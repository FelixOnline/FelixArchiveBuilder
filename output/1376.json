    "content": "In the centre of London there lies a\ncollege; a college not so dissimilar\nto the one you are in. Within this college there is a club; a club of climb-ing... Nine of those from this club\nset out on a journey, a journey that\nwould take them far from family,\nfriends and home across the British Isles, to a land of mountains and\ndragons1\n, a land known as Wales or\nCymru in the native tongue.\nThe journey started as each\njourney does, with each member\npacking their bags in preparation\nfor a week in a small (but cosy)\nhut in Snowdon. They headed for\nthe meeting point that had been\narranged long ago, and at the union they found their transport, the\nmighty white minibus which would\nbe captained by Dom and Matt\nthrough their adventure.\nTragedy stuck though before they\nset sail, as the fellowship lost their\nfirst, Katie had heeded the call of\nmedicine and bowed out to save\nthose back in London, and so with\nthe minibus packed the remaining\nseven (for one would make his own\njourney at a later time) set off waving farewell to their friend.\nThe music started, but it was not\ntime to party, they zipped up their\ncoats and donned their head-torch-es, as they knew the first mission\nwas not far from home; they had to\nacquire a Christmas tree, for it was\nforetold that in their destined land,\nChristmas would take place and\nwithout a tree the Christmas gods\nwould not smile upon their quest.\nThankfully Christmas in their\ncurrent lands had ended, and the\nstreets were overburdened with\ndiscarded trees, and so staying\ntrue to their civic duty they ridded\nthe street of one of its festive foli-age. Difficult as it was to load into\nthe transport, the combined might\nand will of those present managed\nto bring it aboard; and the journey\ntruly began.\nThe first day in their new lands\nthe intrepid team braved the wind\nand rain, and after feasting upon\ntheir Tesco value sausages and bacon [or eggs in the case of young\nTimothy], they headed into the outdoors to little Tryfan.\nAs the road ended and the walk\nbegan, the wind began to pick up,\nbut this made them only more determined to get to the rock. Each\nmember taking their share of the\nequipment, ropes, helmets, harnesses and gear they marched towards their destiny.\nSplitting up into two groups of two\nand a last of three, they began their\nassault on the rock. The groups\nchose their route up to the top of\nthe foreboding rock. Dark from the\nrain and enshadowed by clouds;\nthey climbed.\nAlex and Dom were the victorious two who forged their way to the\ntop of the challenge long before the\nothers and with speed on their side\nthe two scaled down to the bottom\nof the climb, looking to conquer it\nonce again. Meanwhile, the others\nwere left lingering half way up their\nroutes combating the wind and rain\nthat had only increased with time.\nThe next to arrive at the top were\nMatt, Laura and Bish, followed lastly by Tim and Henry; but it was not\nthe order of which they arrived that\nmattered, it was the sheer fact that\nthey had made it to the top. They\nhad fought the rock and won.\nAs Tim and Henry began to unfasten themselves from their safe\npositions at the top of the rock, they\nwere greeted by Alex and shortly\nafter Dom, who had managed to\neasily defeat the slab a second time.\nThe two teams walked down to-ter sting, but they pushed on past\nthe initial stage, till they found the\ntrue path, and the sign directing\nthem to the top of Snowdon.\nThe top was subject to the all the\nair that had been pushed up by the\nwind, and so a gale streamed across\nit; but even battered by the winds\nthey were determined to reach the\npeak.\nOnce they descended from the\npeak, the weather appeased, and\nit was an easy walk back alongside\nlakes and hills, and awaiting them\nat the bottom were the rest of the\ngroup, although wet, they had been\ngiven chips for free and the whole\ngroup devoured them with ease.\nHowever their bellies were not\nfilled by the chips, and so they\nheaded for the warmest tavern they\nknew of, and there gorged themselves on the food of the land. This\nis where the eighth member of the\ngroup, Kunal, arrived, and regaled\nthe awaiting others of his travelling\ntales (although they will be told in\nanother story).\nAfter the stories were told and the\ngreetings finished, the now complete group travelled to their hut.\nWhere the medics challenge was\nset upon the new arrival. The rest\nof the group prepared the mattress-es, and watched in astonishment as\nKunal reached the bedroom in one\ntry, feet first.\nThe following day Tryfan was\ntackled again; however on a much\nlonger multi-pitch route, taking the\nteams higher and further than be-fore. The group split into two teams\nof three and one of two; and set off\non their individual journeys. Little\nis known of what happened along\nthese journeys, apart from they became epics, with many difficult manoeuvres over flakes, up slabs, and\nthe majority off route.\nOne team however ran into the\ngether triumphant in their achieve-ments, but the weather turned, and\nthe sky opened to rain down upon\nthem all it had drank.\nAt this point the team of three\nwere half way through their second route up the slab, and so it was\nup to the four to save everyone\u2019s\nbelongings from the rain and take\nshelter in the bus. Fate however\ntook another turn towards death as\nthe journey then claimed its second\nvictim, all the bags were out of the\nrain, but Laura\u2019s camera was still\nin active service, not sheltered from\nthe storm, it took its final photo in\nthe rain, and died.\nOnce the days outdoor activities\nwere over, the indoor trials could\nbegin. It was proclaimed that the\nmedics had laid out a challenge to\ntheir freshers to climb the ladder\njoining the living room to the bed-rooms, feet first.\nSo with mattresses in place, the\nfeat was attempted; however it was\nfor naught, as try as they did, they\ncould not manage to get higher\nthan half way.\nThis was not the only challenge\nlaid forth, the walls of the hut in\nwhich they occupied were begging\nfor human contact; and so a route\nfrom the floor to the ceiling was\ndevised, and soon after conquered,\nfirst by Matt, but he was not alone\nand soon the others followed.\nOn the second day it was decided\nthat those on the journey being\nfrom the Mountaineering Club,\nwould climb a mountain; and so\nthey sought out the biggest mountain they could find, which took\nthem to Snowdon.\nIt was an eight mile round trip to\nascend to the top and return back\nto the origin, but the valiant team\nclothed in waterproofs, tied their\nlaces tight and started the hike.\nThe rain hit their faces with a bit-most trouble. After a day of making\nup their own way to the top; they finally reached the peak as night fell.\nThis left them with the unenviable\ntask of making their way down in the\ndark; only aided by what light their\nmeagre torches could produce.\nAs they journeyed down however,\ntrouble was brewing with the others waiting. A local man started\nproclaiming profanities at those\nwalking in the dark; resulting in\nthe calling of the police, who then\nsat and waited for those missing to\nreturn.\nIn the meantime the team scrambling their way down the rocks\nwere blissfully unaware of the trouble below, singing various marching songs to keep them entertained\n(most coming from Disney movies);\nbut as they reached the bottom their\npath was lit by the powerful torches\nof the police car, and with a thank\nyou and goodbye it then drove away\nleaving them in peace to hear of the\ntrouble they had caused.\nThe climbing was not the highlight of the final day, that was left\nuntil the evening, where on the\ntwelfth night Christmas took place.\nSecret Santa, Christmas crack-ers, Roast pork (chops), old jokes\nand blueberry crumble for dessert\nwere what spurred festivities on\nthe last night of the long trip.\nAnd once all the presents were\nopen, the new gear placed in the\nhut, and all the food eaten, there\nwas but one thing left to do. They\nhad to write their entry into the\nguestbook.\nHours they spent debating on\nwhat the best words to leave as\nguidance to those who would follow\nin their footsteps, but it was finally\ndecided, and written; and with that\nthe tour was over, their duty done,\nall that remained was the journey\nback home to their loved ones.\nA feast of festive mountaineering\n25\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHenry Fisher\n\n"

This Friday is going to\nbe even better so you should go!\nOur final review is of The Roxy\non a Monday night. With the\ndemise of Trash this place is sure\nto get more and more popular as\ntime goes on and quite rightly\nso. Super cheap entry and super\ncheap drinks with great music\nmake for a super cheap great night\nout. Just don\u2019t drink too many of\nthose \u00a31.50 Kronenbergs or things\nwill get messy, as I\u2019m sure some\npeople I know will confess to.\nThere\u2019s one more day to enter\nour competition to Danny Howells\nat The End this Saturday, so if you\nemail in before Friday midnight,\nyou\u2019ll win.\nTo round things up, I hope you all\nhave a lovely week and until next\ntime, enjoy the huge selection of\nLondon nightlife.

Taz Alibadi hits the dancefloor at the Ram Records birthday party\nawesome and he was spot-on\ntechnically \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame that\nthe venue was nowhere near its 800\ncapacity just yet. It started to fill\nup in time for Sparfunk, who was\nhonestly a bit disappointing after\nthe initial high energy build-up by\nShimon. Soon enough though, it\nwas time for Red One back to back\nwith Sub Focus.\nSub Focus is one of the newest\nadditions to the Ram family and at\nsuch a young age has already built\nup a dedicated fan base and rightly\nRam Records Birthday\nThe End\n2nd March\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nso. He played a few of his own tunes\nincluding \u2018Swamp Thing\u2019, \u2018Airplane\u2019\nand \u2018Flamenco\u2019 and the whole place\nerupted, whilst Red One kept things\ngoing nicely but seemed to have a\nlesser impact.\nThe main dancefloor was filling\nup nicely as Commix and Fierce\nplayed back to back, building up to\na two hour set by Andy C. Things\nreally seemed to slow down at this\npoint, but we couldn\u2019t help but think\nit was the calm before the storm.\nAppropriately, Andy C came on to\nRam Trilogy\u2019s \u2018Screamer\u2019. The\nmain room must have filled up\nin about two seconds flat and the\nwhole crowd pressed forward.\nThe atmosphere was electric;\neveryone always has such high\nexpectations of the man they call\n\u2018The Executioner\u2019.\nHe played some classic tunes\nincluding \u2018Valley of The Shadows\u2019,\n\u2018Body Rock\u2019 and \u2018Planet Dust\u2019 which\nhad everybody in the place jumping\nup and down. Unfortunately\nthough, I thought his set ended up\nbeing a little boring with the same\nrepetitive rolling bassline and not\nmuch else. It was more the kind\nof thing that I\u2019d expect to hear at\nRenegade Hardware (another bimonthly drum n bass label night at\nThe End \u2013 well worth checking out\nif you like your basslines dark and\nheavy).\nWe kept listening out for tunes\nwe recognised but he ended up\nplaying a lot of fairly uninspiring\nnew tunes. Perhaps I\u2019ve come to\nexpect a bit too much from Andy C,\nhaving seen him play several times.\nHe certainly kept my attention\nfor the first half of his set, but I\u2019d\nhonestly have preferred to see Sub\nFocus carrying on for an extra hour\ninstead. As a whole though, the\ncrowd really did love Andy C \u2013 they\nalways do!\nIt was now well past 4am and\nthe main dancefloor emptied out\nas DJ Die had the unenviable task\nof following Andy C on the decks.\nWe ended up missing most of his\ntunes as we headed back into the\nchill-out lounge to recuperate and\nre hydrate. By the time we made\nit back into the main room, it was\nthe final hour with Mampi Swift and\nFresh back to back. They played an\nabsolutely stomping set and Mampi\nSwift, in particular, didn\u2019t let the\nfact that half the punters had gone\nhome stop him from sticking on\nsome awesome tunes and smashing\nup the dancefloor.\nIt was the perfect ending to yet\nanother memorable Ram Records\nat The End. Here\u2019s to another\nfifteen years of Andy C and friends.\nTaz Aliabadi\nThis was always going to be a big\nnight. Ram Records at The End\nis a firm-favourite in the drum n\nbass calendar - a guaranteed good\nnight out with minimum attitude. It\ntakes place bi-monthly on the first\nFriday of the month, and has a truly\ndedicated following. For those of\nyou that don\u2019t know, Ram is one of\nthe foremost drum n bass labels in\nthe world. It was founded fifteen\nyears ago by sixteen year old Andy\nClarke, now better known as the infamous DJ Andy C. Together with\nAnt Miles, Red One, Shimon and\nMoving Fusion, Andy C and Ram\nRecords have been consistently\nproducing first-rate drum n bass\nanthems and dominating the global\ndrum n bass scene.\nThis wasn\u2019t just another Ram\nparty; this was the 15th birthday of\nthe label with a line-up featuring\nthe Ram legends as well as few of\ntheir friends from the industry. It\nwas definitely the kind of night\nthat required tickets in advance,\nhaving sold out five days before\nthe big night itself.

Plans so far call for the sabb\noffices to be moved up to the fourth\nfloor, and a large cafe area to fill the\nfirst floor where the offices currently are, providing an \u201calcohol-free\nzone\u201d.\nThe paper argues that the cafe\nwill be a waste of space, and that\nthe JCR, SCR, and Ethos cafe provide more than enough coffee shop\nspace. Instead, the paper proposes\nto make the space into a multi-pur-pose \u2018dance studio\u2019, with mirrored\nwalls and a sprung floor.\nThis would not only serve the\nroughly 500 members of the Union\u2019s dance societies, but could be\nused as an alternative venue when\nthe Concert Hall is booked for any\nother club. The paper highlights\narts clubs, martial arts clubs, and\noverseas societies in addition to the\ndance clubs.\nThe new area would be around\n22m x 10m, making it one of the\nlargest studios of its kind in London; this would encourage outside\ncompanies to hire the space, possibly generating significant return\nfor the Union.\nThe paper also proposes that the\nsabb offices should move to the new\nmezzanine level that is being created in the gym, placing them next to\nthe new Student Activities Centre,\ncreating what it refers to as a \u201cone\nstop shop for students\u201d.\nThe paper is being proposed by\nJon Matthews (DPFS), Eric Lai\n(DPCS), and Mark Flower (RCC\nChair), and has more than 250 sec-onders, making it likely to be voted\nthrough at Council.\nThose damn drains\nApparently Felix was wrong about\nthe drains; the Union\u2019s contractors can be absolved of any blame.\nInvestigations have shown that the\ndrain blockage is simply the result\nof fifty years of scale buildup.\nAccording to a document picked\nup from a Management & Planning\nGroup meeting (a confidential sabb\nand staff meeting), the repairs are\nto cost \u00a316,000, though this is referred to as \u201coptimistic\u201d. However,\na gleeful sabb was heard to declare\n\u201cat least we\u2019re not paying for it!\u201d,\nsuggesting the College have decided to foot the bill.\nHow the election got fixed\nYou may be wondering what happened after the Union Court met to\ndecide if removing John Collins as\nReturning Officer (over allegations\nof bias) was consitutional or not.\nThe Court decided it was not\nconsitutional, citing among other\nreasons the fact that Exec was not\nquorate (did not have enough members present to be viable).\nExec therefore met again, and\nthe vote was split 3-3 on whether\nto disqualify Mr Collins. Normally,\nthe chair would have the deciding\nvote, but Mr Collins had passed\nNUS delegates\nannounced\nAlongside the sabb elections, eight\nNUS delegates were also elected.\nThese delegates will travel to the\nNUS Annual Conference at the end\nof March on behalf of ICU to vote\non NUS policy for the next year.\nCouncil has recently passed policy\nthat not only forbids delegates from\njoining any political or religious\nfaction at the Conference, but also\nforces them to vote as directed by\nCouncil (in order to best represent\nthe views of IC students).\nThis restriction has angered at\nleast one candidate, who refused to\nsign the declaration that the election had been free and fair after\nbeing told he would not be allowed\nto sit with the Student Respect fac-tion, having clearly been unfamiliar\nwith Union policy. This candidate\nwas not elected to be a delegate.\nThe next President, Stephen\nBrown, was elected to be a delegate,\nreceiving the majority of the vote.\nMr Brown was the spiritual leader\nof the \u2018No\u2019 campaign during the referendum last term, and has spoken\nout against what he regards as the\n\u201cirrelevance\u201d of some motions to\nbe discussed at Conference. Other\nmembers of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign\nelected were Ashley Brown (also\nLive! editor), Omar Hashmi, and\nEd Hunt.\nThe leader of the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign,\nAlex Guite, was elected, alongside\nthe current Deputy President (Ed-ucation & Welfare), Ben Harris, and\nthe DPEW-elect, Kirsty Patterson.\nCamilla Royle, famous within the\nUnion for the \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 papers\nthat were destroyed at Council last\nterm, and the paper copied from the\nStudent Respect website that faced\nheavy criticism at the last Council,\nwas also elected.\nThis gives the ICU delegation\nfour anti-NUS candidates, and four\npro-NUS candidates.\nICU President, John Collins, will\nalso join the delegation, weighting it slightly in favour of pro-NUS\nmembers.\nPro: Alex Guite & Ben Harris Anti: Ashley Brown & Steve Brown\nTomo Roberts\nEditor-in-waiting\nYes, other things have been happening besides election farces\nthe chair onto ex-Medic President\nDanny McGuinness for the dura-tion, who is not a member of Exec\nand therefore could not vote! Rather than drag the issue to Council,\nMr Collins gracefully stood down as\nReturning Officer, making the end\nresult of all the to-ing and fro-ing\nexactly null. Hurrah!\nElection complaints\nRumours abound over what kept\nthe Presidential election results\nfrom being announced until Thursday. One suggests that another\nsabb had been trying to sabotage a\nPresidential candidate\u2019s campaign,\nthere being no shortage of bad blood\nbetween the two individuals.\nFelix candidate Emily Lines suffered systematic removal of her\nposters, prompting the Elections\nCommittee to obtain CCTV footage\nof the walkway to determine the\nculprit.\nLastly, Diogo Geraldes told Felix he\u2019d lost his entire deposit after waving his famous \u201cWTF?\u201d\nsign over Jon Matthews\u2019 head at\nhustings.\nHe claims that WTF stands for\n\u201cwonderful tact, friend\u201d and that\nhe is the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice.

    "content": "Why would the Fellwanderers go\nto the New Forest? There are no\nmountains or hills it\u2019s just full of\ntrees, mud, heath and ponies. Well\nlet me explain and hopefully by the\nend of this report you will know why\nthe New Forest is such an amazing\nplace.\nSo it\u2019s 5pm Friday and it seems\nthat I am the last to arrive at Beit\nQuad even though I have organised\nthis trip back to my home area (I\nlive in the south-eastern corner).\nThere stand eight eager Fellwanderers ready to embark on the massive journey down south to the New\nForest. In just half an hour we have\nthe mini bus packed with Chris arriving just in time. As the questions\nlike \u201chave we got everyone and\neverything\u201d are running through\nmy head a familiar smiling face appears at the window of the bus. Its\nTim, does he want to come, no he\njust wants to say good bye which is\npretty good timing. Had he been a\nfew minutes later we would have\nbeen off navigating the treacherous\nLondon rush hour to the M3.\nOkay, maybe I slightly exaggerated the distance since we arrived\nat our gourmet restaurant known\nto every Fellwanderer as the \u2018chippy\u2019 at 8pm. I remember this being\nthe best fish and chip shop on the\neastern edge of the forest and with\na group of hungry students we all\nknow what would happen if this\nwas not the case (details are too\ngraphic). With the queue coming\nout of the door and a stack of spuds\nthat would make any man weak at\nthe knees, the prospect of surviving was looking good. One delicious\npie and chips later we did what students do best and stocked up with\nfine (yes we have good taste in alco-hol!) ale and whiskey.\nArriving at the camp site (Acres\nDown Farm in Minstead) at 9pm we\nthen pitched the tents after a comical effort of putting the poles in the\nwrong holes. Maybe I should have\ntried putting the tents up in the Union first but at least now I know how\nthey work. Anyway, we stand around\nin this muddy field not knowing\nwhat to do since normally we are\nstuck on the motorway with numb\nbums thinking \u201care we ever going\nto get there?\u201d We got the alcohol\nflowing and started to disturb the\nlocal tranquillity; however I didn\u2019t\ndrink since I was cheekily driving\nto say hello to my parents (actually\nI wanted a warm and comfortable\nbed) only ten miles down the road.\nDon\u2019t worry, the pleasure pain\nbalance was restored as I needed\nto get to the camp site earlier and\nturf everyone else out of their tents\n(not as easy as you may think). With\na warm cup of tea or two inside us\nwe headed towards Bolderwood\nhoping that the grey clouds would\njust stay grey. After seeing a herd\nof deer and ending up in the middle of the woods knee high in mud,\nit dawned on me that I should have\nbeen paying more attention to the\nmap. No I wasn\u2019t lost; I knew where\nwe were, well sort of. Now knowing that I need to improve my map\nreading skills, we ended up outside\nthe Queens Arms in Burley (what a\ncoincidence that it just happened to\nbe midday).\nAfter a quick pint or seven with\nlunch we staggered for a while until we soon realised that bringing a\nboat would have been a good idea\nsince we were faced with an underpass that wasn\u2019t so passable. The\nday continued through more trees,\nmud, and rivers (sorry about the\nwet feet!) whilst being watched by\nthe ponies.\nAll of a sudden the ground began\nto shake and the rumbling of hooves\nstarted to deafen us. We jumped out\nof the way as many horses bolted\nfrom the bushes chasing after a\npack of excited dogs. Finding ourselves in the middle of a fox hunt,\nwe continued. Again our progress\nwas hindered as we leaped into\nsafety to stop ourselves becoming\nflattened as the second wave of\nmad rich English men and women\n(don\u2019t want to get sued for lack of\nequal rights) crashed through the\nvegetation. Luckily the dogs had\nmore sense to realise that we were\nnot foxes and we arrived at a complete fire place in the middle of no-where. The Portuguese Fireplace,\nleft from the war, gave us the perfect opportunity to get the banner\nout and argue over who had the\nbest whiskey (trust me we needed\nit after our traumatic experience).\nWe closed the walk off with an epic\nclimb to 89 metres to admire the sun\nsetting behind a landscape filled\nwith the silhouettes of trees. Dinner was then enjoyed, after a short\ndrive to the coast, in the moonlight\nwith the sound of crashing waves on\nthe pebbles. After a little whiskey\nand beer (no we\u2019re not alcoholics; it\nwas just used to keep us warm) we\nwere gazing at the twinkling lights\nfrom Bournemouth in one direction\nand Yarmouth in the other.\nMuch the same happened on\nSunday until we arrived at a river\njust north of Holly Hatch Inclosure\nand the desire to jump overcame\nme. With the first jump a success,\nI wanted to beat the distance and\ncontinue showing off. I found a manageable section, took up a run and\nthen... \u2018splash!\u2019, water came up to\nmy head and my trousers were now\ndripping but somehow my feet were\ndry. Once the laughter had finished\neveryone jumped the river to take\na short cut across the marsh. The\nground was now violently wobbling\nand a local woman waking her dog\ntold us that we were best off crossing at the bridge. Taking her advice\nwe all slid through a deeper patch\nof bog before arriving back on the\nother side. With a few wet feet our\nroute took us up to the top of Hampton ridge for some well deserved\nlunch looking over the forest and\nenjoying the view.\nThe walk continued along the\nridge to the dizzying heights of 124\nmeters (don\u2019t laugh this is high in\nNew Forest terms). Our journey\ntook us through some spectacular\nwoodland with a carpet of fallen\nleaves and of course a lot of mud!\nWith one pissed off farmer (I assure\nyou no fences were harmed) we enjoyed a local pint of Fritham ale at a\nvery busy Royal Oak before continuing across open pastures. In the\ndistance we spotted an ice cream\nvan. Were we witnessing a mirage\nor had the beer gone to our heads?\nLike de-hydrated men in the desert\ninvestigation was needed. After an,\nI think it was real, ice cream we left\nthe van to serve its regulars (the\nhorses).\nWith a not so quick go on a rope\nswing and again wading through\nmore bog we arrived back at the\nbus ready to depart to London. Everyone clambered in and strapped\ndown, the bus started moving back\nand all was looking good. But no,\ndisaster had struck as the bush was\ntrying to knock on the window when\nwe realised that just revving the\nengine was not helping. The more\nwe tried to free ourselves the more\nthe back slid around into the ditch,\nwere we ever going to get back to\nLondon? When we gave up trying\nto push the bus out, the campsite\nowner came to the rescue. As if\nthis had happened before, her tiny\n(well in comparison) Nissan pick up\ntruck made light work of pulling a\nsliding bus out. This comical scene\ngave way to a round of applause\nand a few cheers with Martin looking slightly embarrassed that he\nhad managed to get the bus stuck.\nAs the night drew in our weekend\nhad come to a close. Having seen\nenough mud and horses we were\nnow safely on the motorway with\nhalf of the forest stuck to the bottom of our boots.\nThe Fellwanderers organise four\nbiweekly weekend trips a term to\nsome of the most spectacular scenery in England and Wales. We also\norganise Sunday walks in between\nthe weekends that explore the\ncountryside on the edge of London.\nFor more information look us up at\nwww.fellwanderers.com or come\nto one of our free Tuesday lunches\nin DB\u2019s from 12:30.\nFellwanderers discover New Forest\nMaybe the gap was bigger than he first thought\nNathaniel Bottrell\nShowing off\n...

And We Can\u2019t Mention Our Disco\nOur Disco - 2ManyDJs\nHub\nFriday 23 February\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nTwo Fridays ago I embarked on\na mini adventure, an adventure\ninto the deepest, darkest depths of\nAldgate East, in the rain, and fucking freezing, wearing a T-shirt was\nnight the brightest idea ever. After\ntrying every which direction from\nthe tube station I managed to find\nthe place I was looking for; a grim\ndoor hidden away down a deserted\nside street, with a queue of bedraggled looking people waiting out-side. In front of me and my trusty\nfriends were three freshers staying\nin Fisher, I knew this because they\nwere talking about Fisher - as you\ndo when in a queue for a club, saying that they did sport one of the six\ngirls at Imperial, a good turn out.\nSo what is this queue doing in an\nally who\u2019s main function looked like\na venue for rape and murder? Well\nit was obviously the queue for Our\nDisco. Our Disco? I hear you cry,\nwhat the fuck is that? Why go out\nyour way and get rained on when\nthere is a slew of perfectly good su-perclubs open on Friday night, full\nof pillheads shit faced and dancing\nto debatable music?\nSimple put, it is because And Did\nWe Mention Our Disco? Is one of\nthe little known highlights of the\nclubbing circuit, it\u2019s own flavour\nof electro is unmatched in qual-ity, diversity or originality, that and\nthe fact most generic, loutish club\ngoers haven\u2019t heard of it.\nWhile Chalk is the new darling\nof alternative clubbing, thanks to\nheavy promoting by the guys behind Turnmills, top acts are lost\non the poor crowd who attend, or\nthe vast venue it is spread across.\nThe more compact Durrr is mildly\nbetter but only if your idea of fun\nis hanging around with a bunch\nof fashion kids who look about as\nhappy as if their whole family had\njust died at the hands of a savage\nelephant shrew. So after a hiatus of\na couple of months and a number of\nvenue swaps Our Disco is back under the title And We Can\u2019t Mention\nOur Disco! Glyn, Den, Rory and Nadia front a four week run of nights\nstarting a on the very night in ques-tion, hidden away at The Hub at\nLondon Met Union. Not only that\nbut the subtle name change these\nnights have is thanks to four top\nsecret acts playing on each of the\nnights, who are only confirmed on\nthe night, when you get inside the\nclub - those crazy kids.\nBefore I completely go off on one,\nendlessly praising the DJs lets take\nstock of the venue. The fact it is a\nstudents union is at first a little dis-concerting, but on arrival you soon\nrealise it is a little bit different to Imperial\u2019s own bars (it isn\u2019t a building\nsite for a start); The Hub (recently\nrenamed from the Sub Club) even\nhas a ticketing desk and split level\nbars. Upstairs you can take advantage of the \u00a33 a pint for Grolsch and\nmusic piped up from downstairs.\nThe comfy leather sofas and fast\nbar service is a big improvement\nover Canvas, an intermediate and\nhorrendously over priced venue\nOur Disco visited. After a bit of chin\nwagging it was time to hit the floor,\nthe dance floor that is, sampling the\nevenings secret guests.\nAnyone with more than two brain\ncells would probably have guessed\nthe secret guests well in advance,\nand all our dreams and desires\nwere confirmed when we proceeded back downstairs to find a mammoth poster stating \u20182MANYDJs\u2019\nin letters about as big as your face.\nThe last Our Disco had made the\ncritical mistake of running the\nheadliners, Simian Mobile Disco, at\nthe late hour of 3:30am. Luckily the\nlesson had been learnt and the Belgium duo came out of hiding to the\ndelight of the audience at a sprightly 1:30. The set was immense and\n13\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nNIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfeatured a gamut of music from the\never popular Gossip remix to the\nbrand spanking new Justice track\nwith the log dance floor being intimate enough to make it all a little\nbit special. We even saw those Fisher people on the dance floor, just\nnot dancing so much.\nIt is safe to say that Our Disco is\nback on form, returning from the\nblip was that Canvas. With the penultimate night of the run tonight,\n(9th March) and any bright spark\nknowing the guests will be *******\nit should be pretty fricking awe-some, so put on your glad rags and\nrole over to east London for a night\nof glorious music.\nIf those Fisher Hall people are\nreading this, email in and we\u2019ll give\nyou a prize. Because we love you.\nNick Simpson\nTrust them this week, it\u2019s going to be even bigger\nStill win tickets!\nIt takes a certain type of DJ to\nplay all night long. Rather than\nwhip out your set of peak time\nbangers for the last two hours\nyou have a whole nine hours to\nfill. Not only is that one heavy\nbag of records, but it means a\nfair amount of genre juggling.\nEven the most fervent and energetic clubber might be feeling\na little jaded after nine hours of\nsolid minimal techno.\nMr Danny Howells, however,\nis one those DJ\u2019s who relishes\nthe chance to play all night.\nEquipped not only with the\nstamina, enthusiasm and bladder control to play from start\nto finish, he has a record collection that can keep the most\ncynical, weary club-goer glued\nto the dancefloor the entire\nnight. Never mind taking you\non a journey, it\u2019s a full on expedition requiring tent, ice pick,\nprovisions and a compass!\nDig Deeper always brings\nthat special touch of Howells\nmagic to the dancefloor. With\na friendly up for it crowd who\naren\u2019t afraid to show their ap-preciation, and a DJ whose passion for making people dance\nwill never tire, Dig Deeper has\ngrown to be an essential night\nin the club calendar.\nFrom March, Dig Deeper is\nmoving to a Saturday, giving you\nthat extra hour to take in the finest selection of Deepsexyfuturistictechfunkhouse\u2122 through\ntill 7am. Since even Danny can\u2019t\nbe in three rooms at once, up in\nAKA Freak Luke Soloman will\nbe bringing his Little Creatures\nto town.\nEMAIL IN BY FRIDAY MIDNIGHT TO WIN TICKETS!\nDig Deeper with Danny Howells\nMarch 10th 2007 at The End\nBook into Rehab at The Roxy\nRehab\nThe Roxy\nMondays\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been to\nThe Roxy on a Monday night. Years\nin fact, I generally only go to Panic!\non a Tuesday night but I was pleasantly surprised this Monday when I\ngave Rehab a visit.\nTherecentlyre-named(previously\ncalled Airport) club night is exactly\nwhat you need for a cheap, fun night\nout, The DJ\u2019s Adam, Alicat, Val(Fan\nClub) and Lydia(Afterskool) play a\ngreat selection of music all night.\nOn first arrival (about 11:30pm)\nwe were greeted by an interesting\nmix of 1960\u2019s music, not quite what\nwe first expected but it was great\nto dance to all the same. The place\nwas very packed compared to what\nThe Roxy used to be on a Monday\nnight before Airport took over, the\nplace was as full as the super popular night Panic!\nThis club night is basically 100%\ncatered for students so it\u2019s not surprising that almost everyone in\nthere was either at UCL, Imperial\nor Kings (apart from one really old\nshort dude who I met, but he was\ncool). It was great, I met loads of\npeople I knew in there.\nAfter getting a few beers from the\nbar and much drunken chatting at\nthe sofas, the DJ\u2019s changed over.\nEnd of the 1960\u2019s set and start of the\nuberpopular and great selection\nof Indie and Electropop. Perfect\ntracks to spend the next three hours\ndancing stupidly to. The dance floor\nwas packed all the way to the end, I\nleft at 2:30am and people were still\ngoing.\nAll in all, it makes a nice change\nfrom the supertrendy DURRR and\nit\u2019s a hell of a lot better than Metro\non a Monday night. One of the\nbest Monday night Indie clubs in\nLondon.\nI\u2019ll be paying them a visit again\nfor sure, and you should to. A small part of the Rehab flyer\n\n"

    "content": "Gentlemen, we can upgrade him\nAdam Omar can make him better than he was. Better. Stronger. Faster. Shu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu.\nI\nt\u2019snewtechnologytime again,\nwith all sorts of companies\nyellingnext-genthisandnext-gen that. No matter what the\nconsole makers claim, the PC\nwill always be the bastion of true\ngaming and the tip of the spear as\nfar as technology is concerned.\nHowever, as is the norm in these\ncases, one has to build or buy a\ncomputer before being able to experience any of that.\nIn this feature, we\u2019ll be giving you\nsome general advice on choosing\ncomponents, and providing a look\nat a range of low, mid, and high-end\nbuilds, as well as our recommendations for the best of the best. But\nbear in mind that, of course, these\nare gaming desktops, nothing more\n\u2013 and we can\u2019t help you put the\nthing together, either! You should\nconsider doing it if you\u2019re brave\nenough though, as it\u2019s relatively\nstraightforward, and a lot cheaper\nthan paying for installation!\nSo, what does what? First, there\u2019s\nthe processor \u2013 in this day and age it\nwould be pure madness not to get a\nmulti-core CPU. As more and more\npeople have multi-core capabil-ity, more and more programs (and\ngames!) will provide support. And\nwith more supported programs,\nmore people will buy multi-cores\n\u2026and so the wheel turns.\nTied closely to the CPU is the\nmotherboard choice. I cannot stress\nhow important a good motherboard\nis. It is the most important component in your PC. Many people make\nmistakes, spending loads on their\nCPU or graphics card and neglecting their motherboard. Ultimately,\nyour motherboard is what ties everything together and transmits\ndata between all your other parts. A\nshit motherboard equals a shit PC,\nsimple as that. Remember to check\nthat its compatible with all your\nother parts.\nSince we\u2019re gaming, let\u2019s take\ngraphics next. If any of you are\nplanning to buy a computer in the\nnear future, I suggest you hold off\nuntil the next generation of DirectX10 (Microsoft\u2019s foundation graphic engine) cards arrive. Unless you\nhappen to have been born in a vat of\nmoney, there\u2019s no point in buying a\ngaming card now and then upgrading to DX10 in the future.\nHard Drives are another often\nsidelined component. As such I will\nonly bother you with this humble\ncollection of words: Western Digital. SATA II, 16MB Cache. Simple,\nbut crucial. Similarly, drives are\nsimple too \u2013 these are quite stan-dard. Any old DVD-writer will do.\nThe technology is much the same\neverywhere.\nNow, the frivolities. If this was a\ntropical country, I\u2019d have suggested\nyou get at least 6 fans or a water-cooling set. But in England, a couple of 12cm fans will suffice. Intel\u2019s\nstock coolers deserve special men-tion. Though quite uninteresting at\nfirst glance, those trusty black fans\ncan keep your computer stable up\nto 1.5 to 2 times the CPU speed, depending on your processor.\nPower supplies (PSUs) are another crucial part that many people\nforget. A good PSU means a stable\ncomputer (at least with respect to\npower). 500W is the bare minimum\nnowadays, with units that go up to\nabout 1100W. A nuclear explosion\nto any gamer\u2019s electricity bill, I\u2019m\nsure.\nFor mice \u2013 optical or laser; accept\nnothing less. Go for wired instead\nof wireless. Wireless devices are\n(slightly) slower to respond than\nwired ones, and some of them require batteries. We\u2019re gamers. We\nhunch at our desks anyway.\nAs with mice, go for wired key-boards. Unless you plan on playing\nyour games from the next room or\nacross the street, there really is no\nneed to have a wireless keyboard.\nA good sound card isn\u2019t that necessary for gaming, although it is\none of those things that would be\nnice to have. Creative are a safe bet\nfor anything sound-cardy. Coupled\nto that, go for headphones wherever possible. You don\u2019t want to be\ndistracted by the d00d next door or\nby a car outside when trying to land\na frag. Otherwise, its down to personal preference.\nUnless you happen to have a desk\nthe size of a bed you\u2019ll need to go\nwith a TFT for your monitor. 19inch\nshould be the minimum size. And\nalways, always get a monitor with a\nDVI connector \u2013 with a comfortable\nviewing angle.\nAesthetics aside, a casing should\nbe chosen with respect to ease of\nuse, weight, stability, and sturdi-ness. Aluminium is light but expen-sive, but I\u2019d rather have a hulking\nsteel behemoth any day. Air circulation and ventilation is also another\nimportant factor.\nUnreal Tournament 3 \u2013 Commence eye-bleeding \u2026 now.\nPushing the envelope \u2013 the unforgiving games that\u2019ll test your PC\u2019s limits\nYou\u2019ve taken our advice and put together something resembling a PC\n\u2013 or maybe you want to test the one\nyou already have to check that the\nvideo card\u2019s still running? There\u2019s\na variety of games both out now\nand upcoming that are sure to do\nthe job.\nThe first, and almost oldest, is\nprobably Bethseda\u2019s most recent\nRPG release, Oblivion. Despite\nbeing a year old now and holding\nan unsteady place in 2006\u2019s game\ncharts, Oblivion is a massive resource guzzler, still providing a\nhuge challenge to any computer\nwhile wandering around the huge\nvistas with lighting effects on full.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t do the job, there\nare mods that make the game even\nmore demanding, racking up the\nsettings even further and increasing the richness of the visuals. If\nyou want to test large-scale graph-ics, this is the one.\nFor those of you that have already\npicked up a copy of the latest strategy hit, Supreme Commander, or\nthose that took a spin on the demo\na month or so ago, you\u2019ll already\nbe aware of the scale of waging\nwar. Huge populations of units on\nscreen at once, with varying levels\nof zoom from global to close-up-and-personal. This is a game that\ntakes whatever memory you\u2019ve got\nand then demands more \u2013 a terrifyingly impressive game when played\non the right system, if you can get\nmore than a 2 vs. 2 running smoothly online, you\u2019ve already got a very\ncapable machine.\nIt\u2019s also worth taking a step even\nfurther back in time and revisiting F.E.A.R., now available at a\ncriminally low price. F.E.A.R. was\na demanding game upon release\n\u2013 kicking up a fuss even on the best\nhardware, with software conflicts\nabound. Now, F.E.A.R.\u2019s theatrical\nlighting and fast-paced shooting\nstill provides a test to the average\ngamer\u2019s PC. If you\u2019re playing this\non a resolution larger than a postage stamp, you\u2019re taking steps in\nthe right direction.\nBut it\u2019s the future that holds the\ntruly terrifying games. Already\nwe\u2019re seeing the new Command\nand Conquer \u2013 not thought to be\ntoo demanding \u2013 putting large pressure on a lot of mid-spec PCs. The\nadvent of Windows Vista and its\nalleged focus on high-end gaming\nmeans that future releases could\nuse even more of a machine\u2019s raw\nresources \u2013 but that might not be\nthe good news it sounds, as more\nresources available means more\nresources are used \u2013 leaving low-end gamers in the dust while the\nnext-gen speeds off into the sunset.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom yet,\nthough, and thankfully the dreaded\nVista exclusives seem thin on the\nground \u2013 at least for the time be-ing. Unreal Tournament 3 (above)\nwas one of the first sights we got of\nthe Unreal 3.0 engine, now powering every next-gen game under the\nsun. It\u2019s all very well for console\ngamers, who can rely (most of the\ntime) on developers to get the right\namount of power out of the plastic\nbox. But the prospect of games like\nUT3 \u2013 with open-ended detail options ready to be scaled to christ-knows-where and beyond \u2013 should\nbe making any gamer think twice\nabout putting off an upgrade for another year.\nThe Unreal 3.0 engine has been\nlicensed by Sony, EA, and Square\nEnix to name but three, and Epic\nhave already stated that Unreal 4.0\nhas been in development since early 2004 (though not due to be seen\nuntil 2010, such is their faith in the\nthird engine).\nAmerica\u2019s Army 3.0, Bioshock,\nand Unreal Tournament 3 will all be\nusing the engine that we\u2019ve already\nseen used in Gears of War. However\nprepared you think you are for next-gen \u2013 you\u2019re not prepared enough.\n20 felix Friday 9 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Following week after boring week of success that Nintendo\nseemed physically unable to stop,\nthe internet finally found something\nto call the Wii\u2019s proud parents on\nthis week, as Virtual Console newcomers SNK explained that Nintendo was still keeping online gaming\nstrictly out-of-bounds for develop-ers, and was expected to continue\nin this vein for the rest of 2007.\nNot that this is going to do much,\nsince Wii sales hit the 5 million mark\nthis month, with 6 million expected\nto be gone by the end of March. Nor\ndid it stop the Business Development Director of iD software \u2013 iD\nfor chrissakes \u2013 announcing that\nthey thought the Wii to be \u201cfantastic\u201d and would be looking to convert\nsome of their games to the inno-vative, if underpowered console.\nFrankly, Nintendo should be made\nto pay for nice things to happen like\neveryone else. It\u2019s disgusting.\nSony showed us how it was done\nthis week, peforming a Wacky Races-style U-turn on their claim that\nrumble technology was \u201cnot an issue\u201d by decided that it was an issue,\nand an issue that was worth paying\n$150 million to resolve. To us, that\nsounds like the kind of issue you\ndon\u2019t accidentally say isn\u2019t an issue.\nWhether it\u2019s enough to save the European Playstation3 from being utterly shunned is yet to be seen \u2013 but\nthe March 23 release won\u2019t show\nmuch of Sony\u2019s long-term success\nin the PAL regions.\nFar away from the console bickering this week, though, saw a much\nmore grown-up kind of bickering\n\u2013 the delights of the San Francisco\nGames Developers Conference\nhas begun, with keynotes abound,\nand snide remarks fired from corporation to corporation.

    "content": "Escaping the post-Christmas blues\nfor a week of scuba diving in the\nblue waters of the Red Sea was\nclearly a great plan. Still, landing\nin Sharm el Sheikh and arriving\naboard the Bella 1 \u2013 the boat which\nwas to be our home for the week\n\u2013 it was hard to believe we\u2019d left the\ncold greyness of an English January behind us quite so successfully.\nThe Bella itself was beautiful \u2013 all\npolished wood and gleaming metal,\ncomplete with sundeck and even a\njacuzzi for those who still deluded\nthemselves that this might be a holiday rather than a dive trip. Plenty\nof space, in fact, for all those essential post-dive activities: sleeping;\nwriting logbooks; more sleeping;\nhunting through fishbooks for fish\nthat refused to be identified; perusing dive photos; going back to sleep\nagain; sunbathing (for those dedicated enough to find a place in the\nsun that was also out of the wind \u2013\nnext time I\u2019m taking a windbreak as\nwell as suntan lotion.) And then, of\ncourse, there was the eating (a lot\nof eating). The food was great, although the non-meat eaters didn\u2019t\nfare quite so well; the chef had a bit\nof a thing for fried cucumber as an\nideal vegetarian dish.\nDespite this packed relaxation\nschedule, we somehow managed to\nfit in a total of twenty dives. Our itinerary took us in a rough loop around\nthe Northern Red Sea, to include a\nhuge variety of reefs and wrecks \u2013\naccording to our dive guides Nicole\nand Thijs, this was where captains,\nhaving navigated through the\nstraits of Suez, would customarily\nhand over command of the ship to\ntheir first mate, who would promptly run the vessel aground on the\nnearest reef. You\u2019d have thought\nthey might have learnt from the\nfirst poor soul who did this \u2013 but no\n\u2013 the same story was told in dive\nbrief after dive brief. We weren\u2019t ob-jecting, however. It gave us a lot of\nfantastic wrecks to dive.\nOur first was the Chrisoula K,\nsunk on the edge of Abu na Has\nreef in 1981, where the cargo of\ngranite tiles that had been en route\nfor Yemen were to be found stacked\nin the hold, \u2018Made In Italy\u2019 stamps\nstill clearly visible on each; and\nthere was a still intact workshop,\ncomplete with workbench and drill\naffixed to the wall, perfectly spotlit\nby the open hatch in front of it, as\nif someone had just downed tools.\nFurther wrecks followed: the Carnatic (1869), where we sadly failed\nto discover any gold; the Giannis D\n(1983), possibly sunk so its owners\ncould claim on the insurance; pe-culiarly, a barge; the Kingston; the\nDunraven (1876), like the Carnatic,\na tramp steamer; and (most memo-rably) the Thistlegorm. Finding\nthis last 4898-tonne, 415-foot ship\nproved to be more of a challenge\nthan you might expect, given its\ndimensions: still, our indefatigable\ncaptain managed it, having left his\nhandheld GPS at home.\nAfter an hour of aimless sailing to\nand fro, we were forced to wait for\nthe next morning and the arrival of\nsomeother(ratherbetterequipped)\ndive boats. A few disgruntled faces\nall round. The Thistlegorm itself,\nhowever, was definitely worth the\nwait. Attacked at the ironically\nnamed Safe Anchorage F in the\nStraits of Gubal by a German bomber squad in 1941, the explosions\nthat sunk the Thistlegorm created\nenough light to illuminate another\nship at Safe Anchorage H (sunk by\nthe same bomber squad a few days\nlater).\nAt 30 metres, however, there was\nplenty of ship left for us to explore.\nTwo locomotive engines lie to port\nand starboard of the wreck, blown\noff by the bomb blast, with their\ncoal tenders still on deck. At the\nstern, we found anti-aircraft guns,\nboxes of shells (one polished by\npassing divers, with \u20181929\u2019 still legible its brass side), and further towards the bow, a Bren gun carrier\ntipped on its side. Inside, boxes full\nof thigh-length rubber boots, four\nintact trucks, each with its cargo of\nthree motorcycles neatly stacked\nalongside one another, and a cargo of small aircraft wings. Only\nLouise, in determined pursuit of\nthe-most-controversial-statement-of-the-week award, declared that\nshe didn\u2019t really see what all the\nfuss was about: \u2018I think the Thistlegorm\u2019s boring\u2019. Tree had to be forcibly restrained from throwing her\noverboard.\nExploring the wrecks themselves\nwasn\u2019t all there was to do, of course.\nWe were surrounded by underwater life on every dive: electric blue\nparrot fish audibly chomping on the\ncoral; dense globe-shaped shoals\nof glass fish; huge moray eels (one,\non the Barge, so accustomed to\ndivers that it let itself be stroked);\nhundreds of flame-orange anthias,\nclustered on the reefs, vivid against\nthe deep blue of the water; shoals of\nsilvery blue fusiliers; the elongated\nsilhouettes of cornet fish swimming\nclose below the surface of the wa-ter, above us as we looked up; bright\nyellow banner fish; two turtles, each\nresting in their own caves, one of\nthem coming out to swim around\nus once he\u2019d got bored of being\nphotographed; huge, placid-look-ing batfish; blue spotted ribbontail\nrays; big bulbous-lipped Napolean\nfish; toothy-mouthed trigger fish;\na reef shark circling the bow of the\nThistlegorm; anemone \u2018Nemo\u2019 fish\nin pairs, defending their anemone\nhomes against over-impertinent\ndivers; crocodile fish, boxfish, and\nunicorn fish (all three very aptly\nnamed); on a night dive, spiny-backed lionfish hunting in small\npacks of three or four, following our\ntorchlight to track down their prey.\nThe last night of our stay onboard\nwas the chance for a great party.\nUnanimously voted best-looking\nmember of the crew by the female\nmembers of the group (Odiri, I be-lieve, was a particular fan), Amr\ngave what was allegedly a demonstration of Egyptian dancing \u2013 or\nperhaps just an excuse to drag us\nall onto the dance floor for public\nhumiliation! Dancing was followed\nby singing and a very entertaining\nround of magic tricks, and then a\nmidnight diving competition. Swimming costumes on, in went Mike,\nBen W, Jenny, Tom and I. Never\nones to be bested, Nick and Ben T\nfollowed close behind, with Ben T\nthen embarking on a piratical re-boarding of the boat via the anchor\nrope at the bow. Who needs a lad-der, especially when you can earn\nthe glory of a spectacular bruise\nand several scrapes by doing it the\nhard way?\nMeanwhile, in the water at the\nstern, Mike was earning his title\nof most intrepid underwater fight,\ntaking on a sea urchin with his bare\nfists. And after all this excitement,\nwe still had energy for two brilliant\ndives the next day in the Straits of\nTiran, on the Shark, Yolande and\nJackson reefs. The last dive gave us\nour most hotly debated fish identification of the week \u2013 was it a tuna?\na shark? Or perhaps that previous\nunidentified species, a tuna-shark?\nBen T wasn\u2019t watching closely\nenough to contribute to the discussion \u2013 far too busy kidnapping Jo\nS\u2019s fin from her right foot.\nAnd so our fantastic week came to\nan end, after a day of recovery back\nin Sharm el Sheikh, with quad biking for some, lounging by the pool\nfor others, and a raucous evening\nout at the Camel Bar for every-one. Pretty please can we go again\nsoon?\n26 felix Friday 9 March 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDiving the depths of the Red Sea\nCatherine Patterson\nUrban Lifestyle\nIn great locations\nFriendly People\nOn hand to help\nStudent Living\nWith your friends\nFIND OUT\nVISIT\nMORE\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nor call 0208 808 5445\nor call 0208 808 5445\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nor call 0208 808 5445\nCALLING ALL\nSTUDENTS...\nCONSIDER UNITE FOR YOUR\nSTUDENT ACCOMMODATION\nAVAILABLE TO SUIT\nYOUR NEEDS\nA WIDE CHOICE OF ROOMS\nThe world\u2019s only underwater toilet.

    "content": "It\u2019s white guys with guitars\nOnly one page this week before an onslaught of pages for the term\u2019s final issue\nSaying that Babyshambles' notoriously chaotic front-man Pete\nDoherty has a slight time-keeping\nproblem is like saying he might\nhave a tiny drug problem. Knowing\nthis I can't help feel that half of the\nincredibly packed Brixton Academy expects to be told to head home\nbefore Babyshambles even hit the\nstage tonight. Enough has been\nsaid about Doherty's personal life\nthough as tonight it's all about the\nmusic, at least for me. Whether or\nnot he's high doesn't really bother\nme one bit, there's only one thing\nI want to know. Does he cut it in\nperson?\nHaving never seen Doherty perform live, in either guise, I want to\nget the chance to catch a glimpse of\nthe man that has inspired a generation of teenagers. Certainly the man\ncan cut it on CD, showing off his\ncreative abilities with The Blinding\nEP, but can he hold it together in\nfront of a packed out Brixton Academy full of his adoring fans?\nA thoroughly entertaining warm-up was provided from the up-and-coming I Was A Cub Scout and the\nhotly tipped Little Man Tate (we\nmissed Brighton rockers My Device, although having seen them\nbefore, they were rather good) who\nboth seemed to really relish the\nchance to play a venue the size of\nBrixton Academy playing with tremendous energy.\nAs the increasingly anxious crowd\nawaitedthearrivalofBabyshambles\non-stage the usual twenty minute\nmid-band pause seemed to take a\nlifetime as the security guards pull\nsix or so squashed kids from the\ncrowd; one of whom can no longer\nwalk for whatever reason. Such is\nthe hysteria that Pete Doherty is\nsurrounded by that the fans don't\neven scream for Babyshambles.\nAs they appear on-stage, an instant and massive roar greets\nthem. A roar which lulled as they\nlaunched into their set with crowd\npleaser Pipedown. With Brixton\nfull-to-bursting with fans eager to\ncatch a glimpse of frontman Pete\nDoherty, almost inevitably crowd\ntroubles forced a untimely pause\nthree tracks in as Babyshambles\nwere forced to leave the stage after\ncalls for the crowd to move back\nfailed.\nAfter their return they picked up\nwhere they left off playing some\nnew material in the form of Delivery and tracks taken from The\nBlinding EP\n, Beg, Steal or Borrow\nand Sedative. Special mention\nshould go to I Wish, played towards\nthe end of the seventy minute set;\nit stole the night and had the whole\ncrowd skanking along with its reggae melodies.\nDipping into the crowd pleasers\nwith Killamangiro, The Libertines\nhit Time For Heroes and a special\nBabyshambles\nBrixton Academy\nI\u2019ve never even been to the Borderline before, yet I am already giving\nstrangers directions. Luckily I\u2019m\nnot wrong, and I find this cosy venue tucked away just behind Charing Cross Road. First up tonight is\nthe interestingly monikered Dave\nHouse who does his best to liven up\nthe crowd armed only with a guitar\nand his voice. He does his best, but\nperhaps he is suffering from the\nsymptoms of the cold that he observes \u201ceveryone in England has\nright now!\u201d Taking requests from\nthe crowd is all he seems to do; in\nfact there is no discernable set at\nall, which makes for a friendly atmosphere in which the crowd dictates what music they hear.\nNext up are Tellison, a local band\nfor us Imperial types, coming from\nHammersmith, who have clearly\nbrought a sizeable support with\nthem to cheer them on. They take\nme completely by surprise by unleashing a brilliant array of tunes\npacked with vocal harmonies and\ninfectious melodies. The band play\nwith such enthusiasm and energy,\nnever without a smile on their faces\nthat it is impossible not to like them.\nThe biggest cheer comes for their\nsong New York New York which is\ntheir only released song to date, but\nwatch out for their album too which\nshould be out next month.\nDartz! start their headlining show\noff with a bit of banter with the\ncrowd, thanking us for coming out\nto their \u2018home show\u2019. \u201cNah, we\u2019re\nfrom Middlesbrough actually,\u201d says\nthe guitarist, and when the crowd\ncheer this piece of information he\ncontinues, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve obviously\nnever been!\u201d This is a band who\nspecialise in great tunes, made\nparticularly danceable by the intricate guitar parts and funky drums\nwhich are reminiscent of Q and Not\nU in their prime. Interestingly the\nguitarist and drummer swap instruments for one song, and prove\nthemselves equally adept in each\nother\u2019s role.\nThe highlights include the hand-clap-orientated Prego Triangolos\nand most recent single, the awesome Once, Twice Again which\nrounds off an immaculate set. The\nband returns for an encore even\nthough no-one was really cheering\nfor it, which is always disappointing,\nalthough somewhat inevitable. Worryingly for an album launch show,\nthe band doesn\u2019t have any copies\nof their debut This Is My Ship with\nthem, but I advise you look out for it\nas it is surely a corker.\nToby Prudden\nDartz!\nThe Borderline\n\"duet\" with Kate Moss on La Belle\nEt La Bete, Babyshambles left the\ncrowd waiting for hit single Fuck\nForever. Proving an energetic and\nmoving ending that culminated in\nPete Doherty twirling freely across\nthe stage.\nTom Whitson\nlive reviews\nKlaxons debut album finally reviewed\nI have to admit before you start\nreading this too much, I never expected to enjoy Myths Of The Near\nFuture, ever since the Klaxons\nexploded onto the scene late last\nyear with their techno-punk style.\nBut as a fair-minded chap I had to\ngive Myths Of The Near Future a\nchance.\nOpener Two Recievers is slow\nto start providing a nice intro for\nthe album building to the dizzying\ntechno influenced heights of the\nKlaxons, it\u2019s all there but for the\nglowsticks and fluorescent hoodies.\nAtlantis To Interzone rapidly takes\nover with its catchy, if slightly re-petitive, chorus. So infectious is the\nchorus I can't help but hum it the\nrest of the day.\nThis seems to be a repeating\ntheme of Myths Of The Near Future and even though I never paid\nmuch attention to the Klaxons'\nprevious hit singles, Magick and\nGolden Skans they seem somehow\nfamiliar, lyrics even seem to have\nstuck. A pretty good testimony to\nthe sheer catchiness of the Klaxons\u2019 debut album.\nAfter everything that's been written about the Klaxons' championing\nthe \"new-rave\" movement \u2013 including the day-glo, smiley face laden\nNME cover story \u2013 Myths Of The\nNear Future isn't exactly what I ex-pected. Tracks like Golden Skans\nand Forgotten Works are a lot more\nindie than I expected, lacking the\nsirens and techno beats made famous by the new-rave genre.\nWhen all is said and done Myths\nOf The Near Future is a pretty good\nalbum, not what it's hyped up to be\nThe Klaxons\nMyths Of The Near Future\n(Universal)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nbut good all the same. Highlights\nwould have to be the almost too\ncatchy singles Magick and Golden\nSkans but the less familiar tracks\nsuch as Totem On The Timeline are\nstill so infectious they'll have you\ndancing on the morning tube.\nTom Whitson\nnu-rave review\nMatty Hoban\nMuzak Editorr\nI\nn keeping with me mentioning music at Imperial last\nweek, I thought I would talk\nabout some more stuff a bit\ncloser to home as it were.\nWith the recent announcement of\nStephen Brown \u2013 the guy I voted\nfor, but shhh, you are not to know\notherwise the losers will come\nand remove my spleen \u2013 as Union\nPresident elect, I thought I would\nmention one of his policies that\nstuck with me.\nAside from all the obvious stuff\nsuch as keeping bar prices as\nlow as possible, being open and\nhonest, I stumbled across a brilliant point: trying new things in\nthe ents schedule and not being\nafraid to make mistakes. From\na music point-of-view, the ents\nis important because you want\ntastes in music represented, and\nthe Union should be there for you.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the ents\nhas been successful this year\nwith sell-out events but Stephen\nwants to improve diversity in\nevents, and we are a diverse uni-versity. The current ents system\nwe have that represents the Union is an events/venue manager\nwho books and organises the\nevents with the occasional aid\nfrom various sabbs or societies.\nThis is good in that there is a\ndedicated officer who can oversee\neverything and has ultimate con-trol, but the diversity is limited by\nonly having one representative.\nAs far as I can see, there are\ntwo practical ways in which there\ncan be more diversity: \u2018privatising\u2019 events by introducing more\noutside promoters; or the introduction of an \u2018ents board\u2019 which\nshares the burden of responsibility and creativity. The first\noption is currently used in the\nform of Oculo Garden, but could\ngo much further, eg. Afterskool\nKlub at LSE and attract students\nfrom across London. This brings\noutsiders with their own enthusiasm and advertising impact.\nHowever, the set-up at the Union\nmeans bureaucracy involved and\na gamble on an outside promotion company.\nThe ents board appears to be\nthe most viable at the minute and\nit would involve those who run\nevents and so have a stake in its\nrunning. The ents board can then\nwork with the ents manager for a\nmore diverse ents. Aaron OliverTaylor (look him up in the College\ndirectory) is trying to set one up,\nI recommend you get in touch.\nWearing gaudy clothes all day can really depress you\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nR\n\n"

    "content": "This year\u2019s Night Hike was in the\nsame place as last years\u2019, around\nDorking on the North Downs.\nThere is a Scout hut quite helpfully\nplaced on the outskirts of Dorking\novershadowed by Box Hill. This\nyear was relatively easy for the\norganisers as the route had been\nplanned with no need to set up any\nof checkpoints.\nEven so after all the maps had\nbeen printed a slight alteration was\nneeded as checkpoint 2 was placed\n100 metres down the road from\nwhere it should have been. The\nminibus drove out and found a suitable clue for the new checkpoint 2.\nIt then started to pour, and wondering whether anyone would turn\nup to walk around in a downpour we\nstarted to get the hut prepared for\nthe night to come.\nJust after 7pm, the first runner\nteam arrived and by 7.50pm they\nwere off. After a bit more of a wait\nthe walker\u2019s registration opened at\n8.30pm with one team turning up on\nthe dot. Most of the others turned\nup in the two minibuses that arrived around 9pm.\nThe competent and novice teams\ncould start at 9.30pm and most\nteams took the time to prepare\ntheir routes. Each of the 20 checkpoints had a question associated\nwith it, most of the answers were on\nsigns or around the area so torches\nwere essential.\nMost teams left sometime between 10 and 11pm; however the\nother two runner teams waited until the last moment before setting\noff into the night.\nTherewerethreedifferentcategories: \u2018novice\u2019, for those who weren\u2019t\nvery familiar with navigation skills,\n\u2018competent\u2019, for those with a little\nmore experience, and \u2018runner\u2019, you\ncan guess what they do.\nNovice teams had a choice of visiting up to 11 checkpoints in the\narea to the West, while all 20 checkpoints were up for grabs for the\ncompetent and runner teams. Most\nof the teams elected to head around\nthe course clockwise, as this meant\nthey could come down Box Hill instead of going up it.\nA few people had to pull out during the night due to the cold and\nwet conditions; they were all met by\na rescue minibus and a warm hut\nat the end of it. All but two teams\nstayed within their allotted time,\nwith severe time penalties taking precious points away from the\nteams, everyone knew they must be\nback within 6 and a half hours.\nExtra time was awarded for visiting manned checkpoints and with\nthe rain pelting down most teams\ntook this option as it gave them a\nchance to find some cover and perhaps get a cup of tea.\nThe first team back was \u201cTeam\nTwelve\u201d the first runner team who\nmanaged 14 of the checkpoints\nand collected 670 points, they then\nhad a 2 and a half hour wait to see\nwhether they had won or not.\nThe rest of the teams arrived between 2 and 5.30am, with breakfast\nbeing served from 5am. The last\nteam aptly called \u201cMarooned\u201d arrived at 5.30 after being picked up\nby the minibus at a manned check-point. They managed to get to 9\ncheckpoints but were 39 minutes\nlate so their final score was 315\npoints.\nIt turned out that perhaps the\ncourse was too hard this year with\nno team managing to get to all the\ncheckpoints and so the 1000 points;\nhowever the winners of the competent category made a good attempt\nto visit 18. This gave team \u201cAndras\nIs A Gay\u201d a total of 895 points which\nwas the winning score, for the win\nthey received beer, the smiles that\nthis produced made walking some\n20km seem worth it.\nSecond place went to another\nteam from the Outdoor club \u201cBurg\nIs A Gay\u201d with an impressive 850\npoints. Third place went to the Fellwanderers team \u201cLittle House On\nThe Prairie\u201d with their score of 725\npoints.\nIn the Novice category an external team \u201cRoxy Monkey\u201d managed\nto get to all 11 of their checkpoints\nand score the maximum 525 points\navailable. In second place team\n\u201cEdgy People\u201d came home exactly on the dot of 6 and a half hours with\n9 checkpoints visited and 445 points.\nThird place went to team \u201cABC\u201d as\nthe only managed to visit 5 checkpoints and collect 260 points, they\ndecided to come back and get dry\nafter 2 and a half hours.\nOne runner team \u201cDan Is A Lady\u201d\nmanaged to get round 12 checkpoints in just over 3 hours then\nspotted the rescue minibus heading his way. After wading through\nthe flooded road he hitched a lift\nback to the dry hut. This meant he\nreceived 560 points and the possibility of receiving one of the wooden\nspoon replacements for this year.\nThe other runner team \u201cJoe Is A\nGay\u201d split up with Joe coming back\nto hut after a few hours and Neil\ncarrying on. Neil arrived back to the\nhut after visiting 13 checkpoints but\nwith over 2 and a half hours left.\nAfter a quick break he ventured\nup to the nearest checkpoint to\nlevel his team\u2019s score with that of\n\u201cTeam Twelve\u201d. This meant that\nthat \u201cTeam Twelve\u201d was pushed\ninto second place behind \u201cJoe Is A\nGay\u201d, with \u201cDan Is A Lady\u201d coming\nin third.\nThere were other prizes for those\nplaced outside the top three, these\nincluded the \u2018best lighting device\u2019\naward this year that was awarded\nto the team with Christmas lights,\nand a lighted disco ball. The \u2018most\nrandom object carried round\u2019\naward went to the team which managed to carry a fold-up table round\nwith them.\nThe \u2018best costume\u2019 award went\nwithout a doubt to the team that\ndressed up in ponchos, moustach-es, sombreros, and carried flaming torches. These torches were on\ntrack to win the best lighting device\nas well until they went out in the\nrain; hopefully they remembered to\nbring other sources of light.\nThis year instead of wooden\nspoons there were dog food sporks.\nThese were a brilliant find and all\nthe teams which won one were\ndeeply honoured to receive such\nan award. These three teams were\n\u201cABC\u201d, \u201cThe Fellowship\u201d, and \u201cDan\nIs A Lady\u201d.\nSpecial mention should go to\nmembers of the committee which\nperformed above their normal\nroles. Paul by getting scared by a\nrubber chicken, and Phil for being\na muppet and not being able to light\nhis stove, keep up the good work\nguys.\nSpecial thanks must go to Mark\nfor driving the rescue minibus, also\nto Phil, Oli, and Tamsin for manning\nthe checkpoints, and not forgetting\nKirsty and Paul for manning the\nkitchen for breakfast [Editor: I do\nanything for tea].\nAlso thank you to the fifty-odd\ncompetitors who took part.

On\nFebruary15th,StephenRademaker,\nthe former US Assistant Secretary\nfor International Security and Nonproliferation confessed that the\ntwo crucial votes by India against\nIran in the Governors\u2019 Board of the\nIAEA which led to Iran\u2019s referral to\nthe Security Council were indeed\nthe result of US coercion. Incidentally India, like the other US allies\nPakistan and Israel, is not a signatory to the NPT and has developed\nnuclear bombs, which is tolerated\nand supported by the US.\nThe main charge by the Western\nleaders is that Iran concealed its\nnuclear programme for some 18\nyears, but what is never mentioned\nis what prompted Iran to conceal\nits programme.\nIn fact, in violation of Article IV of\nagainst non-nuclear countries.\nTony Blair\u2019s decision to renew the\nTrident system is similarly in gross\nviolation of the NPT.\nIs it possible to tailor attacks and\nsanctions in such a way that Iranian civilians will not be harmed?\nAbsolutely not. In Iraq, thirteen\nyears of sanctions before the 2003\ninvasion, which were supposedly\ndesigned against the Saddam re-gime, resulted in the death of over\none million children alone. The\nthreats of UN sanctions against\nIran have already caused a large\nflight of capital, economic recession and massive new unemploy-ment. Sanctions will only hurt the\neconomy and the Iranian people.\nIsrael crippled Iraq\u2019s nuclear programme 25 years ago with an air\nstrike on its unfinished Osiraq\nreactor. Can a similar military attack \u2018succeed\u2019 against the Iranian\nprogramme?\nIraniannuclearplantsarescattered\nthroughout the country and deeply\nfortified underground, which makes\nsuch conventional attacks impossible to succeed. That is why the US\nand Israel have been shamelessly\nconsidering (according to various\nsources and reports for example by\nSeymour Hersh in the New Yorker,\nPhilip Giraldi, an ex-CIA officer, in\nthe American Conservative and\nmore recently in the Sunday Times)\nto use tactical nuclear weapons to\ndestroy Iranian nuclear plants.\nHow would attacks and/or sanctions affect the region?\nJohn McCain, the Republican hopeful for the US presidential elections\nin 2008, who supports the military\noption against Iran to be on the ta-ble, was asked this same question.\nHis answer was simple: Armageddon. In fact, Iran is three times the\nsize of Iraq and has three times\nmore population with considerable\ninfluence in Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Afghanistan. An attack on\nIran will lead to a full scale war, a\nmajor regional conflagration, mass\nrevolts against pro-US regimes that\nwill deeply destabilize the Middle\nEast further for decades to come.\nWhat would you recommend\nworld leaders wanting to ensure\nthat Iran does not build nuclear\nweapons to do?\nThe US should enter into direct and\nimmediate negotiations with Iran\non all issues in dispute without any\npreconditions. Based on a grand\ndeal that the US should offer, in\nexchange for security guarantees\nand lifting of US sanctions against\nIran, an agreement can be reached\nwhich would provide Western leaders with the assurances they seek\nthat Iran\u2019s nuclear programme\nwill not be diverted into a weapons\nprogramme.\nWhat is your sense of the opinion\non this issue amongst Iranian exiles in general? Some Iraqi exiles\nplayed a leading role in making\nthe case for the invasion of Iraq;\nwill we see a similar effort now by\nsome Iranian exiles?\nThe overwhelming majority of Iranians in diaspora are against any\nmilitary attack on their country but\nmost of them remain passive and in\ndenial that such an attack is actually possible. It is vital that they stand\nup with a united voice against another pre-emptive illegal and criminal war of aggression, which will\nbring a catastrophe for the whole\nworld.\nanyone) as a confidence-building\nmeasure for some two years during\nits negotiations with the EU-3 (the\nUK, France and Germany) in 2003-05. But the US, the back seat driver\nin the EU-3 negotiations, insisted\nthat Iran\u2019s right under the NPT for\na fuel cycle be relinquished. That is\nwhy the negotiations failed and Iran\nreversed its voluntary decision to\nsuspend uranium enrichment early\nin 2006. Since, as recognized by the\nEU-3, the earlier Iranian decision\nto suspend enrichment was a voluntary one, its reversal was completely lawful.\nIran has also offered an unprecedented proposal to invite Western\ncompanies and governments in a\njoint venture to develop its nuclear\nprogramme, which together with\nits pledge in ratifying the Additional Protocol can provide the complete assurances sought by the US\nand the West that its programme\nwill never be diverted to a nuclear\nweapons programme.\nBut this offer was also immediately dismissed by the US, which\nmakes one suspect that the US is\nnot after resolving the Iranian nuclear issue but is seeking a regime\nchange. Iranian leaders now say\nthey are standing up for Iran\u2019s national rights under the NPT and are\nrefusing to be bullied by the US.\nWe also need to bear in mind that\nthe five permanent members of the\nSecurity Council and above all the\nUS are the real violators of the NPT\nas they have refused, in breach of\nArticle VI, to take any effective\nsteps towards nuclear disarma-ment. The US has built new generations of nuclear weapons, including\nthe so-called mini-nukes or tactical\nnuclear weapons, and has declared\nin the Pentagon\u2019s document \u201cDoctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\u201d\nthat it will even use them \u201cfor deterrence\u201d in pre-emptive attacks\nthe NPT, the US in the post-revolu-tion years pressured all Western\nand non-Western governments and\ncompanies to cancel their nuclear\ncollaboration contracts with Iran.\nIsrael bombed and destroyed the\nOsiraq nuclear plant in Iraq with\nimpunity. Also Saddam systematically committed war crimes by using chemical weapons, provided by\nthe West, against Iran with complete impunity, despite Iran\u2019s protests to the UN. Iranian leaders, as\nRafsanjani put it, concluded that\n\u2018The [Iran-Iraq] war taught us that\ninternational laws are nothing but\nink on paper.\u201d.\nIran did in fact voluntarily halt its\nenrichment programme and voluntarily enforced the Additional Protocol of the IAEA (for inspectors to\ngo anywhere, any time and talk to\nThe greatest teaching point of medical school is the way it splashes\nreality in your face like a bucket of\ncold water. As a student you have\nideals about how to practise medicine and how to treat patients. Every day spent in the wards reveals\nthat once upon a time consultants\nshared the same ambitions that\nare still burgeoning in the students.\nYet somewhere in the evolution of\nmedical student to consultant these\nideals and ambitions are both lost\nand smothered.\nThe ideals of treating a patient\neffectively and efficiently without\ncausing inconvenience or harm\nhave been invaded by the practice\nof defensive medicine: treating\npatients in a way that averts the\nprospect of being sued and taken to\ncourt. Tests and investigations are\nmade not out of neccesity or benefit\nto the patient but to avoid liability.\nThis wastes money, time, and unnecessarily puts patients at risk.\nThis practice exists because peopledon\u2019ttrustmedicalprofessionals\nanymore. Patients continually seek\nlegal action, the Daily Mail has its\ninevitable field day and the mother-in-law of a government sticks its\nmalignant nose even further into\nsomething it has no real understanding of. Most politicians don\u2019t\nhave medical training or sufficient\nexperience of working in the NHS.\nPatricia Hewitt is the current Secing \u2013 doctors do know what they\u2019re\ndoing, they don\u2019t need to be put under the microscope. Let them get\non with their job.\nThis CCTV atmosphere does\nnothing but hinder how medical\nnot that medical professionals do\nnot need monitoring but that right\nnow it is verging on harassment\n\u2013 every single step taken, no matter\nhow miniscule, needs permission,\ndocumenting, justifying, authoris-retary of State for Health but prior\nto that she was Minister for Small\nBusiness and E-Commerce at the\nDepartment of Trade and Industry, roles which, besides managerial experience, have questionable\ncommon ground. Admittedly, managerial experience is useful but she\nhasn\u2019t worked for the NHS at any\nother level so it\u2019s bewildering how\nshe expects to know what changes\nto implement. Clearly though, her\nmain objective is keeping the voters\non her side and making them happy\nand in attempting to do so she is\ndoing a wonderful job of forgetting\nto consider the long-term consequences of her \u2018amendments\u2019.\nWhilst it is agreed that the NHS\nis a service to the public and that\npatients should certainly be satisfied and receiving the best possible care, sometimes patients don\u2019t\nalways know what that is \u2013 they\nmight Google it, or think they know.\nBe it at first glance a patronizing or\npolitically incorrect statement it\u2019s\nstill true. Doctors and nurses have\ntrained for years and have firsthand experience, they have specialist knowledge in their field and it is\nabout time some trust was handed\nback to them.\nSurely there exists an attainable\nbalance between having a cohort\nof Harold Shipman caricatures and\ndoctors who are under 24 hour sur-veillance, working to \u2018cover their\nbacks in case something happens\u2019,\ndrowning in red tape. The point is\nprofessionals work by forcing them\nto worry more about a possible\ncourt case than what the patient\nreally needs. It is not essential to\nX-ray every single patient with a\ncough if the other symptoms and\nsigns are not suggestive of something sinister and if twenty years of\nexperience is telling you that there\nis nothing wrong with the patient,\nbut the X-ray still has to be performed and documented.\nGiving autonomy back to the\npeople who have trained hard and\nworked in medicine is what is need-ed, not more tracking \u2013 it just puts\nprofessionals under unwarranted\npressure. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising\nif the next set of junior doctors is to\nbe electronically tagged.\nThe public needs to accept that\ndoctors have not yet reached the\nomniconscience and miracle-per-forming powers of God so of course\nthey will make mistakes, but that\ngenerally speaking they don\u2019t\ndrive into work vowing to commit\nmalpractice.\nMore so, patients need to take\nmore responsibility for their health\ncare instead of riding the bandwagon of blame culture. After all, a doctor\u2019s job is not to cure, it is to give\npatients the tools and information\nto help them cope with their health\nand doctors would be able to do that\na lot better if they were allowed to\nuse their own discretion without a\nheavy cloud of scrutiny enveloping\nthem.\nDoctors need to be left to work without having to worry about\nimpending court cases from patients intent on suing them\n\n"

In order to celebrate the\nend of this year\u2019s crop and welcome\nthe new class, Film Felix is growing\nup too, and it needs you!\nWe want to showcase a whole\nrange of material that goes beyond\nwhat we have at the moment. The\nOscars are over, bah, who cares?\nThere\u2019s more than simple awards\nfodder out there and we want to\nbring that to the attention of our\nreaders as well. If you are a particular fan of foreign cinema then\nyou may feel your view is underrepresented by our current section, or\nyou may think that any film made\nafter 1970 is just rubbish and want\nto expose your peers to a back catalogue of classics. If you get an urge\nwhenever you meet someone to declare your undying love for Stanley\nKubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Demi\nMoore, or Lindsay Lohan then put\nyour obsession in print and we\u2019ll try\nand find you a platform to spread\nthat view. We\u2019re talking real passion\npieces here.\nAlternatively, hands up who\nthought The Godfather was rubbish \u2026 Anyone? I\u2019m not of the\nmindset that it is, but if you are then\nyou must be sick to death of seeing\nyour favourites pushed down the\n\u201cX Greatest Movies of All Time\u201d list\nby it and its sequel. Trash it, and if\nit\u2019s done in a sufficiently entertaining way then it\u2019d be a great read\nand I\u2019m sure if you argue your case\nstrongly enough, you\u2019ll find a follower or two.\nOf course this isn\u2019t all we\u2019ll have,\notherwise we\u2019re in danger of becoming either ass-kissing loons or\nbitter old misers.

One was at the premiere of\nthe final Star Wars film: the end of\nan epic saga no matter which way\nyou look at it; the other was to the\nconclusion of Battlefield Earth\n\u2013 indubitably the worst film ever\nconceived, and the applause was\nsimply a self-congratulatory act by\nthe two people that had managed to\nstay awake through the less-than-epic drivel, thanking the heavens\nthat it was finally over.\nHowever, I have found a third.\nFans of bizarre, irreverent, and occasionally violent comedy, rejoice,\nfor the makers of Shaun of the Dead\nhave reunited to give you Hot Fuzz,\na film so consistently amusing it\ndoes provoke you to stand up and\napplaud, a quality only usually reserved for the very heights or deep,\ndark abysses of moviemaking.\nSimon Pegg stars as Nicolas Angel, an officer in the Metropolitan\nPolice who is forcefully reassigned\nto the peaceful village of Sandford\non the basis that he is making the\nforce look bad; with an arrest rate\n400% higher than that of any fellow\nofficer, an expert command of extreme driving and high-speed pursuits (including extreme biking), a\ndead-eye when it comes to armed\nresponses, a mastery of unarmed\ncombat, and to top it off, two firsts in\nPolitics and Sociology, the audience\nis not surprised the top brass are\nenvious of PC Angel (well, perhaps\nRobert Andrews\nnot the Sociology degree part).\nSandford, an idyllic, tranquil, and\ntherefore dull, drab, and lifeless village too far from any city to have a\nmobile phone reception, is very different from Angel\u2019s normal London\nenvironment.\nThis village is said to be the safest\nplace in the country, and as such,\nthe small police force situated there\nspend their days eating ice cream,\nlooking for missing swans, and mispronouncing London in such a variety of ways you\u2019d be convinced that\nthey have never heard of the place\nbefore. So much for civilization beyond the M25 \u2026\nHowever, soon the sleepy town\nappears to be hiding something\na lot more sinister as residents\nstart dropping dead faster than\nyour average series of Midsomer\nMurders.\nAlongside Pegg is his old partner\nin comedy crime, Nick Frost, as the\noafish but well-meaning sidekick,\nperfecting their double act in this\nspiritual sequel to Shaun. Frost\u2019s\ncharacter in particular proves the\nmost amusing in a sweet and innocent way, ranging from the inevitable brain freeze that comes\nfrom stuffing a Cornetto down your\nthroat at light speed to his inquiry\nas to whether there\u2019s a point in a\nman\u2019s head that if shot, explodes.\nPegg radiates the seriousness expected from his character, wonderfully juxtaposed by the rest of the\nactors, which include some well-cast cameos including Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, and Jim Broadbent,\ncontinuously providing a stream of\nlaughs at machine-gun pace.\nThe humour in the film varies\nthroughout, beginning with irony\nand gradually moving towards the\nslapstick action-packed finale with\nnumerous parodies, throwbacks,\nand homages to various other films\nand cultural reference points, including Chinatown, Terminator 2,\nJurassic Park, and the videogame\nResident Evil 4. The pleasingly\nover-the-top gore which begins as\nnumerous \u201caccidents\u201d befall the\nvillagers, including \u201cfalling on a set\nof shears\u201d and \u201cblowing a house up\nby cooking a pot of baked beans\u201d\nare horribly amusing to watch, as\nyou find yourself battling between\nwhether you should be laughing or\ncringing in disgust.\nThe storyline is as excellently\ntwisted as Shaun of the Dead,\nto which there are many nods in\nthis film, including the eponymous\nshortcut sequence where several\nmembers of the cast attempt to\nleap over a series of garden fences\nto varying degrees of success.\nEven when the jokes are so carefully set up and you can see them\ncoming from a mile away, they are\nstill as funny as the more unexpected ones. Towards the end, the\nfilm\u2019s plot provides a delightful set\nof eccentric, ludicrous twists that\nwill have you struggling not to cry\nwith laughter.\nOf course there will be hundreds\nof comparisons made between Hot\nFuzz and Shaun of the Dead, but\nalthough they begin in similar ways\nand the cinematography is employed in the same way throughout\nboth films, the humour in Hot Fuzz\nis so varied and well-paced that at\npoints it becomes a parody of itself\nand its own ridiculous events, proving all the better for it. Nevertheless, it is perfectly valid to infer that\nif you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead,\nyou will absolutely revel in the comic stylings of the second cinema offering from the Spaced team.\nSo if you want to see a film that\ngives you rural settlements full\nof murderous conspirators, set-pieces for delivering far-out action\nsequences, heroic swans, sheds\nfull of high-tech weaponry, and old\npensioners being kicked in the face,\nthen this is most certainly worth\nthe asking price.\nThank heavens for city life.\ncurriculum of quantum mechanics\nand, well, whatever else people do\nhere, then drop us a line and we\u2019ll\nsee if we can send you something\nsuitable.\nFor this week, we\u2019re trying to satiate your desire for what\u2019s out at the\nmoment to wipe the nasty Oscars\ntaste from our mouths. We\u2019ve tried\nto include a little bit of something\nfor everyone so hopefully we\u2019ll tickle your fancy.

    "content": "Middling success for IC shooters\n31\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPicture the scene\u2026 it\u2019s foggy\u2026\ndark\u2026 we\u2019re in the countryside\u2026\nit\u2019s 11pm and a pair of headlights\nappear dimly in the distance around\nthe corner. The sound of a diesel\nengine roaring is the only noise\ndisturbing the evening stillness\u2026 a\nlone figure stands in the middle of\nthe road, waving it down and directing it to turn off the main road\u2026\nsounds dramatic doesn\u2019t it? What if\nI told you it was the Union minibus\nand it really was 11pm? What if I\ntold you the lone figure was yours\ntruly, having arrived with the advance party thirty minutes earlier?\nWhat if I then told you that it was\nthat late because the navigator of\nsaid intrepid union minibus had\ntaken one single wrong turn and\nonly realised the error of his ways a\nfull 35miles later? Ahh\u2026. I see\u2026\nAfter all the drama of travelling\nup to the West Midlands, getting\ncustomarily lost, stopping at the\nservices early for a bursting bowel\n(75mph never seemed slower!), flying down the M42 trying to make up\ntime then realising they were flying\nin the wrong direction, stopping\nproperly at the services for suste-nance, driving down unlit A-roads\nwith a truck going in the opposite\ndirection, we finally made it with\nbeers ready to open, Krispy Kremes\nready to chow down and the generous warmth and hospitality of Ironbridge Youth Hostel for the night.\nThe next morning would come\nfar too soon for most and far too\ndramatically for all \u2013 however had\nAyman not stayed up all night (for\nfear of sleeping in himself) and put\non his best Arnie impression at 6am\n- kicked-in doors and everything\n- we may not have got a full complement of shooters up and ready by\n7:30 for the hour journey onto West\nMidlands Shooting Ground, one of\nthe premier grounds in the UK and\nhost to the British Open last year.\nOn arrival it was straight down to\nbusiness. Just as soon as we had\na cuppa and a bacon sarnie \u2013 pri-orities! But seriously now, onto the\nbusiness end of the trip we pro-gressed. The shooting ground is\nhome to some of the best terrain\nfor sporting clay pigeon shooting\nand with the number of entries\ngrowing every year to vie for both\nthe Championship and the Trophy\nit was apparent to all that this year\nthe shooting was going to be fast,\ncomplicated, and hard to figure out\nquickly. Nothing worries a shooter\nmore than a target they can\u2019t figure\nout how to hit \u2013 and this year there\nwere an abundance of challenges\nand plenty of chances to watch\nothers try with almost guaranteed\nmixed success.\nThe results were varied with the\nfirst team filling in positions from\ntwenty-fourth to forty-ninth out of\nabout 60 Championship Course\ncompetitors and the second team\nfilled positions from 29 to 61 out\nof the Trophy competitors. In the\nteam competition the 1sts finished\nseventh out of 16 and the 2nds eleventh out of 22 teams. The graduates eventually finished off fourth\nout of 11 graduate teams and while\nit doesn\u2019t look particularly impressive out of context, the scoring\nwas tight and all the teams were a\nstone\u2019s throw from picking up a few\nmore places in rank \u2013 a clear sign\nwe\u2019re finally building up the much-BUSA Championships Scores\nIC 1sts 178\nIC 2nds 171\nIC Graduate 1sts 187\nIC Graduate 2nds 154\nneeded momentum for a fight to the\nfront of the pack next year.\nFinally, the author can only commiserate the club \u2013 who for the\nsecond year running have lost the\nChallenge Cup, a competition initiated by Geoff Quint and Tim Aplin,\na challenge thrown down at the feet\nof the undergraduates to take on the\nbest of the old boys and beat them\nat it \u2013 the closeness of the scores\ntell their own tale and we have no\ndoubt one day they will triumph\nover us. Just not this year\u2026\nGuilds/RSCU paint the town red\nThere aren\u2019t many things that can\nget a student out of bed and standing outside of the Union at 9am on\na Sunday morning, but one thing\nis for sure; the promise of pelting\nscientists with 200mph paintballs\ndoes! What is fast becoming an annual tradition, the CGCU paintball\nevent saw the finest Guildsmen\n(and women) clash head to head\nwith RCSU (scum). Headed by the\nglorious yet petit James Fok the\nengineers plenty out numbered\nthe scientists. Without any RCSU\nexecutive or enough members for\na team we generously \u2018leant\u2019 the\nscientists four strapping mechanical engineers, while Mr. Vigoureux\ntook the challenge of captaining the\nhodge podge team.\nThe weather was dull and interspersed with rain but thankfully the\ndrizzle did nothing to crush the enthusiasm of the students. The first\ntwo games were over a lumpy field\nfull of saplings and mounds.\nWorking with superior intellect\nthe engineers quickly out maneu-vered, out witted and out shot the\nscientists with two outstanding\nflanking runs which saw Martinez\nsteal the flag, winning the game for\nthe engineers, without a single cas-ualty. For the second round the scientists tried to pick up their game\nbut could only muster a stalemate\nand tie the match.\nNext up was a car infested farm-yard. Rescuing a mannequin from\nthe back of a tractor proved complex for the engineers \u2013 with poorly\ndeveloped sense of humanity many\nwere distracted by the fine array\nmechanical machines, instead of focusing on the task in had \u2013 rescuing\na lifeless comrade. The field ended\nwith a win to the scientist preceded\nby a tie, the engineers needed a\nnew tactic.\nBut luckily, we had a unique ele-ment, the engineering fast Fok. As\nwe went into the speedball game,\nthe nimble Guilds president proved\nhis worth by darting across the\nfield and picking up the flag in both\nrounds. The following success was\nslightly marred as the scientists\nentrenched themselves for the\nrounds and the ensuing skirmishes\nsaw a tie followed by a win to the\nengineers.\nAll rested on the final map, both\nteams had two wins and the game\nreverted back to the hilly terrain\nthat boosted the engineers to an\nearly lead at the beginning of the\nday. The fire fight was intense as\nteams clashed at the extremes of\nthe map but the engineers found a\nkink in the enemy lines and sneaked\ninto their base to retrieve the flag.\nLagging by one round the scientist\ncould only hope to draw the day and\na heavy bombardment of our base,\ncoupled with ammo running out\nthey managed a final win, ending\nthe day with no clear winner.\nIf this has whet your appetite for\nCGCU events, don\u2019t despair, the\ntraditional \u2018Egg Race\u2019 is coming up\non March 7th. The challenge is to fly\nand egg as far across Queens\u2019 Lawn\nas possible from Queens\u2019 Tower. We\nare looking for teams to take on the\nchallenge after spending the afternoon fashioning a plane out of balsa\nwood, glue and tape. If you fancy a\nchance then email guilds.honsec@\nic.ac.uk for more details.\nTim Aplin\nThe members of the IC shooting squad who have clearly been working out \u2013 check out those muscles\nClash of the idiots proved to be a resounding success\nA.

And that is what\nhis troops did racking up atleast\nfive goals in the first quarter of an\nhour.\nThe goal flurry came with clinical precision from the tasked strike\nforce. The first few went in with an\nunbelievable air of ease. With an\nIC victory on the cards again, the\nrecovering Star Wars and Foetus\nwere given a break till half time.\nSensing an easy game ahead and\nperhaps his only chance at goal\npie this season, Harvester quickly\nmade a tactical decision to place\nhimself at centre forward and within a couple of minutes had excitedly rifled one in from close range.\nGoals kept on pouring past the\nKings goalie (who was by now acting as an innocent by-stander) from\nRatty, Jumanji and Toady.\nThe team managed to keep their\nheads, moving the ball well and giving Kings absolutely no chance off\nrespite. Half-time was blown, which\ngave the umpires the chance to\nsharpen their pencils and count the\nscore so far \u2013 13-0! A new strategy\nwas dreamt up in a matter of sec-onds. It was time to put this game\ninto the record books.\nAnother half like the first would\nxkcd www.xkcd.com\nbring us close to the record. Harvester and Ratty took a rest bringing Star Wars and Foetus back into\nthe fray. Toady kept it tight from\nbehind whilst the rest of the team\nswarmed the field in a frenzy of goal\nhunger.\nGoals came quicker than ever\nin the second half; Sid notched up\nyet more for this season, Shipman\nslotted one in net for his first this\nseason and Naked Tube Rider even\nput one away on his debut. Further\ngoals came from Foetus and Date\nRape as the magic 26th goal was\nput away.\nHarvester and Ratty moved back\ninto the mix in place of Shipman and\nKrusty. With 20 minutes remaining\nit was time to enforce a power play\non Kings so IC removed their goal-ie, with Plug to increase the torrent\nof pressure on the opposition.\nTime to make this game histo-ry! Up stepped Batty to the mark\nputting his goal away to make it 27-0 and a new record.\nStar Wars continued the scoring\nfrenzy along with Krusty, crafting\nsome moments of hockey genius.\nThe final score was 32-0. Yes, they\nhad 11 players. Yes, this time they\nhad a goalie. Yes, they knew which\nend of the stick to hold. No, they\nweren\u2019t blind! Great performance\nfrom the Mens 1s to keep playing\nteam hockey, even well into a dou-ble-figure victory.\nWell done boys, the record books\nare ours for a while yet. A devastated RSM proceeded to the Union to\ndrown their sorrows, and plan their\nBottle recovery mission to Camborne next year.\nMens Hockey\nIC 1st XI 32\nKings 1st XI 0\nRichard Bacon\nThis time Joe didn\u2019t feel so silly dressed up in ridiculous amounts of padding and a Darth Vader helmet\nHockey 1st XI legendary goal haul\nWWW.XKCD.COM/C165.HTML\n\n"

    "content": "4 felix Friday 9 March 2007\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHelping prevent attacks on Iran\nFelix: What compels you to undertake this campaign against sanctions and military intervention in\nIran?\nAbbas Edalat: The Iran-US standoff\nat the present time has a shocking\nresemblance to the run-up to the US\nled invasion of Iraq. The same Neoconservatives and hawks headed\nby Dick Cheney in Washington, who\nchampioned the cause of invasion\nof Iraq that has brought the current\ncatastrophe for the people of that\ncountry, are now shamelessly calling for a military attack on Iran.\nThe same Israeli lobby which\npushed for the invasion of Iraq is\nnow pushing for attacking Iran.\nThe same strategy of lies, and distortions which was used to dupe\nthe international community and\nsoften it up for the invasion of Iraq\nis again used to pave the way for\nanother illegal pre-emptive war of\naggression against Iran.\nYou only need to replace Saddam\u2019s non-existent Weapons of Mass\nDestruction with Iran\u2019s fantasy nu-clearweaponsprogrammeandbear\nin mind that \u201clinks with Al Qaeda\u201d\nand \u201csupport for terrorism\u201d are levelled against Iran as were against\nthe Saddam regime to get the exact\nsense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The UN Security\nCouncil resolutions, obtained by\nUS political coercion and economic\nbribery, also play an exactly similar\nrole, namely to provide a veneer of\nlegitimacy for a criminal and illegal act of aggression. What is now\nof course new is that Iran is, on top\nof all these things, blamed for the\nfailure of the US in Iraq, which furnishes a new pretext for justifying\naggression.\nThe real motivation for the US is\nneither Iran\u2019s nuclear programme\nnor its role in Iraq and fantasy links\nwith Al Qaeda. The hawks in the\nUS administration are resolved for\na regime change in Iran in accordance with the Neo-conservative\nProject for the New American Century which aims to use the might\nof the US military power to replace\ndefiant regimes in the Middle East\nwith pro-US regimes to establish\nher control of energy resources and\npower in the region.\nThe US has mobilized a massive armada in the Persian Gulf\nthreatening Iran with military ac-tion. We need urgent mass action\nto prevent a new catastrophe in the\nregion which will dwarf what we\nsee in Iraq. Only mass mobilization\ncan prevent this happening in the\nnext 22 months that Bush will be in\noffice.\nWhy does Iran need a nuclear pro-gramme, given that it has so much\noil?\nYou should ask Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz\nwho under President Gerald Ford\nsuccessfully persuaded the Shah\nof Iran in the 1970s that his country\nneeded a large nuclear programme\nwith over twenty nuclear reactors\nfor energy production. You see a\ngreat amount of hypocrisy here in\nthe Western media. The truth of the\nmatter is that Iran\u2019s oil resources\nare depleting fast. In fact, Iran is\nspending billions of dollars a year to\nimport petrol for internal consumption as its refineries were destroyed\nby the Saddam regime thanks to\nthe support he received from the\nWest for his 8 year war on Iran. As a\ndeveloping country, Iran\u2019s strategy\nis to sell its oil so as to be able to\ndevelop its basic and hi-tech industries and use nuclear power to generate its internal energy needs for\na growing population of over 70 mil-lion. This is a perfectly rational and\ncost-effective strategy.\nDo you believe the Iranian leadership\u2019s claim that they are only\nintent on nuclear energy? Do you\nthink that the crowds who show\nup to demonstrations in favour\nof the nuclear programme in Iran\ntend to believe this claim, or are\nthey hoping that Iran will secretly\nacquire nuclear weapons through\nthis program?\nI do believe that the Iranian leadership is only intent on nuclear en-ergy. There is a fatwa, a religious\ndecree, by Ayatollah Khamenei, the\nsupreme leader, who is the highest\nauthority in Iran, against the pro-duction, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons which are declared\nun-Islamic. The Western media,\nwhich often condemn the Iranian\npolitical system as theocratic, conveniently fail to let the Western\npublic know about this fatwa. The\ncrowds which show up to demonstrations in support of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme fundamentally\nsupport the supreme leader and\ntherefore his fatwa.\nThe Iranian army and civilians\ngreatly suffered as victims of Saddam\u2019s chemical bombs, provided to\nhim by US and German companies\nwith the approval of their govern-ments. Over 52,000 individuals in\nIran continue to suffer from those\nchemical bombs, and many of them\ntake part in demonstrations against\ntheWest.Ibelievethatthesevictims\nand those who march with them are\ngenuinely against all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, including\nnuclear weapons that the US has\nunrepentantly used in Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki and the chemical\nweapons the US allowed Saddam\u2019s\nregime to use against Iran.\nIran\u2019s President Ahmadinejad is\nreported as having said that Israel\nshould be \u2018wiped off the map\u2019 and\norganised a conference for holo-caust-deniers. Is Israel right to feel\nan existential threat from Iran?\nIt is a myth that Ahmadinejad has\never said that Israel should be\n\u201cwiped off the map\u201d. This myth was\ncreated first by a mistranslation of\nthe statement Ahmadinejad made\nand later by its deliberate distor-tion. What he actually said in October 2005 is that \u201cThe Zionist occupying regime of Jerusalem should\ncease to exist in the page of time\u201d.\nHe has also specifically said in very\nclear terms that \u201cIsrael should go\nthrough a regime change in the\nsame way that the Soviet Union\nwent through a regime change.\u201d\nThe Soviet Union of course went\nthrough a bloodless regime change.\nAyatollah Khamenei, who has the\nfinal say on any major state and foreign matter, issued a statement after the mistranslation of Ahmadinejad saying that Iran has not and will\nnot threaten any country but that\nit will defend itself against any ag-gression. Of course none of this is\never really reported in the Western\nmedia.\nIn contrast to Khamenei\u2019s statement that rules out any threat by\nIran against other countries, the\nIsraeli and US leaders have not just\ncalled for a regime change in Iran\nbut have publicly threatened, in violation of the UN charter, to launch\nan air assault on Iran and have been\nactively planning a regime change\nby covert military operations inside\nIran to foment ethnic violence and\nunrest in the country.\nIt was foolish to organise the\nHolocaust conference in Tehran; it\nplayed right into the hands of warmongers in Israel and Washington.\nHowever its objective was not to\ndeny the Holocaust but to investigate how it has been abused to\njustify the atrocities committed by\nIsrael against Palestinian people.\nI am a critic of the Iranian government in terms of its records on human rights, democratic rights and\nits existing laws and treatment of\nwomen, ethnic and religious minor-ities. However, Iran is home to one\nof the oldest Jewish communities\nin the world and the largest Jewish\ncommunity in the Middle East outside of Israel, who continue to live\nin peace with the majority Muslim\npopulation and have their own religious establishment, synagogues\nand members of Parliament.\nFurthermore, Iran has not invaded or threatened any country for\nover 250 years. The same cannot be\nsaid about the US, the UK and Israel who in the past half of a century\nalone have waged numerous wars\nof aggression and occupation.\nAnother fact hardly ever reported\nin the West is that, in 2003, with the\napproval of Ayatollah Khamenei,\nIran made a major overture to the\nUS in which she pledged a de facto\nrecognition of the State of Israel\nand an end to any material support\nto Hamas and Hezbollah, in exchange for security guarantees and\nlifting of US sanctions against Iran.\nThe US, having just invaded Iraq\nand hoping for a regime change in\nIran as well, dismissed the overture\nimmediately and reprimanded the\nSwiss Government for passing the\nIranian offer to Washington.\nThus the threat is not from Iran\nagainst Israel but from Israel and\nthe US against Iran.\nIsrael has always been its own\nmain enemy, creating the existential threat against itself. By ethnic\ncleansing of Palestinians, by wars of\naggression against its neighbours,\nOscar Dahlsten\nA familiar face and familiar red backdrop, Imperial\u2019s Prof. Abbas\nEdalat. Visit http://www.campaigniran.org/ for more information\nA campaigner against military intervention in Iran\nby violating over 60 UN resolutions\nand above all by its forty-year illegal occupation of Palestinian land,\nIsrael has laid the foundation of its\nown insecurity. This self-imposed\nexistential threat will certainly increase massively if Israel commits\nthe folly of launching a military\nattack on Iran and can only end if\nIsrael ends its illegal occupation\nof Palestine and reverses its racist\npolicy of ethnic cleansing.\nThe Director General of the IAEA\n(International Atomic Energy\nAgency) says that Iran is not fully\ncomplying with a recent UN Security Council resolution. Why is Iran\nnot doing that?\nIran is exercising its legitimate\nrights under the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) to enrich uranium\nup to 3 percent grade for a fuel cycle used in generating electricity,\nwhich is far short of the 90 percent\nenriched uranium required for a\nnuclear bomb. Iran considers the\nUN Security Council Resolution\n1737 requiring Iran to halt its enrichment programme as illegitimate since there is no of evidence\nfor a nuclear weapons programme\nin the country.\nIran is put on trial because of the\nsuspicions of some Western leaders about the intentions of Iranian\nleadership. The US is asking Iran\nto prove a negative, that it does not\nintend to develop nuclear weapons,\nand for the US \u201cabsence of evidence\nis not evidence of absence\u201d.\nWithout any evidence of a nuclear\nweapons programme, the referral\nof Iran\u2019s nuclear file from the IAEA\nto the Security Council was politi-Felix interviews Imperial\u2019s Abbas Edalat, campaigner against sanctions and military intervention in Iran\nThe truth is\nthat Iran\u2019s oil\nresources are\ndepleting fast\n\n"

Mr Sinclair, who had his name changed on\nthe ballot to \u2018Felix\u2019 as this is apparently his nickname, picked up 367\nvotes, only 100 votes less than\nMiss Lines and Mr Roberts re-ceived. In the first round of\nvoting, the two well-known\nFelix names were separated by only 19 votes.\nHowever, after redistribution of votes for\nMr Sinclair, Mr Roberts was elected with 625 votes, having picked\nup more second preference votes\nthan Miss Lines (who received 576\nvotes).\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) was contested by a \u2018clubs veteran\u2019, Alistair Cott, and a member\nof the Slate, Alexander Balikhin.\nThe experienced Mr Cott won\nwith 687 votes compared to Mr Balikhan\u2019s 300, despite Mr Cott\u2019s lack\nof campaigning.\nFour candidates stood for Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services), including a Slate member, an ex-Wye\nPresident, and a relative outsider.\nAnthony Calder, dogged by accusa-The student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,376 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n9 March 2007 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\npage\npage\nFarce, free sweets and late results; this year\u2019s elections are finally over, and here are your new sabbaticals\nYour next Union President, Steve McQueen Brown\ntions that an event that took place\nwhile he was President lost more\nthan \u00a325,000 (despite protestations\nthat it was not his fault), struggled\ninto last place with 140 votes.

There is no doubt that they have been\nslightly more farcical than usual and everybody, including\nme, is in some way responsible for this. I think it is fair to\npoint out that the unusually large number of candidates\nwho stood for election this year vastly increased the\nprobability of something going wrong!\nIt is important to understand that the democratic\nstructures of the Union allow for any member to complain\nabout how elections are conducted. I understand that the\nelections committee have faced an unprecedented number\nof complaints this year from a variety of people and I am\nsure that have dealt with them as fast as possible. Election\nresults cannot be announced until every complaint has\nbeen resolved and this is why the President\u02bcs election result\nhas been delayed by nearly a week.

    "content": "Clint\u2019s project that really delivers\nHis name may not have been in the envelope come Oscar night, but Clint still handles Letters with skill\nI\u2019m not a fan of Clint Eastwood. For\none of the most revered directors of\nthe past decade or so, I generally\nfind he has very little to say with\nhis films. I slept through Mystic\nRiver the first time I tried it and\nMillion Dollar Baby made me want\nto scratch my corneas off. It seems\nthat Clint\u2019s method (and it seems\nto be admired critically) is to drain\nhappiness from the audience but\nwithout any real motive and little\ncomment by way of a theme. Hence\nI was reluctant to see this but figured I\u2019d give Clint a reprieve. And\nwhether it be fluke or divine inter-vention, it seems he\u2019s done alright.\nThis is the companion piece to\nhis Christmas release, Flags of Our\nFathers, a film about the American\nlandings on the Japanese island of\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nIwo Jima during World War II that\ndisappeared from cinemas in under\na fortnight. This is essentially the\nsame story but while Flags told the\nstory from the view of the American\nside, this tells the Japanese story.\nLetters From Iwo Jima follows several soldiers of different ranks of\nthe Japanese army as they prepare\nthe island for the American inva-sion, all the time sensing they are\ngoing to their death.\nFor someone who I always viewed\nas lacking in artistic integrity and a\nfilmmaker who made films to win\nOscars and for that reason alone,\nthis double bill seems to be a piece\ncloser to his heart. Clint sets out to\nhave his say on the current warring\nstate of the world by showing how\nconflict affects everyone involved.\nThere are no absolute enemies and\nwar is simply a conflict of beliefs,\nhe wants to say, and you\u2019d be hard\npushed to miss it with a subtlety\njust slightly more deft than Crash.\nIt\u2019s an interesting perspective\nfor someone of an older generation\n(tolerance doesn\u2019t always come so\neasily to those who lived through\nthe old wars) but today seems to\nbe on most minds. The war on Iraq\nhas served to make people think\nabout the need for conflict and the\nunfortunate people caught up on\nBest of the rest: What\u2019s worth the ticket price?\nGiven that we\u2019ve been sadly missing film reviews for the past few\nweeks, we understand that we have\nleft you, the trusty Felix reader,\ncompletely unaware of what is on\nout there. Without knowing what\u2019s\ngood, without knowing what everyone\u2019s talking about and without\nknowing what is actually worth your\nstudent loan. But put your fears to\none side now, as here\u2019s a low-down\non some of the offerings to get yourself along to and give that revision a\nmiss for another couple of hours, as\nwell as a couple to avoid.\nFirst up, The Good Shepherd.\nNot so good. This is the incredibly\nlong new film from Robert De Niro,\nhis third foray into directing, and\nis a piece that has definite echoes\nof The Godfather. This influence\nseems to be quite natural for De\nNiro who won an acting Oscar for\nhis part in the sequel, but The Good\nShepherd seems to do the opposite\nto what made The Godfather so\ninteresting.\nboth sides, so does Clint\u2019s message\ncome across as revolutionary?\nWell, no. But the film is his best\nI\u2019ve seen so far and the impending doom of the piece is foreshadowed in every frame of Letters. It\u2019s\nrefreshing to see a film that isn\u2019t\nsaluting the Star Spangled Banner\nthroughout and although I missed\nFlags when it was released, the image I got of it was more one of anguish on the part of the soldiers, not\npride at defeating the Japanese. It\nseems America has entered the age\nof self-reflectivity and can look at\nitself in a more objective way than\nthe air-punching nationalism of Independence Day or Armaggedon.\nSounds like progress to me.\nSo is the film any good? Yes. Clint\nis a dab hand with a camera and it\u2019s\ninteresting to watch the characters\ndevelop through the letters of the title and careful exposition through-out. There\u2019s lots of blood thrown in\nthere for good measure and the focus is definitely on the humanity of\nwar, not the insanity of it that films\nof Vietnam seized on (think Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket). The\nCGI landing itself means it lacks\nthe realist impact of, say, Saving\nPrivate Ryan but is necessary for\nthe scale of the attack.\nThe characters are the most important part here though as without them the whole meaning of\nthe piece collapses, and the view\nthrough the eyes of a young baker,\nsummoned to war away from his\nwife and unborn child, proves to be\nthe most arresting despite seeming\na tiny bit contrived.\nAltogether, it\u2019s dubious how this\nwill stand up against the great\ncollection of war films out there\nalready, and either we believe we\nhave seen all the atrocities before\nor we accept that we\u2019ll never have a\ntrue picture of life on the front line.\nHow much this adds to the mix is\ndebatable, but don\u2019t write it off as\nhollow Eastwood Oscar fodder.\nThat\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t, but it\ndoesn\u2019t tick the same obvious boxes\nas the others. Maybe that explains\nthe Scorsese sweep this year.\n\u201cClint, if you make us watch Million Dollar Baby one more time \u2026\u201d\nLetters From \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nIwo Jima\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\nWriter: Iris Yamashita\nCast: Ken Watanabe,\nKazunari Ninomiya,\nTsuyoshi Ihara\nBanjo Kennedy By this I mean the way in which\nit portrayed organised crime as\nrunning in an identical manner to\na business organisation. What this\nfilm does is to show the early CIA as\noperating in much the same way as\norganised crime, a brutal tale that\nasks how far are you willing to go\nfor something.\nIf only they\u2019d asked it faster. Instead there are almost three hours\nof political debate, punctuated with\nscenes of domestic hell between\nMatt Damon as the young CIA operative and Angelina Jolie, his wife.\nThese moments come as a welcome break from the political onslaught that permeates everything\nelse, and everything seems more\ndragged out so that De Niro could\nwedge in more characters to be\nplayed by an arsenal of thesps and\naward nominees.\nThis name grabbing only serves\nthe film badly, despite their good\nperformances, as it never totals the\nsum of its parts.\nMuch better is The Last King\nof Scotland, which is still playing\nin a cinema near you. This would\nrun and run if it were theatre, and\nrightly so. With performances to\nscare and endear you simultane-ously, moments that sicken and\namuse you and a story of misplaced\npower and hope that resonates in\nwhatever era, this is high quality\ncinema.\nJames McAvoy shows that young\nBritish talent doesn\u2019t mean Keira\nKnightley and seems to be hot\nproperty at the moment, in cinemas again this week with Becoming Jane. Let\u2019s hope he gets back\nto edgier things like this in the near\nfuture, however.\nMost people I know have seen it\non word of mouth due to a lack of\ncoverage in awards ceremonies\n(besides Forest Whitaker) which\nI feel is inexplicable. Try it and it\nmay prove to be the sleeper hit that\nyou\u2019ve been waiting for under all\nthe overhyped rubbish around.\nOne film that may have escaped\nattention by not being advertised\nto saturation point is Orchestra\nSeats, an easy going French offering that has a lot of heart but\nnot much else. It\u2019s sweet enough,\ncentring on a young girl whose life\nweaves around three other characters who work in different art fields\nbut all feel slightly unfulfilled.\nIt\u2019s interesting and has a light\ntone that would be suited to a lazy\nSunday afternoon, so this may be\nan option if you don\u2019t fancy the involved politics of the previous two\noptions here.\nMusic and Lyrics is the other\npiece of the puzzle here so that\nhopefully there\u2019s something for\neveryone. Well, at least there would\nbe if this one had something good\nto offer up.\nAs far as chick flicks go, you pretty much know what your getting\nwhen Hugh Grant comes on the\npackaging. Sadly, here the joke just\nseemed to be wearing a bit thin and\nhe didn\u2019t have the spark that made\nhim so popular in the 90s.\nThe plot basically sees him struggling to find lyrics for some music\nhe\u2019s written and it just so happens\nDrew Barrymore can do that with\nease. Phew, otherwise we might\nrun low on story here \u2026\nFor a film called Music and Lyrics, the music doesn\u2019t make you\nwant to throw down your handbag\nand dance around it ladies, and\nthere are times when it just drags\non and on until you wish you were\nwatching MTV so you could change\nchannel.\nThis was never going to be Citizen\nKane though; it\u2019s meant to be fun.\nSadly, the comedy aspect, whilst\nproviding a few laughs, seemed to\nhave gone AWOL for the majority,\nmeaning the \u201crom\u201d was left sans\n\u201ccom\u201d. Not really one for the DVD\ncollection, but there\u2019s plenty to talk\n(i.e. complain) about afterwards if\nyou want a suitable, low-IQ, first-date movie.\nOther than these, be sure to\ncheck out previously reviewed fare\nsuch as Notes on a Scandal and\nThe Queen that are still bouncing around. And if none of those fit\nyour personal tastes, then hopefully\nthere will be something more for\nyou next week. Miserable gits.\nAngelina taunts a class geek; Cecile de France loses \u201cGuess the City\u201d; Forest wears this season\u2019s must-have: tartan and khaki; Hugh stammers through Drew\u2019s touchy feely crap\n15\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix\nFriday 9 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPhantasy Star \u2013 Way before WoW\nYou think 70 is impressive? Robin Andrews was hitting level caps while you were figuring out WASD\nH\now do you kill that\nwhich has no life?\u201d\nasks a terrified technician working at Blizzard Entertainment.\nApparently someone has been playing World of Warcraft for so long\nthat they have levelled up beyond\nthe boundaries of the game; as a re-sult, this could very well be the End\nof the World of Warcraft.\nDon\u2019t panic. Whereas this scenario has been lifted from an episode\nSouth Park, this is probably never\ngoing to happen; but it does show\njust how much the \u201conline phenomenon\u201d has infected pop culture\n\u2013 played by as many people in the\nworld as live in Switzerland.\nHowever, long before Azeroth\nwas created, aeons before the first\nonline character levelled up for the\nfirst time, there was another online\nworld which became the foundation\nof all MMORPGs that exist today.\nFor anyone who\u2019s ever mashed\nthe A-button to cut down hordes of\nflying robots, fired a shot into a poor\nlittle Rappy or electrocuted the\nmighty Dark Falz with a Razonde\nyou will know what I\u2019m talking\nabout. Phantasy Star had returned\nto the (then) new generation of\ngaming consoles, but with something decidedly different from the\nusual role-playing fare.\nConsole gamers were promised\nwith a persistent, constantly-evolv-ing world with thousands of players\nfrom all around the world at any\ntime participating. Although this\nwas not the first game to have the\ncapability to do so, it is indubitably the game that has provided the\ntemplate for many of the epic sub-scriber-rich games one can play to-day. Phantasy Star Online was unleashed upon the world \u2013 literally.\nI remember my first experience\nof this strange new type of game:\nincredibly excited by the prospect\nof an epic role-playing game online,\nand being a true console gamer\nthrough and through, I rushed out\nto buy my copy and encouraged everyone I knew who could pick up a\ncontroller to do so.\nI started off as a meek Hunter,\nor HUmar (a human close-combat\nspecialist),andafterfollowingmuch\nhigher level \u2013 and mostly Japanese\n\u2013 avatars around the game, I started to level up, despite being repeatedly crushed under the feet of the\nworld\u2019s multiple bosses. Eventually\nI had grasped the idea of forming\na party of online gamers that I got\nto \u201cknow\u201d through the pre-voice\nchat text messaging system, which\nfrequently littered the screen with\ncomments ranging from \u201cWatch\nout for the Delseban horde!\u201d to the\nless-helpful \u201cOMG u r teh n00b.\nWHY DIDN\u2019T U HEAL!!!\u201d Amusingly the text system attempted to\nreduce the level of swearing and\ncursing to such an extremely\nsensitive degree the word Saturday appeared as Sa****ay.\nThe real-time combat and levelling up principle was simple\neven back in 2000, but fighting\nalongside other people rather\nthan non-player characters\nproved far more exciting and\ninteresting. The levels were\nlinear and the enemy AI was\nvery predictable but the\nsheer range of weapons,\nrare items, and enemies\nthemselves meant that\nthis game stood out in\nthe bland old guard\nof shoot-em-ups and\nracers.\nThere are four aspects of this game\nwhichformemade\nit one of the most\nmemorable to\nplay and something which all\ngame devel-opersaspired\nto recreate.\nThe first is\nthat scary,\nshaky\ntime you\ncome\nacross the game\u2019s final\nbosses, either Dark Falz or\nOlga Flow. Usually this happens when you are a very\nlow level character being\nprotected by other, much\nhigher level babysitters.\nYou seem to stand there in\namazement at this enormous creature you would\nnever have been able to\nreach on your own, watching helplessly as it takes\ncheap shots at you and\nultimately requires your\nguardians to repeatedly\nheal you or just ignore you.\nWhen you come back to this\nincarnation of pure, gaming\nevil much later in the game with\nfar more experience, it is incredibly\nsatisfying to take it out yourself.\nOnly in an online role-playing situation could you attempt at taking\ndown a final boss just as you have\nstarted the game, giving you an\ninsight as to how far you have yet\nto progress.\nThe second aspect is undoubtedly the obsession with finding rare\nitems. Personally, I spent many\na day, night and groggy morning\ngrinding the virtual world with other equally-dedicated button mashers trawling through dungeons and\ndefeating creatures on ridiculously\nhigh levels in order to obtain a sin-gle, incredibly rare weapon. Even\nafter this weapon was found I was\ntold of another, even more powerful item that I may be interested in\nby a level 200 veteran of the game,\na player who had yet to find it him-self. The days of the week blurred\ninto one very rapidly: you just had\nto be the best; there was no question about it.\nThenthere\u2019stheslow,steady,painful transition from crawling to walk-ing, as it were. When you became\nstrong and co-ordinated enough to\nactually command a party of Hunters and take on the game\u2019s more\ndifficult regions, it brought with it\nan overwhelming sense of achieve-ment: what seemed like years ago\nyou were nothing. Now you have finally evolved into a grown newbie.\nThere was still, clearly, a long way\nleft to go before you would see everything PSO had to offer.\nBut the prime reason for playing this revolution in role-playing\ngames has to be the community\naspect of it. Not only could you talk\nto people as happy to spend a large\nportion of their life in a non-existent\nreality as you, but the whole idea of\nhaving a player economy for selling\nand trading items, the brilliant lobby system, and the constantly evolving world gave you every reason to\nlog on every time you sat in front of\nyour television \u2013 the MMO \u2018X-Factor\u2019 that makes it money today.\nUnbelievably, it\u2019s true: there was\na game released prior to WoW\nwhich ruined as many gamers\u2019 social life as it has. The game simply\nhad to many levels to achieve, too\nmany secrets to hunt down, and\ntoo many personalities to slash and\nhack through the hordes of enemies\nwith. Even the little robot, your own\npersonal MAG, which you had hovering behind you throughout the\ngame proved to be a source of addiction in itself: it could level up,\narm itself and even enhance your\nown abilities.\nPhantasy Star Online\u2019s servers\nare to go offline after seven years\nof providing many gamers with\nthe fantasy world prior to which\nthey could only dream of. All of the\nabove reasons of why this game is\nso legendary are the core aspects\nof any modern MMORPG, and PSO\ndeserves to be praised.\nIf you are the type of gamer who\nlooks back on this game with a distinct feeling of nostalgia, (in other\nwords refer to money as Meseta\nand believe that a Rappy bears a\nstriking resemblance to your pet\ncanary), the next time you see your\nneighbour stumble into his room after another WoW-induced sleepless\nnight, you can safely claim that you\nwere there from the beginning.\n\n"

    "content": "Jazz and rock. And blues. And\nmetal. And folk, indie, alt., acous-tic, punk... The list goes on. But it\ndoesn\u2019t make a very snappy name.\nProbably why our founding fathers\nin their infinite wisdom shortened\nit to Jazz and Rock. And hence\nprompting the timeless question:\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like jazz or rock?\u201d\nSo first off, let me assuage your\nfears; any musical style is welcome\nhere. No really, it is. So there. We\nrun a well-equipped practice room\nin the west wing basement of the\nUnion, cheap as hell and available\nto all our members, and we also\nregularly hold gig and jam nights\nin dB\u2019s.\nOur gig nights are all about giving\ntalent from Imperial (and sometimes further a field) a chance to\nget out there and play, any style\nand any level of previous live experience are usually welcome. Our\njam nights are, somewhat more\nrelaxed. Whether you want to do\ncovers (Hey Joe and Master of Puppets are usually mandatory at some\npoint), a 15 minute 12 bar blues jam,\nor even a solo acoustic set, all you\nneed do is bring down an instrument (be it guitar, violin, saxophone\nor pizza box, yes, I said pizza box),\nand make some noise and have\nsome fun.\nWe recently held Friday Night\nLive, one of our larger termly\nevents. Five great bands took to\nthe stage of dB\u2019s \u2018til late, with drink\naplenty, helped what turned out to\nbe a great night with an excellent\natmosphere. First to the stage was\nthe funk-rock of Reality Cheques,\nand they were followed by the\ncrushing heaviness of Death Penalty (No one survives \u00a92007), who,\nastonishingly didn\u2019t empty the room\nand even managed to get a mosh pit\ngoing! Twice!\nNext up came the soulful styling\nof Luca Laraia who held an absolutely packed DB\u2019s rapt for his 35\nminutes on stage. He was followed\nby the only non-Imperial band of the\nnight, the up and coming melodic\nrockers Cato Street Conspiracy, a\nname which you should certainly\nbe on the look out for in the future.\nTo close the night were our very\nown blues rockers, White Elephant,\nstalwarts of Jazz and Rock, supplying their own share of cool for the\nevening.\nLast Tuesday, 6th of March, we\nhad our, ahem, \u2018Varsity\u2019 Rock Off,\nwhich you may note came the night\nbefore a certain college event, from\nwhich we have in no way borrowed\na name from for reasons of publicity.\nAnyway, we pitted two medic bands,\nbeing Honour Amongst Thieves\nand Dirty Frank, against two of\ntheir non-medic counterparts,\nDeath Penalty and White Elephant,\nin a battle to find who rocked the\nhardest, fastest, and most. [Editor\n\u2013 from the over enthusiastic gesticulations of one of my house mates I\ncan only assume they managed to\nat least please the crowds.]\nClash of the Century\nSaturday 10th March,\n6.45pm \u2013 2am\ndB\u2019s, ICU, \u00a33 entry\nOur other big event this term is\nour way of celebrating the college\ncentenary Jazz and Rock style. It\u2019s\non March 10th and we\u2019ve called it\n\u2018Clash of the Century\u2019, and it is basically a battle of the bands equivalent of the Royal Rumble. Almost 20\nbands will take to the stage over the\ncourse of the night. Some old hands\nwhom you\u2019ve seen before and whom\nwe\u2019ve mentioned earlier, no doubt,\nand some new faces, all vying for\nthe title of Imperial\u2019s greatest band.\nThe battle lines are well and truly\ndrawn, so come on down, pick your\nside and get ready to make some\nnoise, as we try our hardest to rock\nthe Union to its very core.\nSo much more than just jazz and rock. Grown men gently weeping into microphones too\nClash of the Century with J\u2019n\u2019R\nAs many of you will know, the second annual Ethical Careers Exhibition took place in the Great Hall last\nWednesday. The idea was to showcase careers that lead to something\nmore than just a decent salary and\na company car, focussing on careers\nthat make a positive difference to\nthe world.\nCompanies included Transport\nfor London, the energy consultancy\nESD, and PowerPerfector, makers\nof energy efficient technology, to\nname just a few. There were also\nrepresentatives from student societies such as Engineers Without\nBorders, with free tea and coffee samples provided by Imperial\nFairtrade.\nThe usual stalls and freebies were\nsupplemented by a series of seminars ranging from the potential of\nfuel cell technology to opportunities for volunteering in India and\nEnthusiasm for Ethical Careers Exhibition\nSean Richardson\n24 felix Friday 9 March 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nturning an entire village \u2018carbon\nneutral\u2019.\nAlthough the turnout was smaller\nthan last year, and the stalls were\nfewer, the atmosphere was great.\nA lot of the recruiters commented\non how interested and interesting\nImperial students were. Apparently we came across as enthusi-astic, thoughtful and well prepared,\nwhich is encouraging to hear.\nI was personally pretty amazed at\nhow many people came to the semi-nars, since half an hour at lunch\ntime is a valuable thing. It was\nworthwhile to many, though; two\nquantum physicists who attended\nthe talk on Finding an Ethical career in Science, Design and Technology told me \u2018We both didn\u2019t like\nthe ordinary careers fair with British Petroleum and the Ministry of\nDefence.\u2019 For them, like many oth-ers, ethics is paramount in career\nchoice.\nHowever, for some Imperial stu-dents, choosing a career is about\nbalancing priorities. Most of us care\nabout sustainability and social jus-tice, but for many this fades into insignificance in the face of the pressure to find a job \u2013 any job \u2013 that will\npay the bills.\nA student from the Engineers\nWithout Borders stand admitted to\nme that she has a job lined up from\na year in industry scheme she did\nin her gap year before university,\nbefore she had come to care about\nethics. Now her ideas have changed\n\u2013 but she\u2019s still taking the job, without checking on the company\u2019s\nethical record. It\u2019s just too time-consuming for a final-year student\nto go job-hunting.\nFreya Summersgill\nThat is why the Ethical Careers\nExhibition is so important. There\nare plenty of companies out there\ndoing exciting, worthwhile work,\n(some of them pay pretty well too),\nand they all want to recruit dedicated graduates with a fabulous\nscience education. If you wander\nthrough a room filled with those\ncompaniesyou\u2019reboundtocomeout\nwith a dozen possibilities that you\u2019d\nnever have considered before.\nSo support our Ethical Careers\nExhibition! This year it was organised by students for students, and\nsome people worked very hard and\nput in a lot of time to make it hap-pen. Now, because of the event\u2019s\nsuccess, the Union staff might be\nlending a hand, but we still need\nvolunteers to make the 2008 event\nbigger, better and more useful, to\nhelp more of us find the job we really want, not the one we\u2019re settling\nfor.\nSo, if you are interested in helping\nout next year, please email us at\nethicalcareersexhibtion@imperial.\nac.uk\nEnvSoc actively saving the planet\nAn array of stalls at the Ethical Careers Exhibiton\n\n"

Having spent the\npast few only playing in the Central\nLondon league, it was finally time\nfor us to get back into the midst of\ninter-university table tennis.\nArmed this year with the strongest squad to date, six of us were sent\nto Nottingham to represent IC in 4\ncategories - men\u2019s singles, men\u2019s\ndoubles, women\u2019s singles and women\u2019s doubles. The tournament was\na 2-day event with the preliminaries on Saturday while on Sunday;\nthe finals of all these events were\nplayed. Upon arrival at the sports\nhall, the sight of 18 playing tables\nwas indeed impressive and daunting at the same time. To challenge\nwith the very best of universities in\nthe country is something new to us.\nSince it was our first entry, we did\nnot set ourselves any targets but\nvowed to play our very best for the\ncollege.\nWe soon got under way and both\nour pairs in the men\u2019s doubles\nmade it to the second round where\nit turned into another Imperial vs.\nCambridge affair when we were\ndrawn with \u2018those guys again\u2019. Cambridge currently sits on top of the\ntable in the premier division of the\nBUSA league and it seemed that\nthey wanted us to know that as they\nended our interest in this event.\nAnusha and Nan as our sole representatives in the women\u2019s doubles put in an impressive display of\ntable tennis and looked unstoppable\non their way to the semi-final to win\nus our first medals of the tourna-ment. They went out at this stage to\neventual winners Embling/Brown\nof Essex.\nIn the men\u2019s singles event, Ko\nChi and Wei Lun faced some pretty\ntough opposition in their preliminary groups and were unlucky not\nto qualify. Serkan and I fared better\nand made it through qualifying to\nthe knockout stages where I went\nout to Cambridge\u2019s Stanley Zhang.\nSerkan made it to the second round\nand was unlucky to face the number\n1 seed Adam Bleakley so early on\nand went out in the last 32.\nFocus then turned to the women\u2019s singles. First up was Anusha\nwho finished second in her preliminary group. We could have wished\nfor a better draw when she came\nthrough another preliminary match\nto set up a meeting with number 1\nseed Egle Adomelyte in the knockout stages where she lost in three\nclose sets. Nan had to play number\n2 seed Abigail Embling in her first\ngroup and while leading 2-1 in sets,\nwas on the verge of a huge upset\nwhen Embling staged a comeback\nto take the final two sets. Nan lost\nanother close match 3-1 and this\nplaced her third in the group.\nOur last chance for some medals was in the plate. Only Wei Lun\nand Nan entered this event and we\ncame so close to making it a double.\nWei Lun fell at the semi-final stage\nto Jade Blasse of Middlesex. Nan\nlooked invincible on her way to the\nfinal where she blew away Penelope Sawa of Southampton to add\nsome more silverware to our cabinet in Ethos.\nIt was unlucky that some of us\nhad been drawn against the top\nseeds very early in the competition,\nbut we left feeling satisfied with our\nperformances and commitment.\nMoreover, we had managed to win\nsilverware in our very first attempt.\nAlthough there is still a difference\nin technical skills between the best\nplayers and us, there is plenty of\nroom for us to improve for next\nseason.\nIn contrast to the lack of training\nfacilities in previous seasons, the\npresence of complete facilities at\nEthos will benefit us greatly in the\nfuture. In addition, we would like to\nthank Sport Imperial for their kind\nsponsorship and continued support\nfor the team. We are looking forward to next season as we prepare\nto enter the BUSA leagues and will\nreturn to the championships next\nyear hoping to bring back some\nmore trophies!\nClockwise from top: William Do, Anusha Seneviratne, Wei Lun Wong, Nan Luan, Ko Chi Cheung and\nSerkan Karaagac line up; Nan Luan collects her prize as singles winner; Serkan Karaagac gets ready\nThis year has seen the start of the\nULU mixed lacrosse cup following\nthe growing competitiveness of the\nleague involving teams from across\nthe London universities.\nWith seven teams entering the\ncup, and the added incentive of being the first winners of this compe-tition, enthusiasm and determination were high. IC lacrosse were\ndrawn with a very tough first round\nmatch against Royal Holloway 1sts\nwho are currently sitting at the top\nof the league.\nAfter a valiant team effort they\narose triumphant (8-4) after a hard\nfought match. Everybody played\nan excellent game and man of the\nmatch went to Sam Jayaweera for\nsome outstanding work at the back\nin defence.\nThe second round opponents\nwere huge rivals King\u2019s and this\nwas to be played on the weekend\nof the medics Rag Dash. So with a\nnew look team we went apprehensively to Honor Oak Park to face a\nvery strong opposition.\nIC played some fantastic lacrosse,\nwith some very attacking and also\nexcellent defensive play, deservedly ended up 4-3 winners. Man of the\nmatch went to Hamish Dickson this\ntime for his impressive Goalkeeping throughout the match which\nsaved us on occasion from losing\nthe tight lead.\nThe Cup final was held last Sunday against Barts and the London.\nIC were unstoppable and this match\nhighlighted the improvement of the\nteam over the season as we ran\naway with a 16-1 win.\nThe team played some beautiful\nlacrosse and also battled hard despite difficult conditions and were\nduly rewarded with goals. Man of\nthe Match went to Chris Allen for\nhis tally of goals he notched up!\nI would just like to thank everyone\nwho has played in these fixtures, it\nhas been a real club achievement to\nget this cup and represents a lot of\nhard work throughout the season.\nWe can look forward to retaining\nthe silver next year!\nMixed Lacrosse team\u2019s cup run ends in silverware\nLacrosse Cup Final\nIC Mixed 1st XI 16\nSt. Barts 1st XI 0\nCharlotte Boughton\nWilliam Do\nButterflyCatchingSoc didn\u2019t manage to catch much in the open field\n\n"

You can't talk on\nthe tube, but while not talking on\nthe tube, you can wear whatever\nthe fuck you want.\nSome people may think fashion is\na frivolous affair, perhaps they think\nthere are more pressing concerns\nin life. However, in this slothful,\nindividualistic age, fashion is actually a useful way to burn money and\nperpetuate the consumerist cycle.\nOh, I may joke about the pointlessness of fashion, but imagine a world\nwithout it. We might as well walk\naround blind to the beauty of the\nworld. Everybody has the potential\nto realise their own personal style.\nExpress yourself and spread your\nfashion memes around the world.\nThat said, some people need some\ntips to hone their style. You can call\nthese people... students who go to\nImperial. Joke! Not really.\nTips for acheiving style nirvana:\nStick to your style. Once you've\ndefined your look, don't buy anything thing not prescribing to it.\nThis requires a degree of fashion\nwill-power. No matter what a find it\nis, if it doesn't go with all the other\nclothes in your wardrobe, it is a\nwaste of money. You will never wear\nit. Only celebrities can buy anything\nthey set their cold, dead eyes on,\nbecause they have too much money\nto burn.\nLindsay Ho-han may have a\nwardrobe as big as my apartment,\nbut her style is also disposable.\nWhat happened to the great fashion icons like Audrey Hepburn who\nkept a signature look throughout\ntheir careers? That is what to aspire towards.\nDon't buy items in multiple col-ours. The more of an item you have,\nthe less exciting it is to wear. Like\neverything in life, if you have too\nmuch of something, you begin to\nfeel passive-aggressive towards it.\nThink of opportunity cost (an excellent fashion philosophy) two different tops is better than the same top\nin two colours.\nBuy colours that complement\nyour skintone. Don't bother with\nAutumn, Winter bullshit, it's much\neasier than that. Look in the mirror.\nIf your skin tone looks washed out,\nthen that colour doesn't suit you,\nyou must never buy anything in that\ncolour again. Alternatively stop using alcohol as a social crutch, and\neat something with more nutritional value than toast.\nDon't follow trends too closely.\nNot all trends fit all body shapes\nso don't follow fashion slavishly. My\neyes are still recovering from the\nhorror of the cropped top trend of\nVictoria Beckham, a definite lack\nof personal style\nLindsay Lohan, souless style\nRussell Brand, 'xciting!\nAudrey Hepburn, timeless\nAndre 3000, hey ya! Rachel Bilson, woof woof\nThe Love London fashion show,\norganised by students of Imperial\nCollege London, incorporates a\nwide variety of stunning clothing\nandcurrententhusiasmaboutour\ncity. The event will take place on\nTuesday 20th of March at 'Ham-mersmith Palais', which is located on Shepherd\u2019s Bush Road,\nLondon, W6. 'Hammersmith Palais de Danse' was opened in 1919,\nmaking it one of the oldest venues in London, complementing\nthe selected theme perfectly.\nThis is a fundraising event with\nthe chosen charity being Demelza House, an organisation providing hospice care for over 450 children with life-limiting illnesses\nand their families, across Kent,\nEast Sussex and South London.\nThese children are not expected\nto reach their 19th birthday, due\nto their incurable illnesses. As\nwell as providing hospice care,\nDemelza provide hospice care\nat homes, planned short breaks,\nemergency respites, therapies,\nsymptom control, end of life care\nand bereavement support. It is vital that these children receive the\ncare and support they deserve in\norder to ensure they are comfortable as their conditions worsen.\nTheir website can be found at\nwww.demelzahouse.org.\nLove London's aim is to raise\nan excess of \u00a38,000 for this most\nworthwhile cause; exceeding last\nyear\u2019s total from a successful\nouting at Pacha in Victoria, which\nwas held in aid of Chase Hospice.\nPrevious supporters have included Voyage, TM Lewin, Jigsaw,\nGhost, Diesel, Boyd, Zara, LK\nBennett, Space NK, Pepe Jeans,\nCalvin Klein, Urban Outfitters,\nPaul Smith, Question Air and\nLaundry Industry.\nToni and Guy aided Love London with their creative hairstyl-ing expertise, Space NK provided\nthe makeup and Deloitte and\nErnst Young generously sponsored the event. The evening\nachieved coverage in the local\nand national press including Metro, Tatler, The Evening Standard,\nThe Daily Mail, TimeOut London\nand Vogue.\nLove London fashion show\nthe 90's. So many flabby, teenage\nmother, chav guts.\nWearmake-up.ThisisfortheMs.s.\nWearing a bit of mascara doesn't\nundo the suffrage. Use make-up to\nemphasise your good points, but\ndon't paint a new face on.\nWear nice underwear. Throw\naway all underwear which has no\nclassifiable colour or fraying elas-tic. If you wear grey granny pants,\nno matter how awesome the outfit on top, you know the truth. Buy\nyourself happiness with some nice\npants. Aussiebum does the coolest\nguy's underwear (www.aussiebum.\ncom/en). Of course, for women\nthere's always Topshop's 3 for \u00a37.\n(But don't you always get stuck on\nthe third pair?)\nRead fashion magazines for in-spiration. You don't even have to\nbother reading the articles in most\nof them! Just look at the pretty pic-tures. I recommend Pop (although\nthere tends to be a high ratio of flesh\nto actual clothing. Some might say\nthat's a good thing), i-D, Glamour,\nVogue, Vice (www.viceland.com).\nFor more obscure foreign fashion\ntitles, the Waterstones on Charing\nCross road stocks a large selection.\nKnow that not all high street\nbranches are equal. What is stocked\nat each store is up to the store man-ager, some have better selections\nthan others. These are the best high\nstreet branches: Primark, Hammersmith; Topshop, Oxford Circus;\nH&M, 360 Oxford Street; New Look,\n500 Oxford Street; Urban Outfitters, High Street Kensington; Zara,\nKnighstbridge.\nDon't let your outfit down with\nyour choice of shoes. Dorothy Perkins is an unsung hero for decent\nquality, cheap shoes. Office and\nSchuh are the best for cool everyday shoes. Size? on Carnaby Street\nhas the best selection of ridiculously priced, \"limited edition\" trainers.\nBuy individuality at vintage shops.\nThere's practically a small village of\nvintage shops around Brick Lane\nand Commercial Street in the East\nEnd. (There's also the fashion market at Spitalfields, Sundays, 9am\n\u2013 5pm). The Seven Dials area in\nCovent Garden is also a good place\nfor vintage shops; you can find Pop\non 6 Monmouth Street.\nThe most important tip; only trust\nyour own opinion. If you like some-thing, then wear it. What really\nmatters is how your clothes make\nyou feel, not other people's opinion\nof them.\n\n"

This year they\u2019re planning to\ntake on a new challenge with West\nSide Story.\nWest Side Story is a modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet, set in\nthe west side of Manhattan. The\nshow depicts the struggle of power\nbetween two rival gangs, the all\nAmerican \u201cJets\u201d and the immigrant\nPuerto Rican \u201cSharks\u201d. As with\nRomeo and Juliet one of the gang\nmembers (the American Tony) falls\nfor a rival gang member\u2019s sister\n(the Puerto Rican Maria) and the\ntwo get caught up in the violent\nstruggle between the two gangs.\nThe music is composed by Leonard\nBernstein and includes the famous\nsongs \u201cMaria\u201d, \u201cAmerica\u201d and\n\u201cTonight\u201d.\nWhen not rehearsing or perform-ing, the cast, band and crew like to\nspend their time having other kinds\nof fun taking on various forms.\nEach performance ends with the\nspeedy removal of stage make-up\nin order to get to the pub as soon as\npossible. Here, apart from drinking\nthe local cider, the \u201cDonkey\u201d award\nis given for the most of obvious mistake of the evening. Then it\u2019s off to\nthe Scout Hut (a place that needs\nto be seen to be believed) for acceptable after hours drinking. Here\nthere are parties, barbecues and,\ndespite the obvious lack of any apparent cleanliness or hygiene in the\nplace, quite a lot of pulling. Once\nout of alcohol or energy everyone\nreturns to the accommodation at\nthe local primary school to indulge\nin literally as much toast as you can\neat (the drinkers among you will\nunderstand the importance of toast\naccess after a heavy night).\nAs well as all this there are plenty\nof other distractions including the\nlocal beach, curry house and more\ntea shops than you can shake a\nfruit scone at. There is also a charity concert followed by a black tie\ndinner on the middle weekend, this\nyear celebrating the society\u2019s 40th\nyear in Devon.\nThe society rehearses throughout the summer term and the first\npart of the summer holidays. The\nTour itself starting with the setup\non Thursday July 26th and finishing\nwith the last night on Saturday 11th\nAugust. As anyone who\u2019s been will\ntell you, Tour is really good fun and\nquite often an unforgettable experi-ence. If you\u2019re interested in being\ninvolved in West Side Story then\nplease come along to our initial\nmeeting at 7.30pm on Monday 12th\nMarch in the Union Dining Hall.\nTaking on the Westside (Story)\n28 felix Friday 9 March 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRob Felstead\nThe stars of Batboy, who can be found semi-naked in last week\u2019s issue\nSmashing dress ma\u2019am\n\n"

    "content": "Love, literature and landscaping\nWith Dramsoc\u2019s latest play, an adaptation of Arcadia, there\u2019s laughs to be had and lessons to be learned\nTom Stoppard\u2019s play Arcadia was\ndescribed as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by\nthe Daily Telegraph when it first\npremiered at the National Theatre in 1993. It is a play that encompasses a vast range of topics, from\npoetry, philosophy and physics to\nlandscape architecture. It\u2019s an ambitious comedy, one that educates\nwhile it entertains \u2013 which made\nputting on this the play a little chal-lenging. How to tackle the highbrow\nissues involved without without\nturning the play into a lecture? God\nknows we already spend enough\ntime listening to academic ramblings during the day to sit through\nNeil Monteiro\nThe Protagonists\nSeptimus Hodge\nTutor to Thomasina, Septimus is\nthe embodiment of the Regency\nplayboy. Confident to the point of\narrogance, his charm and charisma cover a deeply intellectual\ncharacter that feels the loneliness\nin being the sole reasoned man in a\nworld descending into the Romantic madness.\nThomasina Coverly\nChild prodigy and daughter of the\naristocratic Lord and Lady Croom.\nThomasina has an intelligence that\npossibly surpasses that of Septimus but it\u2019s her innocent approach\nto the world that gives her a true insight into the happenings at Sidley\nPark.\nHannah Jarvis\nSuccessful author of \u201cCaro\u201d a biography of Lord Byron\u2019s lover, Caroline Lamb. Hannah is a closet feminist obsessed with the idea of the\nRomantic sham, the period of not\nthinking but feeling.\nBernard Nightingale\nSelf-centred English lecturer who\ncomes to Sidley Park looking for\nfame by proving that Lord Byron\nkilled a man there in a duel. Bernard\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s not willing to let anyone stop him from getting his share of limelight.\nValentine Coverly\nDescendant of the Coverly\u2019s of the\n1800s, Valentine is a churlish mathematician with a quiet cool. Valentine is on hand to explain the workings of God, through maths, to art\u2019s\nacademics. Not that he believes\nin God, but never mind.\nLord Byron\nGeorge Gordon Byron is a central figure in Arcadia although\nhe is never seen or heard from\nonstage. Lord Byron is probably\nthe most famous of British poets\nand is considered the leader of\nthe Romantic movement.\nHis best known works are\n\u201cChilde Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage\u201d\nand \u201cDon Juan\u201d although he is\nmore often associated with the\ncontroversy he caused in the social circles of Regency England.\nHe lived a life of extravagant liv-ing, love affairs, debts and was\nplagued by accusations of incest\nand sodomy. A forerunner to the\nModern artist, really. His lover,\nCaroline Lamb once described\nhim as \u201cmad, bad, and dangerous\nto know.\u201d\nTowards the end of his life, Byron became involved with revolutionaries in continental Europe\nwhen he travelled to Greece to\nfight the turks in the Greek War\nof Independence. He never saw\nany action though and died of flu\nin 1824.\nit all over again in the evening. But\nit turns out Stoppard balances the\nplay almost perfectly.\nArcadia is as much about love\nas it is about literature; there are\nas many lines dedicated to Newton\nas there are given to innuendoes.\nThe result is a play that leaves you\nlaughing, crying and a little inspired\nto go out and learn again. I\u2019ve spent\nso much time on Wikipedia whilst\nrehearsing this play that I found\nmyself reading about the diet of\nthe ancient greeks the other night.\nI might try to slip that in somehow\nbefore the opening night.
