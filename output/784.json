We have been\nexperiencing severe equipment\ndifficulties in the Print Unit: all three\nprinting presses gave up the ghost,\nleaving us with only 1500 finished\ncopies at 9.25am last Friday. As I write this, the new press has just been\ncompletely turned over and hopefully\nfixed. This means, unfortunately, that\nthe waiting list for print jobs is now\nstretching well into December and the\nPrint Unit Manager is worn out and\nready for replacement!\nRag Week\nI realised just how mean and miserly\nsome of you are this week. It was a nice idea to ask for 20p for each small\nad and diary entry, or so I thought,\nbut the number of times people just\nturned around and walked out of the\ndoor when I told them that they'd have to donate to charity this week\nshocked me. 20p is the price of a chocolate bar, a tabloid, or a quarter\nof a pint of beer. This said, I would\nlike to thank everyone who did\ncontribute.\nDebt, Degrees and Damp\nIt was announced at Council this week\nthat College administration are\nexpecting to lose around 500 head\ntenancy places in Hamlet Gardens,\nLexham Gardens and Earls Court\nSquare. On further investigation,\nFELIX discovered that 50 places are\ndefinitely going next year, forcing\nmore students into the private sector.\nIt has to be this year that we make the\ndecision whether to campaign for\nincreased benefits/grants in order to\ncover the rise in the cost of living, poll\ntax, rent increases and such, or to\nresign ourselves to the fact that in\norder to complete our degrees in\nLondon we must find a part-time job,\nfind sponsorship or take out massive\nloans. I can only talk from my own\nsituation: I have one more year of\nPhysics to complete and I am not a sponsored student. My family live on\nthe outskirts of Greater London in a Conservative run borough which will\nonly give me a full grant if I live in\nCollege accommodation. Next year,\nif I don't want to get into debt, I will\nhave to live at home (it takes just over\nVh hours to commute in every\nmorning) and as I will get no\ntravelling expenses, any grant I do\nreceive will go to British Rail and\nLondon Transport. The alternative is\nto drop my degree and find a job. I am confident that I could start at\naround \u00a310,000pa. There would be\nno debt, no rising damp, no exams\nand money in my pocket.

Partly due to a small pitch,\nIC sporadically played disjointed,\nscrappy hockey.' Paul Skipworth\ndictated up front and scored IC's first\ngoal with his revolutionary bobbling\npenalty flick (his total now being 14\ngoals, scoring in all of his 8 games).\nGary Knaresborough added to the\nscore with his maiden goal in the\nsecond half. The defence was\nconfidently solid throughout the\ngame, Rolf Slatter being brilliantly\nathletic between the posts (proving\nagain that even when approaching his\nthirties, experience counts for far\nmore than youthful physical prowess\nin the goal keeping business). This\nresult gives IC a chance to top the\nMiddlesex l st division if they can win\nagainst high flying Mill Hill on\nSaturday.\nHOCKEY Shooting down\nthe wing\nIC 3rd sV British Airways\nWithin seconds Steve Burton\nproduced our first goal.

After some poor passing by AJ,\nBA gained position, ran the ball\nthrough our defence. The goal-keeper\ncame out to attack the BA player but\nmiss-kicking the ball, BA managed to\nscore with the loose ball.\nThe second IC goal came from\nVijay Thuker after complex passing\nwithin the D before scoring.\nBA's third goal was scored when\nfour from the two teams were on the\nground after the keeper had taken\nthem out.\nThe second half was almost the\nusual IC 3rds game but they didn't score any goals.

    "content": "RAG MAG OR RAG DRAG?\nThe mid-sixties saw\nthe troubled birth\nof the Imperial\nCollege Rag Mag,\na publication\ndestined time and\ntime again to cause\ncontroversy. Under\nthe editorship of\nDavid Irwine, the\nfirst issue\nunderwent\ncensorship of an\nentire 16 page\nsupplement, and\nfew subsequent\nissues have been\nspared from similar\nnotoriety. The\ncurrent issue is\nunlikely to remain\nunscathed; no doubt\nsome puritanical\nmembers of the\ngeneral public will\nbe critical of the\nfront cover!\nA distressing feature of the Rag Mags\nof other, lesser institutions is their\nten dancy to regurgitate the same\nmaterial issue after issue. The IC\nversion has always prided itself on its\noriginality, to the extent of being\na period of hostility between the Rag\nMag editors and ICU Executive\nofficers.\nAlthough the balance was redressed\nthe next year, 1981 once again saw\ntrouble, with Patrick Coil's the second school of thought, but like\nall such things, has passed through the\nhands of the ICU Censorship\nCommittee, and has benefited from\nclose cooperation between the Rag\ncommittee and the ICU Executive.\nGiven adequate time, an editor\nshould be able to prepare a magazine\nwhich is not only runny, but which\ndemonstrates the ability of IC to\nproduce wacky writers and wild\ncartoonists. It is possible that there\nmay be pressure on future editors to\nfollow the trend set by this one,\nespecially if we prove successful. The\npresent practice of preparing the Rag\nMag over Summer doesn't really\nleave enough time for this, and many\non this year's committee feel that the\n' \u2022 tow., \u2122 9\u00b0 oi/ir \u201e c,9 \u201e e \u201e ej8 trend setting: Mike Williams, the\nEditor in 1972, is widely credited\nwith the introduction of dead baby\njokes, which now feature in\npractically every Rag Mag going.\nThis year's, for example, is the first\never to introduce the 'non joke'.\nAny efforts to track down IC Rag\nMags from the sixties proves futile,\nas College do not appear to archive\nthem. Those of the early seventies\nremained fairly uncontroversial and\ntherefore avoided censorship,\nalthough nowadays they would\nprobably raise cries of' 'Sexism!'' due\nto being liberally laced with Playboy\nand Penthouse cutouts\u2014a trend which\nlately appears to have died out.\nThe publication reached its present\nformat in 1979 with the introduction\nof higher quality paper and a glossy\ncover. The end result was polished,\nprofessional, and rejected by the\nprinters due to the nature of its\ncontents. 1979 also saw the start of\nA Felix editor and a ULU saba tlc al are Hanging on a cliff.\nWhose fingers do you tread on first?\nThe Felix editors; business before pleasure.\nelection of the editor should be\nbrought forward.\nThe early Rag Mags had little or no\nadvertising, justified by their low\nproduction costs, and even with the\nintroduction of the improved format\npublication being banned by a UGM.\nThe ban was eventually lifted, but not\nbefore momentum had been lost,\nleaving a vast pile of unsold Rag\nMags. An attempt by Carl Burgess to\nban the 1985 version failed, despite\nthe inclusion of Bradford Fire jokes,\nand the resulting notoriety gave a considerable boost to sales country\nwide.\nThe above result has given rise to\ntwo schools of thought. The first\npoints to the good sales achieved by\na bad reputation, and uses that as\nreasoning for an 'anything goes'\nattitude. The second school agrees\nwith the sales point, but adds that a good, clean Rag Mag ought to sell as\nwell, and avoids the adverse publicity\nto College and Union courted by such\nevents as the highlighting in the\nnational press of a recent IC Rag Mag\nas an example of racism and sexism\nin British universities.\nThe present publication grew out of\nWhats t ne worst thing you could say a; worked on trie t.C. Rag Mag' or 'I'm a tr ktn d in 1979 little effort was made to\nincrease this. The aggressive\ncommercial attitude of this year's publication is reflected in increased\nadvertising, and in the possibility that\nit may by possible to persuade\nWhat are (ft.\n'Hetio. my n most terri trying words ti\ns lan Hewgate'.\nbookstores to stock it. Half the\nprinting costs were -covered by\nadvertising revenue, and for the sake\nof quality of production it is hoped\nthat future editors will continue this\ntrend.\nGehon de Silva Wijeyeratne,\nRag Mag Editor, 1987\nFELIX Friday November 13th198711 "

    "content": "Junk Aesthetics\nWith the advent of the found\nfootage phenomenon in recent\nadvertising campaigns (ranging from\nlager to deodorant) and its\nproliferation in the realm of music\nvideo, this collection of short films\ntraces the origins of a traditionally\navant-garde technique. The show at\nthe ICA concentrates on the work of\nBruce Conner and consists of nine\nfilms, six of which are his, covering\nthe period from 1930 to 1980.\nThey range from a bitingly satirical\nview of Kennedy's assassination\n(Report, Conner 1965) which has\ninspired many a dancefloor classic,\nthrough early 'music videos'\n(Mongoloid Devo, Conner 1978 and\nAmerica is Waiting Eno/Byrne,\nConner 1980) to technical\nexperimentation in the form of early\nsolaris ation effects (Berlin Horse,\nLeGrice 1970); there is even what\npurports to be a very young Marilyn\nMonroe posing nude to a tragically\nironic song, cut up and repeated\nOMarilyn Five Times, Conner 1973),\nbut is it really her?\nLike all avant-garde work this\ncollection, some of which is being\nreleased for the first time, suffers\nfrom only partial success, with some\nideas being stretched just a little too\nfar. However, the range and scope of\nthe set as a whole is remarkable and\nsome sections are a pure delight. In\nthe main the films are ironic and\nsarcastic, with the power of newsreel\nfootage used critically to good effect.\nA rare treat for the daring.\n(Until 19th November at the ICA)\nA.N. She's Gotta Have It!\nThe release of this 'seriously sexy\ncomedy' on video follows a record-breaking independent run\u2014a welcome change for a film shot in\nblack and white with an all-black cast.\nNola (Tracy Camila Johns) is a successful paste-up artist, living in\nBrooklyn. To her, men are either\ndecent, or dogs. Trouble is she's found three decent ones and doesn't want to choose between them.\nThere's the sensitive and caring Jamie\n(Richard Hicks), smooth and arrogant\nGreer (John Terrell) and the hip and\nlively Mars (Spike Lee, who also\nwrote and directed the film).\nTheir respective attempts to upstage\neach other form a hilarious portrayal\nof male rivalry as the prospective\nsuitors fight for Nola.\nAltogether a sharp and witty study\nof modern relationships neatly turned\naround. One criticism though; who\npays \u00a335 for a video these days?\n(Available from Palace Video,\n\u00a334.99.)\nA.N. Romeo & Juliet\nby W. Shakespeare\nMany Shakespearean productions\ninvolve no more than hammed-up\npoetry and dusty old costumes. I was\nbeginning to believe that no director\nhad the ability to make such work\nrelevant to a modern audience.\nHowever, Jeremy Bell's Romeo &\nJuliet at the Young Vic has returned\nmuch of my lost faith.\nIt is set in the 1980s: the Montagu's and Capulets are wealthy,\nsophisticated business families, the\nNurse a zany b rum mie and the Priest\na black vicar.\nShakespeare's wordy sonnets are\nspoken naturally (even the clich ed \"Romeo, Romeo, where for art\nthou\"...etc). Romeo (Richard Huw)\nand Juliet (Sarah-Jane Fenton) are\nplayed as rough-edged teenagers who\nfind themselves immersed in emotions\nthat they can neither understand nor\ncontrol. Their powerful love story\nunfolds.\nTowards the very end of the play\nthe direction seems to lose its way,\nbut this was more than compensated\nfor by the remarkable power and\nimagination of earlier scenes.\nIt is frightening that a play of such\njealousy, hatred and violence as well\nlove can be as relevant to our lives\nas it was to the Elizabethans.\n(Until November 21 at the Young\nVic, SE1.)\nL.H. THEA\nThe Rover\nby Aphra Behn\nAfter a highly successful season in\nStratford, the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany is starting The Rover again\nat the Mermaid Theatre. With very\nfew changes to the cast and a brilliant\npreview performance it is set to have\nan equally successful London season.\nJeremy Irons plays the lead role of\nthe Rover; a wild philandering\nwomanizer who regards sex as the\nprime objective in life. I always think\nthat on television and film Mr Irons\nis such a drip, but his stage\nperformance is excellent; he is the\nperfect actor for the character.\nThe lively and bubbly Geraldine\nFitzgerald and Imogen Stubbs play\ntwo of the three sisters who break free\nto enjoy the carnival. These two are\nexemplary of the whole cast, who\nexude the same infectious sense of\nenjoyment.\nThe Rover is easy to follow, fun to\nwatch and brilliantly performed, and\nwith student concessions and standby\ntickets available this is a play not to\nbe missed.\nr.G.

Piquet\nmay already have the World\nChampionship, with the possible re-emergence of Ferrari in time for the\nnew season.\nGame Shows\nHighlight of the week is Treasure\nHunt, cruelly switched to Sunday\nafternoons (l pm, C4) but losing none\nof Aneka Rice's bubbly charm\ntempered only by Kenneth Kendalls\naut bor it y( 'cos he knows the\nanswers).\nMusic\nStill on Saturday, you might consider\nShostakovich's Fifth Symphony\n(8.15pm, BBC2 and Radio 3)\nperformed by the BBC Welsh\nSymphony Orchestra, with the added\nextra of a stereo FM simulcast.\nDrama & Documentary\nSaturday sees the return of the\ninsincere duo Cagney & Lacey\n(9.20pm, BBC1). More predictable\nplots, unimaginative endings and bad\nacting.\nNext Friday sees the continuing,\nexcellent documentary about the\nactivities of Customs & Excise (The\nDuty Men, BBC2, 9pm), this week\nfocusing on Poteen Manufacture in\nUlster.\nCartoons\nThere are some great repeats being\nshown on Saturday but you may\nrequire an early start to catch them,\nor a video! Roobarb (9.20am, BBC1)\nnot seen since our teens, brings happy\nmemories; and later (about 10.30am, ITV) during No. 73, a showing of The\nTrapdoor is a must and has been\ndescribed as 'Morph on acid'.\nFELIX Friday November 13th198715 "

I frequently exceeded these hours mainly due\nto being woken at 6.30am on my day off by a resident\nfor some trivial reason.\nIn addition to my basic wage, I was contractually entitled\nto a bonus of \u00a3100 for working the whole scheme, and\na further sum up to \u00a3200 for generally being a good boy.\nMost other Managers in the scheme totalled bonuses of\naround \u00a3260, including the Night Manager of Beit Hall.\nI received \u00a3150 five weeks later than promised.\nInterested in what looked like a \u00a3110 shortfall, I contacted Mr Arthur, who finally\u2014after much\nblustering\u2014stated that he had been informed that most of\nthe time I had performed excellently, but sometimes I had\nnot been available. I checked: most of the complaints about\nmy not being available related to my day off, or my\nstatutory weeks holiday.\nAt the end of the scheme, I, and most of the other\nemployees of the scheme were exhausted.\nMichael Arthur miscalculated the VAT percentages on\nrents this Summer, thereby losing thousands of pounds\nover the whole scheme. Has he lost any bonus for his\ndemon stra table in competency. DON'T work for the Summer Letting Scheme.\nYours,\nAP Bannister.\nAbortive\ntopic\nDear Judith,\nCan I assure Steven Mercer (FELIX November 6) that\nthe questions I posed in my last letter (October 30) were\nmerely an attempt to encourage people to accept that, in\nconsidering the Tightness or wrongness of abortion, there\nare important issues to be faced which are sometimes\nignored. There seems to be aten dancy nowadays to just\nassume in discussions, for example, that the (very real)\nemotional traumas of women with problem pregnancies\njustify abortion or that abortion on demand must be the\nnatural step forward as it makes it all much easier (ref\nKemi Adenubi, October 16 and November 6). I do think,\nthen, that his extreme condemnation of my letter is a bit\nmuch.\nIn answer to his question, then, I would say 'yes', a pregnant woman does keep the individuality 'that gives\nher the freedom to decide the course of her own life'. But\nin believing in such rights (along with Mr Mercer one\npresumes) I acknowledge the corollary that there are\ncertain things an individual does not have the right or\nfreedom to do. Now perhaps he, or others, would tackle\nmy question, the one he took such annoyance at: How\n' come a woman can choose to end the life of her child just\nbecause it is still in her womb?\nYours sincerely,\nHugh MarKenzie.\nIntheear of\nthe beholder\nDear Judith,\nI am outraged at the posters for RCS Broadsheet which\nask if you are 'pissed off. The standard of English in\nBroadsheet (to use it's politer title) is generally poor, but\nto extend such crudity to posters is appalling.\nEnglish is a beautiful language, don't let Broadsheet\nwreck it; burn Broadsheet posters!\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Cholerton (Physics II).\nPlanned\nand subtle?\nDear Judith\nDoubtless you have received many letters on the\nmascot ry events of Friday November 6, I myself was\npresent at both events and would like to make the following\n2 points.\nA few years ago I did a considerable amount of research\ninto the history of Mascotry of the past 30 years or so\nand therefore feel as if I can talk from a position of some\nauthority on the matter and the following points clearly\nemerge:\n(i) No CCU mascot has ever been stolen by the violent\nstorming of a UGM or any other Union event.\n(ii) All successful raids have involved planning, subtlety\nand above all patience.\nI hope Guilds and Mines take good note of these 2 points\nand refrain from bringing mascot ry into future disrepute.\nYours in all good faith, j Benjamin Sidle (ex-RCS student)\nGissa bonus\nDear Ed,\nI'm still waiting for my bonus.

At SCAB Nite tomorrow\nnight, you can see all of IC's performing societies 'doing their bit'\nfor Rag, on the Union Concert Hall\nstage. Most of the performances are\nmore light-hearted than usual, whilst\na couple should be just plain\nridiculous.\nUnder the banner of the latter come\nDebSoc's debate: This house believes\nCaptain Kirk is the ultimate dramatic\nhero, proposed by the good captain\nhimself, and opposed by James Bond.\nAlso DramSoc's irreverent rendition\nof Alice in Wonderland, starring the\nDramSoc 'tech ies '\u2014should be good\nfor a laugh.\nOn a rather less silly note, OpSoc\npresent Trial by Jury by Gilbert and\nSullivan, whose works they must\nknow back to front by now; DramSoc\nare doing Alan Aycbourne's Between\nMouthfuls, and Choir sing the\nGeographical Fugue. Jazz and Rock\nClub have two bands appearing,\nincluding The Rhythm Method,\nCollege's new jazz he pte t; there is an\n(as yet unknown) ensemble from IC\nOrchestra; and a band from the newly\nformed Folk Club. Those ve te rens of\nSCAB Nite, the Trombone Trio, from\nChamber Music make a welcome\nappearance, and include Tony Neal,\nthe Young Musician of the Year\nfinalist. The evening is rounded off\nby Film Society, who will be showing\nBarbarella in cinema scope, starring\nJane Fonda, into the wee small hours.\nYou get all this, and a cheap bar,\nfor a mere \u00a32, all of which goes to\ncharity through IC Rag. So even if\nyou don't go to any other event in Rag\nWeek, go to SCAB Nite on Saturday\nNovember 14 (tomorrow) at 8pm in\nthe Union Concert Hall. Alice in\nWonderland will never seem the same\nagain.\nRichard Squire, SCAB Chairman.\nCrisis at Christmas\nThis year, Crisis at Christmas will\norganise its nineteenth pilgrimage\nfrom Canterbury to London, now a recognised annual event, which is\ngrowing bigger by the year.\n(Hopefully 500 walkers will turn out\nthis year.)\nThe money raised by sponsored\nwalkers (around \u00a340,000 last year)\nhas given comfort and new hope to\nmany thousands of single, homeless\npeople; people without home or\nfamily, often sleeping out and living\nrough, during the winter months, with\nlittle chance of a happy Christmas.\nYet there are still thousands more\nwho need your help, and you can give\nthat help by either joining the walk\nitself on November 28 and 29, or by\nsponsoring me! Keith Lowthian\n(Chem Eng I), Falmouth-Keogh,\nRoom 379.\nSponsor forms should be found in\nyour CCU offices so please leave\nyour name etc and give generously to\nthis cause.\nThe pilgrimage itself is 60 miles in\nlength\u2014no joke! It is traditionally\nstarted by the Archbishop of\nCanterbury in the grounds of the\nCathedral,finishing two days later\n(having walked 34 miles of the first\nday and 26 on the second) in\nSouthwark. The route consists of road\nwalking for the most part along the\nnone too scenic A2 and negotiates\nsuch obstacles as Shooter's Hill (a1 lA mile gradual climb) and an even\nworse climb out of Rochester.\nIf you are interested in walking,\neither see me or write to:\nPilgrimage Office\nCrisis at Christmas\n212 Whitechapel Road\nLondon El 1BJ Once again, please give us your\nsupport and help the single homeless.\nCheers,\nKeith Lowthian\nAero darts\nNovember 20\nAerosoc challenge all departments\nand anyone in College to enter the\nfollowing 2 competitions:\n1.

You decide\non key issues affecting its\nperformance, such as lowering prices\n(gaining customers but reducing profit\nmargins) or tendering for contracts\n(profitable in the long run but risking\ninitial cash-flow problems). The final\noutcome will rest on your decisions,\nbut also on those of your competitors.\nAfter 2 or 3 repetitions of the\ndecision-making process a winner of\nthe game emerges.\nMembership of the Industrial\nSociety (\u00a31.50 for the year) allows\nyou to take part in such games, which\nare run by the companies which have\ndesigned them. Each company tends\nto provide travelling expenses, lunch\nor dinner during the game, and\ninformation about themselves. Games\nare usually held on Wednesday\nafternoons, finishing at around 6pm or 7pm. Only thirty places are available on\neach, so early application is advised.\nThe games are fun whether you're\naiming for large profits, deficits, or\njust a slander campaign against your\ncompetitors. You'll also learn a great\ndeal about businesses and how they\nare run.

This\nparticular system is a fusion of the art\nof Soo Bahk Do and Chinese fighting\nsystems, and is characterised by a large repertoire of kicking techniques.\nIts best-known user is probably the\nformer martial arts champion, Chuck\nNorris.\nA typical class consists of execution\nof basic movements, basic technique\nand free-fighting.

After about a minute,\nRCS then passed Theta out through\na window into the Beit Quadrangle.\nIt had nearly reached Beit Arch when\nsome Guildsmen shut the iron gates\nbarring the exit to Prince Consort\nRoad.\nFor a while it looked as there could\nbe some violence with the RCS\nmascot trapped in the Quad.\nHowever, in an attempt to avoid\ntrouble, Mr Tyler invoked a rule\nclaiming that they had 'overwhelming\nnumbers' and that the mascot should\nbe handed over to them. At the time,\nthe RCSU members present were\nprobably outnumbered, but not by a large amount, according to ICU\nDeputy President Alan Rose, who\nwas called in to adjudicate the count.\nWhile a count was being arranged\nand the two groups were separating,\nthe two RCS Theta Bearers, Dan\nPluta and Dave Burns, took Theta\nsecretly back through the Union\nBuilding, passed the Albert Hall, and\nonto Kensington Gore. There, after\nsome delay they hailed a taxi, telling\nSid, the driver \"This is possibly the\ngreatest moment of your driving\ncareer\". The taxi then drew off\ntowards Knightsbridge. Meanwhile,\nsome RCS students sat on the bonnet\nof a car being used by C& GU to chase\nthe mascot.\nWhile the taxi was waiting at the\ntraffic lights at the top of Exhibition\nRoad, a red Metro being driven by\nTim Clark pulled up behind the taxi.\nOne of the occupants, Chris Adams,\ngot out and stood in front of Mr\nClark's car while the taxi drove off.\nMr Clark then drove slowly forward\nand Mr Adams did not move. Mr\nClark then drove forward again, and\nMr Adams ended up on the bonnet\nwhile the car drove around the corner\nand stopped out of the traffic. The car\nRCSU mascot, Theta, making an unconventional getaway\nhad some minor damage to the\nbonnet, while Mr Adams had a stiff\nknee for the rest of the day.\nClare McErlane, the President of\nthe RCSU, said afterwards that \"they\nwere very glad they still had their\nmascot'', and felt that if the attack had\nbeen better planned it would have\nsucceeded. C& GU President Dave\nTyler said that the spirit of mascot ry was adhered to, although the Vice\nPresidents of all the CCU's would be\ngetting together after Rag Week to\nformalise the rules as regards\nmascot ry. When asked about his\nfeelings when RCS smuggled away\nTheta during the count, he said he\nwould have done the same thing, but\nexpected RCSU to pay a fine for\ndoing so. It was better, he said, to pay\na fine and keep your mascot.\nAn IC Union executive meeting\nlater agreed that 20% of the total from\nthe RCS 24 hour Rag Collection\nshould be split between the other\nCCU's. Later that evening C& GU make\nanother attempt when they\nunsuccessfully tried to follow the van\ncontaining Theta after the RCSU Life\nScience Freshers Dinner.\nFifty places to go\nThere will be at least 160 less places\navailable in Head Tenancy flats next\nyear. The contract on the '220' block\nin Hamlet Gardens, holding about 130\nstudents, is not being renewed by the\nlandlords. This was known last year,\nand a new block, containing 80\nstudents in flats for four was taken\nover as Head Tenancies this year,\nleaving a drop over the two years of\n50.\nThe remaining loss is from the 8\nEarls Court Square building which\nhouses 30 students. The landlord is\nprobably not renewing the contract\nfor economic reasons, although\nnegotiations are still continuing.\nThe other main block of Head\nTenancies, in Lexham Gardens, are\ndue to be renewed in February. Every\nyear the negotiations have been more\ndifficult as the landlords have\ndemanded more. An additional\nproblem this year might be the\nwithdrawal of Housing Benefit, which\ncould put the Lexham Gardens prices\nout of the reach of many students.\nThe College is still looking for new\nHead Tenancies, although with the\nprices of property around the College\narea being so high, there is a problem\nin that the only buildings in a reasonable price range are not in an\nacceptable condition for housing\nstudents, and there is no point in\noffering College Head Tenancies that\nhave no advantages in cost, distance\nor facilities over commercially\navailable property.\nBRI Blood\n155 pints of blood were donated by\nstaff and students last Friday. The\ndonations were in response to a plea\nby City and Guilds Union after they\nwere fined 50 pints of blood for\ndisrupting the Freshers' Reception.\nMaking history\nSTOIC, the television network of\nImperial College, will be\nbroadcasting all night tonight for the\nfirst time in their history. The\ntransmission is scheduled to start at\n10.00pm and end sometime on\nSaturday morning.\nMore minibuses\nThere will be a minibus service to\ntake women home after the Guilds\nCarnival next Friday night. This\nfollows the success of a similar\nscheme run in Freshers' Week.\nNew officer\nInterviews will be taking place on\nTuesday for the new IC Union\nFinance Officer.\nCrashing down\nJohn Redwood, Conservative MP for\nWokingham and former Head of\nDowning Street Policy Unit, spoke to\nImperial College students on\nTuesday.

    "content": "UNDER THE MICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nChaos is a fascinating and fashionable field of research. Curiosity is driven\nby the question: how is it possible for a purely deterministic system to\nbehave in a totally unpredictable manner? If you play around with the\nsimple equation in the article then you may well catch the bug. Try it;\nit really is fascinating. Here is some further reading for those who are\ninterested: Scientific American 245 pl6( Nov 1981), Concepts of Modern\nMathematics p307 Ian Stewart (published by Penguin 1981).\nArnold's Cat brings\nchaos\nPure mathematics is in trouble. Gone\nare those halcyon days when every\nresult was guaranteed to be useless.\nEven number theory (where people\nwaste their time trying to prove that\nxn+ yn= zn has no whole number\nsolutions for n greater than 2) has\nstarted to prove useful. Recently some\ndeep (and, until now, utterly useless)\nresults from algebraic number theory\nhave just been used by two mathematicians at Queen Mary\nCollege, to make some simple kinds\nof chaos more understandable.\nIt is worth taking some time for a quick introduction to chaos. Consider\nsimple recursion relation xn+ l=ax n(l xn). This defines a sequence of\nnumbers with each new number being\nfed back into the equation to give the\nnext number. Different types of\nbehaviour occur for different values\nof a( values of a between 0 and 4 and\noutput of the function (that is xn+1) eventually settles on one number, but\nfor a between 3 and 4, crazy things\nhappen (go try out a few sequences\non your calculator; you will appreciate chaos much better if you\ndo). For values of a near 4 the output\nof the function is completely chaotic;,\nthat is, the output fluctuates wildly\nwithout apparent order, visiting every\npoint between 0 and 1. The function\ntypifies simple dynamical systems\ncommon in the real world, such as\npopulations whose growth is\nconstrained by a limited food supply.\nThe latest discoveries concern\ncertain two-dimensional discrete\ndynamical systems. These are\ndescribed by functions like the simple\nequation given above, but with two\nvariables. The trouble with these\nsystems is that a great deal of their\nbehaviour is chaotic and this makes\nmathematical analysis very difficult.\nHowever, some initial states evolve\nin a perfectly regular manner, but\nthese are very difficult to find as they\nare completely surrounded by states\nwhich are effectively unpredictable.\nThis is typical of chaos: the slightest\nuncertainty in the initial state\nproduces complete uncertainty in the\nstate after only a few cycles of the\nsystem.\nThe system is studied by looking at\nthe properties of its phase space (this\nis just a graph where a point sums up\n4\nall there is to know about the system,\nthat is there is one axis for each\nvariable, position, momentum, etc).\nIn this case, the phase space is\ntopologically equivalent to the surface\nof a doughnut. The dynamics of the\nsystem are described by a repeated\nmapping on the surface of the\ndoughnut, called Arnold's cat (it was\nfirst illustrated by a drawing of a cat\non the surface).\nPercival and Vivaldi (the two from\nQM C) realised that many of the\nquestions about the system could be\nrephrased as questions about the\narithmetic of some number relating to\nthe mapping. These can be answered\nusing some of the most useless\nconcepts in pure maths (such as the\nquadratic reciprocity law, ideal\nclasses, the classification of primes as\nramified, split and inert..). Using\nsuch arcane devices, the two\nmathematicians were able to map out\nthe regular point in the sea of chaos\n(which can be thought of as the\nskeleton on which the chaos is hung).\nThis is helping with an understanding\nof the depths of the chaotic regions\nof the system.\nThe importance of this work lies in\nthe number of chaotic systems in the\nreal world. Almost any system with\nnon linearity or feedback will exhibit\nchaotic behaviour at some point\n(biological systems are often based on\nfeedback loops: for example, heart\nattacks have been modelled as\ntransitions to chaos. A lot of physical\nsystems are similarly chaotic (for\nexample, the weather).\nThe big question is this: can pure\nmathematics survive all this\napplicability? (Nature 329 p670 and\n391).\nGas from\nthe Earth\nIf science can be measured by\neconomic returns on investment, then\nGeology is a very successful science.\nThe world's biggest and most\nprofitable companies rely on geologists to find the oil and gas\ndeposits that create their profits.\nHowever, all the oil may have been\nfound by applying an incorrect theory\nof its origin, at least according to a geologist called Thomas Gold (his\nbook Gas From The Earth was\npublished last md nth). The new theory suggests that\nnatural gas and oil are not derived\nfrom rotting primaeval rubbish, but\ncome from the earth's core where\nthey were trapped when the earth was\nformed. Gold, formerly of Cornell\nUniversity, now at Cambridge, first\nproposed the idea several years ago.\nGold's theory neatly explains some\nobserved anomalies in the contents of\ngas and oil deposits. The actual\ndistribution and extent of petrochemical reserves has always\nbeen something of a mystery, and it\nis often difficult to explain the\nreserves' origin in terms involving the\ndecomposition of biological junk.\nGeologists usually propose that the oil\nwas formed somewhere other than\nwhere it was found and then moved\nthrough porous rock until stopped by\nan impervious layer. But the oil\nshould leak away faster than it has\ndone if it is as old as we think.\nThere is also the problem of the\nrelative composition of oil and gas.\nBasically there is too much hydrogen\nfor a st ric dy biological origin. Worse\nthan that, there is the helium: some\nnatural gas wells contain several per\ncent helium (in fact this is where all\ncommercial helium comes from), and\nthere is no way to explain the helium\nwithin conventional theories. Gold's theory neatly accounts for the helium,\nwhich was a common constituent of\nthe early solar system (as was\nhydrogen). It is not difficult to\nimagine the trapping of gasses in a planet built by slow accretion of rocky\nbodies, as long as the whole body\nnever becomes completely molten\n(and this is now the favoured theory\nanyway).\nIt is, unfortunately, difficult to\nverify or refute such an idea easily.\nGold can explain the circumstantial\nevidence for biological origin (the\npresence of common plant-derived\nchemicals in oil) as the result of\nbiological contamination of his\nprimordial deposits. But there is a definitive test. If Gold is right, then\nwe should be able to find\nhydrocarbons in areas where they\ncould not possibly have had a biological origin. These areas of the\nearth's crust contain only very old\nrocks and no sedimentary deposits\nwhere biological waste could have\ngathered.\nGold was able to persuade a team\nfrom the Swedish electricity industry\nto drill a deep hole in one such\nsuitable area. Unfortunately, the\nmoney for the project has run out due\nto 'un for seen drilling problems', just\nas interesting results were coming in.\nNo gas field has yet been found, but\nthere is methane and helium and\nhydrogen in places where they should\nnot be.\nHopefully the project will restart,\nbecause if Gold is right then there is\nenough gas down there to keep the\nwhole world well supplied for\nthousands of years. That is long\nenough for us to find a better way to\nbecome extinct than running out of\nenergy.\nSCIENCE PAGE\nArticles, suggestions\nand complaints\nshould be sent to\nSteve Black c/o FELIX Office or\nphone int 4642.\nFriday November 13th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Slamdance\nAlthough, technically speaking,\nWayne Wang's Slamdance can be\nclassed along with a growing batch of\nAmerican movies directed by\nOrientals, it can be much more\nclosely associated with the recent\nbatch of oddball thrillers in which the\nmain character gets involuntarily\ndragged from his safe, normal world\ninto a nightmare sub-world of fear\nand horror (Blue Velvet, After Hours\nand Something Wild being the better\nexamples of the genre).\nThe central character here is\nDrood, a painter and artist (played by\nTom Hulce), who appears practically\ncontinuously in the film, which is no\ngreat shame as his performance is\neasily the most enjoyable to watch and\nhis character is the only one allowed\nenough scope to develop. The\ngateway to his nightmare opens when\nthe woman he has just recent iy finished an affair with is murdered;\nhe has been sent incriminating\nphotographs of her with public figures\nand on top of this the police are ty ring to frame him with the murder.\nThe problem with the film is that\nneither the storyline nor the script are\never really strong enough, and the\nsub-plots in the movie such as Hulce's relationship with his estranged wife\nand their daughter 'Bean', or Hulce's internal wrangling s over whether or\nnot he really loved his ex-mistress\nElandra Caldwell are never strongly\ndeveloped. The support is also weak:\nthe usually reliable Harry DeanStanton is mediocre as the semi-honest cop, Smiley. Adam Ant and\nJohn Doe also make only half-worthy\ncontributions to the action. Only Don\nOpper, as the hoodlum, with a warm\nheart, who has to hassle Hulce\nmanages to impress. Again, it is only\nHulce who shines, as the twisted look\nand boyish smile are used as\neffectively as they were in Amadeus.\nWang also shows some nice touches\nthroughout the film, but the pace\nchops from slam-bang-wo ll op to\nstillness too abruptly.\nAll this may sound very negative,\nand although it doesn't quite live up\nto the standards of the films in whose\nwake it is following, Slamdance is an\nenjoyable film, and you could do a lot\nworse than to go and see it; it's just\non leaving the cinema one has the\nfeeling that although it was good, it\ncould have been a lot better.\nN.C. Let's Hope it's a Girl\nDespite Liv Ullman's touching\nportrayal of a woman coming to terms\nwith adversity and Catherine\nDeneuve's occasional appearance,\nthis film does not have much to offer.\nTwo hours of struggling with the\nsubtitles of this Italian film was only\nacceptable because the plot was so\nslow moving I didn't miss any of the\nfilm by having to read them.\nWithout men, Elena (Liv Ullman)\ncopes with a failing estate, the death\nof her estranged husband and the\nseeming desertion of all her brood.\nThe strong feminist undertones\nsurface in the last scene, where all the\nwomen, united and facing their\nproblems together, prepare and eat a meal. The only man present, dotty old\nUncle Gugo, symbolically doesn't eat\nwith them, but sits to one side knitting\nsocks for horses.\nI don't expect many students would\nenjoy this film: on a rainy afternoon\nwith nothing better to do I would\nrather sit in the rain and save the\nmoney.\n(Renoir, Russel Square, WC1.)\nT.G. The Rescuers\nFirst released in 1977, Walt Disney\nis trying to make some more money\nfrom The Rescuers re-released last,\nweek. Created from over 2'/2 million\nseparate drawings it is well worth\nseeing. In true Disney style there are\nlots of goodies (the mice) and baddies\n(Medusa), plenty of action and a happy ending. What more could you\nask for?\nIf you do go and see it watch out\nfor the remarkable likeness between\nthe evil Medusa and our very own\nMrs Thatcher.\nT.G. The Magic Toyshop\nThe latest offering from the poison\npen of Angela Carter was filmed but never generally released, appearing\non video instead. Following in the\nwake of The Company of Wolves this\nproduction certainly deserved\ninvestigation.\nIt concerns the fate of Melanie\n(Caroline Milmoe), an innocent\nteenager who is tragically orphaned\nand is forced to stay with her sadistic\nUncle Philip. He owns a toy shop in\nsouth London and is obsessed with\npuppets, forcing his family (consisting\nof his dumb wife and two toys) to\nwatch strange plays he writes and\nperforms using the mannequins he\nlovingly creates. These become\nincreasingly bizarre and eventually\ninvolve Melanie herself as the divide\nbetween fantasy and reality is blurred.\nThe film provides a captivating\natmosphere of magical fantasy, with\nmysterious forces and sexual intrigue\nweaving a complex thread. However,\nthe characters do not develop beyond\nfairy-tale stereotypes which deprives\nthem of any real interest and although\nthe ideas are effectively executed, the\nstrangeness soon becomes tedious due\nthe total absence of plot and the film\nquickly becomes vacuous. Rather\nthan the thought-provoking Company\nof Wolves, The Magic Toyshop left me\nfeeling cheated of any stimulating\nconclusion.\n(Released by Palace Video today)\nA.N.16 Friday November 13th1987 FELIX\n\n"

The 3rds struck a free kick by\nChris Budgen was laid off to Fergus\nBatstone who turned sharply and fired\nin a low cross that Chris Morris\nconverted perfectly. Fifteen minutes\nlater Alan Glass added a second after\na Chris Morris back-header and the\n3rds began to believe that it would be\ntheir day. The 2nds had other ideas\nhowever, and began to play as they\nknew they could, Pip Peel was\ncausing lots of trouble to the 3rds defence and Dan Thomas was always\ndangerous. The real star (as ever) was\nNiel Vandenbegin, but it was Adam\nwho pulled one back for the 2nds just\nbefore half-time after a slight\ndefensive error. The second half\nbegan with the 3rds determined to\nhold their lead, but they could not\nbelieve their luck when Fergus\nBatatone duped the 2nds keeper from\nthe edge of the box to put the thirds\n3-1 up. After this the 2nds really\nbegan to play, Paul Thompson and\nSmart Miller made probing runs from\nthe back and John West was creating\nlots of space in the midfield. The 2nds pressure paid off at last when a cross\nby Adam Thomas was headed home\nby PP Peel, but unfortunately for the\n2nds they couldn't create any more\nreal chances, even though they\ncontrolled the rest of the match. The\nfinal whistle went with the 3rds the\nwinner, but judging by the way the\n2nds played it will be very surprising\nif they don't win the league come the\nend of the season.\n3rds Team: Julian Henson, Chris\nBurton, Mark Woodgate, Kevin\nGraves, Chris Budgen, Graham Day,\nChris Morris, Paul Neville, Andy\nLeahy, Fergus Batstone, Alan Glass,\nNeil Lennard (sub).\n2nds Team: Andy Allen, Smart\nMiller, Russ Dark, Paul Thompson,\nMicky Plummer, Rakesh Muthod,\nJohn West, Jo Muller, PP Peel, Neil\nVandenbegun, Adam Thomas.\nIC 5th s Team: Julian Henson, Chris\nBurton, Kevin Graves (capt), Mark\nWoodgate, Chris Budgeon, Graham\nDay, Chris Morris, Paul Oster, Mark\nRadley, Paul Neville, Fergus\nIC Ills 3-LSE Ills 0\nIC Ills approached their 3rd game of\nthe UAU competition needing a win\nto have any chance of going through\nthe regional division. The IC captain\nwon the toss and decided to attack\nagainst the wind in the l st half.\nNeither team settled down properly\nand IC were content to contain LSE,\nknowing that with the advantage of\nthe wind in the second half they\nshould be able to take the points. The\nl st half ended scoreless, with very\nfew goal attempts apart from a couple\nof half chances that fell to Fergus\nBatstone.\nIC began the second half well,\nChris Morris and Mark Woodgate\nwon everything in the air and the ball\nwas rarely seen by goalkeeper Julian\nHenson. Move after move took IC\nnearer to opening the scoring,\nGraham Day came close and Fergus\ncontinued to cause problems to the\nLSE defence. Eventually the\nbreakthrough came, a goal mouth scramble saw Paul Nevillefinishwell\nand LSE began to crumble. IC began\nto completely dominate the game, a run from the defence gave Kevin\nGraves a1 on 1 with the keeper who\nsaved well and after coming close\nwith a powerful shot. Graham Day\nslotted in the second when Fergus\nrobbed the LSE keeper. LSE had\nnothing more to give and Paul Neville\n(ICs answer to Gary Lineker)\ncontinued his excellent scoring form\nby getting the third 5 minutes from\ntime.\nIC Vs 5\u2014KQC Vis 1\nIC Vs achieved their second win of\nthe season last Wednesday in a hard\nfought game against KQC Vis. The\nmatch was evenly balanced until the\ntwentieth minute when Glenn Evans\nscored the first of his magnificent\nhattrick. No one was more surprised\nthan him to see his 20 yard effort loop\nover the goalkeeper and drop just\nunder the bar. KQC fought back hard,\nand but for some brave defending by\nour illustrious leader, veteran Jon\nTurner, and the rest of the star-studded defence, the game might have\ngone the way of so many others this\nseason. KQC did equalise ten minutes\nlater. Approaching half-time, IC\ncontinued to counter-attack and were\nrewarded by another goal from Glenn Evans, this time a12 yard angled\ndrive beyond the keeper. The score\nremained 2-1 until, in the second half,\nwith the wind in our favour, Glenn\ncomplete his hattrick by beating two\ndefenders and prodding the ball past\nthe despairing keeper.\nMidway through the second half,\nthe goal of the season so far was\nscored by Steve Von Bargen\u2014our\ngoalkeeper! A long kick resulted in\nthe ball bouncing on the penalty spot\nand over the head of the other keeper\ninto the goal. Last, but not least, our\nfifth goal was scored by the right-back\nMike Wilson after a move started in\nour own penalty area.\nA sad note is the loss of our\nmidfield player Hemang, carried off\nwith a fractured ankle.\nNext summer, a group of students\nfrom Imperial College will be\ntravelling to India with the aim of\ncrossing the Eastern Himalaya\nthrough Bhutan to Tibet, and them\ncontinuing across China to Beijing.\nAny budding explorers interested im\ntaking part in this expedition are\ninvited to apply for a place now.\nEXPEDITION\nExplorers\nthis way\nSome mountain trekking experience\nwould be an advantage though not\nessential.

Paul Thompson\nreplaced the injured Jezz Holland, in\nthe heart of the defence, and Adam\nThomas made a welcome return after\nhis ventures into l st team football.\nPlaying against the wind in the first\nhalf, IC soon got to work. Pip Peel\nopened IC's account, finishing off\nwith a spectacular lob, having been\nput through in usual style. Towards\nthe end of the well-fought half, Guy\nPhiri latched on to another ball,\nrounded the keeper and slotted the\nball home. Playing with the wind in\nthe second half, IC camped in LSE's half. However, pressure was not\nrewarded with goals, until Adam\nThomas crashed a volley into the net,\nfrom outside the box. This victory\nmeans IC will get to at least the\nregional playoffs for the last 16 in the\nUAU.\nTeam: S Holden, S Miller, R Dark,\nP Thompson (capt), M Plummer, R Muthoo, P Peel, J West, J Muller, A Thomas, G Phiri.\nORIENTEERING\nRunning\nwild\nOn Sunday the Orienteering Club\nattended their fifth event of the season\nat Chelmsford.

It is\nprohibited by international covenants\nto which Syria is a party.\nNevertheless anyone suspected of\nopposing the Syrian Government risks\ntorture at the hands of the country's security forces.\nFor many years, Amnesty International has received reports that\npolitical prisoners are systematically\ntortured and ill-treated by Syrian\nsecurity forces. People arrested or\nabducted by the security forces in\nthose areas of Lebanon under Syrian\ncontrol have described tortures\nsimilar to those suffered by detainees\nin Syria. The use of extensive powers\nof arbitrary arrest and detention\nconferred on the security forces by a state of emergency which has been in\nforce in Syria since 1963 provides the\nmain context in which torture takes\nplace. These powers have been\ngrossly abused. The various branches\nof the security forces have seized\npeople at will, without warrants,\nwithout any explanation of why they\nare being arrested and without\nreference to any central authority, and\nheld them incommunicado for long\nperiods, in some cases for years. It\nis during such incommunicado\ndetention that most prisoners are\nreported to have been tortured.\nBrutal methods of torture at the\nhands of the Syrian security forces\nhave been described to Al. One, the\nSyrian Chair, involves the use of a metal chair to which the victim is\nbound by the hands and the feet. The\nchair's backrest is then bent\nbackwards, causing acute stress to the\nspine. Meanwhile metal blades fixed\nto the chair's front legs cut into the\nvictim's ankles. People tortured in the\nSyrian Chair are said to have suffered\nfractured vertebrae and near\nback or chest with a sharp hot metal\nrod; plucking hair or skin with\npincers/pliers; extracting finger and\ntoe nails...the list goes on.\nDetainees are tortured to make\nthem 'confess' or to incriminate\nothers. Some are tortured as a punishment for protesting about their\ndetention without charge or trial,\nTorture method known as the 'Guillotine'; the blade stops just short of the\nvictim's neck.\nstrangulation. Al has received\ndescriptions of over 35 different\nmethods of torture, excluding the\nroutine beatings. For example, 'Bisat\nal-Rih' (flying carpet): strapping the\nvictim to a piece of wood shaped like\na human body and either beating\nhim/her or applying electric shocks\nall over the body; placing pieces of\ncotton wool soaked in petrol on\nvarious parts of the body and setting\nthem alight; piercing the victim's This drawing illustrates a method known as the 'Flying Spider', reportedly\nused in Anjar detention centre in Lebanon. Victims are suspended from the\nceiling by their hands and feet and beaten on their backs.\noften for many years. Others are\ntortured in order to force them to sign\nstatements renouncing their political\nviews. Relatives of political prisoners\nhave been taken hostage and tortured\nto try and make the prisoners\n'confess' or give information. Others\nhave been taken prisoner and tortured\nfor information about a relative who\nwas wanted by the security forces. A number are reported to have died in\nprison in recent years. Some are said\nto have died as a result of torture\nduring interrogation, or through\nroutine ill-treatment and appalling\nconditions of imprisonment.\nThe Imperial College group will be\npart of a worldwide campaign against\nthese human rights abuses. If you\nwould like to join us, come to our\nmeetings (Tuesdays, 5.30pm, Brown\nCommittee Room) or contact Guy\nSims or Monique Yeo (both of Maths\n2).\nDon't just be horrified by man's inhumanity to man, join in the fight\nagainst it!\nISLAMIC\nInstinct and\nIntellect\nGod gave man a spiritual instinct, a desire to revere something greater\nthan man's own self. Throughout\nhistory we find people worshipping\nsomething\u2014God, idols, the sun,\nwater, or even other men.\nHowever, God did not leave us the\nemotionally-based spiritual instinct\nalone by which to discover our\ncreator. God also gave man intellect,\nwhich should guide us to the proper\npath. Without its guidance, instinct\nmay cause man to worship fire or\nstones, a result of low level thought.\nThus God made Islam to be\naccepted intellectually, not as a blind\nfaith. Many verses of the Qu'ran give\nrational arguments for the existence\nof the one true God; unfortunately\nspace is too short to quote any.\nOnly after the muslim is\nintellectually convinced that God is\nalone the creator and worthy of\nworship, that Mohammad (may peace\nbe upon him) is the Prophet of God\nand that the Qu'ran is from God, can\nhe submit himself to the will of God.\nBut that will be enlightened\nobedience, not blind obedience.\nImtiaz Z Malik (EE2)\nChairman of the Tuesday Circle\nROCK\nMusic\nRock Society, the newest society at\nImperial, has a simple aim: to bring\ntogether people who enjoy rock music\nin any of its forms. We will be\narranging trips to gigs (including\nregular pilgrimages to the Marquee),\nholding rock discos and concerts in\nCollege, and showing rock-related\nfilms and videos.\nWe also intend to forge links with\nother colleges such as Goldsmiths and\n.UCL; the new ULU rock society\nshould be big enough to hold concerts\nfeaturing well-known bands.\nIC Rock Soc's first event will be\na 'Sixties and Seventies Disco' for\nRag Week, to be held in Southside\nUpper Lounge on Saturday 23rd November. So come along and\nsupport us and Rag.\nAs with any new club, there is\nplenty of scope for (polite)\nsuggestions, so come and make them.\nMeetings are in Southside Upper\nLounge every Monday lunchtime.\n18 Friday November 13th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "INI ews Music news\nThe College Music Committee has\nbeen inspecting rooms which have\nbeen put forward by College\nadministration as alternatives to the\nMusic Room to be lost in Princes\nGate. The most satisfactory room is\nTerminal Room A in the old Holland\nClub, which is being converted into\nrooms for the Department of Computing. Four rooms in Sherfield\nhave already been allocated as\npractice rooms.\nMr Malcolm Aldridge, a member\nof the Music Committee, expressed\nhis disappointment at the loss of the\npresent music room. He said T am a little sad. There is only one place in\nthe whole College which is ideally\nsuited to music making. There are\nliterally dozens of rooms which are\nsuitable for conferences and\nseminars'.\nICU President Ian Howgate\nacknowledged the progress which had\nbeen made. He indicated, however,\nthat the Union would continue to fight\nfor the use of the Music Room.\nBig Demo\nThere was a major demonstration\noutside the Huxley Building on\nQueensgate on Tuesday afternoon.\nMembers of the Bangladesh National\nParty were protesting against the\nruling administration which seized\npower in a military coup in 1981. At about 3.50pm members of the group\ncharged across the road to the doors\nof the Bangladeshi Embassy. There\nwas a brief scuffle with police and\nreinforcements were called in.\nWithin a couple of minutes 6 police\ncars, 7 bikes, 2 vans of policemen and\n2 mounted policemen arrived. The\ngroup were forced back to the other\nside of the road where the\ndemonstrators got increasingly angry.\nWhen FELIX approached members\nof the group they claimed that the\nmilitary regime had assassinated Mr Siaur Rahman who ruled for 5 years\nunder a democratic system. Since the\ncoup there had been hundreds of\npeople killed in Bangladesh and much\nof the countries wealth had disappeared.\nThe 1987 Rag Mag was launched at\nthe Beer Festival on Wednesday. The\nRector, Eric Ash, bought the first\ncopy for \u00a35 from the editor, Gehen\nde Silva Wijeyeratne. Later 700\ncopies were sold from the rag stall at\nthe cover price of 50 pence. This is\nthe first new Rag Mag produced at\nImperial for some years after\ncontroversy over the contents of previous editions.\nThe Beer Festival itself was a great\nsuccess, with takings of over \u00a35,300\nand a profit for Rag of over \u00a32,100.\nMany students attended the Festival\nto sample the large variety of Beers\non offer.\nSurrey saga continues\nUlU travel\niii Surrey University have still to write\nofficially to Imperial College Union\nabout the events that happened two\nweeks ago last Wednesday, when\nvisiting IC sports teams caused\ntrouble in their bar.\nA motion concerning the trouble\nwas passed at the weekly Surry Union\nGeneral Meeting (UGM) on Tuesday,\nalthough a stronger worded motion\nput to the previous U GM was rejected\nafter pressure from Surry sports\nteams. The original motion called for\nthe banning of IC students from\nSurrey's Union Building and the\nsigning in of visiting sports teams,\nneither of which were contained in the\nmotion which was passed.\nICU President Ian Howgate has\nsent a letter to the Chairperson of\nSurrey'sU GM which apologised for\nany trouble that was caused, and\nwhich contained reports from the\nImperial sports teams that were\npresent. When contacted by FELIX, Surrey's President Andy Young said\nhe would be writing back by the\nbeginning of next week.\nIn the meantime, copies of front\ncover of last week's FELIX, containing this story, were distributed\non the Surrey campus by their sports\nteams after a piece published in the\nSurrey Student Newspaper 'Bare\nFacts' which made no attempt to put\nboth sides of the story.\n\u2022 Worldwide flights on quality airlines\n\u2022, Special fares for students and academics\n\u2022 European trains and short breaks\n\u2022 Overland tours and holidays\n\u2022 Group bookings\nUnbeatable prices \u2014 unbeatable quality Enquiries and Bookings:\nEuropean 01-581 8233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nUL U Travel\nS her field Building Imperial College Prince Consort Road London SW7. sm \\\nJ(| Compact discs rejected\nfi./ ft) H \u00bb TheWorldbeaters\nThe second Imperial College Union\nCouncil this year took place on\nj Monday evening. A suggestion that\ni Compact Discs should be bought to\n; replace many of the worn out records\ni in the Haldane Library was rejected,\n;\nin favour of a proposal to purchase\ncassette tapes. It was pointed out that\nalthough a large number of students\nhave cassette players, less have the\nequipment for playing CD's and\nrecords.\nA proposal by ICU President Ian\nHowgate that Union General\nMeetings should be held every other\nweek in the J CR resulted in much\ndebate. The first U GM held there two\nweeks ago was a success, but Ian felt\nthat it lasted too long and motions\ni were not discussed. He pointed out\nthat more regular UG M's would\nresult in less business for each\nmeeting. There was opposition,\nhowever, from members who thought\nthat many students have other\ncommit tm ents at lunchtimes when the\nmeetings would be held, and it would\nresult in problems scheduling clubs'\nevents and meetings. It was decided\nto refer the matter to the next U GM for a further discussion before a decision was taken.\nThe non-attend en ce of some of the\nmembers of Council resulted in a proposal that any member who cannot\nattend and does not send a proxy or\nacceptable apology would be fined\n\u00a35, to be donated to rag.\nFELIX Friday November 13th1987 "

    "content": "The case for\nbetter driving\nDaren Austin takes\na brief look at\nadvanced driving:\ntests and the\nlikelihood of having|\nan accident.\n'13 dead on M62', '18 dead on M6\\\n'U turn madness on M4'. Fortunately\nheadlines like this are not everyday\nreading in our national papers, but\naccidents do happen every day on our\nroad and motorway network.\nAccidents with rare exceptions do\nnot occur at any given time or place,\nbut rather in widely scattered areas,\nat all times of day and night.\nSurprisingly only a few of these can\nbe attributed to any particular road\nfeature or vehicle defect, but it is\nfound that 90% of all accidents can\nbe traced to 'human error' by the\nperson or persons concerned.\nBy international standards Britain's roads are relatively safe, and our\naccident rate is among the lowest in\nEurope. Even so our safety\nperformance is not a matter for\nself-gratification.\nEvery year about 330,000 people\nare killed or injured on our roads,\nnearly 6,000 are killed, some 80,000\nseriously injured and another 245,000\nless seriously injured. On average a road injury occurs every 99 seconds\nand one person dies every 75 minutes.\nAmongst men aged under 30 this is\nthe single most likely cause of death,\noutweighing all types of diseases.\nThe single biggest cause of\naccidents is driving with excess\nspeed; this, coupled with driving too\nclose to the car in front, leads to many\nof the horrific motorway pile-ups.\nHow many people know the stopping\ndistance of a car travelling at 70mph? It is little wonder then, that a line of\ncars separated by about 20 feet and\ntravelling at about 60mph in fog is an\naccident waiting to happen!\nThe single most effective method\nof reducing the accident rate is to\npress for better standards of driving.\nThere exists, in this country, two non-profit-making charities, The Institute\nof Advanced Motorists and the\nRoSPA Advanced Drivers\nAssociation, whose aim is just that.\nTo become a member involves a1'/2 hour test of both driving skills and\nknowledge. Passing the test is not\nnecessarily the main object! The\nevaluation carried out by one of the\nexaminers, all of whom hold Class 1\nPolice certificates, is what really\ncounts. From the assessment the\ncandidate can learn what is right about\nhis driving, and more important, what\nhe should do to improve from a safety\npoint of view.\nMany drivers have potentially fatal\nflaws in their driving. It is surprising\nthe number of drivers who dip the\nclutch before negotiating a bend,\ninstead of changing down. Or the\npeople who actually take both hands\noff the steering wheel without\nrealising!\nThe Government Transport and\nRoad Research Lab has shown that\ndrivers who pass the entrance test are\n50-70% less likely to have an accident\nthan the general motoring public,A consequence of this is that they are\nconsidered much better insurance\nrisks, and can save up to 30% on their\npremiums.\nIf anyone would like more\ninformation on advanced driving do\nnot hesitate to contact me, Daren\nAustin, via the Physics pigeonholes.\nThe stopping distance at 70mph in\nideal conditions is 315 feet, so just\nhow good a driver are you?\nWHITBREAD Our reputation has been\nbrewing since 1742.\nWe wish Imperial College every success with the Rag Week\nUMi ln ii XTnimmKaii 11t 'll 1087\nFriday November 13th1987 "

As the words of derision\nfor Guilds flowed from his pen, he\nthen stumbled by naming the Theta\nBearers as Dave Tyler and Dan Pluta.\nMaybe the Broadsheet Editor\nconsidered the only way the Guild's President was likely to get his hands\non the RCS mascot was by changing\njobs.\n\u2022IT'S GOOD to hear that 155\npeople turned up at Southside Gym\nlast Friday to donate one brain cell each to the Guilds President.\nHowever the sabbaticals were not\namongst them, maybe they're a bit\nshort themselves...\n\u2022CHAS 'TAKEITEASY' Jackson\nran into a bit of trouble in Marks and\nSparks recently when he went to buy\na new suit for Commemoration Day.\nAfter choosing a racy little \u00a3200\nnumber he proceeded to write a cheque. Unfortunately, Chas did not\nhave his cheque guarantee card on\nhim and tried to fob off the attractive\nyoung assistant with his Union card.\nNot surprisingly, he was soon seen\nheading for the manager's office...\n\u2022 MATTHEW BRIDGWATER,\nbar worker, Hamlet sub-manager and\nPhysics post grad, seems, upon first\nsight, an unlikely person to embark\nupon a PhD. However, Matthew has\nscrapped his MSc and decided to try\nand become Doctor Bridgwater.\nWhen quizzed on his reasons for the\nchange he replied 'It's a good chat up\nline for the gir lies!'. No doubt this\ninsight into the world of the post grad will be a real wow with the gir lies down the 'boo ooze r', so Matt would\nsay.\n\u2022OVERHEARD IN Mergers Bar...\nPissed Old FELIX Hack: 'Alan, I need some dirt on you for FELIX.'\nAlan Rose: 'Well, how about I voted for Ian Howgate?'\nFELIX Hack: 'But that's not\nscandalous.'\nAlan Rose: 'I think it is!'\nTHE BARON 'But this is just the sort of thing I'm talking about', said Whygate. 'This is\nwhy we must have the \"Whygate\nfinishing school for new citizens\" '.\nWhygate was getting very upset and\nnot speaking very clearly. In fact he was\nleaping up and down on his desk with\none finger in his ear, trying to do an\nimpression of the letter 'P. With him in\nthe citizens' office were Alan Ego, the\nDeputy Head citizen, Mrs Jolly Hockey\nSticks, the citizens manager, and Bob\nAitch, the citizens' stool of sport. They were discussing what to do about\na serious complaint from the head citizen of Sorryland. A group of sporty\ncitizens, the particularly evil looking set known as the rug ger buggers,\nhad gone to Sorryland and behaved very badly after their games.\n'It was only a case of high spirits', punned Aitch, trying his best to calm\ndown Whygate and at the same time checking that his hair was in place.\n{Aitch was very careful over his appearance and was proud of his\nreputation for being the cutest leading citizen in Cheapskate).\n'High spirits?', screamed Whygate. 'Some of them even took their\nclothes off.\n'But Whygate, de a rie, you do that all the time', said Mrs Jolly HockeySticks, doing her best to prevent the situation getting any worse. 'Why\ndon't you invite the head citizen of Sorryland over for a vat of sherry. I'm sure he would enjoy that'.\nFortunately the conversation was interrupted by Whygate's phone\nringing. It was Arthur Michael, who wanted to discuss the colour scheme\nfor the new Michael-Whygate home for senior citizens. As usual,\nWhygate's attention was immediately absorbed by any discussion about\nhimself. 'Pink, green and maroon stripes', said Whygate at once, forgetting\nabout Ego, Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks and Aitch. 'But I wanted wallpaper\nwith gnomes on', complained Arthur Michael. The two of them settled\ndown for a serious argument.\nElsewhere in Cheapskate, lots of citizens were still recovering from the\nannual Bore Festival. This was one of the many occasions when most\nof the citizens drank as much gassy liquid as possible, then brought It\nall back up again, telling each other as they did this what a great time\nthey were having. The excuse of the moment was that it was the middle\nof the citizens' Cloth Week, and so all the money they spent on gassy\nliquid would be going to charity.\nThere were lots of events of this type during the citizens' Cloth Week.\nMost of the time the citizens would be drinking a lot, breaking the furniture,\nand taking their clothes off. In fact. Cloth Week was an opportunity for\nthe Cheapskate citizens to behave like rug ger buggers. But not all of Cloth\nWeek involved drinking lots of gassy liquid.\nOther things to look forward to in Cheapskate included the Daft Race.\nThis was a very silly competition between teams lead by the three clowns,\nDave Braincell, Clare MacUseless and Jumping Jehosofat. This was a very\npopular part of Cloth Week, which was quite surprising really since it\ninvolved people getting wet, but not a lot of drinking of gassy liquid.\nMeanwhile, in the Baron's castle, the chief yes man, Ian Bore, was trying\nto produce the next WetNerk. Bore was a little worried that the first issue\nhad been a bit one-sided, so he had decided to make sure that this one\nincluded several people's points of view. He had put together an impressive\nlist of articles and was certain that he was going to bring out a well\nbalanced paper. The articles submitted so far included: 'A biography of\nthe Baron', 'The Baron\u2014a life', 'Cooking with the Baron', 'The best of\nCheapskate', 'The Baron's progress', 'There will always be a Cheapskate',\nand 'The Baron's greatest hits'. Bore knew his job all right....\nWill there be any articles about the Baron in WetNerk?\nWill Ego say anything next week?\nWill Arthur Michael get his wallpaper with gnomes on?\nWill Whygate manage to convince anyone that he is the letter 'P'? Find out in the next issue of The Baron of Cheapskate.\n\u2022 CHAS 'A NOD'S as good as a wink' Brereton has been having a few\nproblems with members of the\nopposite sex recently. Whilst playing\nthe piano at one of the Guilds\nFreshers Buffets Mr Brereton\nsuddenly hit upon what he thought\nwas the ultimate chat-up routine. He\npicked out the prettiest girl he could\nfind and asked her if she would\nsponsor him for a charity piano\nplaying session.\n'Yes', was her reply, 'when do I pay you.'\nWiley Chas suggested that they\nshould meet that Saturday lunchtime\nin Norman's to discuss the financial\naspects. When the girl actually\nshowed up, Chas was so surprised\nthat the pn ly line he could think of ran\nalong the lines of 'Would you like to\nbecome an ordinary member of the\nAcademic Affairs Committee?'\nNeedless to say, the affair was fairly\nshort lived.\nNot to be outdone, though, Chas\ndecided to try the same routine at the\nremaining dinners and arranged to\nmeet a number of girls the next\nSaturday. Fortunately, with a little\nhelp from his filo fax he managed to\nstagger the times so that the girls\nwould not accidently meet each other.\nPity, no one turned up.\n\u2022 INFAMOUS Mech Eng 3 wally\nJames Burdett caused a normally\nplacid lecturer to erupt into a torrent\nof four letter words last week. James\nwas travelling in a lift in Mech Eng\nwith Mr Lewis and Dr Barnes when\nhe was challenged by a fellow student\nto open the doors between floors. This\nhe did, stopping the lift, setting off\nthe alarms and incurring the obvious\ndispleasure of the other occupants,\none of whom complimented him on\nbeing a'f*** ing b* st*rd'.\n\u2022 POOR OLD David Ashforth, the\nvicar of Cheapskate, thought that he\nwas doing a good turn when he\ndecided to photocopy last week's edition of Chi Rho. He had heard that\nthe trusty FELIX litho had given up\nonce more and ran off all the copies\nhe thought the Editor would need.\nMeanwhile in some dim and distant\npart of College, the Chi Rho Editor\nwas busily trying to Gestetner the\nwhole edition in an attempt to keep\nthe costs down.\nIf anyone out there knows of a good\nhome for a pile of week old\nchaplaincy mags, give the chaplains\na call.\nFELIX Friday November 13th19877 "
