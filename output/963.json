They do don't they,\nadmit it. We've had them all by the\ntruckload before and by gum we're\ngoing to have to sit through it all\nagain.\nDaniel McCormick (Mel Gibson)\nhaving been frozen for over fifty\nyears awakens to find himself in\n1992, lost, alone and out of step.\nDaniel never got a chance to declare\nhis love for his sweetheart Helen\n(Isabel Glasser), and must now\ncome to terms with his own life, in\nso doing, becoming a catalyst to\nhelp others do the same.\nYou want to puke, right? Well go\nright ahead and do it, I must say this\nfilm can be faulted in many ways,\nmost of them arising from the fact\nthat it has all been done before, all\nthe morals have already been drilled\ninto us, isn't it about time we had\nsomething more original, please?\nMy main gripe however, is that\nthis film tries to be too many things,\ninstead of simply concentrating on\n\u2022\nHH HH BH what is really at the heart of this well be wholesome, edible, true and\npicture; a love story. Like an onion thoughtful, but there's just so much\nhowever, there are too many layers you can eat (right?) and by the time\nto peel away, most of them may you get to the middle you've lost\nIf;V m;mm Accidental Hero Bernie La Plante (Dustin Hoffman),\nrisks life and limb to save the plane\nfull of people that has just crash-landed about ten metres in front of\nhis car. Standing alone amidst a driving rainstorm, Bernie in no way\nthought it was a good idea, f ing and\nblinding his way throughout the\nwhole rescue. This unlikely\n'Accidental Hero' lives by the credo\n'keep a low profile' and abiding by\nthis religion disappears into the\nnight leaving only a size 10B loafer,\nlost in the mud, as a remnant of him\nyour appetite and it's all a bit bland\nand tasteless. Strictly above\naverage.\nMario.\never being there.\nGale Gayley (Geena Davis) a TV\nreporter aboard the plane, in search\nof a good, wholesome, American\nway type story begins to hunt this\n'Angel of flight 104'.\nTo cut a long story short. John\nBubba and down and out (Andy\nGarcia) comes forward as this hero\n(Bernie having given him the\nmatching shoe) and so begins a warped tale of Bernie desperately\ntrying to claim what's his and Gale\nsearching for the truth, while John\nreaps the rewards.\nThe film finds its premises in\nAmerica's craving for heros\u2014and\nfinds its irony in how the media and\nindeed most of the nation define\nthose idols (the blow-dried,\ndesigner-clad, optimistic and\nsuperficially sincere and strictly\npreferred).\nWhile the acting is faultless,\nespecially Hoffman, the plot seems\ntoo sugary and sweet to swallow\nand as a comedy there just aren't enough laughs to carry the film\nalong. It's too short and you are left\nfeeling in need of more to fill your\nmind. Strictly for the optimists and\nthose with a passion for the 'there's a little good in everyone' type of\nthing. I'm sorry but this film just\ndidn't smack me in the face as hard\nas I'd hoped.\nMario.\nPage 22\n\n"

Olympia & York, owners of\nthe Thatcher monument, Canary\nWharf, propose a private rail kink\nto Central London; Cecil\nParkinson, temporarily distracted\nfor secretarial pursuits announces\nthe Jubilee Line extension in\nNovember.\nIsolated by the Department of\nTransport and London\nUnderground (both preferred a fast\nlink from Liverpool Street to\nPaddington 'Cross Rail', or a line\nfrom Chelsea to Hackney), left\nwing London boroughs (annoyed by\nthe 40% private capital\ncontribution), and powerful right\nwing boroughs (Westminster and\nCity both wanted a line North of the\nriver), Parkinson's only supporter\nwas, predictably, the London\nDocklands Development\nCorporation (LDDC). Parkinson\nploughed on, securing the support\nof the South London boroughs with\nstations at Southwark and\nBermondsey.\nThe eleven new station buildings\nover the ten miles of the track\nconsist of the most ambitious\nexpansion of London's ailing public\ntransport system since the Second\nWorld War, opening up a whole\nnew area South of the Thames, an\narea cruelly neglected by the tube\nat the moment. (Only 30 of the 270\nstations are South of the river), and\nconnect Docklands to the West End\nin under twenty minutes.\nThe new station at Westminster\nwill be the lower floors of a new\nParliamentary building, in the\nenvironmentally sensitive area on\nParliament Square from there the\nline heads under the river to\nWaterloo, interchanging with\nBritish Rail and thence, to\nSouthwark. Southwark essentially\nacts as an interchange for British\nRail's Waterloo East sited on the\ncorner of Blackfriars Road and The\nCut, it possesses a pivoting glass\ncanopy to close the station at night.\nThe next station down the line is\n!\nyet another British Rail interchange,\nat London Bridge, and from there\nthe line proceeds to Bermondsey.\nThe second new station, and one in\nthe decaying inner city area, the\npotential for rejuvenation of the\nlocality is massive. Situated at the\njunction of Jamaica Road and\nKeetons Road, designed to allow\ndaylight to flood down to the\nplatforms, and, with an office block\non top, curved to allow the sun's rays to reach the homes beyond.\nCanada Water is planned on an\ninterchange with the East London\nLine between Rotherhithe and\nSurrey Qyays, and incorporates a new bus station. The line then\ntunnels beneath the Thames to the\nIsle of Dogs and to Canary Wharf,\nthe most expensive station on the\nnew line (projected cost \u00a360M), is\nexpected to be amongst the six\nbusiest stations on the whole\nnetwork. Built within the West\nIndia Docks, the station is mostly\nhidden beneath a new park area,\nwith entrances rising from the\nground in huge glass bubbles.\nThe line tunnels below the river\nyet again to North Greenwich,\nwhich is to be built with three\nplatforms, facilitating a possible\nfuture extension East to the Royal\nDocks. The line tunnels below the\nThames for the fourth and final\ntime, North to emerge from tunnels\nto run parallel with BR's North\nLondon Line to interchange at\nCanning Town with that Line and\nthe new East extension of the\nDocklands Light Railway to the\nRoyal Docks and Beckton. The\nJubilee continues with the North\nLondon Line to West Ham, to\ninterchange with the District/\nHammersmith & City and West\nHam, connected with a bridge with\nextensive use of glass bricks. The\nnew line runs with the North\nLondon line to its terminus at\nStratford, to interchange with the\nCentral Line, the proposed Channel\nTunnel line and the aforementioned\nCrossRail.\nFootnote\nWhether the Jubilee ever gets built\nis still very much up in the air. The\nrecent Government spending cuts\nfor London Transport (a25% cut\nin funding) have already led to\nclosure proposals for two stations\n(Aldwych, Mornington Crescent),\nand the delay caused by them on\nwork at South Kensignton led\ndirectly to the bomb being able to\nbe hidden behind exposed\npanelling. This, coupled with the\nneed for public investment, mainly\nfrom the financially troubled\nOlympia & York, could still force\nthe abandonment of the project,\nleaving London with a rapidly\ndecaying public transport system,\nclogged road and increasing\nenvironmental pollution.\nTHE MAGPIE PROJECT\nVacancyfor Laboratory Assistant III\nFollowing the successful integration of two\nother assistants a third is sought.\nThe MAGPIE project in the physics\ndepartment is the construction of the largest\npulsed power current generator in Europe.\nWhen completed in March 1993 its 1.6 million\nampere current from a2 million volt supply will\nbe used in the quest for nuclear fusion.\nThe job will be un glamorous, primarily being\ngofer ing, form filling, telephoning, cleaning and\nmanual labour with a small well motivated team.\nThe applicant will be enthusiastic, intelligent\nand trained in Physics or Engineering.

    "content": "Reviews\nFelix 963\n24 March 1993\nObsessions An alcoholic German doctor has\nbeen visited by a beautiful, arrogant\nEuropean woman who strode into\nhis jungle outpost, demanding help\n(guess what). That's how his\npassionate obsessions started.\nDoctor (Rob Inglis) is revealing us\nhis story in this one man play\nadapted from Stefan Zweig's 'Amok'.\nThe action revolves between the\nship's deck, a medical outpost in the\nJavanese Jungle Government house\nand sleazy downtown Djakarta.\nEverywhere 'that sultry, oppressive\natmosphere that plays on your\nnerves like a thunderstorm till they\nsnap\u2014and you run amok'. By the\nway, amok (from Malay) means a rush in frenzy. Totally blinded with\nhis passionate obsession, the doctor\nis ready to sacrifice everything, his\ncareer, his doctor's licence and life\nto save her secret.\nAlthough Rob Inglis (who also\nadapted this play) managed quite\nsuccessfully to carry out dialogues\nwith invisible persons and to move\nfrom one situation/place to another,\nsomehow he failed to express all\nthose passionate obsess on s, which\nwas what the story was about. He\nperformed and looked very tired.\nThis tiredness was somewhere\nbetween an acting tired and\nemotionally exhausted person and\na really tired actor performing late\nat night (the play starts at 9.30pm) in front of a half empty audience.\nIf you do go to the Sunday\nMarket in Camden and if you can\nkill time there until 9.30pm( maybe,\na couple of drinks in the Oxford\nArms, where the Etcetera is) why\nnot, go and see this play since you\nare there already. Otherwise don't bother.\nElena.\n\u2022 Etcetera Theatre Club, Oxford\nArms, 265 Camden High Street,\nMW1. Box Office 071-482 4857.\nTickets \u00a35.50.\nThe Three Sisters\nTempted with a last minute ticket\nI found myself seated before The\nThree Sisters. Perhaps I must\ntherefore claim part of the\nresponsibility for the dismal\nresponse Rose Bruford's group\nmanaged to evoke in me. I tried, I really tried. Alas, their efforts were\nfru ides s. This production was very,\nvery dull.\nObsessions.\nIt was also very, very long\u2014and\nyet the character is ation remained\nlargely undeveloped. The\n'thumbnail sketches' of chr act ers never became credible. The two\nservant characters of confused\nregional origin (you can't beat a Geordie/West Country accent and\na limp to instantly create someone\nstupid and harmless) were of source\nof particular dissatisfaction.\nIronically, they were also the\nsources of greatest amusement. The\nsimple roles and straightforward\nexchanges were handled best.\nPerhaps Chekov was a mistake.\nElaine Pyke handled the part of\nMaria fairly well, although she\nherself looked bored at times.\n(Understandable in the company.)\nHow she could find anything more\ninteresting in Jershin than in\nKulygin did not become apparent\u2014\nin fact the male cast seemed to be\nthe unfortunate sufferers of\n'Charisma Lobotomies' all-round.\nI did spy a cast member yawning\nat one point, but I won't tell who.\nDisbelief, therefore, hung thick\nin the air\u2014while onstage each\nmember of the cast launched his/her\npiece of dialogue to minimal\nresponse from the others (\u2014the\nsound of castaway lines thudding on\nthe floor was practically audible\nthroughout the performance). Still,\nwe ploughed along, with the\nvolume of speech at a constant\n'forte', varying to brief 'mezzo\nforte' in moments of extreme\npoignancy. The lack of aural\nsensitivity was not aided by the\nstaging, which placed the dinner\ntable inthe wings of the theatre,\nleaving the actors barely visible and\nscreaming over to a distant and\nyawning audience.\nEnduring memories\u2014Maria's fate was indeed a poor one, of all\nthe three sisters she at least did\ndeserve better\u2014perhaps one day\nshe'll get to Moscow. I'm afraid I don't know if she got there or not\u2014\nafter the longest and most inept\npiece of scene changing I have yet\nseen I'm afraid I sloped off home\nto catch Northern Exposure.\nThe 'not able features' award for\nthis evening goes resoundingly to\nthe noses of all cast members,\nwhich had more character and\ninterest in them than anything else\non stage. Fabulous hooters, shame\nabout the production.\nLaura.\n\u2022 The Cochrane Theatre,\nSouthampton Row, WC1. Box\nOffice 071-242 7040. Tickets\n\u00a33-\u00a35.\nAlfie\nAlfie is a play about a London based\nDon Juan and his incredible love\nlife. Well, you would think it is\nafter seeing the first ten minutes of\nthe play, but as the story unfolds a deeper message seems to emerge.\nFrom scene to scene, and from love\nto love we are confronted with\nsituations which are quite\nunexpected in that their serious, and\nsometimes sad atmosphere clashes\nwith Alfie's happy-go-lucky\npersonality. Using these scenes, an\nhonest attempt is made, to unveil\ncertain murkier sides of the\nrelationship between the sexes. It is\nthis insightful text, as well as Alfie's incisive monologues which gives\nthe play its power.\nAlfie often talks directly to the\naudience and tries to induce in them\na judgement of his character, as\nwell as a general sentiment towards\nhim. This is vital since the audience\nmust witness his tribulations as if\nthey were happening to a acquaintance or a friend. Adam\nFaith achieves this admirably and\nthanks to him the full potential of\nthe text is brought forth. This rare\ncombination of great acting and a great script make this play a must\nfor any theatre lover.\nManor.\nPage 20\n\n"

Yet again,\nManchester has produced a band\namong bands. The story so far is:-Four lads got together just over a year ago, wrote some songs, played\nsome gigs, and at the end of 1992\ncaused an absolute riot at the 'In the\nCity' conference, where every\nsingle major record company in the\ncountry clam our ed for their\nsignatures. Normal people, at this\npoint, sign the contract and jet off\nto Brazil to get deep inside\nthemselves for that crucial first\nalbum... So what do Molly Half\nHead do ?... Guessed it yet ? ...\nThat's right, sign to a local\nManchester independent, (Those of\nyou who are a little less susceptible\nto the hype might note that the band\nactually signed to Columbia, part of\nSony Music, for a 'Amillion, and\njust signed to Playtime, the\nindependent for two singles to gain\nsome credibility with the sad does who don't believe that major labels\nfrom his roots.

All we're left with\nis the rump end of 'Lead Vocalist',\nby which stage it should be just\n'Vocalist' as Rod's got no band to\nlead. The second half comprises of\ncovers from various star turns like\nStevie Nicks and the Stones etc. But\nlike most of Rod's career since the\nFaces, it's bland and plays its hand\ntoo early. Only Tom Waits' 'Tom\nTraubert Blues' finishes with the\nopen hand of youth regained.\nThe remaining Faces reformed\nrecently for MTV, so maybe Rod's getting the message; the sad thing\nwas he was really quite good back\nthen.

After\neventually deciding on which\nboards to take and completely\nemptying Salisbury's, we set off.\nFriday night was spent consuming\nthe odd 'medicinal' pint and\nwondering how a greying 50 year\nold could be ex ploy ed as DJ. The\nnext morning at 7.00am, James\nwasn't too impressed when I woke\nhim up to inform him that it was\nbloody windy outside\u2014miserable\ng it! Despite being of a reasonable\nstrength, the wind was inthe wrong\ndirection\u2014offshore which is\ndangerous for those still learning.\nSo we spent most of the morning\nlooking for a beach where the wind\nwas in a suitable direction (cross-shore). We found just the place, a small inlet for the intermediate,\nbordering on the open sea for the\nexperts. Ignoring a small snow\nflurry, and those wing eing about the\ncold, we rigged up and went out.\nConditions were 'rip pin': the gently\nshelving beach was perfect to\nlaunch from and the speeds we got\nup to bridged on the orgasmic. We\nwere all re vitali sed by a humungous\nChinese on the Saturday evening in\npreparation for a mind-blowing\nSunday. The conditions on Sunday\nwere similar when we got on the\nwater at lunchtime. One\nexception\u2014the wind speed went\nthrough the roof. I almost dumped\nin my wetsuit when I nearly lost\ncontrol during on particularly\nscreaming run. Those on the shorter\nboards were jumping and carving\nlike I'd never seen before. There\nwas more to come: half way\nthrough the afternoon we sailed into\na full-on snow blizzard: the wind\nreached a crescendo and the\ntemperature dropped dramatically.\nBeing masochists we carried on,\nuntil the wind finally dropped.

See below for more free fall insanity\n'eat ure Felix 963 24 March 1993\nTen past six on a bright sunny\nSaturday morning, what a glorious\nday to act like a bird. An uneventful\ntrip into college for 7.45 to meet up\nwith fellow skydivers and\nparachutists, an uneasy, pensive\nsense of excitement lingers over the\n26 jumpers who depart their destiny\nat Hinton in the Hedges airfield.\nAt last the airfield, well at least\non sight, we seem to stalk the\nairfield in ever decreasing c irl ces, was this a sign, no, just another\nright turn. At last an entrance, and\nwhat an entrance, the wrong one\nstraight onto the runway. On finally\nsorting out where we were\nsupposed to be, the party splits up\nwith the 23 parachutists departing\nto the local village hall to complete\ntheir training and the four tandem\nskydivers to commence their\ntraining. Being one of the tandem\nskydivers I was trained thus, meet\nLarse your strap-on instructor, this\nis the harness which attaches your\nback to my chest, when the plane\nis at 9,000 feet you will sit on my\nlap 'but I hardly know you', I will\ntighten the harness after the other\nthree skydivers have departed the\nplane at 9,500 feet we will shuffle\nto the exit, you will sit on the edge,\nyour thumbs in your shoulder\nstraps, knees together, legs bent\nunder the plane, head up and away\nwe go, then you immediately arch\nyour back, keep your knees together\nwith your legs bent, back as far as\npossible, training finished.\nThe first two tandem skydivers\njumped, Rupert first looking a bit\nwhite and worse for wear\nafterwards and having been out on\nthe town the night before didn't help\n'was it really a sickening\nexperience?'. John followed and on\nlanding was on a bit of a buzz 'well\nis it better than sex?!!'.\nAt last my destiny arrives, I get\nkit ted up with my flying suit,\nharness, helmet and goggles.\nBiggies eat your heart out.\nMeanwhile the intensively trained\nparachutists return to be greeted\nwith the news that the ground wind\nspeed is greater than ten knots so\nno jumps could take place until it\ndropped below. This fortunately did\nnot apply to me.\nI approached the plane with\nmixed feelings of eager\napprehensive anticipation. Five\nskydivers, squeezing into the small\ninterior, the plane was a bit rope y with various pieces of tape, holding\nthings together thank goodness I had a parachute on. We taxied\ndown the runway turned and away\nwe climbed, I was sitting on the\nfloor next to where the door should\nhave been, but instead this was the\nopen jumping space. During the\nclimb the other skydivers indicated\nthe increasing height, the fields\nbelow formed a patchwork quilt of\ngreens, browns and yellows, so\nsoon just over 5,000 feet, the mile\nhigh club, well not quite. The first\nsky diver departed: he was doing a low altitude dive he disappeared\nrapidly, ('gulp!') my heart beat\nincreased yet again and what is this\nhollow feeling inside 'why am I here and what am I doing?'. Nine\nthousand feet onto my instructor's lap, 9,500 feet where did the other\ntwo skydivers go; Who's next? I shuffle to the door, what was it? ah\nthumbs in shoulder straps, knees\ntogether, legs bent under the plane,\nlook up, just a quick look down\nwasn'ta good idea it was a long\nway. I look up, heart racing,\nsav our ing the fear and enjoyment\ntoo late to back out, and away.\nWhat a sensation: no sense of\nfalling, no sense of speed although\nit is 120mph plus, the wind roaring\nin my ears, ripping at the flying\nsuit, trying to tear off my goggles,\ntime for aerial acrobatics. A360 \u00b0\nto the right then the left with swift\nsharp execution, how long have we\nbeen falling, what's our height, will\nthe parachute open, enjoy and\nsav our the moment. A tremendous\njerk and an upward movement the\ncanopy is open, no more fear just\nan adrenal in high now the glide\ndown, spiralling, turning and\nhovering, the view and sensation\nare fantastic, no, here comes\nreality: a perfect stalled upright\nlanding, but me well I am still\nflying...It would be so easy to\nbecome a skydive junky living for\nthat adrenal in rush and pushing\nyourself to the limit with radical\nman oe vres. Meanwhile back on the ground\nthe wind speed finally dropped\nbelow 10 knots but the light was\nfading all too fast which meant only\n6 parachutists actually left the\nground and experienced their own\n2,000 feet jumps conquering their\nfears and apprehensions getting a buzz of a lifetime.\nThe light or lack of it prevented\nthe rest of the party jumping, and\nthe last tandem skydiver Charles\ntoo. This means a return visit for\nthose frustrated who live life to the\nfull. Don't be frustrated and\nremember if you don't return\nMulitple Sclerosis sufferers will\nremain frustrated.

This, of course, is another\nunfamiliar concept to those who\nseem to consider themselves our\nopponents, most of whom are\nextending their RCS careers by the\ntraditional routes of retaking years,\nhanging around on the dole, or\nsimply attempting to retain their\ntenuous position at Imperial by\npla gia rising the work of others.\nPossibly the only good thing to\ncome of this election campaign is\nthat the current 'Hon Sec' (in the\nsense of using the pot rather than\ndoing the job) has decided not to\nscrew up the job of president as well\nnext year.\nWe're sorry that we've had to\ntake part in the kind of bitching\ncampaign that we've always hated,\nbut distances of several hundred\nkilometres make more conventional\ndebate impossible.

Is the author\nOpinion\nMusical chairs\nDear Jonty,\nWe hate having to write aCC U rant, but we have been left no\nchoice by the actions of certain\nmembers and hangers-on of the\nRCSU. It is difficult to mount an\nelection campaign from another\ncountry, but we managed. The first,\nblatantly unfair, attempt to organise\nan election (not that 'organise' will\nbe a familiar word to the people\nconcerned) was finally quashed\nwhen it was realised that it was\nsimply an attempt for a few of the\nRCS lads to swap the jobs around\na bit without involving\nunpleasantness like democracy.\nWe then took part in the second\nelection campaign, and, for reasons\nof normal student thrift, kept our\nelection advertising to a minimum\nwhen we realised that we were\nunopposed. We hadn't counted on\nwhat appears to be some kind of 'tit\nfor tat' campaign by some of the\n'hacks' and random hangers-on\nwho like to hang around the RCSU\ncongratulating themselves on their\nimportance. There was of course,\nno way we could answer a series of\nuntrue allegations from Paris and\nPadua, and no way that we could\nput our mothballed election\ncampaign back into action against\nNew Election. It seems a typical\nand rather sad case of a few of the\n'mascot ry boys' clique getting\nAlan Bailey\nDear Jonty,\nAt the beginning of this academic\nyear I made a more than generous\noffer of '...contributing to the air\nfare to Iran for any Muslim who\nhated this country and Western\nculture in general.' This followed\nthe circulation of the infamous\n'Nobby the sheep' article. My only\ncondition was that they promise\nnever to return. This offer was\nNOT meant as an insult to the\nIslamic community at all. It was in\nfact aimed at those who quite\nclearly have no respect for British\ntraditions, do not w isn to integrate\nand really hate living here. I was in\nfact prepared to do them a favour\n(as well as the rest of us!). No one\ntook me up on the my offer.\nI was therefore surprised to\nreceive in my pigeonhole yet\nanother article from the Islamic\nsociety continuing the feud with\nConSoc. I wonder what dod gy 'organisation' is funding the Islamic\nsociety as to enable them to\ncontinually publish this garbage.\nNot being a member of either\nsociety, I feel in a position to\nperhaps settle this dispute.\nLet's take the Islamic letter first.\nWe are told that the countries in the\nMiddle East are not really Islamic\nstates. Well they seem to think so,\nand anyway they are a damn sight\ncloser to an Islamic state than Great\nBritain. Logically would it not\ntherefore be preferable for Najeeb\nKhan to go to one of these?\nThen Najeeb turns his eye to law\nand order. He justifies the 'cutting\nbits off people' punishments by\nsaying how barbaric some people\nare in the West, and uses the case\nof Jamie Bulger. He is thus\ncomparing Islamic Law to the\nminds of crazed murderers! How\nodd. He says that Islam believes in\nthe after life and that this motivates\npeople to behave themselves. After\nlife? What are you on? I certainly\nwouldn't mind having a pint of it!\nThen its the economy.\nApparently an Islamic state would\nhave 0% interest rates. What about\nexports, exchange rates, inflation\netc. He missed out the issue of the\nweather. No doubt under Islamic\nlaw the sun would shine very day\nand the rain wouldn't dare fall\nbecause of the threat of the eternal\ndamnation!

We have a Prime\nMinister with no real vision or\nideas. He is surrounded by a bunch\nof nobodies (with a few exceptions)\nin the cabinet who can't have the\nbest interests of the United\nKingdom at heart. If they did they\nwouldn't be prepared to sell us\ndown the river in Europe as Major\nintends to do. They also would treat\nNorthern Ireland as a genuine part\nof the United Kingdom, instead of\nindicating that the current\ngovernment is a perfect image of\nthe principal Western ideologies-democracy, capitalism and social\nwelfare? If so, current affairs prove\nthat assumption to be wrong.\nIt is important to have some\ndebate on such important issues, but\nboth the Islamic and Conservative\nsocieties need to be reminded of the\nneed for tolerance and mutual\nrespect.\nYours sincerely,\nGeoff Maxwell, Elec Eng 2,\nCathSoc Vice-President.\nappeasing 1KA scum by continuing\nwith the treacherous Anglo-Irish\nagreement.

One side is based on fantasy\nand would probably be better\nunderstood after consuming a good\ndeal of mind blowing drugs.

    "content": "Reviews\nBlackmail Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is the\nfirst in a short series of silent films\nwith new scores at the Queen\nElizabeth Hall, the film itself has\nbeen partly restored as well.\nWatching the film with the live\nmusical accompaniment involved\nhaving to appreciate both mediums\nsimultaneously, though obviously\neach complemented the other, and\nI found it a kind of schizophrenic\nexperience. On the music side, the\npiece sounded startlingly modern in\nplaces, and it seemed to lift the film\nout of the conservative 1920's.I also noticed how extensively the\nmusic was used to convey an\nemotion for lack of dialogue. The\nfilm was also in terse ting unto itself\n- one can see many elements found\nin later Hitchcock, eg. the bird's eye view of a winding staircase as\nseen in Vertigo, and the acting,\nalthough heavily hammed up, was\nthou roughly enjoyable. Full marks\nto the BFI.\nAralia Elegantissima.\nHedda Gabler Henrik Ibsen wrote this play in\n1890: however, it is still not\noutdated, being about a woman who\nfeels not only caught in her\nmarriage but in her life in general,\nher demands reaching beyond\npomposity into the aesthetics of\nsuicide. This time, it was staged by\nFelix 963\nHot Head Productions at the\nEtcetera Theatre. It was a bit of a surprise that the leading role was\nplayed by a black actress because\nit's a bit of a change to the usual\nblonde stereotype and an interesting\nfeature. However, Julia Hagan\nconvinced in being a smug, spoilt\nGeneral's daughter (although I found it irritating that nobody had\ntaught her how to move in this kind\nof tight-cut dress). The actors and\nactresses obviously were very\nenthusiastic about their play. I liked\nAnstey Thomas as Mrs Elvsted and\nKenneth Owens as Judge Brack best\nsince their acting was the most\nnatural; but perhaps it is due to a prejudice that I found the others to\nmuch of the British waffling type\nrather than a more down-to-earth\nScandinavian approach.\nKristine.\n4?0per a The Duel of Tancredi and Clorinda To someone more used to\ntraditional opera, the set-up seemed\nquite bizaar e. The stage itself was\nwhite: a huge screen with a niche\ncontaining a sofa and limited\nadditional acting space. The actors\n(Narrator: Paul Nilon; Clorinda:\nPatricia Rozario; Tancredi:\nChristopher Ventris) contrasted by\nwearing black for the most part,\nwith a little green. No 12th Century\ncostumes here!\nThe acting was good, though\nsometimes I couldn't correlate the\nacting to the music. Their singing\nwas excellent\u2014I could hear the\nwords 99% of the time.\nIt's a story of thwarted love.\nTancredi (who was a First Crusade\nCrusader) falls in love with a Saracen maiden. One night she\ndresses as a warrior and sets fire to\nan English encampment. He chases\nafter her, and they duel before\ndawn. As the sun rises, he mortally\nwounds her and removes her mask.\nHorrified, he discovers his mistake.\nShe asks him to b apt is e her and pray\nfor her soul, even though she had\nlived her life to the contrary. He\nbaptizes her and she dies in his\narms, having attained eternal peace.\nFive Madrigals lead you through\nthe story to the duel, followed by\nthe duel itself. Monteverdi's musical moods throughout do\njustice to the story.\nPossibly the modern presentation\nis meant to appeal more to young\npeople\u2014period costumes with a bit\nmore scenery might have served\nbetter.

The introduction\nwas intriguing: a screen depicting\ntwilight, a low voice in a strange\ntongue, and a woman dressed in a mildly seductive manner setting the\nscene in an eerie fashion...cue\nBluebeard (Gwynne Howell) and\nhis new wife, Judith (Sally\nBurgess). The screen rises to reveal\na castle corridor.\nJudith becomes intrigued as to\nwhy seven doors are always locked.\nOn persuasion he relinquishes to her\nthe seven keys, with increasing\nreluctance. Behind each door is\nrevealed an aspect of him which he\ndoesn't want her to discover\u2014a torture chamber, an armour y,a treasury, and a secret garden, each\nstained with blood.

She then goes to join\nthem, as wife of the Night, leaving\nBluebeard alone.\nThe acting and music were very\ngood indeed, and there was clever\nuse of staging throughout.

Have you\never been on a degree course and\nrequirements of the licensing\nauthorities and college regulations.\nAs your article pointed out, there\nwas a reported error in the bar's accounts and this necessitated a temporary closure, so that the\nmatter could be properly\ninvestigated. The fact that the error\ndid not prove in the end to be as\nserious as it first appeared to be,\ndoes not mean that the decision to\nclose temporarily was wrong or\ninappropriate.\nYours sincerely,\nAngus Fraser.\nhad some irritating bastards pester\nyou for three years trying to sell you\nthe ideal of Islam.\nName withheld to avoid annoying\nbastards pestering me for the rest\nof my sentence.\nCrocky's view\nDear Jonty,\nI was pleased by the calm tone of\nthe reaction to the-Beit Back on\nIslam in Felix 960.\nSince we seem to have non-fanatic muslims ready to discuss\nthings maybe they could make it\nclear how the Islamic 'way of life'\nregards women (declared inferior to\nman by the Koran), the Jewish\npeople and their religion (Angel\nGabriel was first spoken of by the\nJews\u2014this does not give him a 'nationality' but an 'origin'!), or\natheists and polytheists. Could they\nalso explain the concept of Jihad,\nwhich it seems 'technically' cannot\nbe called for beyond certain\nMiddle-Eastern borders, and\nexplain to what extent the Koran\nallows humans to administer Justice\n(including killing people or putting\na price on their head) in the place\nof God, whom it would seem is old\nenough to defend himself and will\nhave the last word anyway. (This\nlast point can be made to Christians\ndogmatically protecting Jesus\nagainst blasphemy).\nBelieve me, I have an interest in\nthe ways of Islam, but also great\nconcern as to how it is understood\nby those who follow it.\nIslam does have a history of non-peaceful conversion, though\npossibly not half as bloody as that\nof Christianity. Muslim-majority\ncountries also have a history of\ncommon wars (Iran, Iraq, Syria,\nEgypt, parts of Lebanon and North\nAfrica...) and please, we a// know\nthat Muslims, like countless other\ngroups, have been kicked around\nand still get thrashed nowadays\u2014\nthis is in no way a private privilege,\nnor a reason to present them as\npassive victimised angels.\nPlease try to answer these\nquestions with as little dogma as\npossible that means without\nattributing too many desires and\nactions to God, about whom you'll\ndisagree forever with millions of\nother believers who all think they\nfollow the Final Message, the Real\nWay or whatever else.\nYours expectantly, Mr Crocky.\nand shake my head. 'Hmmm,' he\nreplies,'I 've seen a few people fall\ndown with those on their backs I can\ntell you.' He begins to list all the\nequipment he would carry with him\nin the field, fighting so that I'd be\nable to live in a country where\npeople like him are free to walk the\nstreets. 'Oh yes, and Billy we never\nsaw him again, after Lyons'. Then\nhe looks at me and I know whats\ncoming. Good grief, we're only\nseconds away from Clapham\nJunction. 'Billy? Billy? It cant be\nyou can it?' Damn right it can't. 'You've grown your hair you old\ndandy but...' I run.\nThe bus. I'm upstairs on my final\nleg. If you ever need to find a madman look to the top left seat of\na London double decker. A portly\nold black gentleman begins tapping\nhis feet and miming a harmonica\nsolo, then launches into a heart\nbreaking drunk rendition of 'Season\nof the Blues'. And I'm thinking of\nthe government which has\nabandon ded these people on the\nstreets, to take their own lonely\nroads, all of which lead to London.\n'Care in the Community'! It has the\nsame ring as 'Barmiztvah in a pork\nshop'. While I'm wondering who's really mad, John Lee Hooker the\nSecond stamps his foot and wails\n'Now it's the Season - uh uh yeah\n- for the Blues'. Too right.\nA Slice of Life\nOwain Benna/IacJc\nIt took Odysseus ten years to get\nback from Troy. The man didn't know his own luck. A few wailing\nwitches and a one eyed sheep herder\nand suddenly half his ships are\nbubbling under the Adriatic. Now\nif those hardy Greeks had the\nmisfortune to require the use of\npublic transport en route -disembarking at Ithaca special\nwheelchair ramps and\nZimmerframes would have been\ncalled for, before the brave but\ngeriatric sailors returned to their old\ncastle. There Odysseus finds his\nwife, not on the point of being wed\nto another, but fumbling over the\nbathroom sink, simultaneously\nadjusting her dentures and\nexamining her great great grand\ndaughter for head lice. And I'm assuming he wasn't travelling at\nautumn, with leaves on the line\ndelaying his journey until the\ncoming of the Roman Empire.\nI know I should be tolerant but\nit's just I would so much rather\nmeet ad is gr untied Minatour, travel\ncard in cloven hand, at Gloucester\nRoad tube station than the loonies\nI bump into. They scare me.\nWednesday was simply a rollercoaster ride through human\ninstability. Just getting home, a forty five minute journey, brought\nme into contact with most of the\nrejects from 'One flew over the\nCuckoo's nest'.\nThey were mainly harmless mind\nyou. Well, excepting Damien.\nDamien is the name we shall give\nto the young gentleman who sat\nnext to me on boarding the Circle\nLine train. Damien wore black.\nOnly black. Fine, so do I sometimes. His arms were exposed.\nThey looked like he'd decided green\nwas not an appropriate skin colour\nand had clumsily attempted to paint\nover them with a thin coat of Dulux\n'Snow White'. The result was a less\nwell known shade - Dulux 'Walking\nDead'. He had 'ta to oed'( they\nlooked more like machete scars...)\non each for arm some rather natty\nupturned Crucifix's. On his coat\nwas a badge with 'Charles Manson'\nem blaze ned across it, the names of\nhis victims written beneath. At\nVictoria I got ready to leave.\nDamien turned to face me, head\nvibrating with the headphone d Death Thrash he was pumping into\nit, and gave a long low moan that\nreminded me that one day I was\ngoing to die, and Damien would\nprobably rather like to be present.\nOkay so I survive, and make it to\nplatform nine. Enter stage left an\nold Asian woman, carrying an\nempty picture frame. Now Damien\nwasn't mad, his parents had just let\nhim watch dr iller killer at too tender\nan age. As the lady placed the\npicture frame to my face, nodded\nthoughtfully and then howled into\nthe air before shuffling off to repeat\nthe trick I mused about whether it\nwas possible to somehow sense a video nasty through the walls of the\nwomb. She was completly out of it.\nAnd not one of the commuters was\nin the s lig he st bit perturbed.\nSo I'm sitting at the back of the\ncarriage, trying to think of any evil\ndeeds I'd done that morning, and\nhalf expecting Jeremy Beadle to\nturn and give me his devilish grin.\nAn old chap comes and sits next to\nme. He seems normal enough and\nthe train trundles out of Victoria.\nIt's over the Thames that he reveals\nhis true and half expected colours.\nSpying the coarse hessian rucksack\nI carry he says 'Ah, now that's an\nold para issue isn't it?' I think it's a copy, but I'm not sure so I nod\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\n24 March 1993 Felix 963\nThe Clinton Factor\nAs fireworks burst over Pennsylvania Avenue, the Labour Party looked\nWest for inspiration. Would the Clinton Factor help ? Could the party\nreform? Would John Smith ever win an election? Mimi Chakraborty\nlooks into the future...and prop he sises doom.\nFourteen years in the doghouse is\nalways bad for morale, and the\nparty John Smith has inherited have\nreasons to be seriously depressed.\nA record fourth election defeat\ntakes some explaining and for\nLabour, answers haven't been easy\nto find. It's not that the party was\nunpopular, it's not that people\ndidn't like them, it's just that for the\nfew nanoseconds in April when they\nslipped behind the Tories in the\npolls some mean person came along\nand called an election. Once it was\nall over, they leapt back into the\nlead again and have scarcely looked\nback since. A few short months\nafter he became his own man, John\nMajor set about exploring the\nterritory of negative popularity,\ngoing where no man had gone\nbefore. No wonder the defeat was\nso hard to swallow.\nAlmost a year on, however,\nLabour seem set upon bungling the\nnext election as well, by dint of\nsimply not bothering to change.\nHaving failed to capital is e on the\nTories new Kamikaze-style of\ngovernment, the party fell all over\nitself in the rush to squabble about\n'Clintonisation'. From the reactions\nof some, one could be forgiven for\nthinking that this was a process\nwhich compelled paid-up members\nof the Party to have 'Bill is my hero'\ntattooed across their foreheads. The\nidea of sending a delegation of\nshadow-cabinet ministers to meet\nClinton's top aides and gen up on\nHow To Win An Election After a Very Long Time seems modest by\ncomparison. However, it still\nprovoked howls of outrage from\nthose who saw the creeping hand of\nClintoriisation was nothing less than\nthe beginning of 'a battle for the\nsoul of the Labour Party'. These are\nexactly the people who John Smith\nwould like never to have to speak\nto again, but sadly they are all\nmembers of his own party.\nIf the traditionalists are unhappy,\nit was nothing compared to the\nmods, many of whom were\nmuttering loudly about the\nincompetence of the new\nleadership. In the months following\ntheir election John Smith and\nMargaret Becket found themselves\nfielding accusations of weak\nleadership, lack of direction and of\n'sleepwalking into electoral\noblivion'. These same months saw\nthe Tories lurch gracelessly from\none cal amato us decision to another\nand yet another still. After an\nun pre ci dented catalogue of\ndisasters; the retreat from the ERM; u turns over the pit closures;\nallegations over Matrix Churhill;\nDavid Mellor's affair; Norman\nLamont's cheque-card, house guest, drinking habits,...etc, it was said of\nthe Prime Minister that he had the\nuncommon ability to spot a crisis on\nthe horizon and lead his whole party\ninto it before most political pundits\nhad even realised it was there.\nAgainst an onslaught of better\nadvice, John Major stoically led by\nthe chin taking on apparently any\ncomers. In a clearly tactical\ndecision designed to shake up a party in danger of falling into a complacent snooze, Nice-Mr-Major\nled his party through a tableau-viva nt of Dante's seven circles of\nHell. Displaying masterful\nleadership not normally seen\nbeyond the lush fields of 'One Man\nand his Dog', the Prime Minister\nshepherded an increasingly\nbewildered flock into policy-collapse, party division, public\nfighting, media derision,\ninternational humiliation and at the\nvery point his party had its lowest\npopularity rating since the war, he\nthreatened it with a General\nelection.\nThe Tories didn't bother to stop\nwhen they saw a brick wall, they\njust went on going. A week began\nto look like a long time between\ncrises and increasingly incredulous\nhacks found themselves scrambling\nto keep up with a Prime Minister\nwho was always one disaster ahead.\nJohn Smith, whose debating talents\nlie in a somewhat forensic ability to\nde ssem ble rhetoric, found himself\nunexpectedly flailing and his skill\nirrelevant. With an a la-carte menu\nof pit closures, public interest\nimmunity certificates, hospital\nclosures, rail privatisation, dod gy arms-sales, rising unemployment,\nmedia-intrusions, royal taxes, he\nwas still unable to impose himself\non any of the debates. Increasingly\nthis failed to cheer Labour\nbackbencher s, who began to ask\neach other if anyone remembered\nvoting for him, and if so why.\nBryan Gould spoke of the party 're-considering its decision to elect\nJohn Smith', others chipped in with\n'failure of radicalism' and John\nPrescott's plea 'for God's sake give\nthe man a chance' had the effect of\nmaking a poor leader look even\nmore hopeless. What had gone\nwrong? John Smith had emerged as\nthe front-runner in the Labour\nleadership campaign even as Neil\nKinnock stepped off the platform on\nApril 9th. His eventual election on\nJuly 18th was only a formality. He\nhad planned to give his party time\nto recover from its defeat while\nintroducing a series of rolling\nreforms\u2014his 'new plan for a new\ncentury', evidence that he inclined\ntoward the long view. Unhappily,\nhe tripped over the short view first,\nand in less than four months he\nseemed to have fallen flat on his\nface.\nTo be fair to John Smith, it was\nnever really his fault. He had been\nall set for combat with a man in a grey suit, who liked cricket and said\n'not in considerably' a lot. Nobody\ntold him when he took the job that\nthe real enemy would be a saxophone playing JFK look-a like\nfrom small-town America. When\nClinton won in November, it was\ndeath-by-comparison for John\nSmith. If the Tories support of the\nRepublican campaign was a blunder, the ensue ing acrimony still\nhad the happy result of shielding\nMajor from any direct counterpoint\nwith the new President. Not so the\nluckless Mr Smith, whose party\nheld a champagne bash at the\nDorchester to celebrate the\nPresidential inauguration. Labour\nhad forged links with its opposite\nnumber during the election also,\nand had presented themselves as\nbeing on the same side fighting the\nsame battles against the same\nenemy, and the party was to boast\na common victory. As a strategic\nmove this ranks with inviting your\ngirlfriend to meet a distant\ncousin\u2014who happens to be\nfabulously sexy, incredibly\npowerful and America's most\npopular person\u2014and then hoping\nyou're the one she still wants to go\nout with.\n\n"

But enough of this\nmindless banter, onto the band. The\nFat Lady Sings are, in stature,\nshort. Very. And they feature\nseventies man, complete with\ndancing shoes,as their keyboard\nplayer. I felt quite superior in my\nusual smug manner. But having\nbeen away for many a moon, they\nexhibited a quite understandable, if\nnot totally popular, desire to play\nsome new material, just playing an\nold song 'when we think you're\ngetting totally hacked off. And of\nthis new material my undoubted\nfavourite was a nifty little tune\ncalled 'Drunkard Logic', along with\nMint400,3% Minutes \u2014 Power haus 'To Begin at the Beginning,' wrote\nDylan Thomas. He was sadly\nmistaken.

Bitter and twisted, the last\nthing I want to see, the last thing I deserve is another dose of 3'A fucking Minutes.\nThey seem to follow me around.\nI saw them support Kingmaker\n(who?), had the single rammed\ndown my throat, and then suffered\nfellow Irish band, Hothouse\nFlowers' cover, 'Love Don't Work\nThis Way' (and they thought I wouldn't notice that one).\nBut, as I was asked, 'Have they\ngot any better?' No ,they haven't. This was proved by the final song\nof the set, their raison d'e tre, 'Arclight'. It's always been\nmajestic, but it's been more exalted\nbefore, than tonight, where it\nsounded drowned in over powering\ndrums at the start, and too quiet at\nthe end. No, The Fat Lady Sings\nhaven't got any better, but that\ndoesn't mean they're no good.\nThey're good, but they're not any\nbetter.

If 'creep'\nwas just a one-hit wonder, as the\nband introduces it as, is there\nanything more we can expect from\nthem? Radiohead's most noticeable\nmusical direction is the contrast in\nvolume employed between verse\nand chorus. This is taken to the\nextreme with an introductory\nsolitary bassline, drums and\nwhispering vocals whilst after a couple of phrases the rest of the\nband crash in creating a rather\nfrenzied but impressive maelstrom\nof noise.\nHowever, even if such a song-structure is repetitive, it is of course\nwildly different from the lame nonentities on the scene at present.\nIndeed Radiohead pick up on this\nfor one of their main lyrical themes-'Pop is dead, long live pop, died a death of back catalogue.' Radiohead\nappear as the saviours of pop,\nwhich is very noble if they have the\nmusic to go with it.\nAnd after tonight, I think they\nhave. This is reinforced by their\nsomewhat frustrated character. As\nThorn Yorke sings, he screws up\nhis face, his rank, sheared hair\nfalling around him, whilst Jon\nGreenwood plays the guitar with the\nfretboard behind his head, or strums\nthe guitar against the plectrum.\nAnyone can play guitar, but only a few can play like Jonny Greenwood\nwithout grinding their knuckles to\ndust. Radiohead may be dominated\nby an extreme self-loathing, an\nalmost destructive ideal of one's So, in association with XFM( it's indie radio, not racial equality)\nwe're here to commiserate the\npassing of an auld enemy, the\nT& C2.

I 've told you all this before,\nif you don't get the message now,\nit'll be over your head forever. Eat.\nGorgeous. Heh, heh, heh, terrible\npuns, what do I care? I'm free, to\ndo what I want, any old time. Shut\nup, Shut up, I 'll do what I want to\ndo.\nLise Yates.\n\u2022 Eat play at the Phoenix festival\nin July, Stratford.\npersona-the bedraggled hair, taunt,\ntight clothes and watery eyes paint\na pitiful picture of destitution, yet\nbehind the horror there is a certain\nblack humour which prevents the\naffair from becoming a degraded\nmorbid show for the terminally\nunstable revealing a slight glimmer\nof hope. The band played\n'Rhinestone Cowboy' as the first\nencore, much to the amusement of\nthe crowd.\nThe highlight of the gig was the\nnew track 'Stop Whispering'.\nTypical guitar rifts with Thorn\nsharing his loneliness, his\ndifficulties with relating to other\npeople, his hatred of those that can,\nand his instinct that he should be\nseen but not heard. Anyway\nhalfway through the guitars totally\nfade out followed by the bass and\ndrums whilst Thorn sings 'doesn't matter anyway'. Then silence and\nThorn screeches ' FUCK YOU'. The hatred, pain and outright\nopenness of this made everyone step\nback, open their eyes and smile. We\nlove Radiohead, we thought. We\nwant to wrap him up and put him\nto bed and read him a story and look\nafter him. Then the guitars are off\nagain, racing through an explosion\nof energy, the crowd is moshi ng and I am beaming at the beauty of\nit all.\nRadiohead are all love and all\nhate, they are the ugly ducklings of\npop, with standard raised they are\nready to rescue the crumbling scene\nthat is British music.

Given the\nlikelihood of our being grossly\noutnumbered, we are not inclined\nto accept their challenge.\nWe would like to make it clear\nthat we do not have any objections\nto those who practice Islam. Indeed\nwe would broadly support a 'free\nmarket' in religion, it being purely\na matter of personal preference.\nGreek uproar\nHowever, the attempts by some\nof the more fundamentalist types to\noutline the alleged benefits of their\nundemocratic integrated political,\neconomic and judicial system by\nslating our own democracy and\nindigenous religious institutions, are\nalso offensive.\nWe cannot help commenting on\nAbdullah's observation (Felix 959)\nthat there are only 95,000\nmillionaires in Britain.

If you are puzzled I do\nsym pathis e, but please refer to the\nTurkish history to see the origins of\nthe word Greek.\nComing back to Ersin Akartuna's article, my curiosity was exceeding\nmy resentment for such insults and\nalso I tried to see the reasoning that\nfollowed. Hence my thinking too\nthe following 'paths' of reasoning:\nIn the Hellenic religion, Jesus\nChrist declares that no man should\nanswer violence back with violence\nyet if I am not mistaken, the Koran,\nevery unbeliever of the Moslem\nfaith should be treated with the\nsword and total an nihOa tion. Then\nI remembered an incident two years\nago in Istanbul, where a whole\ntourist bus of Hellens visiting the\ncity, was put on fire by a Turkish\nfanatic, and 32 people, including\ntwo children were burned to death\nsince they could not escape from the\nbus.\nFinally I also re meme red all these\nUN accusations about the Turkish\nestablished Greek community (tens\nof thousands killed; 1,300,000\ndeported\u2014date given by French\nhistorian Castellan).\nAs for Cyprus, the Treaty of\nGuarantee allowed a punctual\nintervention, upon the condition of\nboth Greece's and Britain's agreement, for the uphold of the\nConstitutional order. Not only the\nConstitutional order had not been\nbroken to justify an intervention,\nbut the Turks, by their invasion and\noccupation of 40% of the Cypriot\nterritory from 1974 to this day\n(which differs from an\n'intervention' in a big way),\ndestroyed Constitutional order\npermanently. Also, nothing at all\ncan justify the killing of 4,500\nGreek Cypriot civilians and the\nuprooting of a further 200,000\n(fully documented by the UN, Amnesty International and other\nhuman rights monitoring groups, in\ncontrast the the Turkish claims of\n'Greek massacres'). How about\ntoday, after 19 years of occupation?\nAre you still re-establishing the\nConstitutional order (in contempt\nfor the UN Resolutions which\ncondemn you)?\nYours faithfully,\nEmmanuel Saradakis, Physics\nPhD, on behalf of the Hellenic\nSociety.\nBarry's funeral was attended by\nmany of his friends and colleagues\nfrom Imperial. Tributes came from\nboth academic and administrative\nstaff, apprentices and students.\nGraham, Lesley, Robert and I feel\nvery proud of Barry's contribution\nto education at Imperial College.\narmy attacking constantly the\nKurdish tribes in their territory, and\nmassacre ing Kurdic villages.\nAll the above, as you understand,\ncame in strong contrast to the above\nnamed article, especially since I have never heard, seen hints of such\nbehaviour in my country. And then\nin the midst of all this puzzlement,\nI finally grasped the point of the\narticle!\nErsin Akartuna's article was a try\nfor jest! Thus relieved, please\nconvey my best wishes to Ersin\nAkartuna, for she has actually lifted\nup my mood considerably today.\nYours sincerely,\nGeorgia Sigala (PG 1).\n\n"

In Issue 962 of Felix an\ninterview with Mr Hancock was\npublished, this was ruled to have\ncontravened the regulations of the\nelection. In a compromise move,\nthe elections committee then ruled\nthat Mr Hancock would be allowed\nto stand as a candidate and answer\nquestions, but not give a speech to\nGUC.\nThis held until the speeches for\nthe post started, and the barring\nfrom the post took place. Confusion\nreigned for at least an hour and a half while speakers, including other\ncandidates for the same post and\nUL U sabbaticals, demanded that\nMr Hancock be allowed to put his\ncase.

He\nsaid he was very pleased but\nbelieved that his policies had been\nresponsible for his victory.\nIn a separate contest the post of\nUL U President was won by Simon\nRix.

    "content": "Felix 963\n'eat ure24 March 1993\nAs Clinton made his inaugural\nspeech, champagne corks popped\nand all eyes were fixed on the\nsatellite link-up. The Labour party\nhad been given front-row,\ncomplementary, velvet-lined seats\nand the picture they were watching,\nwas \"The way we might have been'.\nIf John Smith can't deliver the\ngoods then he will be given the hoof\nby someone who can. The most\nserious challenges to himself and\nMargaret Beckett come inthe shape\nof Tony Blair (Shadow Home\nSecretary) and Gordon Brown\n(Shadow Chancellor).\nTony Blair is very bright and\nstreetwise\u2014he recently said 'Hell'\non Walden, and talked\nauthoritatively about 'sex' in a letter\nto the Sunday Times. In a debate on\nterrorism recently he had Tory\nbulldog Kenneth Clarke giggling\nnervously as he saw his chances of\nbecoming Britain's next-Chancellor\nvisibly wither. Blair's rapier t hurst s into the Home Secretary drew cries\nof delight from Labour's back\nbenches. Beside him, John Smith\nand Margaret Beckett looked on,\ndoubtless proud, but for all that,\nthey looked a little glum. In another\nlife Blair might have been their\nclever young son, who had come\nback from university full of newfangled ideas and now no longer\ntreated them with the respect they\ndeserved.\nGordon Brown is also very clever\nand often looks very cross.\nAlthough he makes Labours' plans\nfor the economy sound dull, he will\nbe able to wake people up by hitting\nthem with a big mallet. These are\nthe things people need to know\nabout future party leaders. Blair has\nrepeatedly called for galvani sing new policies which is also nice to\nknow. Recently they both went to\nWashington to meet top Clinton\naides. They learnt some valuable\nlessons; Bill Clinton was elected\nbecause people liked him. In order\nto make people like you you must\ntell them what they want to hear.\nClinton promised everybody\neverything, and he played the\nsaxophone as well. If the Haitians\nhave to stay at home and he has to\nraise taxes, the comforts of the Oval\noffice will help take the e dee off his\nidealistic despair. (The Tories have\nknown this for a long time. Even\nwhen there is a recession at election\ntime they never mention it.) Both\nBlair and Brown are part of the\ngeneration of Labour MP's who\nhave never experienced\ngovernment. This means that when\nthey are hauled up by Messrs\nPrescott, Dobson and Skinner, (on\nthe subject of Labour's historic past\nlinks with the unions, municipal\nownership, socialism) they will be\nable to pretend not to remember.\nThis may make some people bitter,\nbut everyone else will understand.\nResisting the temptation to ditch\nSmith over the nearest cliff\nLabour's progressives stepped up\ndemands for 'radical new policies'.\nRight behind them thundered the\nold guard threatening that the party\nwas 'too right wing' and that there\nhad better not be 'too many new\nbloody policies'. Charting the\ndelicate path between the leadership\nlaunched 'The Commission for\nSocial Justice'. This was an\nindependent review of all aspects of\nSocial Policy, including the\nuniversality of benefits with\nreference to a demographically\nchanging society. It had never been\neasy to make the Citizen's Charter\nlook like a really Big Idea, but\nwhere Downing Street policy\nadvisers and hard-man William\nWaldegrave failed, the 'new\nBeveridge report' stepped in to do\nthe trick. Theoretically it should be\ndifficult to disagree with a report\nwhich promises everything, but not\nfor the Labour party. Though the\nidea was almost fainting with its\nown worthiness, the fact that it\nwouldn't deliver until 1994 and then\nmight throw out some of Labour's most sacred principles meant that\nlike the dregs of an old box of\nQuality Street, there was something\nto disappoint everybody.\nThis is John Smith's big problem;\nhow to reconcile the irreconcilable,\nhow to hold within the arms of one\nparty those whose motto is\n'Downing Street and don't spare the\nhorses' and those whose motto is\n'Everyone must go back to the old\ndays'. In edging toward the middle\nground he runs the risk of bumping\ninto Mr Major, and with talk of\n'rights and freedoms of the\nindividual, they could even swap\nspeeches. Both have recently given\nkeynote addresses to the party\nfaithful, and the temptation to rattle\non at length was resisted by neither.\nMr Major spoke wistfully about\nvillage bakeries, and threw in some\nhigh-Tory paternalism which\ndoubtless held his Carlton Club\naudience (average' age seventy-plus)\nin thrall.\nMr Smith tried to engage in\npromoting policies which were both\nin div u a list and collective whilst\nignoring any inherent contradiction.\nBoth shared similar themes in some\nrespects. The problems of timeshare\npolicy; on Europe; on Health and\non Social Policy are more damaging\nto Labour than to the\nConservatives, since Labour have\nless room to manoeuvre.\nIf the sight of Blair and Brown\ndiscussing 'New Paths To Victory'\nwith American spin-doctors does\nnot worry John Smith, then the sight\nof Robin Cook sipping dry white\nwine along side them should. Cook\nis one of the most impressive of the\nshadow cabinet, not least because\nof his ability to maul any\ngovernment minister who falls in\nhis way\u2014he is said to 'look like\nLenin, though without his sense of\nhumour,' and he has warned that\nLabour may never win and election\nagain. He has never stood for a leadership position himself on the\ngrounds that he is not populist, but\nhaving managed both Kinnock and\nSmith's campaign for the\nleadership, he may well be\npreparing to play bridesmaid for a third time.\nJohn Smith may be left to play out\na period of usefulness, and then be\nchallenged some time in 1994. To\nBlair's advantage are his youth and\nobvious ambition. Clinton may\nhave entered Washington on a bus,\nbut Blair and Brown availed\nthemselves of a stretch limo with all\nmod cons. They need n't worry, it\nis just this kind of rapacity which\nwill attract votes. People who want\ncars will vote for people who have\ngot them.\nOf course, even Blair and Brown\nmay not be successful, as Britain\ncautiously noses out of the\nrecession, the next four years can\nbe expected to deliver modest\ngrowth. As other European\ncountries are heading into decline;\nGermany has broken its back over\nre-unification costs; France seems\nracked up on high interest rates it\ncannot afford; even the mighty\nJapanese are paying the price for\ngross Capital expenditures of the\nlate eighties. Britain has at least\nweathered most of the worst. Four\nyears down the line things may look\na little brighter for the Tories, who\nknows? Either way whether it is\nSmith or Blair, or someone else\nleading the Labour party, it will be\nimpossible to ignore that this party's future hangs over the edge of the\nabyss.\nPage 13\n\n"

One down, three to go.\nBut in all of this they've retained\none vital recognisable\ncharacteristic. They're still crap.\nThousand Yard Stare, on the\nother hand, have not mutated.\nThousand Yard Stare run through\npretty much the same set we'd seen\na couple of weeks previous at the\nBlue Aeroplanes, Kingmaker\n- UL U, Friday\nAt last, I deem myself worthy of\npassing the pearly gates into the true\ninner sanctum of Felixdom. (I do\nthe deeming around here, mate y M. Ed.) I have followed the three\nrules of any hack attending a show:\nstand at the back and don't smile,\ndon't clap at the end of a tune and\nturn up late to all shows or leave\nearly. Then you're hard, cool and\nhave earned your press pass.\nRespect.\nSo here I am, long b wac k coat,\nsipping me brown, having missed\nthe first band and arrived half way\nthrough the Kingmaker set. Excuses\nall round, my wisdom tooth was\ngiving mo teething pain. Heh, this\nis 1993 and life is great, just like\nFrosties. Digression, the essence of\nChaucer.\nThree men on an empty stage,\nsomething was missing, just what\nwas it. Robert Mitchum smiles at\nthe great pretender. Loz sings about\nreal things that affect everybody and\nthe indie bop kids nick his beer and\njump off the stage. Bloody kids. I was in 'Nam me, '69. I heard\n'When Lucy's Down' but the rest\nwas new material. Most of it was\ntypical pop riffs that don't inspire\nme to write anything.\nThe Blue Aeroplanes, by\ncontrast, were remarkably good.\noT Camden Palace. 'No score, after\nextra time' opens, with assorted\nother gems from 'Hands On', and\na few new numbers thrown in for\ngood measure. Thousand Yard\nStare are about a thousand times\nbetter than Airhead.\nVoice Of The Beehive. So good\nI can't think of anything to say. I was suitably sweaty afterwards,\nwhich is always a good evaluation\nof the gro ovi ness quotient of a good\ngig. Voice Of The Beehive are even\nbetter than Thousand Yard Stare.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Thousand Yard Stare's collection of early material, 'Fair\nTo Middling' is out now on Stifled\nAardvark/Polydor.\nThe set starts with the band hidden\nbehind a polythene sheet upon\nwhich their shadows are projected\nthrough a wall of smoke. This\ncurtain is promptly pulled down\nafter an older crowd have\nrecognised the song. Then we're\naway. There are four guitarists- the\nentire band family and road crew must have been hired. At one point\nthe drummer plays guitar. There is\nalso a dancer. Oh no I think,\nanother Bez, Boz, Baz tw at. Yet I am wrong, the dancer is a great\naddition to the set.\nThe Blue Aeroplanes are a great\nlive act. Their originality is\noutstanding. They break all the\nrules, write decent songs, employ\nthe bouncer as guitarist, throw\nflowers at the audience, and totally\nenthral the audience. For their first\nsong of the set, the female member\nplays and sings a solo ballad tided\n'Separated'. She introduces it as the\nsong the rest of the band wanted her\nto play as she was the only female\nin the group. Totally unprepared for\nthis, she apologise s for her first\nmistake and starts again. Total\nshowmanship. This band were\ngreat, buy their albums, sing their\npraises but most important of all, go\nsee them.\nRalph\nAlbums\nPutting our House In Order (POHIO) is a registered charity set\nup to help the homeless.

He wants us to\nknow that.

So\nhere's the first, the previously\ndeleted EP2, in all its glory on the\nsecond of an oh-so commercial two-cd pack. The first contains a re-recording of 'Fashion Crisis...' and\na live version of 'Time', and\nassorted other tracks dragged from\nthe past, which you, as an astute\nreader of our reviews, have already\nbought, correct?\n(For those of you who foolishly\nignored our recommendations,\n'Fashion Crisis...' is probably The\nFrank & Walters best single,\nexcepting 'After All', a pristine\nblast of nonsense which takes at\nleast two weeks of constant listening\nto decipher.)\nTold you so.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Out on Go! Discs, April 5.\nare so laid back they're horizontal.\n'I need a joint' is sweet jazz/soul to\nmake you weep\u2014here and\nelsewhere the sounds almost negate\nthe strong words.\nI couldn't believe the difference\nbetween the sound and the\nsentiment. It's mellow, thought-provoking stuff. As a dance record\nthere is much to dance to, it's music\nto think with\u2014not to rave with. The\ninstructions say that after you've\nlistened to the words for a couple\nof playing s then 'pump up the bass\nand volume and rock this shit'\u2014It\ndoesn't fit...\nAl Mac.\n1 0 , 0 0 0 Maniacs \u2014 Candy Everybody Wants A creep in' from the looming forest\ncome the 10,000 Maniacs,\nclutching singles from their latest\nLP 'Our Time in Eden'. A jaunty\naffair this after the shiny doom of\ntheir previous stuff. Which is not to\nsay that 'Candy Everybody Wants'\nis your usual easy stocking filler.\nRather it floats on either a crackling\ntune and the general all-round\nexcellence of leader Natalie\nMerchant.\nThe other single tracks give\nglimpses of their other sides. The\nliterate ly tipping of hat in 'Jack\nKerouac' and homely portrait of\n'My Sister Rose' are as good a range as you can hope to get of the\nworld according to Maniacs. A fine\nplace to pass the day, believe me.\nTintin.\n\u2022 Released on Electra.\nA Certain Ratio and Denise\nJohnson \u2014 Turn Me On Five remixes that are surprisingly\ndifferent enough deserve to be on\nthe same CD. Only the 7\" 'Edit' is\na bit bollocks, but I normally find\n7\" isn't enough to 'turn me on'.\nAll the other tracks are pretty\nfunky. Thumping bass and sweet\nsinging, perhaps what would be\ndescribed today as 'New Power\nSoul', or just good old Soul II Soul\nstyle. The tune is definitely\nreminiscent of Soul II Soul,\nespecially track four\u2014'Primetime\nMix', which sounds like Soul 27\nSoul on a New Jack Swing trip.\nThe nicest track is track five\n'M21 Mix', it's a bit more 'chill'\nand a bit adventurous. She does get\nturned on right at the end if you\nknow what I mean. OK this isn't especially original but the sound of\nher sparking up right at the end is\na nice touch.\nIf you're into this kind of music,\nbuy it. Sounds good in the sunshine.\nWish.\n\u2022 On Robs Records.\nPage 16\n\n"

    "content": "R Felix 963\ne views24 March 1993\nBrain dead Hoff a James R Hoffa as most of you may\nnot know was one of the most\nimportant figures to come out of the\nAmerican labour movement in the\nthirties. He shaped the history of the\nnation's most powerful labour\nunion, the International\nBrotherhood of Teamsters. This\nepic film follows the career of the\naforementioned figure over four\ndecades\u2014from his passionate\nstruggle for power to his final\nenigmatic fall.\nThe great man himself is played\nby Jack Nicholson, so effectively in\nfact that you soon forget about the\nFew Good Men and the Jokers and\nwatch, mes meri sed as Nicholson\n'becomes' Hoffa in what is surely\nhis greatest acting moment.\nSupported by such distinguished\nnames as Danny DeVito (who also\ndirects) and Armand Assaute (to\nname but two) this film has no\ntrouble persuading Joe Public that\nit means business.\nEverything revolves around an\nanonymous diner, standing alone on\na highway, somewhere in modern\nAmerica, and through the eyes of\nBobby Ciaro (DeVito), Hoffa's trusted friend, we are treated to\nflashbacks over Hoffa's career\nevery once in a while returning to\nthe diner, where the story\nprogresses. This works\nexceptionally well and other than\nbeing so refreshingly original is\ncarried out so innovative ly that this\nmust rank as one of the best films\nI have ever seen. Somehow I just\ndon't think it will get the credit it\nundoubtedly deserves. Why do I hear you ask? Well, it's just that this\nfilm has not been aimed at a British\naudience. Although most\nAmericans are as familiar with the\nname Hoffa as we are with\nThatcher, I couldn't help but feel\nslightly left out, wishing I'd known\nmore about the man before I saw the\nfilm.\nIf you enjoyed JFK, then you\nmust see this film, if only because\nit recreates the same sort of\natmosphere, if you didn't then it'll\nprobably bore you senseless.\nSome thought of Hoffa as a God,\nsome as the devil and opinion will\nbe divided about this film in a similar way, though I can't recommend it highly enough.\nMario.\nWhile spying on her son on his first\ndate at the zoo, Lionel's domineering mother is bitten by a rare monkey. The bite slowly\ntransforms her into a flesh-eating\nzombie (ring any bells?) and the\nmayhem begins.\nThis is the most gory film I 've\nseen in a long time; pulsating\ninternal organs, severed limbs and\nblood by the tanker full, combine\nto keep you on the brink of losing\nyour dinner right from the start.\nIt is also one of the funniest films\nI 've ever seen, the whole cinema\nwas falling around in the aisles so\nI 've got to recommend it to anyone\nlooking for a laugh.\nBeware, this film is only for those\nwith strong stomachs and I wouldn't advise having a big dinner before\nseeing it, you certainly won't want\nto eat afterwards!\nThere you go, fin.\nIan.\nSommers by The moment Jack Sommersby\n(Richard Gere) returns from the\nCivil War, to reclaim his life after\na seven year absence, he brings\ndramatic change to his home town\nand everyone in it. His wife, Laurel\n(Jodie Foster), cannot believe that\nCandy man In inner city Chicago, there is a legend of a hook-handed killer\nnamed Candyman. This is the\nsubject of university student Helen\nLyle's( Virginia Masden) doctoral\nthesis. Her investigations lead her\nto an unsolved murder in a rundown tower block known as Cabrini\nGreen. There she finds the first\npiece of solid evidence - a giant\nmural of the killer's screaming head\n- and gradually the myth evolves\ninto uneasy reality.\nForget Nightmare On Elm Street,\nthis is a real horror movie. The\nemphasis is not so much on blood\nand sharp implements, although it\ndoesn't miss out on that, but more\non the breakdown of rationality and\ngradual weakening of Lyle, whose\nhard-faced attitude crumbles before\nCandyman (Tony Todd) and his\ndripping hook. The violence we are\nexposed to is terrifying without\nbeing particularly explicit, due to\nexcellent direction (from Bernard\nRose). Philip Glass provides an\nbrilliant, haunting soundtrack which\ncomplements Candyman's deep,\nechoing voice. Clive Barker has\nfinally realised that he should leave\nfilm making to others (after the\nawful Hellraiser trilogy) and stick\nto writing and producing. All the\nfuss about the recent spate of violent\nmovies has no foundation if they\ncontinue to be of this quality.\nAralia Elegantissima\nSommersby: coo\nher once difficult and violent\nhusband has come back a kind and\nloving man and neither can certain\nmembers of the community.\nThis 'epic tale of love, deception,\ndenial, hope and sacrifice' starts\npromisingly but quickly becomes\nboring. The photography which\ninvolves various shades of brown,\nand the 'epic ness' of the acting, is\na struggle to sit through. The only\nrousing moment was the hanging at\nthe end. Unless you worship the\nactors, go and see something more\ninteresting, like mud.\nAralia Elegantissima.\nCandyman: You give me a buzz\nPage 21\n\n"

Don't be so parochial. So what if I want\nto review books written for the 3-6\nage group? There's an important\nmarket to be tapped out there. Now\nthat Imperial College Union has\ndone the right thing by the Day\nNursery with the type of legal\nopinion last seen in the Maastricht\ndebate last month, we have to cater\nfor our younger members. It also\nmeans I get a few cheap presents to\ndistribute when I go home at Easter.\nAt a rough stab, The Wizard,\nthe Fairy and the Magic Chicken\nis for the younger of the age band,\nanything from 3-5 years. It starts\nwith promise. There once lived a Wizard, a Fairy and a Magic\nChicken. Each thought, 7 am the\ngreatest in the world' and tried to\noutdo the others. And each was\njealous of the other two. And that\nspelled trouble, a lot a trouble....\nStations of the Tide by Michael Swanwick This is a strange book. Well written\nand readable yet somehow it does\nnot suck you into the plot.\nThe plot is good. A story of an\nextensive galactic civilisation where\nthe spread of high technology onto\nunder-developed worlds is\ncontrolled. However, an item of\ncontraband technology has been\ntaken by Gregorian back to his\nhome planet of Miranda and the\nBureaucrat has been sent to retrieve\nit.\nFirst he must find Gregorian, and\nthis is essentially what the book is\nabout. The man has a God-like\nstatus and following, and finding\nhim is difficult and dangerous.\nThe characters are not being\nforced from one situation to another\nwith ne bul us plot links as you might\nexpect in books of this genre. But\nthe plot moves naturally along and\nthe characters come nearer their\ngoal.\nAn original and descriptive book,\nbut lacking some pace and urgency,\nwhich could make it a nice Sunday\nafternoon read.\nSteven Newhouse.\n\u2022 Published by Legend, \u00a34.99.\nOK, I lied. It isn'ta work of\nchildren's fiction after all. It's a well researched, carefully\ndocumented account of the\nworkings of the senior management\non the 5th floor. Substitute the\nCashier, the Stocktaker and\nLieutenant Khartoum as you wish.\n'MY wand has a PICKLE on it, 'said\nthe Magic Chicken'. Just like\nCollege executive, with that turkey\nexplaining how he's going to solve\nthe pickle cause by the purchase of\nClayponds and the non-sale of\nMontpellier, for example. 7 can\nkiss a pig,' said the Wizard.

'RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!'\nthey shouted. As seems to be the\nnorm with kiddies books, this one\nis vibrantly coloured, rather like the\nnew breed of university chemistry\ntexts. Purple is used rather well,\nand the ferocious monster looks\nrather benevolent, even\nChancelloroftheExchequer like.\nThe front of Prehistoric\nPinkerton shows a large,\nMarmaduke (Hussey?) -like dog\ndreaming about being a dinosaur,\nwhich seems to be hatching, well,\npups. This unusual lesson in animal\nreproduction aside (bit like Alien,\nThe Butcher Boy,\nby Patrick McCabe A measure of this book's brilliance\ncan be gauged by Neil Jordan\n(producer of 'The Crying Game')\nbuying its film rights. The book was\nthe 1992 winner of the Irish\nTimes/Aer Lingus prize for fiction\nand is published, appropriately\nenough, on St Patrick's Day (17th March).\nThe story centres on a boy,\nFrancis Brady, growing up in a small rural town in Ireland in the\n1960s. Small events and childhood\njealousies combine to lessen his grip\non reality. Thus begins a gradual\ndescent into his own fantasy world\nwhich is very selective about what\nit incorporates from the real world.\nIt is an inherently tragic story, but\nis very wryly amusing when Francis\noffers his opinions on facets of Irish\nlife (especially the Church!). This\nbook will leave a lasting impression\non you that far outweighs its\nbrevity. It shall take its place among\nthe classics of modern Irish\nliterature.\nI just hope that Tom Cruise\ndoesn't get the lead role in the film.\nGM Ingram\n\u2022 Published by Picador, \u00a35.99\nreally), the large dog appears to\nhave teething problems, which\nenable him to become a bit of a beaver and eat trees. Oh, it's a Great Dane pup, is it? First we had\nthe Budweiser Clydesdales, now we\nhave the Carlsberg Pups.\nI instinctively dislike kids' books\nwith the words 'stegosaurus' or\n'diplodocus' in them. The portrayal\nof the natural historian in the book\nis a nice example of how not to do\nit. It is no wonder scientists\ncomplain. Firstly, the dinosaur\nspecialist is called\n'Zandorfosaurus', which doesn't roll off the average five year old\ntongue with great ease. Then, he is\ndescribed as devoting all his life to\ncollecting bones. Great. That will\ninspire kids up and down the land.\nThe drawings show him as some\nsort of fat, idiotic dentist, and given\nthe sympathy of children is going\nto be with the dog, it doesn't help\nto have him shout, firstly, What are\nthose children doing? No one is\npermitted to approach the skeleton,\nand then It's a dog. Alert the pound!\nSurround the mongrel. This is all\ntopped off with that beautiful\ndialogue,\n- That's absurd. The museum\nwouldn't think of displaying a common tooth!\n- This is the closest you will come\nto meeting a real dinosaur, and\nA Morning For Flamingos by James Lee Burke\nA routine assignment transporting\ntwo prisoners to their executions\ngoes fatally wrong when they try to\nescape. Dave Robicheaux is\nbrutally wounded and is set on\nrevenge.\nIn an attempt to recover his own\nsense of self, he is persuaded by the\nDE A to go undercover as a drug\ndealer in New Orleans. His life\nquickly becomes a nightmare as he\nbecomes increasingly involved in\nthe life of a mafia don. The\nmysteries of Cajun voodoo magic\nadd another twist to the story.\nThe drugs and detection are\nmixed in with the family life of\nRobicheaux, his Vietnam\nexperiences and the injustice and\npersecution felt by the 'people of\ncolor in southern Louisiana'.\nJames Lee Burke has a very vivid\nstyle of writing, with the ability to\nconjure up a perfect image in only\na few words. This along with the\ncontrasting violence and personal\ntouches makes this one of the best\ndetective novels I have read in quite\nsome time\nBland\n\u2022Arrow \u00a35.99\nPinkerton (the brute on paws) is a lot friendlier.\nI wouldn't buy this one, thanks.\nStick with the chicken.\nBodhran\n\u2022 Published by Macmillan\nPicturemac,\nboth \u00a33.99 ea.\nNicola by Nicola Owen This is a true story: the PMS case\nthat made legal history. Maybe I was the wrong person to read this,\nbeing male and not having\npersonally experienced PMS( premenstrual syndrome), but I was\ninterested nonetheless.\nThe describes the life of Nicola who\nup to the age of 14 was a successful\ndancer, hard working and a bright,\nhappy girl in a just as successful\nfamily. Things then started to go\nwrong. Her relationship with her\nmother turned sour; she began to\novereat and then force herself to\nvomit; she went to a dance school\nthen gave up dancing and she ran\naway from home. By the time she\nwas 18 she was in Holloway Prison\nbeing charged with arson on two\naccounts, endangering life and\nintent to kill. Whilst in prison she\nhad attempted suicide by slashing\nher wrists, hanging herself and\ndrowning. The doctors,\npsychiatrists and lawyers were\nready to send her to Broadmoor for\nthe criminally insane.\nHowever, her parents worked long\nand hard showing much love for\nnicola, trying to prevent this. Her\nmother, Pam, was the one who kept\npointing out that Nicola's life had\nonly changed so dramatically since\nher periods had started. They found\na doctor (female) who could help.\nFor the last four years of her life\nshe had been various tranquillizers\nthat had no effect other than\nremoving her from reality or\nturning her into a zombie. The cure\nfor Nicola's problem was described\nas a miracle ('though today it is\nknown as the 'pill'), as not much\nwas really understood about PMS.\nThe book is fairly well written apart\nfrom the opening of the first couple\nof chapters which nearly made me\nput the book down before I'd started. However, as I got into it I found myself pulled into Nicola's life. It's a good book which has\ngiven me some insight into the\nnightmare which women can suffer\nfrom, 'though it also left me quite\nbemused.\nGBH\n\u2022 Published by Corgi, \u00a34.99\nPage 18\n\n"

When\nit is a meeting of the most\negocentric personalities in the\nUniversity of London, productive\ndebate is not on the cards. Last\nTuesday's meeting of GUC, the\nGeneral Union Council of the\nUniversity of London students'\nunion went far beyond this.\nIt was not the votes upon votes\nupon votes, or the quoting obscure\nstrictures from a mystical little\ngreen book, even the fact that the\nballot boxes for one election closed\nbefore any candidate had a chance\nto speak, it may have been that half\nan hour was spent discussing\nwhether men should be permitted to\nvote in the women's officer\nelection, but it wasn't. What really\ngaulle d was the fact only ten people\nfelt they had the right to impose all\nof this on the rest of the meeting.\nEvery time an issue was raised,\nthe same faces felt they had to stand\nup, rather like watching a human\nmerry-go-round of wooden,\ngarishly painted models\ncontinuously enjoying the sound of\ntheir own voices. Unfortunately, if\nyou did want to speak and you\nweren't deeply personally aqua in ted with the chair of the meeting, you\ndid not stand a chance.\nThe only moment in which\nfreedom of speech reared its ugly\nhead was when Sharon Redrobe,\npresident of Royal Veterinary\nCollege, forced her way to the\nmicrophone to complain about not\nbeing allowed to speak, which was\na fair point, but only added to the\ngeneral chaos.\nHow can this body expect to\nFelix 963\nrepresent the students of London?\nThe few that control and run UL U are elected from the odd one or two\nwho bother to turn up to GU C. Generally, they are sabbaticals or\nheavily involved in internal politics,\nso spend most of their time\nperpetuating the backstabbing and\ninfighting that takes place at GUC.\nThe few good things that do get\ndone, are hidden behind closed\ndoors so that they do not fall prey\nto some personal vendetta from\nsome other hack.\nIt is small wonder that colleges\nlike Imperial consider opting out of\nthe University of London, if this is\nthe best they have to offer. Bound\nup with a deeply undemocratic\nstructure, a building which is seen\nas a venue or a leisure centre and\nrepresentation of sixty thousand\nstudents by a self-centred clique, I doubt if the Univerisity of London\nUnion will continue in its present\nform for very much longer and\nOpinion\n24 March 1993\nGUC should seriously consider the\nneed for its own existence. And the\nsooner it does get its act in gear and\ndoes some serious restructuring, the\nsooner it will lose its well earned\nreputation as an ego supporting, CV\nboosting, small-minded coven of\nrejects from the real world.\nCredits\nNews: Declan, Andrew, David\nReviews: Sara, Mario, Richard,\nPhil, Kristine, Gareth, Poddy,\nJacob, Gareth Light all the\nreviewers Features: Every club\nand society at IC, Mimi, Sports:\nSarmad, Ismail\nThanks: Rose, Andy, Simon,\nJames, Declan, Steve D, Beccy,\nSteve N, Chris, Rick, Dom, Marc\nSwan, Ian Hodge, Greg, Dave\nCohen, and any one who this\nterm has tried to tame the\ncollating machine, I am eternally\nin your debt.\nPICjBY MIKE CHAMBERLAIN\nCat's Eyes\nThe winner of the competition\nhosted by IC Radio last week was\nRaggie from Physics.

Dodd\nSilwood sulk about elections\nDear Jonty,\nBy now everyone is doubtless\nsick of hearing about the elections,\nbut with the prospect of another one\nnext term for the Hon Sec I feel I should say something.\nSilwood Park this year was\ncompletely ignored by all who stood\nin the sabbatical elections, so if you\ngot elected well done, whoever you\nare. There was no information\navailable on any of the candidates\nfor any of the posts, a fact reflected\nin the news that even though there\nwas a40% turn out to vote at\nSilwood almost 80% of those that\nvoted opted for new election for all\nof the posts.\nThere aren't many votes at\nSilwood, I accept that, but like it or\nnot if you just got elected you are\nresponsible for us. Expecting you\nall to visit Silwood or to hold a hustings here is probably too much\nto ask (although a certain Chris\nDavidson once visited to canvas for\nvotes) but I don't think it is too\nmuch to expect some posters or\ninformation on the candidates. It\ndoesn't take much to put some\nposters in an internal envelope and\nsend them to Silwood I'm sure the\nUnion re pre se natives here would be\nonly too happy to pin them up.\nBefore you all accuse us of being\napathetic and not finding out for\nourselves about the elections just\nhave another quick look at 40% turn\nout to vote and compare it to the\naverage for the whole of Imperial.\nIf that is apathy then how would\nyour describe the candidates attitude\nto Silwood?\nJust to end on a bit of free advice\nfor anyone standing for the Hon Sec\npost, I know where there's about 40\nor 50 votes just waiting to be\nsnapped up if you can be bothered.\nNigel Vamdell (and anyone else\nwho voted new election at Siwood).\nPage 3\n\n"

Three days, and\na lot of beer, later they returned,\nfull of ideas and all clued up, keen\nto make Rag even bigger and better.\nTerm began, and just a few short\nweeks into term, so did Rag Week.\nComplete with the inevitable and\nunmissable Hit Squad, and even\nthose (dare I mention them)\ncontroversial Frontal lobotomy-o grams, plus a whole host of crazy\nevents, including the annual Dirty\nDisco, Slave Auction (yep, I bet\nmost of the slaves, like myself, still\nhaven't paid their debts!), and the\nBeer Festival. What more could you\npossibly desire?!\nA little further into term, Chris\nDavidson was cruelly murdered,\nsparking off a Londonwide search\nfor the culprits of this horrendous\ncrime. Teams even managed to\ncollect a little loose change as they\nComing up over Easter we have a whole load of thrilling collections,\nall listed below for your\nconvenience. If you know you'll be\naround for any of these and fancy\nlending a hand to shake a can, pop\nover to the Rag Office (no longer\na Rag Orifice, it's been tidied\nrecently!) and find the appropriate\nlist. Names have already been taken\nat last Friday's meeting, but there\nare still places left, so don't delay.\nMarch\n23rd Crystal Palace v Liverpool\n24th QPR v Blackburn Rovers.\n30th/31 st Jesus Jones, Oxfam\ncollection.\nA quick thanks go to Thresher\n(Gloucester Road branch) for\nproviding the prize for the Dirty\nDozen winning team - Falmouth\nKeogh, for those of you that have\nchased the killer.\nThroughout all this, the regular\nconcert and football match\ncollections, that have become so\nmuch a part of this year's Rag, have\nbeen continuing, allowing anyone\ninterested free entrance to Simply\nRed, B52s, and many more... All\nin all, a pretty good term, with\nanother one promising to follow\nclose on it's heels. What do we have\nlined up for next term? Well,\nknowing that this is traditionally the\ntime of year when everyone\nsuddenly remembers that they are\nsupposed to be doing a degree, and\nthat if they want to remain at\nImperial another year they need to\npass this one first, Rag will be\ntaking everything easy, as it were.\nThe main event of tenn will be Rag\nFete on May 12th, where at least 22\ncharities, plus various clubs and\nsocieties, will be running silly stalls\nsuch as a laser shoot, balloon race,\ngung e wrestling, and lots more. If\nyou are a member of a club that\nmight like to participate in this\nevent, contact Lorna or Rach in the\nRag Office soon ish.

No prizes for\nguessing that what Thresher kindly\ndonated was something to do with\nalcohol - two crates of something-to-do-with-alcohol, to be exact!\nOn Saturday 13th March, as\ntwenty-odd nervous people\nprepared to jump out of a perfectly\ngood plane in another part of the\ncountry, a handful of collectors set\noff for the wilds of Bristol on the\nsecond most daring expedition ever\nattempted by Rag. Accompanied by\na man-, nay, collector-sized, panda\nsuit and a hedgehog named\nTim'rous, they proceeded to con the\npeople of Bristol out of a grand total\nof \u00a350, and even managed to have\na good time whilst doing so. Well,\ndoesn't that prove something? The\ntotal may not be huge, but speak to\nany of the collectors involved and\nAt the beginning of next term, at an\nEG M, Rag will be electing next\nyear's Chair. Normally, this would\nhave already been done, but as\nnobody stood for the job it couldn't be done. If you are interested\nenough in Rag to consider this, then\nyou will already know about all\nthis, and don't need telling anyway!\nOther Rag posts, such as Internal\nAffairs Officer (the poor little hardworking person that laboriously\nslaves away at the minutes every\nyou will find that they all had a brilliant time - possibly something\nto do with the panda snorting coke\nin MacDonald's?!( There is actually\nan explanation for this strange\nbehaviour - apparently the panda\nsuit has no mouth, so a certain\nJaymz Handley was forced to drink\ncoke, via a straw, through the\nnostril...!). Thanks to a lovely\nsunny day, and a very friendly\nbunch of Raggies from Exeter, the\nfact that both Bath and Bristol Rags\nwere as hard to find as the Red\nTomato on QT was incidental to the\nenjoyment of the day, so I am\nreliably informed.\nweek, not to mention being\nresponsible for witte ring away a page or two of Felix EVERY week!\nie me), Sponsored Events Officer,\nHall Rep Coordinator and lots\nmore, will be elected at the AGM on 7th May. If you think you may\nbe interested in any one of these\nposts, grab this year's officer and\nget them to give you the lowdown\non the job. If you're STILL\ninterested - see you at the elections.\nPraying for the wind to change at the parachute jump.\nBeasts Bash Bristol\nEaster Events\nPosts Pending\nThanks To Thresher\nPage 8\n\n"

To celebrate and\nlaugh off the nightmares, we've\narranged a special comedy\nspectacular. Three top comedians,\nwho've been the recipients of many\nprestigious awards are appearing in\nthe Union Lounge.\nThe main act, Harry Hill,\nrec end y won the Perrier Award for\nthe Best Newcomer 1992. He's appeared on all manner of comedy\nshows and is generally regarded to\nbe the next 'Vic Reeves'. His act\nat the Edinburgh Festival last year\nwas a huge sell-out and he's been\ndescribed as 'The Future of\nComedy'. The com per e for the\nnight will be Boothby Grafoe.\nHaving comp ered in many London\nClubs, last year he was the com per e of the Glastonbury Festival,\nperforming in front of as many as\n4,000 people. He recently won a Time Out Comedy Award for his\nachievements and who am I to\nargue with that.\nThe support act for the evening\nis Dave Thompson, a stand-up who\nhas played all the top comedy clubs\non die circuit. So, for a bill which\nwould normally cost about \u00a37, all\nwe're looking for from you today\nis \u00a32. What a bargain! All this and\na late bar 'til 2am, disco 'til 3am, Smile Zone Happy Hour (8.30pm10.00 pm, all drinks reduced by\n20%). Need I say more? Yes!\nTickets are very limited.

Situated in deepest darkest\nBerkshire, two miles from Ascot\nracecourse, Silwood is a field\nstation of Imperial College and is\nhome for between 100 and 200\npostgraduate students.\nRecently the dearth of\ncommunication between Silwood\nand the main campus was addressed\nby an 'Outreach Day'. The\nPresident Chris Davidson, Student\nAdviser Stefano Ruis and a permanent member of Union staff\nMichelle, spent the day at Silwood\ntalking to residents. During this\ntime the particular problems of\nSilwood students were addressed\nand a plan of action devised. The\nOutreach Day was a great success\nand plans are afoot for repeats.\nIt is easy when living at Silwood\nPark to feel that you are not a part\nof Imperial College Union and\nevents such as these help overcome\nthis.\nUnfortunately, the behaviour of\ncandidates for the recent elections\ndid not act in the same way. You\nmight have noticed that the\n'favourite candidate' for Silwood\nresidents was New Election. This\nis not because we have no interest\nin the elections, quite the reverse;\nit was in response to the interest\nshown by the candidates, in a word\nnil. Not only did they not bother to\nvisit, providing the opportunity for\nhustings, but we also failed to\nreceive any posters or flyers. Any\ncandidate who had bothered to visit\nwould almost certainly have assured\nthemselves upwards of fifty votes;\nprospective officials take note.\nHowever, with the Outreach Day\nI hope we have reached a watershed\nin terms of communication between\nSouth Kensington and Silwood.\nSystems have been established\nwhich will allow Silwood students\nto interact with clubs and societies\nat S. Ken more easily.\nFurthermore, I would remind you\nthat you can make use of the\nfacilities here at Silwood.\nAdmittedly we do not have the\nrange of c&s, however, if you fancy\na day out in the country at the\nweekend why not come and explore\nthe 250ha. of Silwood Park, or find\nout what postgraduate life is really\nlike by visiting the bar during the\nweek.\nWhat I am trying to say is\nSilwood is more than a page in the\nprospectus, it is a community and\na part of Imperial College with\nwhich you may interact.\nMark Cox (Silwood Chair).\nPage 7\n\n"
