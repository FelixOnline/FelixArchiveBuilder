    "content": "are ers EMPLOYING YOURSELF\nDBSS\u2014how a group\nof Imperial students\ndecided to go it alone\nSpot a need,\nand fill it: this\nis the essence of\nstarting up your\nown business.\nThe launch of\nthe DBSS\nLiquid Handling\nSystem\nillustrates this\noption as carried\nout by three\nstudents-Patrick ShawStewart of IC,\nJames Duguid\nfrom\nLoughborough\nUniversity, and\nPeter Baldock,\nalso at IC.\nThe idea for the business originated\nwhen models of a motorised syringe\ndevice developed by Shaw-Stewart\nfor his M. Phil, project in\nbiotechnology were requested by\nresearchers at Imperial and\nSheffield University. Shaw-Stewart\nthe DBSS Syringe Drive Unit,\nPeristaltic Drive Unit, and\nMotorised Valve Unit\u2014controlled\nby a computer running the software,\nsTALK, which is provided as part\nof the package. The hardware can\nbe linked to almost any computer;\ndecided to set up a business and\npicked as partners an ergo no mist, Duguid, and an electronics expert,\nBaldock\u2014who is still working on\nhis Ph.D. at Imperial.\nThey decided to form a partnership rather than a limited\ncompany in order to avoid large\namounts of red tape and the\ncorresponding waste of time and\nmoney. As long as they were VAT\nregistered, they believe, their\ncredibility will not be improved by\ntheir having 'Limited' status.\nStarting on a small scale, each\npartner contributed an initial \u00a31000.\nThe aim was to limit the need for\nexternal funding, so that the\nfledgling company could grow in its\nown time. Duguid and Baldock\nwent on the Enterprise Allowance\nthe software should run on any\nIBM-compatible microcomputer.\nUp to sixty-four devices can be run\nfrom a single PC, and continuous\nflow applications can be handled\nwith varying degrees of accuracy\ndepending on which of the devices\nare used. The whole system has\nbeen highly praised by Dr Dennis\nMeader at Imperial: 'This system\noutperforms systems from the\nmainline manufacturers costing\nmany times as much,' he says, and\nadds that the multi-syringe\nconfiguration allows a greater\nexperimental flexibility than\npossible by any other means. A recipe for success, they hope.\nScheme, which also provided a useful source of advice and\ninformation through the\nGovernment's Small Firm Advisory\nService. Shaw-Stewart had a job\nand devoted his time after work to\nthe business.\nThe product they are making is\na system designed to increase\naccuracy, eliminate errors and save\nresearchers' time in chemical\nexperiments. Half the sales so far\nhave been to large industrial\ncompanies, the other half to\nuniversities. The partners prefer a low key style, depending for sales\non direct approaches to the\ncustomers or on interest generated\nby reports in the laboratory press.\nThe lack of extensive advertising or\n'marketing hype' means that the\nproduct can be sold for a quarter to\na third of the price of equivalent\ncompeting products.\nAs for technical details: the\nsystem comprises three devices\u2014\nSELF\nEMPLOYMENT\nMost graduates at present seem to\nwant, and eventually enter,\nregularly paid employment. But in\nthe future it is quite possible that\never more graduates will adopt\nalternative occupations rather than\nconventional forms of employment.\nThis is largely due to technology\nchanges which are beginning to\nchange the pattern and organisation\nof work. So you may start thinking\nof 'alternative' work-styles either\nbecause you can't find a job, or\nsimply because another pattern of\nworking and living appears more\nsatisfying.\nThe main alternative to paid\nemployment is self-employment,\neither as an entrepreneur running\nyour own business or perhaps as a member of a cooperative group. An\nunemployed graduate may find that some types of self-employment\nrequire too much capital,\nexperience or expertise to be\nfeasible, but there are other types\nwhich require only imagination to\nthink up a viable idea, and time and\neffort to put it into practice.

    "content": "*****\nT^w wC**'**** So you want a job?\nBy the end of the Careers Fair, you\nwill be fed up with hearing about\nthe world of work. However, and\nsad though it is, it must be faced one\nday. FELIX begs to offer a few\nwords of advice about the most\ncommon choices of profession.\nAccountancy\nIn 1985,10,000 UK graduates were\nregistered as trainees in\naccountancy, hopefully heading for\nmembership of one of the six major\nprofessional bodies in this country.\nAfter passing professional\nexaminations, and gaining three\nyears recognised experience, they\nare then ready to become fully\nfledged yuppies. Positions tend to\nopen up about the time you hear\nabout your degree result, operating\non a day release basis. The choice\nof positions is actually very wide,\nand the first BMW tends to arrive\nafter about four years.\nActuarial Work\nI didn't know what this was either,\nbut an actuary is basically an\naccountant with a crystal ball,\ndealing with life assurance,\npensions, stocks, bonds and so\nforth. This involves a study of\nprobability, compound interest and\nstatistical techniques, and their\napplication to finance in general.\nCourses are either\ncorrespondence or postgraduate,\nand lead to examinations for\nfellowship of the Institute (FIAs) or\nthe Faculty (FFAs), of which there\nare almost three thousand members.\nOne year full-time postgraduate\ncourses are run by City University\nin Heriot Watt, bypassing about half\nthe membership exams for the\ninstitutes. Definitely hard work to\nget into, but as the brochure says,\nit can be very rewarding. In other\nwords, lucrative.\nAdvertising\nThe many ways of entering into the\nworld of advertising cannot be\ndetailed here due to the lack of a few hundred pages, but the main\nrecognised course is run by the\nInstitute of Practitioners in\nAdvertising, open to staff of\nmember agencies. In other words,\nget your job, then get your training.\nThis tends to be on an in-house\nrather than on a day release basis\u2014\nfor example, staff who enter Media\ndepartments almost always train on\nthe job, whilst creative staff tend to\ncome from full-time courses at\ncollege, usually in an arts or related\nsubject.\nStarting salaries in London in\n1985 averaged \u00a38,500, with some\nfirst year rises of up to \u00a32000. This\nis quite good going, but if you\nhaven't achieved what is referred to as director status by your early\nthirties, you are counted as a failure. The potential for ulcers\ncould be quite high.\nBiology\nAbout forty per cent of biology\ngraduates in the UK in 1986 entered\na related subject, which reflects a healthy demand for their services.\nThis can be confirmed by a glance\ndown the appointment pages of such\njournals as New Scientist. Any\ncareers service should also provide\ncopies of 'Forward Vacancies',\ncovering April to November, and\n'Current Vacancies', covering May\nin your final year and onwards.\nBiochemistry\nLast year, about 60% of\nBiochemistry graduates went on to\ngain employment in an area related\nto their degree. Most of the rest,\none sadly assumes, went on to\nbecome accountants. One third of\nthis sixty per cent went into\nindustry, tending to be employed\ndirectly from college.\nBroadcasting, Film and Theatre\nThe situation can be summed up by\ndescribing the BBC Radio\nJournalism course: 12 places, 8000\napplicants. Getting into this area is\nvery difficult, and nobody can\nreally tell you any more. There are\nfew courses available, and they tend\nto be incredibly over subscribed. You have to be prepared to apply\nfor absolutely anything, probably\nabout 500 times. The best bet for\nthis is the Guardian on Mondays,\nwith several pages of relevant\npositions. With the competition so\nhot, you have to be prepared for\nrepeated failures, and it is as well\nif you can get some relevant\nexperience\u2014Stoic, Dramsoc and IC\nRadio are your best bet while at\ncollege, as they have been known\nto work for people in the past. Go\nfor it, and good luck.\nThe City\nIf you want to work in the smelly\nbit in the middle of London which\nrejoices under the name of The\nCity, you will find it a fairly small\narea of graduate recruitment, most\ninstitutions still preferring to recruit\nschool leave rs with good 'A' levels.\nThis explains why the yuppie at the\nend of your road can afford a GTi\u2014he didn't bother with\nuniversity. This doesn't exclude\nyou, though. First degrees are\nconsidered relevant, particularly in\nComputer Science. Try the Stock\nExchange Visitors Gallery, Lloyds\nof London Viewing Area, and the\nLondon Metal Exchange for further\ninformation.\nComputing\nLet's face it, there are so many\nopportunities for graduates from\nDoC that they cannot be listed.\nApart from the possibility of\nworking in the City\u2014yup yup yup-posts are also found in engineering,\nmedicine, broadcasting, publishing,\nscience subjects of all sorts, sales,\nmarketing, all sorts of research, and\nof course, in the world of\ncomputing itself. The world is your\nEPROM\u2014blow it as you will.\nEngineering\n'Engineering is an exciting,\npractical world which is concerned\nwith making things happen.' While\nthis is undoubtedly true, there is\nlittle question that the UK engineer\ndoes not share the same financial\nreward and prestige as his US and\nJapanese counterparts. As a result\nof this as many as a third of\nImperial engineering graduates\npursue careers in other\ndisciplines\u2014eg accountancy, retail\nmanagement, etc.\nFor those committed to\nengineering 'chartered status' is\nalmost essential, and is possible\nthrough the relevant professional\ninstitution. Careers are available for\nresearch, design, development\nthrough to manufacture, although\npromotion inevitably leads into the\nbroader concerns of management.\nMarketing and Sales\nThere are three ways of entering\nmarketing: by direct entry from\ncollege, via a postgraduate course,\nof which there are many, or from\nwork in some related field. Direct\nentry can be risky, as- many\ncompanies use the word marketing\nto describe burning your guts out at\nan early age as a sales grunt. On the\nwhole, postgraduate courses or\nsubsequent transfer are your best\nbet, and can lead to a fast and\nprofitable career. Adverts in the\npapers; Evening Standard or the\nGuardian are a major source all the\nyear round, but they have also\nproduced some of the most\ndishonest advertising I have ever\nseen\u2014this probably sums up the\nbusiness of sales and marketing\nquite well: you exist to present\nthings in a favourable light. In other\nwords, you lie.\nPublishing\nGood quality papers carry lists of\npublishing appointments, and these\nare likely to be about your only\nsource of inspiration, apart from\ntrade papers. In applying for these\npositions, it is important to detail\nany relevant experience you may\nhave. Obviously if you are at IC,\nyou aren't on a related course, but\nyou might have some experience\nanyway. You could join FELIX, for\nexample\u2014last year's FELIX editor\nis now Assistant Editor on Digital\nReview\u2014so it can be done. Salaries\nare not high, but job satisfaction can\nbe, as any member of FELIX staff\nwill tell you. Or else.\nPersonnel Work\nAlthough many people enter\ndirectly into the world of personnel\nfrom a first degree or previous\nemployment, full-time courses are\nalso available, leading in this\ncountry to examinations for\nmembership of the institute of\nPersonnel Management. Membership is generally thought to be an\nadvantage, but is not an absolute\nrequirement for entry into the\nprofession. Management trainees or\nthose with previous work\nexperience are also welcome, due\nto their wider grounding in the trials\nand tribulations of the big wide\nworld out there.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198711 "

    "content": "^ Arm..\nate\nCAREERS CASE STUDY\nThe Institute of\nChartered\nAccountants\nrequires you to\ntrain, under\ncontract, with an\nauthorised training\noffice of chartered\naccountants. During\ntraining you gain\npractical experience\nand prepare for the\nprofessional exams.\nThis contract\nrequires the firm to\nprovide experience,\ntraining and to\narrange tuition.\nThe firm will\nusually pay all\nyour tuition fees\nfor your first\nattempt at the\nexams and gives\nyou study leave to\nprepare for them\nthroughout the\ncontract.\nACCOUNTANCY\nRetail & Management\nSuccess in retail management is\nimmediately visible in the High\nStreet. The astonishing growth of\ngroups in various sectors of the\nretail market reflects the ambitions,\norganisational skills and good\nfortune of their senior management\nteams and the men and women who\nlead them.\nHabitat, founded by Terence\nConran, drew its strength from his\nbackground and instincts in design;\nKwikfit-Euro Exhausts grew\nrapidly under Tom Farmer and his\nhard Scottish leadership; Rymans\nwas transformed by Jennifer D 'Abo\nand is now part of the Athena\ngroup, headed by Terry Maher,\nwhose personal background is\naccountancy.\nEqually striking have been the\nreversals in ailing giants, notably\nthe turnaround achieved at\nWoolworths by Geoff Mulcalvy and\nhis team. Each of these successful\ncompanies and indeed every\nsupermarket group, department\nstore and independent retail chain\nrelies on its managers and their\nskills for the continuing efficiency\nof current trading and future\nexpansion.\nThere are undoubtedly many\nopportunities for those with\nmanagement and professional skills\nand who can demonstrate their\nwillingness to use and develop their\ntalents in the retail sector. Larger\ncompanies such as Sainsburys and\nMarks and Spencers have proven\nand respected internal management\ntraining schemes, many with\ngraduate-level entry. Other skills\ncan be studied externally, leading\nto qualifications with professional\norganisations, such as the Institute\nof Personal Management, IPM, or\nthe Chartered Institute of\nManagement Accountants, CIMA.\nExperience, training or individual\naptitude in the retail sector will\nultimately lead to special is ation in\nsuch areas as distribution, sales,\nmarketing, purchasing, market\nresearch, personnel, finance or\nadministration. These aspects are\nsimilar to those encountered in all\nother business organisations. The\npressures for performance and\nresults do tend to be more intense\nand this is reflected in the rewards\nand bonuses for those who succeed.\nThe Pros & Cons of Accounting\nSo how do you summarise the pros\nand cons of a career in accounting\nin such a short article? A good start\nwould be to forget the pros, as they\nare dealt with in great detail in the\nreams of recruitment literature that\nyou've no doubt been avidly\nstudying (or should that be halfheartedly skimming?).\nThe first problem to be faced is\nthat the traditional starting time of\nSeptember seems to fall at the start\nof the slackest period in the audit\ncalendar, with the result that the\nnew graduate may well spend a depressing proportion of his or her\nfirst few months doing the office\nphotocopying, filing and other\nmundane tasks. Whatever the\nvarious firms' brochures and\nadverts may say, everyone I 've\nspoken to has been through the\nsame en thus iam sapping phase (that\nshould be consoling, but it isn't). Once you escape from the office\nthings improve, but only slightly.\nFor the first year much of the work\nis repetitive and dull, but you learn\nfast and responsibility should follow\nquickly together with more\ninteresting work. Variety can be a great help, but unless you are lucky\nyou may have to push for it.\nPossibly the hardest thing to take\nis the amount of academic work that\nhas to be done. Up to 15 hours\nstudying a week may not sound too\nhard, but it can become difficult to\nmaintain a reasonable social life,\nespecially when increased\ncommitments at work start cutting\ninto evenings and occasionally\nweekends. At the end of all this one\nfaces the prospect of sitting time-pressured exams for which the pass-rates are ridiculously low.\nThis may seem to be a rather\njaundiced view of accountancy, but\nI would prefer to think of it as\nrealistic\u2014after all, most trainees\nthink fairly seriously about leaving\nat some point in their first year.\nSome do go, either because they\naren't motivated enough to get\nthrough, or simply because they\nrealise that they chose the wrong\ncareer, but most stay. You only\nhave to look at the opportunities\nopen to qualified chartered\naccountants to understand why.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198717 "

    "content": "'\"\"-'tUng\nGETTING THROUGH\nTHE INTERVIEWS\nAfter you have\novercome the first\nobstacle to getting\nthe job pre selection \u2014there\nis the daunting\nprospect of the\nfirst interview.\nMost of you will\nhave already\nundergone at least\none formal\ninterview when\nyou were applying\nto universities in\nyour sixth form.\nThe first interview\nwill be similar to\nthis because the\ncompany will be\ninterested in\nfinding out about\nyou and whether\nyou are right for\nthem\n\u2022 Presentations\u2014Many large\ncompanies who go 'on the Milk\nRound' will give presentations to\nthe candidates at their own\nuniversities. This will give you an\nopportunity to discover more about\nthat company and ask any questions\nyou may have. You will be able to\nstudy the sort of graduate they\nalready employ and gain a feel for\ntheir sort of management. Most\npresentations are in the early\nevening and include food and drink.\nThey are well worth attending as\nthey will be brief and by meeting\nyour interviewer in a relaxed\natmosphere before your interview\nwill make it much more easy to talk\nwhen you meet him/her in a more\nformal atmosphere.\n\u2022 First interview\u2014the interviewer\nwill base the first interview on your\napplication form and/or curriculum\nvitae. He/she will want to know\nwhy you are doing a degree in\nscience/engineering; why you\nselected certain subjects to\nspecialise in in your final year; what\nsort of degree you are expecting to\nget; and what experience you have.\nSome of the questions will be\nprobing such as why did you stand\nfor departmental representative?\nWhat did you have to do as Vice\nPresident of your favourite club?\nOther questions will be open-ended\nand very difficult to answer. Be\nprepared to answer questions about\nyour previous employment and to\ncomment on how management\ncould have improved the\norganisation: show the interviewer\nthat you have your own ideas.\nIt is almost certain that the\ninterviewer will ask why you have\napplied for their job so it's well\nworth preparing an answer. Don't reel off an answer though\u2014at least\nmake it sound like it's off the cuff.\nThey may also assume that you\nknow their company inside out\u2014\nalways do your homework on the\ncompany thoroughly before the\ninterview.\nInterviewers are looking for your\nparticular strengths and\nweaknesses. They are testing your\nability to communicate. They want\nto see that you are genuinely\nenthusiastic about their company\nand the job they are offering. The\nfirst interview will probably be held\nin a departmental room if it is on\nbehalf of a 'milk round company'.\nIt will last about 30 minutes which\ngives just enough time for the\ninterviewer to gauge if you are\nworth asking back for a second,\nmuch longer, interview. Always\nappear interested (even though you\nmay be bored out of your mind by\nthe questions the interviewer is\nasking) and remember that he/she\nwill usually have made up his/her\nmind after the first5 minutes of the\ninterview\u2014good interviewers spend\nthe next 25 checking out their first\nimpression.\n\u2022 Second interview\u2014most second\ninterviews will take place at the\ncompany's headquarters. Second\ninterviews are worth going to as\nlarger companies will put you up in\na five-star hotel and pay all\nexpenses you may incur. You will\nhave the opportunity to eat and\ndrink as much as you like and try\nout that Jacuzzi in your hotel room!\nSecond interviews are vastly\ndifferent from all other interviews\nyou may have attended. You will\nmeet new people, new\nenvironments and come up against\nother enthusiastic, motivated\ncandidates who are after the same\njob. You may be put through\nseveral interviews, intelligence\ntests, group exercises and talking to\na wide range of recent recruits and\npotential managers.\n\u2022 Group exercises\u2014these are\nspecifically designed to observe\nhow you get on with people and\nyour ability to work as a team. A leader may be appointed and a chosen topic debated while\nassessors observe how you\nperform. They are looking for\neffective contributors who can sway\nthe discussion. This may also be\ndone through role-playing where\neach person is given a position of\nresponsibility with a role to play. In\nthese situations the case study is\nunlikely to have any 'right' outcome\nas the asses or s are looking at the\nway you operate and how\neffectively you are thinking.\n\u2022Written tests\u2014there are several\nsorts of written test. Some test your\nintelligence while others try to test\nyour personality! You may have to\nundergo verbal reasoning tests,\nnumerical tests or even motivation\ntests. It may come as a relief to\nknow that you cannot fail a personality test. These tests,\nhowever, are designed to tell you\nand the employer if you are\nmanager or dustman material. It's always possible to cheat in such\ntests but you may end up with a job\nwhich is totally unsuited to you.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198715 "

    "content": "CAREERS CASE STUDY\nAND DUTY\nFREE FAGS!\nFor many graduates, and\nundergraduates, considering their\nfuture career, the prospect of life in\nthe armed services is not one which\ninstantly springs to mind. However,\nthe armed forces continue to admit\na greater and greater proportion of\ngraduate officers, and the\nopportunities which the services\noffer make them an attractive option\nin the hunt for a job.\nFirst, however, it is best to point\nout that all three branches have\ncommon features which the would-be applicant must be aware of. Most\nobvious, is the realisation that they\nare primarily 'fighting services'.\nMedical and physical fitness are\nmost important, moving hand in\nhand with a fundamental\ncommitment to the aims of the\nServices, the Crown as Head of the\nArmed Forces, defence of British\nterritory, the support of NATO, and\nthe implementation of Government\npolicy. Clearly, those with set\npolitical ideas which they put above\nall else need not apply. Membership\nof the armed forces also carries with\nit an automatic acceptance of\nService Law and discipline. Once\nyou take on this sort of\nresponsibility you will take on not\njust a job, but a whole way of life.\nIt makes great demands on the\nindividual, but the rewards can be\nenormous.\nOfficers are managers of men.\nLeadership ability is not inherent in\nall. However, if it is not\nimmediately apparent that you are\nthe sort of person to lead, this\nshould not discourage you. If you\nhave the capability, it will be\nbrought out in training.\nThere is a social and communal\nlife centred around the Officers'\nMess which many find attractive, as\nwell as almost unlimited sport and\nleisure pursuits. Frequently\nchanging working environments,\nundeniable comradeship, and a sense of belonging are all valuable\nconsiderations in looking at a career\nin the forces.\nThe lack of a settled family life\nis a problem which may not be\nconsidered at first, but is bound to\ncause great strain in later life.\nThis may not affect the new\ngraduate, but the sudden immersion\nin a highly disciplined setting, and\nthe harsh regime of basic training,\nare all barriers he or she must\novercome.\nThe Royal Navy\nEighty-seven per cent of this\ncountry's imports and exports are\nmoved by sea. The role of the Royal\nNavy is of vital importance in\nmaintaining this life blood.\nThe sea is the major difference\nbetween the navy and the other\nservices. Life at sea is radically\ndifferent from any other way of life.\nFor long periods, you are living and\nworking in what is essentially an\nalien environment.\nIn no other career are you forced\nto know your employees as well,\nhave such a huge range of\nprofessional knowledge, or take on\nso much responsibility for your\nfellow man at such an early age.\nWith as many as a thousand\nservicemen on a single ship, the\nneed for this is clear.\nFor the graduate entrant to the\nRoyal Navy, training starts at\nBritannia Royal Naval College in\nDartmouth, Devon. After an initial\nsix week new entry period, during\nwhich sheer fatigue rather than\nmental pressure is at the fore, you\nwill be taught all aspects of\nseamanship, engineering,\nnavigation, and the basics that all\nnaval officers must know. At the\nend of the first thirteen weeks, all\nentrants, except pilots, go on to\nspend nine weeks in the Dartmouth\ntraining ship, learning how ratings\nlive, and reinforcing the lessons of\npast weeks. Graduates go on to a Fleet Board, after which they are\nstreamed off into their\nspecial is at ions. There are opportunities for\nengineers in the weapon's engineering and marine engineering\nbranch, any graduate can join the\nexecutive branch as a Seaman\nOfficer, and in administration as a Supply Officer. Many graduates go\ninto the Instructor Officer\nspecial is ation, the 'school ies' as\nthey are known.\nCommissions can commit you to\nthree years service or up to twenty-two years depending on how certain\nyou feel about the job. Promotion\nup to Lieutenant-Commander is\nautomatic, and 65% of Officers\nprogress past this stage.\nThe Royal Navy offers the\ngreatest prospect of travel in any of\nthe armed services. It is more a way\nof life than any other, and can give\nthe greatest returns.\nThe Royal Air Force\nFlying, and aircraft is what the\nRoyal Air Force is concerned with.\nWhatever the chosen branch within\nthe profession, a strong interest in\naviation is essential. Aircrew pilots\nand navigators are in great demand\nand hold a crucial position. Team\nwork is still at the fore though, an\nRAF station with two squadrons of\naircraft can be staffed by more than\n1000 personnel. With the rapidly\nchanging state of aviation\ntechnology, the RAF is strongly in\nthe graduate market, and graduate\nentry is on the increase.\nApplication can be made initially\nthrough the University Air\nSquadron. There are sixteen of\nthese, with a total of 689\nundergraduate flying students,\nalthough as in all aspects of RAF\nentry, competition is fierce.\nThose accepted for entry into\nofficer training, having been\nsuccessful at the air crew selection\ncentre in Biggin Hill, go on to the\nInitial Training Course for officers\nat the Royal Air Force College,\nCranwell in Lincolnshire, for\neighteen weeks. It is a short and\nhighly intensive course,\nincorporating general and character\ntraining to enable the new recruits\nto fill posts successfully after their\nspecialist training.\nAt this point, the various\nbranches split up to pursue their\nown special is at ions. There are\nopportunities for fighter controllers,\nengineers, supply officers, on top\nof air crew. As with all services, the\ngraduate assumes his professional\nand management roles at an early\nstage in his career, and the\nassociated responsibility for\nmillions of pounds worth of\nequipment. Promotion is rapid,\nwith squadron leader rank being\nattained by about the age of thirty,\nand further advancement probable.\nThe opportunities for women in\nthe RAF abound. Half the air traffic\ncontrol, secretarial and fighter\ncontrol posts are occupied by\nwomen. Women graduates are also\nneeded in the education and\nengineering areas.\nThe sheer cost of training calls\nfor the highest standards of\nachievement. Total interdependence\nis the hallmark of operating aircraft.\nConsequently there is, once again,\na high communal spirit within the\nRAF. The standard of training\nreceived places you in a good\nposition not only within the service,\nbut upon leaving as well.\nThe Army\nThe major problem facing the\ngraduate about to apply for a commission in the army is the vast\nmultiplicity of corps and regiments\nin which one can work. The army\nis subdivided into these 'family'\nunits, and fierce pride is actively\nencouraged within each of these\nunits. An applicant does not apply\nto the army in general, but must get\n'sponsorship' or 'cap bad g ing' from\na regiment, and is given\nfamiliaris ation with that regiment\nbefore his or her RCB (Regular\nCommissions Board), the army\ninterview.\nIf you are successful at your\nRCB, you will go on to a twenty-eight week graduate course at\nSandhurst. Once again, great\nphysical demands are made during\ntraining, aiming to produce both\nphysical and intellectual\ncompetence under stress.\nThe army officer's traditional aim\nis to rise to command of his\nregiment by the age of about forty.\nThis type of staff work can occur\nafter about four or five years of\nservice, and the army officer's career then alternates between staff\nwork and tours of active duty within\nthe regiment. This lends great\nvariety to a career in the army.\nOnce again, an army officer is\nrequired to develop an 'esprit de\ncorps', be gregarious, and have the\ncapability of making decisions in\nquickly changing situations.\nForeign travel is almost guaranteed,\nbut you should expect to be sent to\nserve in Northern Ireland and be\nprepared for this.\nIt is the characteristic of caring\nfor others reinforced by the family\natmosphere of the regiment which\nis at the core of things. This sense\nof belonging serves to counter\nbalance a way of life full of travel\nand family moves.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198723 "

    "content": "HOW TO GET\nA CAREER\nIt's that time of year again, when\na student's fancy turns lightly to\nthoughts of a job. The large firms\nhover over College at the Careers\nFair, throwing out lures for the\nanxious students who have suddenly\nrealised that, in nine months they\nwill no longer be part of the\nsheltered college life. Notices\nappeal with anxious hints that it's time to start hunting, or reassuring\nmessages of the sort, 'it's later than\nyou think'.\nDon't panic. If you concentrate\non one step at a time, common\nsense and a bit of application\n(effort, I mean) should give you a fair chance of winning a job and/or\nstarting a career. And to make it\neasier, there are people able to\nadvise you on every step of the way.\nThe Careers Advisors, while they\ncan't tell you what to do, can point\nyou in the right direction to get\nstarted, test whether you're being\nrealistic and otherwise generally\nhelp you.\nStage one in the job hunt is\ndeciding what type of work you\nwant. If you don't already know\nwhat you're aiming for, there's an\narticle further on in this issue which\nshould give you some ideas on how\nto choose. So let's move on to the\nnext stages.\nThe autumn and spring terms\nshould be taken up with yet more\nresearch. The indexes of the\ngraduate recruitment directories\n(ROGET, GET, GO and numerous\nothers) are usually easily available\nsources. A visit to the Careers\nInformation room should be well\nworthwhile. The University of\nLondon Careers Service offers a wide range of publications including\nthe 'matrices'\u2014folders of computer\nprinted vacancy news which give\nimportant information on\nemployers' requirements and are\nregularly updated. 'Employment\nrequirement forms'; the fortnightly\nlists, 'Forward Vacancies';\n'Recruitment Update' and 'Careers\nExtra'\u2014all these should be\navailable either in College or at the\nUniversity of London. The London\nUniversity's Central Careers Office\ncan be found at 50 Garden Square,\nLondon WC1.\nThe result of your investigations\nshould be a comprehensive list of\npossible employers. Their\nrecruitment literature is important\nreading, most of the big companies\nare represented in the College\nCareers room collection, but if you\ncan't find information on any\nparticular employer try writing\ndirectly to them.\nWhen you have as much\ninformation as you can scrape\ntogether, you can start narrowing\nthe field. Compare the pros and\ncons of the names on your first list, and pick out the most promising.\nAbout a dozen would be a reasonable number for a first\nattempt.\nIt would be wise to include some\nsmall or lesser-known employers on\nyour short-list; the competition for\nmost of the well-known 'giants' will\nbe fierce so having some back-up\nis a good idea.\nIf any of your short-listed\nemployers are taking part in the\nCareers Fair (see the list on page\n26) applying for an interview will\nbe relatively easy. If not, use each\nemployer's preferred format (their\nown application form, standard\napplication form, or CV with\ncovering letter are the most usual)\nto apply directly to them. The\nCollege Careers room has\napplication forms for many\ncompanies on file.\nSome employers keep a low\nprofile (including some of those\ngraduates might find most\ninteresting) so if you want a job\nwith them you'll have to make a speculative approach directly to\nthem. Names and addresses can be\nfound in the various directories.\nThere are also the information\nbooklets produced by the\nAssociation of Graduate Careers\nAdvisory Services\u2014look for the\nvast collection in the College\nwhich should help\nCareers room-you track down employers.\nIf you can spare the time from\nrevising during the summer term\nyou can start applying for jobs that\nrequire you to be immediately\navailable for work. This is because\nmany employers are willing to wait\ntwo or three months for the right\ncandidate. Otherwise you can wait\nuntil after the exams before\napplying again.\nThe good news is that you can\nstill use the College careers facilities\nafter you graduate. Under a 'mutual\naid' system you may even be able\nto use those of any other university\nof polytechnic if that would be more\nconvenient. Public reference\nlibraries should also have some of\nthe sources of information you\nmight need. For information on\nemployers try trade directories (eg\n'Who Owns Whom'), Extel cards,\nthe Yellow Pages, professional\nassociations and institutions (listed\nin the 'Directory of British\nAssociations', published by CBD\nResearch) and, of course, company\nrecruitment brochures and annual\nreports. 'Current Vacancies' and\n'Job Opportunities Bulletin', are\nuseful publications telling you of\nvacancies; the 'Graduate-Employer\nMatching Register' is a computer-assisted register which sends your\ndetails to employers with vacancies\nto fill. Many employers now recruit\nat summer fairs; national or local\nnewspapers and specialist journals\n(Nature and New Scientist for\nexample) carry advertisements for\njobs. Then there are the local Job\nCentres for 'non-professional' and\n'non-managerial' jobs if you need\nto earn your bread while you're\nlooking for something more to your\ntaste. And then there are the private\nemployment agencies.\nAnother point to remember is that\nmany jobs aren't advertised.\nTreasure your contacts\u2014friends,\nrelatives or people you meet\nthrough leisure interests or part-time work. It's surprising how often\ngraduates find jobs through contacts\nthey have made for themselves, and\nthough these people may not be able\nto get you a job, they may put you\nin touch with someone who can\nhelp. They may even be able to get\nyou an interview.\nBut once you've obtained an\ninvitation to an interview, it's all up\nto you. Read on to learn how to\ncope.\nGood hunting.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd1987 "

    "content": "Galileo was\nwrong\nNot content with already having two\nmore forces than the average mind\ncan understand, some physicists are\nlooking for another one. If they find\nit, Galileo's proof that heavy and light\nobjects fall at the same rate will be\nshown to have been wrong.\nThe search started when a physicist\ncalled Fishbach looked at the original\nexperimental data collected in 1923\nby another physicist called Eotvos,\nwho had been doing delicate tests of\nthe equivalence of inertial and\ngravitational mass. Eotvos thought he\nhad demonstrated, within\nexperimental accuracy, that\ngravitational and inertial mass were\nthe same (implying that all bodies fall\nwith equal accelerations), but when\nhis data were reexamined they\nshowed significant statistical\nirregularities, suggesting that there\nwas a small residual mass-dependent\nacceleration.\nFishbach does not say that\nconventional theories of gravity are\nGod and\nslugs\nBiologists have been driven to\nreligion by attempts to find out why\nslugs don't eat moss.\nSlugs seem to happily munch\nanything useful that we try to grow\nin our gardens, but they never seem\nto touch moss. Rather than just\nascribing this to Sod's law or the\ngeneral perversity of nature, two\nbiologists proposed that mosses\ncontain chemical nas ties that the slugs\navoid.\nTo test this, they extracted some of\nthe chemicals from moss. However,\nslugs don't eat liquids, so the\nresearchers had to find some solid to\nsmear the chemicals on. The slugs\nproved very fussy and rejected almost\neverything the scientists tried, until\nthey used the wafers specially\ndesigned for use in the Christian\ncommunion service: the slugs gobbled\nthem up, along with all the moss\nextracts.\nIt is not clear whether this is\nbecause the religious nature of the\nwafers protects the slugs from harm,\nor whether the chemicals are not the\nnoxious bits in mosses after all.\n(New Scientist 15/10/87 p25). wrong as such; rather, he proposes a new, short-range repulsive force\ndependent on the nuclear density of\nthe interacting objects. The implication is that denser objects fall\never so slightly more slowly: that is,\nin a vac cu um, feathers fall faster than\ncannonballs.\nThe results from some of the other\nexperiments are now in. Measurements of gravity in mine\nshafts support Fishbach's hypothesis\nas do some other experiments using\nNewspaper headlines recently\nproclaimed that scientists had\ndiscovered that the entire human race\nwas descended from a single African\nfemale. The headlines were\nsensationalist, but they did contain an\nelement of truth.\nThe raw evidence that led to the\nclaim was based on a study of\nmitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria\nare rod shaped blobs that exist inside\nordinary cells and contain enzymes\nimportant for energy supply: they are\nthe cellular equivalent of the power\nstation. In this case the important\nthing is that the DNA contained in\nthem has certain unique properties. It\nis a sort of relic from the past and\ncontributes nothing to the cell as a whole, and it is transmitted from\ngeneration to generation only through\nfemales. Because it is not involved in\nmainstream genetic processes and the\nmain changes are just random\nmutation, it can be used to trace and\ntime (if we know the mutation rate)\nthe line of female descent.\nThe techniques needed to compare\nthe DNA from different individuals\nhave just recently been applied to this\narea. When the DNA from a wide\nrange of people was tested it was\nfound to be much more alike than had\nbeen expected.\nThe scientists who did the study\nwere surprised, and proposed that one\nexplanation for the low variation\ncould be that everyone is descended\nterrestrial gravity. However, some\ncarefully controlled pure laboratory\nexperiments have found no\nunexpected forces. The definitive\nexperiment will probably require the\ngravitational wave detector at CERN, but until that experiment is done, the\njury is out. Until there is a really good\nproof of the new force, people will\nbe justifiably sceptical of it: after all,\nfour forces are more than we can cope\nwith.\n(Nature 328 p578) from a single female living about\n200,000 years ago. Presumably the\nhuman population was having a bad\ntime at the hunts and had virtually\ndied out. They warned that other\nmore complex scenarios could explain\nthe DNA patterns, but the editor of the paper left that bit out and hence\nthe sensational new headlines.\nRecent work has gone into enough\ndetail to give a good idea of the family\ntree. This places the ancestral Eve in\nAfrica. The most important fact is that\nmodem homo sapiens appears to have\narisen in just one place and then\nspread out, completely replacing any\nother competing species. That is,\nhumanity did not arise in lots of places\nat once.\nThere is much discussion on the\nvalidity of the data. Both the actual\nvalue and constancy of the mutation\nrate, have been questioned. If the\nmutation rate is not reliably constant\nthen the family trees simply cannot be\ntrusted.\nOn the other hand, much of the\ncriticism may come from colleagues,\njealous that they didn't think up work\nthat could make front page headlines\nin the newspapers.\nThe strange thing is that all the\nwriters have failed to notice that the\nbiblical allusion is wrong: the hum am race is more directly descended from\nNoah's wife than from Eve, according to the account in Genesis.\n(Science 238 p24). An appreciation\nof Sir Peter\nMedawar\nNot many people who win Nobel\nPrizes are better known for doing\nsomething else; Peter Medawar, who\ndied earlier this month, was one of\nthose few.\nHe is best known for his sagacious\ncontributions to the popular\ncommunication of science; indeed, he\nhas been called the best science writer\nof his generation. He did not write\nhuge numbers of books (unlike some\nmodern writers such as Paul Davies\nor Isaac Asimov) but when he wrote,\nhe said wise things that showed great\ninsight into the methods and\nimplications of Science. He was a man who was capable of excellence\nin a specific field (immunology), but,\nwhen he wrote about more general\nissues, was no less brilliant. He cared\nabout science as a whole and he cared\nabout how it was used: he showed\nlittle mercy to those who abused it.\nHe thought deeply about how science\nworks and how it affects the world:\nhis vision was broad in contrast to the\naverage specialist who sees only his\nor her own narrow branch of the\nscientific tree.\nHis greatest achievements were his\nwritings. His descriptions of the\nscientific character stand against the\nusual chari cat ure s. His explanations\nof how science is done, and his hints\non how to do it better, have both\nhelped scientists with their work and\nhave educated many non-scientists in\nthe ways of science. Few scientists\nhave ever matched his ability to think\nclearly and to communicate ideas\nsimply and without ob fi is cation. The world needs more people like\nPeter Medawar. Unfortunately a scientific education (especially of the\nsort given at Imperial College) will\nnot encourage people to be like him.\nWe tend to want blinkered\nconservative conformists: they do\nwhat they are told, they don't ask\nquestions, they don't rock the boat.\nThere is no hope for science and little\nhope for the country as long as that\nis the sort of person our institutions\nproduce.\nEditor's Bit\nNext week this space will contain,\namong other things, a look at what\nwork won Nobel prizes this year (was\nDavid Cap lin of the Physics\nDepartment right when he said it was\nthe fastest physics prize ever?).\nUNDER THE CROStjSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nHumanity's single mother\n6 Friday October 23rd1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rag pissed\noff\nLast Saturday the Union Building was\ndamaged at the Mencap 'thank you'\nparty attended by students from all\nover the UK who had helped in the\nMencap London-wide collection. At about 10pm the organisers were\ninformed that a wash basin had been\npulled off the wall in the gents toilets,\nrupturing water pipes which led to\nflooding. As the drains were not\nworking the 'passed water' seeped\ninto Norman's store room and into the\nFELIX Print Room.\nThe Union Building was being used\nfree of charge by Mencap through the\nImperial College Rag Committee who\nwere responsible for the party, and so\nbrought the matter of the damage to\nthe attention of Monday's Council\nmeeting. The question of who would\npay the bill has not yet arisen,\nalthough he did express to FELIX that\nhe hoped that Mehcap rather than IC\nRag would pay. Letters are being sent\nto all the universities whose students\nparticipated expressing the\ndispleasure of the Union at such\ndamage being perpetrated.\nOne on\nRadio 1 will start transmitting on\nVHF/ FM from 6am on Saturday, 31\nOctober. The first transmitter will\ncover the London area only, on 104.8\nKHz, but other major conurbations\nare due to be added. The existing\nshared Radio 2/Radio 1 frequency\nwill continue until airspace is made\navailable to transmit Radio 1 on FM nationwide.\nWind swept\nStaff and students were washed into the sea at a field trip in Dorset last\nweek. The incident took place in the wake of Thursday's hurricane, when\nstudents from Mineral Resources and Petroleum Engineering visited BP's Wytch Farm onshore oilfield, Dorset. Those receiving a dunking included\nProf J Archer, Neilah Ghonia, John McNeill and Robert Ambrose. Mr\nHatamian said that it had not been felt necessary to issue life jackets. Dr\nG Hargreaves, Imperal College Safety Director said, in view of the visit\ntaking place shortly after the storms, 'given the exceptional circumstances,\nperhaps they should not have taken the risk'.\nFishy story\nMr KH Fisher Safety Administrator\nat Silwood Park has strongly denied\nthat there was a serious leak from the\nSilwood Park Reactor Station\nyesterday. When FELIX approached\nhim concerning the issue he laughed\nand exclaimed that it was 'totally\nerroneous'. Professor Peter Grant\nwas absent from Silwood Park\nyesterday afternoon when FELIX tried to contact him, but his secretary\nconfirmed that there had been a leak.\nAlmost everyone approached by\nFELIX denied any knowledge of the\nincident. Mr HAD ew it L Departmental Superintendent at\nSilwood, conceded that he didn't 'think' it had happened. Alan Rose,\nICU Deputy President, said T hadn't heard actually. Maybe Ian Howgate\nknows but he'sp on c ing about in the\nAlbert Hall at the moment. You could\nask the safety people but I 've just put\nback the next meeting.'\nDr G Hargreaves, the Safety\nDirector, said he couldn't tell us\nanything as it was outside his\njurisdiction.\nNews The longest\nyear\nUnion Council approved a motion on\nMonday to change the Sabbatical\nYear from 1st July\u201430th June to 1st August\u201431st July. This could\nbecome official policy by March,\nsubject to approval by aUG M and the\nCollege Governing Body. Part of this\nmotion, although not compulsory,\nwould be an informal training period\nfor incoming sabbaticals which would\ninvolve them spending July on the\ndole and working in the Union Office.\nThe idea, originally proposed by\nJackie Peirce, last year's Union\nDeputy President, is intended to make\nthe Sabbatical Year con in cide with the\nCollege financial year. Union\nPresident Ian Howgate feels that if incoming officers 'are not prepared\nto spend a month on the dole then they\nare not dedicated enough' and that\nsabbaticals are likely to be better off\non supplementary benefit with rent\nrebate than on a sabbatical salary with\nfree accommodation. He denies any\nulterior motive in his gaining an extra\nmonth in office, claiming that he\nwould prefer to spend July writing up\nacademic work than sorting out Union\nfinances.\nLie in\nClocks go back one hour on Sunday.\nA spokesman from Geology said that\nconsidering the age of the Earth, one\nhour was insignificant and so the\nclocks were not really changing at all.\nThe change is unlikely to affect many\nIC students.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd19875 "

Nowadays a room in Southside will cost \u00a335 a week,\nand with the grant at about \u00a32,300, 30 weeks rent will\ntake a huge 45 % off the grant. The rise in private residence\nis even worse. Every year students are paying an\nincreasing proportion of their grant for the privilege of\nliving in Central London. The situation is alleviated\nslightly with housing benefit, but plans are well advanced\nto remove this benefit from students.\nIn addition, if this week's London Student is to be\nbelieved, the Government plans to open up the rented\naccommodation sector, abolishing fair rents and making\nthe renting-out of property widespread are going to push\nup rents by 200 or 300%. Property currently only rented\nout to students to avoid legal hassles will, if the law on\nrenting is relaxed, be let out at 'market rates' in line with\nproperty values. Living in central London as an\nundergraduate (postgraduates can still claim travel back\nand so live further out) is going to be impossible.\nAccommodation will rise to cost more than the whole\ngrant. London colleges will increasingly only attract\n'affluent' students, never mind the Robbins principle\n(higher education for all who will benefit). Market forces\nand Thatcherism in higher education by the back door!\nWhat can be done? Arguing with the College is\nuseless\u2014they have their hands tied by the Government.\nWhat we need is effective London-wide campaigning for\naccommodation NOW! As a first step, what do you think\nthe effect would be if the body representing the students\nof the foremost science and engineering college publically\nannounced that they are actively to discourage new\nstudents from coming to London, because of the\naccommodation crisis?\nChris Martin.\nMusical rooms\nDear Judith,\nWe would like to draw attention to the lack of\ncommunication between the communication experts.\nImagine our surprise, having booked the music room, in\nwriting, last July, to be told, on our return to College,\nthat there was no record of this. We were informed that\nthis was due to the change of control in 53, Prince's Gate.\nNo one on the new Management Sciences staff had thought\nto enquire whether there were any standing bookings.\nHowever, they were very helpful and agreed to honour\nour reservation. Unfortunately, this did not resolve the\nproblems caused by the departmental switch as we were\ntold, one working day before the rehearsal, that the room\nhad been double booked. Fortunately, on this occasion,\nthe club which had booked the only Union room containing\na piano was willing to let us take over use of it. We\nconsider that severe disruption was caused to our Freshers'\nevent due to this gross error on the part of Management\nScience.\nICOS wonders whether the transfer of the Humanities\nDepartment to the Mechanical Engineering building is in\nthe interest of ICU students or merely to further Imperial\nCollege's financial ambitions. The lucrative industrial\nconnections of Management Science may create revenue\nto fill the gap left in their budget when ICU regained\ncontrol of the profits from the Harlington gravel. Part of\nthe reorganisation has involved the removal of one practice\npiano from general use and of two others to the Sherfield\nBuilding. It will also include the refurbishment of the\nMusic Room during the spring term, resulting in total\nexclusion of all users. It is unlikely that student societies\nwill ever regain full use of this facility as Management\nScience have let it be known that they do not welcome\nstudent use of this room during office hours; extending\nuntil ten in the evening.\nWork on the building appears already to be in progress,\nas we discovered to our cost when we went to make some\ncoffee for the rehearsal and found that our whole store\ncupboard had vanished. Although this may seem trivial\nin the face of all the points above, the loss of a valuable\nurn could be seen as a financial disaster to a College\nsociety.\nYours sincerely,\nICOS Committee 1987/88\nG Sturck (Chairman), M Lucking (Treasurer),\nG Turner (Secretary), P Murphy (Publicity Officer).\nCouncil chaos\nDear Judith,\nI would like to reply to your editorial in FELIX780 concerning the cancellation of last Monday's Council\nMeeting. That Monday I walked into the Union Office\nto enquire whether the notifications and agenda e for the\nmeeting had been sent out, and was told by Chas Jackson\n(ICU Hon Sec) that he had not yet had time to print and\ndistribute them. In view of this, and knowing that very\nfew Council members would turn up as a result, I asked\nthe three executive members for their opinions. Having\nheard what they had to say I, as Council Chairman,\ndecided to postpone Council until the following Monday.\nIn the light of the recent \"Not the Freshers' U GM\" fiasco,\nI hope you will agree that it was more sensible to postpone\nthe meeting until everyone knew about it, rather than have\nanother in quo rate, unrepresentative meeting.\nI take full responsibility for this decision, and I apologise\nprofoundly to those that had already set the evening aside\nfor this meeting (I'm included in this category).\nYours,\nAlastair J Seymour, ICU Council Chairman.\nWet and dry\nDear Judith,\nI would like to pour out gems of wisdom to your readers\nlike the sky is currently pouring out water, but I can't.I can, however, give out one pearl: I have noticed that\nwhen I press the little silver button near the handle of my\numbrella that it springs open and covers me thus,\nmiraculously, keeping me in a state of dryness even when\nit is raining. I hope your readers find this information\nuseful and perhaps use it themselves.\nYours,\nA no-longer wet ex-physicist.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198735 "

    "content": "Ik\nGenesis\nThe opinion article on genesis, life,\nthe universe and everything in last\nweek's FELIX would have been more\ninteresting if its facts were accurate.\nThe opinions expressed on the\nrelationship between religion and\nscience are commonly held, but are,\nnevertheless, based on erroneous\ninformation.\nA sort of anti-religious mythology\nhas been built up among scientists.\nThis was started by TH Huxley (as\nin Huxley Building) who, in his\nmemoirs, gave an account of his\nfamous debate with the then Bishop\nof Oxford. The Bishop opposed the\ntruth of Darwin's idea and lost.\nHuxley was the only person to record\nhis memories of the debate, and, in\nthe manner of autobiographies written\nyears after the event, vastly\nexaggerated his side of the story. He\nmade the Bishop out to be a villain\nof un reason, while he, of course, was\na knight in shining armour fighting\nonly for the truth. In reality evolution,\nin one form or another, had been a popular idea for years (the Greeks\nthought it up, but the Victorians liked\nit because it gave credence to the idea\nthat the world was slowly getting\nbetter). Darwin was just the first\nperson to attempt to give it scientific\ncredence. His theory, however, had\nbig holes in it and some people were\nbound to question it on scientific\ngrounds alone. The conflict is not\nbetween irrational religion and\nrational science, but between\nindividuals who disagree about the\ninterpretation of the evidence.\nThe supposed suppression of evolution in the USA has also\nattracted its own obscuring mass of\nmythology. The Tennessee anti-evolution law was only passed, in the\nfirst place, because of a serious\npolitical cock-up. The State assembly\nonly voted for it to please the voters,\nin the calm assurance that the state\ngovernor would veto it. In some\nmuddle of political ineptitude\n(probably because he thought the bill\nwould be ruled unconstitutional by\nsomeone else) he passed it. It is clear\nfrom the records of the time that no\npolitician took it seriously (the\ngovernor said that the law would\nnever be used). The Scopes trial,\nwhere a teacher was tried under the\nlaw (for teaching evolution), was\nstaged to gain publicity for a small\ntown that needed the business. This\nploy worked well, and incidentally the\ncreationists were humiliated even\nFELIX though they won the case at first (and\nthe verdict was later overturned on a technicality). Again there was no\ngreat confrontation between the forces\nof reason and superstition. (The\nbackground to the Scopes trial is\ndiscussed in Stephen Jay Gould's book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes.)\nEven the suppression of Galileo's ideas was more to do with politics\nthan any actual conflict between\nscience and religion. Galileo was an\nun diplomatic character who insisted\non taking the piss out of the Pope in\nsome of his publications. The\nmythology surrounding his trial has\nmore to do with the (possibly\nsubconscious) desire of some\nrelation is ts to demonstrate the\nirrationality of religion, than it has to\ndo with any actual conflict between\nscience and religion.\nOnly extremists believe that every\nword of the Bible was dictated by God\nand has to be taken literally. Most\nothers accept that the Bible is a collection of different works by\ndifferent people with different insights\ninto truth. It claims no special degree\nof historia l accuracy, and it is full of\nimages and symbolism. To demand\nliteral interpretation of all parts (even\nthe visionary acid-trips of Revelation)\nand then to reject the ridiculous\nimplications, says more about the\nmind of the sce pti c than it does about\nthe likely truth of anything in\nChristianity.\nAnother conflict that is more\ncontrived than real is the supposed\nChristian belief of the existence of the\nsoul as an entity independent of the\nbody. Lots of people, Christian and\notherwise, still believe that the soul\nand body are separate, but the idea is\nnot a Christian one. The idea is Greek\nin origin and derives from platonic\ndualism. The biblical concept of soul\nis more sophisticated and in no way\nconflicts with science (though some\ndistinguished neuroscientists have\nwanted to believe that the mind is\nindependent of the brain in the\nplatonic sense, but this is impossible\nto refute or check). In Hebrew\nthought, people do not have souls they\nare souls: the word is a description\nof the nature of our existence; we\nwould say we were conscious,\nsentient beings capable of free will\n(the Bible is more concise because\npaper was short when it was written).\nIn scientific terminology, the soul is\na product of the complexity of the\nhuman brian and the way it is\norganised. If you believe in God,\nthere is no problem in believing that\nhe could recreate a soul by repeating\nthe way a particular brain was\norganised. So individuality could\nsurvive death without there being an\nindependent thing called soul.\nBiblically speaking, the important\nthing about people is that they can\nmake moral decisions and choose\nbetween good and evil. Life after\ndeath is almost a side issue to this\nchoice. It only becomes a big issue\nwhen churches try to sell a happy\neternity for money or obedience now.\nMainstream Christianity has mostly\nconcentrated on encouraging people\nto make the correct moral choice in\nthis life. Deathbed conversions are\nregarded as cynical, insincere and\nsuperstitious.\nMost popular debate on the truth of\nChristianity seems to happen in\ncomplete ignorance of what\nChristians actually believe. Literalist\nparodies (only 144,000 people fit in heaven, for example) of what the\nBible says or of what people believe,\nare set up to be clearly ridiculous. If\nany religion contained such nonsense\nthen we would have to reject it.\nBut, if you disbelieve because of the\nparody, then you are deluding\nyourself. If you care about the truth,\nthen you will find out what a religion\nreally says, before you reject it as\nridiculous. If religions are all superstitious junk, then we do not\nneed parodies of them to show that\nthey are untrue.\nSteve Black, Chem PG.\nStill soul searching...\nMan's search for his soul (and\nwoman's for hers) is too widespread\nand long-standing to be abandoned for\nthe materialistic and rationalistic\narguments of RG Fincher's article\nSoul Searching. Most of the human\nrace for most of history has believed\nin survival after death so strongly that\nthey have developed elaborate\nprocedures to make sure dead soul go\nto their appointed place and don't get\nlost, or worse, hang around making\ntrouble for the living. Sceptics are a tiny mon or it y in the human concensus\non this matter. That doesn't mean they\nmust be wrong, but they might pause\nto consider that the rest of humankind\nmight be aware of something they\nhave overlooked.\nThe existence of souls, like the\nexistence of God, cannot be proved\nor disproved. We can only weigh the\nevidence and make a judgement on\nthe balance of probability. There is\nsome evidence around to suggest that\nhuman personality can exist and be\naware of itself apart from the body.\nThere is a whole literature on the 'out-of-body' experiences of people who\nhave been very ill, resuscitated after\n'dying' on the operating table, or after\ndrowning. The impression of the\n'self leaving the body and looking\ndown on it in these circumstances\nseems to be common. That doesn't prove anything either, but it might\nmake us question whether personality\nis as closely tied to physical molecules\nas the materialists think. I did have\none student from mainland China, a party member and dyed in the wool\ncommunist, who came to me with a strange story. While he was studying\nhere, his mother died in China. He\ntold me how his mother came to his\nroom in England and talked with him\nfor about half an hour. Everything in\nhis beliefs and upbringing told him\nthat was impossible, yet it had\nhappened. He was forced to consider\nthat if dialectical materialism was\nwrong about something so important,\nit might also be wrong about a whole\nlot else.\nWhy are we so hung up about the\nparticular set of molecules we happen\nto be carrying around at the moment\nanyway? They are in constant flux\nand exchange. While you are reading\nthis, part of your breakfast today is\nnow part of the brain with which you\nunderstand these words. We replace\nevery cell in our body in a seven year\ncycle, so you have already undergone\ntotal atomic translocation three times\nsince you were born\u2014some of us\nmore.\nI am not my molecules, I am a pattern of information carried by\nmolecules which are constantly being\npicked up and discarded. In this\nCollege we are fully aware that\ninformation can be stored in av are it y of ways, on magnetic tape, optical\ndisc, bubble memories, or as words\nin a book, and can be transferred from\none medium to another. St Paul said\nof the body before and after death, \"It\nis sown a natural body and it is raised\na spiritual body\" or to put it in our\njargon rather than his, the set of information which is me is expressed\nin a new medium with further\npotential for development when the\nmolecular storage system crashes. It\nis an interesting possibility I rather\nhope to explore for myself\nDavid Ashforth\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198729 "

Bring your own bottle. There\nare also other, more expansive places\nnearby on Church Street.\nSole Mio23 Gillingham Street SW1\n(Victoria tube)\nAround the corner from the Seafresh\nFish Bar. Varied menu with pastas\nand omelettes under \u00a32; a hearty daily\nspecial for \u00a33.\nGaby's30 Charing Cross Road WC2( Leicester Square tube)\nSelection of vegetarian and Middle\nEastern food. Very much like an\nAmerican diner.\nThe Witches of Eastwick\nThe sleepy New England town of\nEastwick is a dull place, for three\nwomen l ving there, all single and\nstrongly independent, life has lost its\nsparkle. Jane (Susan Sarandon) has\njust finalised her divorce, Alexandra\n(Cher) is a widow and mother who\nsculpts dolls, and Sukie (Michelle\nPfeiffer) is a successful journalist who\nwas deserted by her husband who left\nher with six children. Every Thursday\nthey meet to relax and share their\nproblems and a few drinks. 'If men\naren't the answer, why do we always\nend up talking about them?' concludes\nJane. Together they conjure up their\nideal man.\nSoon they learn of the arrival in\ntown of a wealthy eccentric, Daryl\nVan Home( Jack Nicholson).\nIntrigued by the stranger about whom\neveryone is gossiping, they soon fall\nprey to hj s charm when he claims to\nbe 'just your average horny little\ndevil'. He seduces all three women\nand they move into his huge mansion.\nHowever, back in town the rumours\nfly and after the local snoop Felicia\n(Veronica Cartwright) meets a sticky\nend the women decide the menage a trois must come to an end. Realising\ntheir power, the witches and Van\nHome set the stage for a battle of the\nsexes.\nAlthough outnumbered three to\none, Van Home is an ideal vehicle for\nNicholson to play his devilish best.\nHere he has perfected the lunatic\ncharacter from The Shining and he is\nsimply superb as the manic demon,\nwho asks 'Are women one of God's mistakes, like tidal waves?' when the\nwitches start to get the better of him.\nOf course Nicholson steals the show,\ngiven the ability to run amok and snarl\nat the shocked town folk. Underneath\nhis charm is a spoiled teenager at odds\nwith women, and in the three witches\nhe meets his match. Strong\nperformances by all three witches (in\nparticular Cher continuing her diverse\ncareer) are enough to make this film\ngreat entertainment, but what I found\nunnecessary were the special effects\nwhich today are almost obligatory. I suppose they're a throwback to\ndirector George Miller's Mad. Max\ndays but here they are nothing more\nthan old hat.\nEventually the film dissolves into\na flurry of special effects which round\noff the plot, but somehow the\ncharacters deserve better. Good\nentertainment with Nicholson at his\nbest.\nA.N. Vegetarian and under \u00a33 Omnivorious and under \u00a33 Polio Bar20 Old Compton Street W l( Leicester Square tube)\nUnlike Fatso's, Polio gives you\nenough pasta the first time round so\nyou don't need seconds and the price\nstays under \u00a33! Get there early or face\na long queue.\nOmnivorious and under \u00a36\nCafe Pacifico\nLangly Street\n(Covent Garden tube)\nIt is a shame Mexican food must be\nso expensive. This place is better than\nChi-Chi 's at Leicester Square and a bit cheaper.\nJ.B.L a Pergola\n138 Gloucester Road\n(Gloucester Road tube)\nIf you've ever eaten Italian food\nbefore, La Pergola's selection will\nnot excite you.\nMy companion's complaints to the\nelusive waiter, speaking in Italian\ncommanded the attention of the chef:\nYes, he admitted, the ravioli had\ncome from a tin.\nThe apparently reasonable prices,\nwhich had enticed us there for lunch,\nare misleading: Unordered, the two\nsalads which appeared with our main\ncourse\u2014seemingly included\u2014are\nextra (\u00a31.50 each). Bread rolls are\n65p per person (normally included in\nreal Italian restaurants). With the\nobligatory 15% service charge it all\nadds up to make a light lunch into an\nexpensive mistake.\nSince the Pergola, Bellavista (132\nCromwell Road) and Vecchiomondo\nRestaurants (118 Cromwell Road) are\nall owned by Lorenzo's, you would\nbe advised to be very wary about\ntrying the other two (unless you're\nprepared to argue in Italian). s.G.

    "content": "are ers AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR IN\nYOUR PROSPECTIVE\nEMPLOYER\n\"How do I choose\nwhich employer to\napply to? They all\nseem much the\nsame to me. I 'll\napply to the seven\nlargest, most\nfamous employers\nwith the most\nIt might work but, if you have\nspent any time at all choosing what\noccupation you wish to follow, it\nseems a pity to mess up your future\nhappiness by failing to carry out\nadequate research on your\nprospective employer. There are\nfive Directories of Employers of\ngraduates. 'Register of Graduate\nEmployment and Training'\n(ROGET); 'Graduate Employment\nand Training' (GET); 'Graduate\nOpportunities' (GO); 'Directory of\nOpportunities' (DOG) and\n'Directory of Opportunities in New\nTechnology' (DONT). These are a good source for your preliminary\nvacancies and that\nwill probably\ndo.\"\nlist of possible employers. Besides\noutlining the vacancies that they\nmay have, they tell you about the\ncompany's size, its location, its\npattern of employment and even a little of its philosophy. Many\nemployers produce special\nGraduate brochures which provide\nprofiles of recent graduate entrants\nof the 'Day in the life of...' variety.\nThere are many videos for those\nwho prefer watching and listening\nto reading. These can be viewed in\nthe Careers Video Room, key from\nSherfield Room 309. Although all\nthese sources will tell you\nsomething of the companies, they\nare produced and written by the\nemployers themselves and therefore\nare unlikely to paint the companies\nin anything other than glowing\nterms. The same thing can be said\nof the recent graduates brought\nalong to Company presentations. A company is unlikely to bring along\npeople who think it's a foul\ncompany in which to work! So how\ncan you find out which company is\nfor you? Firstly you must know\nwhat you want from an employer;\nWhat sort of environment would\nyou enjoy? What promotion\nprospects or training would suit you\nbest? Do you want a very open,\nfriendly style of management or\nwould you prefer a more\nconservative formal firm? The\nCareers Fair is a good place to start.\nYou might ask them why they think\nyou should work for them rather\nthan for X and Co although don't sound too arrogant when doing so!\nAnother valuable way of finding out\nabout different employers is at the\nOld Students' Association and\nCareers evening.\nOnce you have narrowed the field\nof employers you can save everyone\nan awful lot of time by checking\nwhether the companies actually\nhave vacancies in the areas for\nwhich you are applying. Every\nyear, a well known computing\ncompany is inundated with\napplications for computer\nprogramming jobs. They do have\nbetween 400 and 500 vacancies but\nnot for computer programmers.\nIf the company is visiting the\ncampus during the Graduate\nRecruitment programme then you\ncan obtain the application forms\nfrom the Careers library. Otherwise\nyou will have to apply directly to\nthe company.\nAridfinally,think about 'fall back\npositions'. Please consider the\nwisdom of only applying to the big,\nglamourous, well-known\ncompanies. Every year on the\nImperial Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme, perfectly respectable\ncompanies have to cancel their visits\nthrough lack of applications. Think\nwhat it would do to your chances\nof success if you applied to such a company.\nJOBS FOR THE\nBOYS (& GIRLS)\nThere are many job opportunities\nfor graduates who do not want to\ncontinue in their chosen discipline.\nThese jobs are open to people who\nare not only academically sound but\nwho also possess special personal\nqualities. If you are in your final\nyear you must begin to think about\nlife after University. You must\nbegin to ask yourself 'what do I want from a job or from life?' and\n'what do I have to offer a company?' There are endless\ncareers pamphlets in the College\nCareers Library on Level 3 of the\nSherfield Building, which offer all\nsorts of information and advice. We\nhope to give you a rough guide to\nwhich direction you should be\ntaking.\nYou\u2014what do you want?\n\u2022 Do you want to feel involved,\nstretched, excited, useful?\n\u2022 How important is pay,\ngeographical location, security?\n\u2022 In what way do you want to deal\nwith people\u2014do you want to\nadvise, teach, organise or entertain\nthem?\n\u2022 Do you want a job overseas?\n\u2022 Do you have for ie gn languages?\nDo you want to use them?\n\u2022 Do you want a routine 9\u20145 job?\nWould you object to shift hours?\n\u2022 Do you want further\nqualifications?\n\u2022 Do you want to do something\n'socially useful'?\nYou\u2014what can you offer?\n\u2022 Are you a leader?\n\u2022 Can you work in a team?\n\u2022 Are you a good organiser?\n\u2022 Are you creative?\n\u2022 Are you committed to solving all\nproblems?\n\u2022 Can you work to a deadline?\n\u2022 Are you a sympathetic listener?\n\u2022 Are you confident in public?\n\u2022 Can you express yourself clearly?\nBy answering all these questions\nyou may begin to see which jobs\nyou are suited to and which you'd have no hope of doing.\n14 Friday October 23rd1987 FELIX\n\n"

President Ian\nHowgate proposed honorary\nmembership of the Union for all St\nMary's students this year, allowing\nthem to vote and stand in elections for\nnext year's Union officers. It was\nnoted that there was a lack of\ncommunication between both St\nMary's Union and Imperial College\nUnion. Council members were also\nconcerned about the lack of communication between the\nExecutive and the rest of Council\nabout the merger plans. Mr Howgate\nbelieves that St Mary's Union is\nfrightened of being swamped by ICU.\nStormy\nweather\nWhile Hyde Park may look like a battlefield, College itself was barely\nscarred by Friday's storm.

In the Life Science\nDepartment's pilot plant, a skylight\npane was lifted and later found some\n15 feet away still intact. It is expected\nto be refitted by the end of the week.\nAshfelt on the Union Building was\nalso lifted, which has led to the re-roofing being brought forward. The\nmain victims of the storm have been\nthe trees, with many branches being\nbrought down. College reports that\ntwo small trees are still missing.\nHow to get\nHI\nAlternative Prospectus Editor Sunny\nBains has published Holographies\nInternational, a new magazine for the\nholograph ies industry.

The win was\nall the more impressive because it was\nthe first time that the new squad had\nplayed together.\nUnusually for IC, the defence and\nnew reshuffled midfield were the\nmost influential units. The attack did,\nhowever, show bursts of the magic\nwhich won last year's University of\nLondon League title.\nOnce the attack has settled down\ntogether, and if the influential\nVamadevan can recover his old\n'wobble', this new-look side should\nstock up the Hockey Club's trophy\nshelf again this season.\nPart 2\nIC l st XI0 Spencer-Jennings Select XI \u2014 0\nOn Sunday the College's premier\nhockey side travelled to Earlsfield to\nbe entertained by a Spencer XI specially selected from the London\nLeague Club's2 nd and 3rd teams by\nex-IC impress a rio David Jennings.\nThe side included several ex-IC\nsuperstars and were expected to\npresent stiff opposition.\nSkipper Justin Brooking, rue ing the\nnight before (or was it morning\nAnne?), sat out the first half, but was\nably replaced by UL U player Brendan\nFarmer. The defence remained\notherwise unchanged from Saturday,\nbut the attack sorted three new faces\nin Gary Knartborough, Julian Firth\nand Richard Preston.\nSpencer opened with a flurry of\nsuperb team hockey, pinning IC into\ntheir own half for nearly ten minutes.\nWere it not for excellent defending by\nStonham and Garside, and tight\nmarketing by the half-backs, centred\non Paul Coleman, Spencer could have\nput the game out of reach in the first\nperiod. However, inspired by\nBrooking at half time and marshalled\nby the brilliant Coleman, IC took the\ngame to Spencer in the second half.\nDespite creating many more goal\nchances, IC failed to snatch victory,\nbut can be pleased with a draw against\npossibly this year's toughest\nopposition.\nORIENTEERING\nCoaching first\nLast Sunday, the Orienteering Club\nachieved a first! Their first coach!\nEnthusiasm has grown over the past\nfew years and because of the number\nof new members, a coach was hired\nfor the day instead of the usual\nminibus.\nThe days outing was to Gloucester\nPark in Basildon and was an\nintroductory event for those new to\nthe sport. The courses were set on\nmainly open land which was a little\nmarshy due to recent rain. The\ncourses were of different lengths and\ndifferent degrees of difficulty; the\nhardest being a9.1 km Norwegian\ncourse for experienced oriente ers. This is different to a normal course\nin that parts of the course are given\nat each control and can either be\nmemorised or drawn onto the map.\nEveryone managed to complete\ntheir course without getting severely\nlost, the only major problem being\nbir os lost en route.\nThe day was considered quite\nsuccessful and the vast majority\nexpressed an interest in continuing\norienteering.\nAnyone who is interested in trying\norienteering can come to the training\nsession on Thursday at 5.30pm in the\nUnion Gym.\nFOOTBALL FIXTURES\nHOME FOOTBALL MATCHES\nSaturday 24th October: Wednesday 28th October\n1st XI, Goldsmiths Cup 4th XI, K CH2 nd XI, QHC IV Cup 6th XI, K CH II\nYACHT CLUB WEEKEND\n13 places free for a cruise out of Southampton.

J. Select\nFirst match\ndrawn\nIC l st \u20143\nGoldsmiths\u20143\nAfter just one trial we faced our first\nmatch against Goldsmiths College.\nWe were all a little unfit and rusty at\nfirst. Consequently we conceded a goal in the 24th minute. Periodically\nwe started playing the ball about\nwhich was reminiscent of later years\nstyle of play. Then in the 39th minute\nwe managed to breakthrough\nGoldsmith's defence to make it 1\u20141.\nWe started the second half a lot\nmore confident and began to dominate\nthe game. Against the run of play\nGoldsmiths managed to sneak a goal\non the break.\nIn the 70th minute IC hit back. It\nwas a text book move: the goalie\nthrew the ball to the right touch line,\nthe ball was laid square to Paul Dyson\nwho took it up the pitch and passed\nit through the defence where Nigel\nCollier ran on to it and finished the\nmove. In the 76th minute IC went in\nfront from a solo effort by Paul\nOlden. In the last 10 minutes, with IC\ntiring rapidly, Goldsmiths equalise d with a far post header to make the\nfinal score 3\u20143\nPaul Dyson (Captain).\nROWING Spring\nRegatta\nAfter the racing on Saturday was\ncancelled due to damage from the\ngales on Thursday the two crews\nentered turned up for Sunday's racing\nstill in good spirits.\nIn one of the first races of the day\nthe Colleges Senior A cox less four\ncomfortably won their heat and so\ngetting a place in the final. The other\ncrew an Elite eight followed suit,\nwinning a place in the final\ncomfortably.\nThe Senior A cox less four had a good start in their final and from this\nled the field for the whole race to win\nwell. The Elite eight were not so\nlucky and lost to an Under 23 Gold\nMedal winning crew by just over a second.\n34 Friday October 23rd1987 FELIX\n\n"

Not to be\nmissed at any cost!\nLibel\nTHE BARON\n'Hurry up, Baron!' called John Secretary\nto Derek Dash as he passed Derek's office, 'or you'll be late to say goodbye\nto another group of citizens'.\nDerek was getting ready to attend the\ncitizens' leaving ceremony, held at the\nRoyal Alan Ball. Today was the day\nwhen lots of citizens moved from\nCheapskate to take up their jobs as\nmoney counters. Nearly all the citizens\nbecame money counters when they left\nCheapskate; the only one who had not\nyet got-a money counting job was still\nworking in the citizens' bar.\nDereK was trying to work out why all\nthe citizens wanted to become money\ncounters. The best explanation that he could come up with was that they\nwere all to unimaginative to do anything else. It was certainly true that\nCheapskate citizens were mostly very dull. In fact, if they had been any\nduller, Derek reflected, they would only be able to get jobs in Cheapskate\nitself. Expanding this argument in his usual logical manner, Derek was\njust working out how long it would be before there was only enough\nstanding room for all the incredibly tedious people in Cheapskate, when\nJohn Secretary called to him to hurry up.\nDerek sighed, put on his silly cloak and left his office, picking up a copy\nof the Cheapskate Annual on his way out. Derek enjoyed reading the new\nCheapskate Annual, which had only just been delivered. As usual it\ncontained lots of articles about what a wonderful place Cheapskate was\nand lots of pictures of people smiling a lot as well as three photo-love\nstories and a Dennis the Menace cartoon strip. Derek had particularly liked\nhis own introduction to the Annual. 'I am continually amazed', he had\nwritten, 'at how wonderful Cheapskate is. There is no doubt that it was\nreally wonderful before I became Baron, and, if indeed it is possible, I think\nit is becoming even more wonderful. There are bound to be huge numbers\nof people wanting to become Cheapskate citizens when they see how\ngood the pictures are in our Annual'.\nDerek admired his work for a few minutes whilst on his way to the Royal\nAlan Ball, and then put the Annual inside his cloak so that he would be\nable to read the Dennis the Menace cartoon during the goodbye ceremony.\nMeanwhile, while Derek was reading the Dennis the Menace cartoon,\nthere was lots of rushing about going on elsewhere in Cheapskate. All\nthe important members of the citizens' Factories Club were getting ready\nfor next week's fun-packed 'how to become a money counter' fair. There\nwould be lots of exciting things going on; the citizen's would be able to\nplay 'try to get the 1 Op piece out of the chief money counter's hand' and\nlots of other jolly games. The citizens in the Factories Club tried to convince\nall the other citizens that they were helping them to get jobs as money\ncounters; in fact, everyone in Factories Club was being very very nice\nto all the important money counters who were visiting Cheapskate so that\nthey could get better paid jobs counting money. (Everyone at Cheapskate\nwas very dull, but members of the Factories Club enjoyed being dull).\nThis year, a few citizens had decided that they did not really want to\nbe money counters after all. One of these was the head citizen, Whygate,\nwho enjoyed his job so much that he was trying make it last longer than\nthe usual one year. At the last meeting of the citizens' committee Whygate\nhad swept into the room very proudly (all 2000 sequins perfectly in position\non his new dress) and announced 'we have decided to carry on running\nthe citizens' office for an extra month'. The rest of the citizen's could not\nwork out whether he had actually asked anyone else about it, or if he was\nusing the royal 'we'....\nIs Whygate going to marry Prince Edward?\nWill the PHALIX Editor print a nasty article about the Factories Club\nthis year?\nWhat happened to Dennis the Menace?\nWhy wasn't Arthur Michael mentioned?\nFind out in the next episode of 'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198731 "

    "content": "are er s Things to remember\nGeneral employment prospects\nSince the low in 1981/82\nemployment prospects have been\nrising steadily. Imperial has one of\nthe lowest full unemployment rates,\nwhich is getting still lower. Backed\nup by other measures, this indicates\nthe country-wide recovery which is\nparticularly evident here. There are\nnow more jobs on offer, more visits\nfrom employers and more jobs\navailable at Summer Fairs.\nElectronics and computer science\nare the areas which produce the\nhighest demand. Recruitment levels\nin manufacturing have improved.\nFinance (banking, accountancy,\ninsurance and commodities) and\nretailing employers are particularly\nkeen to recruit science and\nengineering graduates.\nOf course, there will always be\nthose who make no effort to look\nfor work but they are making a big\nmistake. Around 300 electronics\ngraduates were unemployed at the\nbeginning of last year through\nfalling into this trap. You must\nrealise that you are the one doing\nthe seeking, not your future\nemployer. It would also be very\nfoolish to only apply for one job,\nor to go for something that is\nobviously beyond your capabilities.\nThe attainment of a pass degree\nafter five years at college is not a sufficient qualification for R&D \u2014\nbut there is always someone who\ndoesn't realise this.\nTaking a year off\nA year off, taken before university,\nis welcomed almost universally.\nAlternatively, many think seriously\nabout having some time off between\ngraduation and full-time\nemployment. This can be rewarding\nand productive, but it must be noted\nthat if you are over 24, you may be\nadvised to seek careers advice,\ndepending on your choice of\nprofession. Otherwise, there are no\nproblems, although it helps to have\na clear idea of what you plan to do\nwith the year and one which you\ncan articulate\u2014perhaps to a future\nemployer. You should be able to\ntalk about what your aims were,\nwhat you gained from the\nexperience, etc. You should also\nthink ahead. For example, it might\nbe fun going jacka roo ing in\nAustralia for 12 months but you will\nhardly be well placed to apply for\njobs back in the UK. For the same\nsimple reasons 12 months off have\noften become 15 or more.\nRemember the vacancy lists in\nSeptember are probably shorter\nthan in another time of the; year.\nNevertheless, given some thought\nand planning, some time off after\ngraduation can be fun, productive\nand for many, a time of great\npersonal development.\nTemporary work\nWhile the great majority of\ngraduates want permanent work,\neach year there are those who, for\na variety of reasons, seek temporary\nwork. In thinking of the longer term\ncareer prospects, virtually all\nprevious work experience is useful,\neven valuable. Here in London\ntemporary work is not hard to find.\nI can cover many possibilities, from\npart-time work in MacDonalds to\nchallenging administrative jobs. Job\nCentres can be a good source of\nsuch work and there are a number\nof specialist agencies. Catch 22 is\none such firm (it's harder to get a job without experience and you\ncan't get experience without a job).\nAlthough your work might be far\nremoved from your ultimate\nambition, it does give valuable\ninsights into people and the nature\nof work. It can also be a useful way\nof funding that year off.\nSummer Fairs\nIt has always been wrong to think\nof recruitment as being a January\nto March phenomenon associated\nwith the Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme, otherwise known as\nthe 'milk-round'. In fact\nrecruitment is increasingly\nbecoming an all-the-year round\nevent. Nevertheless outside the\nGRP the next busy peak is during\nthe Summer Fairs. This is the time\nin June and July, starting\nimmediately after finals, when there\nare about 10 Fairs throughout the\ncountry. Of these, London is by far\nthe biggest. This year almost 200\nemployers attended during its three\ndays with a wide variety of jobs on\noffer. Thus these events are\nparticularly useful for those who\nhave not wanted to think about jobs\nprior to graduation.\nA cynic's view\nThe 'Milkround', in a nutshell, is\na system that companies use to\nrecruit graduates every year. A company will contact the careers\nservices at a university, and will\narrange to visit the College on some\nday, for the 'first interviews'.\nIn the meantime, recruitment\npersonnel may have attended a 'careers fair' at the College, and\ndistributed lots of applications\nforms along with expensive, glossy\nbrochures, extolling the virtues of\ntheir company. They then sit back\nand wait for the floods of\napplications.\nThey make a selection of these\nand interview at the College. They\nmay also (like IBM) apply their own\nbrand of 'aptitude test' at this stage.\nIf they like you, you are invited for\nsecond a interview at the\nprospective place of employment.\nOn that basis they make their\nchoice.\nIt's all very simple and\nconvenient for all. The students,\ninitially at least, don't even have to\nleave College. The employers, in\ntheory, come to College and get the\npick of the best graduates.\nSo, what's the matter? There are\ntwo problems with the Milkround;\none old, and one new.\nThe old problem is that only some\ncompanies can afford the resources\nto visit Colleges up and down the\ncountry. This means that students\nrelying entirely on the Milkround\nare only going to apply to 'Large'\ncompanies in certain areas. To test\nthis out, walk around Careers Fair\n(as I once did) and find out how\nmany companies aren't involved in\ndefence work. Compare that to the\nnational average. You will find\nquite a difference.\nSo, the students that rely only on\nthe Milkround are restricting their\nchoice. As long as they are\nreasonably forward looking, and\nrealise that the Milkround is only\na small proportion of what's on\noffer, then this isn't such a problem.\nWhat's the more recent second\nproblem?\nThis time, it's from the\ncompanies. Less and less are\nfinding the Milkround worthwhile.\nVisiting dozens of universities and\ninterviewing hundreds of students\nisn't cheap. To make it worthwhile,\nit must produce results. However,\nbecause it's so easy for the students,\nmany are applying to companies\nthey have very little interest in, just\non the off-chance. Even if they are\noffered a second interview, they can\nalways turn it down if something\nbetter comes along.\nCompanies are finding other\nways to recruit. Advertising directly\nto students may be more cost\neffective. They may get less replies\nif the student has to do more work,\nbut the replies they get will be the\nmost highly motivated.\nOne way the graduate\nemployment market may change\nsoon is that the employment\nagencies, very common amongst\nthe 'real' job market, may move\ninto graduate recruitment. A company might 'contract out' it's graduate recruitment to an agency,\nwhich will do all the preliminary\nadvertising, interviewing, testing\nand so on. You would apply to one\nagency, and may well be offered a job in any of the companies which\nuse that agency.\nWhat will this mean for the\nstudent? Probably not very much.\nThe people that seem to get the best\njobs are those that have gone out\nand looked themselves.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198713 "

EMPLOYING YOURSELF\nKEEPING UP WITH\nHOLOGRAPHY\nChoosing a career is never\neasy, but for\nSunny Bains it\nwas easier than\nfor most.\nInstead of\nwandering\naround Careers\nFair looking for\na job that\nseemed suitable\nin the right part\nof the country\nwith a decent\ncompany, Sunny\ndecided she\nwanted to be\ndifferent. So, in\nthe middle of\nher second year,\nshe decided\nwhat her real\nambition was: to\ncombine her\nenthusiasm for\njournalism with\nher love for\nholography.\nBy the end of January 1987\n\"Holographies International\" (Hi)\nwas an idea. By the end of March\nit had a name and a post office box,\nnotepaper and business cards.\nGetting the name was actually more\ndifficult than it sounds. Sunny had\nto prove to Companies House in\nCardiff that the magazine would be\ntruly international before they\nwould give her permission to use\nthe name, due to some 1825 law.\nFortunately, with most of her\nreaders expected to be in the United\nStates, this was not a problem. In\nMay, letters were sent out to\nprospective advertisers. In June\nletters were sent to the United States\nwhere Sunny was going to promote\nthe magazine. The holographic\ncommunity seemed enthusiastic and\nby August Hi had acquired a reasonable amount of material.\nParis and Cambridge provided a few more contacts and by October\n1st, just about all the copy was in.\nPasting up was done in five days flat\nand on October 19th the magazine\nwas launched with smoked salmon\nand champagne.\nThough it may sound\nstraightforward, there were a lot of\ndifficult decisions to be made about\nthe price, the run and the quality of\nthe product Sunny and her deputy\neditor were about to produce. They\nhad to choose a run which was big\nenough to interest advertisers but\nsmall enough for them to be able to\nsend them out. They needed a price\nthat would cover costs while not\nbeing too expensive even for\nstudents to buy and, most of all,\nthey needed to find a printer who\nwould give them a good enough\ndeal for them to afford colour, once\nthey had decided that it was\nnecessary. Advertising rates had to\nbe considered: were they too high\nor too low? What incentives should\nthey give to advertisers? Was it a good idea to send the magazines out\nfree? Who should they send it to?\nWho did the advertisers want them\nto send it to? How heavy could the\nmagazine be for the postage to be\naffordable?\nOn the subject of money, Sunny\nsaid simply, \"I'm not getting paid\nat the moment and not really able\nto temp enough to make ends meet.\n\"available from\nthe IC Bookshop!\"\nObviously, this will change should\nenough people buy the magazine.\"\nThe whole thing might never\nhave happened had Sunny not been\nat Imperial as opposed to almost any\nother college. Sunny explained\n\"It's not just a question of Imperial\nhaving good research projects in\nholography, although that is why I came to IC in the first place. In most\ncolleges the student newspaper is\nrun by students in the art faculties,\nand they have a tendency to pull\nrank over science and engineering\nstudents, and I do not believe there\nis any other student newspaper with\nthe facilities FELIX has. Without\nFELIX I would never have gotten\nthe experience to make Hi happen.\n\"Not only that, but FELIX staff\nwill be playing an important role in\nher publication in the future, some\nof them will be staff writers for Hi,\nand, once Hi can afford it, they may\neven get paid. And Sunny is not the\nonly one who owes her career to\nexperience gained at FELIX. There\nare many ex-writers and editors of\nFELIX who now have jobs in\nscience journalism. Pallab Ghosh,\neditor in the academic year\nbeginning 1983 will be working for\nNew Scientist as of next month.\nDavid Rowe (1984) and Steve\nMarshall (1980) are now doing\nfreelance sub editing and writing.\nMike J L Williams (1974) and\nRichard Weissenberg (staff, 1984)\nare in Advertising and PR. Mark\nSmith (1982) is now writing for\npublishing company Morgan\nGrampian. Since 1985, however,\nthere has been an explosion of\nFELIX staff who have successfully\nentered journalism. Of Hugh\nSouthey's(1985) staff, 7 are now\nworking for publishing companies\nas writers and editors, although\nHugh Southey is not now in\njournalism. He is becoming a lawyer. The success of Imperial\nCollege in turning out that\nsupposedly rare breed, scientists\nwho can write, can largely be put\ndown to the fact that at FELIX\nstudents have a sabbatical editor\nwho can help them to improve their\nskills, as well as access to\nprofessional standard equipment.\nWhether Sunny's venture will\nactually succeed or not is impossible\nto tell, although initial signs are\ngood. If it does, she will have built\nan interesting and challenging\ncareer from almost nothing. Even\nif it doesn't she will have fulfilled\non of her ambitions: to be an editor\nand publisher before turning 20.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198721 "

There are\nobvious do's and\ndont's such as\nlegibility and\nappearance\u2014try to\ntype your\napplication\n(although some\napplication forms\nask you expressly\nto fill them in in\nyour own\nhandwriting) and\nlay it out sensibly.\n\u2022 Always read any information on\nthe job you are applying for\u2014find\nout about the company and the kind\nof people they employ. Larger\ncom panes will produce recruitment\nbrochures which are ideal for this\ninformation. Most brochures can be\nobtained by telephoning the\ncompany or sending a stamped\naddressed envelope. The careers\nlibrary on Level 3 of the Sherfield\nBuilding has a large number of\nthese brochures which you can\nbrowse through at your leisure.\n\u2022 Read the form carefully before\nfilling it in. It's a good idea to take\na photocopy of it first and fill that\nin before completing the final copy.( This may sound tedious but you'll\nalways remember things you should\nhave put in after you've filled up the\nspace allowed!) The copy will come\nin useful before you go into the\ninterview so that you don't contradict yourself.\n\u2022 You should answer all the\nquestions the form asks even if\nsome do not apply to you. It is\nbetter to write N/A( not applicable)\nthan leave a blank.\n\u2022 When answering open questions\nsuch as 'why are you applying for\nthis job?', try not to use clich es. Employers are looking for that\nsomeone who is slightly different;\nsomeone who can use their brain in\nan original way. Most employers\nwill use such questions to sort the\n'definite s' from the 'maybes'. For\nthe same reason, never look at a friend's application form to check\nwhat they're putting. Two forms\nwith the same ideas stick out a mile.\n\u2022 Always include as much relevant\ninformation as you can. List all\nyour 0- and A levels as most\nemployers still regard them as\nimportant. List all your vacation\nexperience\u2014even if you only\nworked at the till in the Union\nSnack Bar; it still shows that you\ncan use mental arithmetic.\n\u2022 The questions such as 'what are\nyour leisure interests?' are designed\nto discover your practical skills,\nleadership abilities or if you like\nworking as a team. When\nanswering these questions, think of\nwhat attributes the job needs and\ngear your answers towards them.\nYou should never give negative\ninformation about yourself\u2014always\nsell yourself.\n\u2022As appearance is particularly\nimportant, don't include spelling\nmistakes or crossing-out. You\nshould try to lay out your answers\nwell in the area available\u2014never put\nall the words crammed at the top of\nthe white space.\nIf you are not applying for a specific job then you may have to\ninclude your own application form.\nIt is best to model this on one of the\nforms you can obtain from the\nCollege Careers Office.\n18 Friday October 23rd1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "News Guilds' Vice mauled\u2014official!\nTanya Maule, a first year chemical\nengineer, was elected Vice President\nof City and Guilds College Union at\nthe Election U GM on Tuesday. She\nfills the position left vacant by Chris\nSimpson on failing his second year\nexams.\nAfter a short speech from each\ncandidate and proposer, Ms Maule\nwas elected with a sizeable majority.\nShe is the first fresher to be elected\nto the Guilds Executive.\n\u2022 FELIX interviewed Ms Maule\nfollowing her victory. She revealed\nthat she first considered standing for\nVP on meeting Dave Tyler, the\nGuilds Union President, at the joint\nC CU Christmas Party in Freshers'\nWeek. She had mentioned that she\nwas interested in Rag, mascot ry and\nEnts to him and he claimed that these\ninterests along with limitless\nenthusiasm were the qualities\nnecessary for VP. The following day\nshe gathered a proposer and second ers from amongst her fellow first-years\nand started to organise her campaign.\nClearly with only two weeks at IC\nprior to the election she needed to\nensure plenty of publicity prior to the\nelection in order to stand a chance\nagainst the other candidates. She feels\nthat questions asked of the candidates\nat the U GM were fair and although\nsome, such as 'who is responsible for\nRag in Guilds', put her at a disadvantage they were all very\nrelevant.\nPredictably she is not willing to\nsacrifice her degree to the running of\nC& GU. However, she believes that\nshe can effectively manage both. Her\nambitions at this early stage are to\nincrease participation in Union\nevents, particularly amongst first-years, and to abolish the present\nelitism which alienates rank and file\nstudents from the management of C& GU. Like every VP before, she\nhopes to raise more money for Rag\nthan before and plans several new\nULU travel\nI \u2022 Worldwide flights on quality airlines\n\u2022 Special fares for students and academics\n\u2022 European trains and short breaks\n\u2022 Overland tours and holidays\n\u2022 Group bookings\nUnbeatable prices \u2014 unbeatable quality\nEnquiries and Bookings:\nEuropean 01-581 8233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nUL U Travel\nS her field Building Imperial College Prince Consort Road London S W7.(AA_ I STA\\\nAO W TheWorldbeaters\nevents which could involve Bo appearing more often. She expects the\nfull co-operation of the two other\nvice-presidential candidates and many\nofficers in C& GU have pledged their\nsupport. Initially she will be\ninformally assisted by Dave Tyler and\nprevious VP s Chris Simpson and\nSimon Corns, but she hopes to be in\nfull control by Rag Week.\nMr Tyler denies that asking Ms Maule to stand was showing any\nfavour it is m as he sees his role as\nencouraging as diverse a selection of\ncandidates as possible. He views\nhaving a female first-year Vice\nPresident as a positive advantage as\nC& GU has previously' had a lack of\ninvolvement from women and\nfresher s. \u2022 Defeated candidate, Ken Pendlebury, bears no grudges against\nthe new VP. He decided to run for\nVP on hearing that Mr Simpson,\nwhom he had shared a room with\nduring the summer, had failed his\nexams. Mr Pendlebury had intended\nto run for VP in March, but had stood\ndown when Mr Simpson announced\nhis ca did a ture. Funds fiasco\nThe Commemoration Day ceremony\ntook place in the Royal Albert Hall\nyesterday. Following the Fellows\nawards, Professor Eric Ash delivered\na speech on universities and the public\nfund cut. He revealed that Imperial\nCollege now receives only 50% of its\nfunding from the University Grants\nCommittee. He went on to warn the\npresent Government of the dangers of\nletting the universities rely heavily on\nthe private sector funding and cast a gloomy picture for universities in the\nnext few years as they all compete for\nthe limited funding.\nThe Imperial College Annual\nReport was published to coincide with\nCommemoration Day. The 28-page\ndocument is in glossy brochure\nformat and contains articles on\nCollege's relationship with industry,\npast students and expenditure figures\nfor the last financial year. It reveals\nthat the total College income was\n\u00a366,385K whereas its expenditure\nwas \u00a367,384K. This is the first year\nthat the College has spent more than\nit received.\nSKETCH j \u2022 The rubric opened, as you might\nexpect, with a tribute to the\nachievements of IC students and staff\nthis year, including the election of\nMike Hassel and David Olive to the\nRoyal Society, and of Alan Swanson,\nColin Besant and Ernie Freeman to\nthe fellowship of engineering. So to\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School,\nand the forthcoming merger.\nProfessor Ash is obviously an\noptimist, as he proved when he\nreferred to the enthusiasm of St\nMary's students about the merger.\nThe experience of IC Union is rather\ndifferent.\nAnd then onto an old favourite, lack\nof money. The Rector raised the\npossibility of privat ising universities,\nand then, not to anyone's surprise,\ndemolished it, mainly by pointing out\nthe lack of endowments coming in to\nCollege funds. This naturally begged\nthe question: Are we doomed to be a loss-making organisation ? Well,\napparently not. If\u2014said the Rector\u2014\nyou count the income to the country\nwhich results from the graduation and\nsubsequent gainful employment of an Imperial College graduate, and\nsubtract from that the cost of that\ngraduate's education, we make about\n\u00a3300M per annum for the UK. so,\ndear Government, although we will\ndo our best to increase our degree of\nself-funding, notably by the launch of\nIMPEL, a company which exists to\nexploit novel ideas and inventions for profit, we still need your money to\nsurvive in our present structure.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd1987 "

    "content": "Academic affairs\nBy now most of you will be settling\ninto the routine of lectures, practicals\nand tutorials\u2014some of you will be\nfinding it easier than others. But if you are having problems the Union's Academic Affairs system is here to\nhelp you.\nAcademic Representatives\u2014around\nthis time your Departmental\nRepresentative (Dep Rep) should be\nholding (or may already have held)\nelections for the posts of Academic\nRepresentatives ( Ac Reps). Each\nsubject group has 2 Ac Reps per year\ndepending on the size of the group.\nThe Ac Reps are the first line of representation between you and the\nstaff. If your lecturer is inaudible\nhis/her writing/overheads illegible or\nthe problem sheets incomprehensible\nthen it's your Ac Rep's job to point\nthis out to the lecturer concerned\n(politely!). The Ac Reps should also\nmeet the course convener/organiser\nat regular intervals to discuss how that\nparticular lecturer course is\nprogressing.\nThe Dep Rep and all the Ac Reps\nin the Department form the student\nside of the Departmental Staff-Student\nCommittee. This committee deals\nwith matters throughout the\ndepartment. For example how a course could be improved or facilities\nfor the students common room.\nIf a problem can't be resolved\nwithin the Department then it can be\ntaken to the respective C CU Academic Affairs Officer (AAO) who\nmay be able to resolve the matter. The\nfour A A Os( including myself are\nresponsible for representing the\nstudent body as a whole on various\nCollege Academic committees with\nimportant sounding names such as\nBoard of Studies, Careers Advisory,\nAdmissions Policy, Vacation\nTraining, Undergraduate Studies, etc,\ndealing with such matters as lecturer\ntraining. In this rep ect it's worth\nnoting that while your teachers at\nschool will have had to go through\nintensive training most lecturers\n(although they may be experts in their\nrespective field) have only a very\nbrief training before they are dumped\nin front of a hundred students and may\nend up fumbling their way through\neven the best prepared course.\nGetting involved\u2014where do you fit\nin. Well for a start you could stand\nas an Ac Rep in your Department. As\na student rep you will get to know lots\nof people within your Department and\nalso at C CU level. Of course with any\npost comes responsibility too. You\nwill be expected to help your Dep Rep\nand attend various Committees among\nother things. Don't let that put you\noff, though. To ensure a good deal for\nstudents academically means that\nordinary students like yourselves\ngetting involved by standing for\nelection and rep e sent ing the students\neffectively.\nThere are also two posts available\nfor Ordinary Members of the Union's Academic Affairs Committee and the\npost of Secretary to the Academic\nAffairs Committee (a post which I held years ago). If you are interested\nin standing and want to know what's involved, please contact me via the\nUnion Office. The papers are up in\nthe Union foyer and the elections will\nbe held at the next Union General\nMeeting.\nFinally\u2014your studies will( hopefully!) form the important part\nof your time at IC and I hope that at\nleast some of you will want to get\ninvolved with Academic Affairs. You\nwill certainly find the experience\nrewarding.\nCharles Brereton\nIC Union Academic Affairs Officer\nUSE YOUR UNION!\n\u2022 Yummy foods in the Uni' Snack Bar\n\u2022 Slurpy drinks in the Uni' Drinks Bar\n\u2022 Happy faces in the Uni' Office\nDON'T BE SHY!\nMore essentials\nEnts, Ents, Ents that's all we seem to\ntalk about. Well there's a good reason\nfor that and that's because all the\nevents are such jolly good fun and\nvalue for money. Before I sum up this\nweek's events I must first add that\nEnts did not make \u00a310,000 in\nFreshers' Week; it was in fact more\nlike \u00a33,000.\nThis week we have a double bill\nfeaturing The Lover Speaks, fresh\nfrom their Eurythmics support tour,\nand a very nice group of boys from\nNorth London called The Gospel. The\nformer play a good mix of colourful\nrock with a good uptempo feel and\nvery interesting vocals. The voice is\nthat of David Freedman, who is\ncurrently in conspiracy with Alison\nMoyet in her latest single which was\nreviewed not so long ago in these\npages. It is also rumoured that A&M will be down at the gig giving away\nrecords. The Gospel are an energetic\nyoung band whose only aim in life is\nto entertain, having recently done\nseveral gigs at the Mean Fidler\nincluding a proclaim ers support. They\nare well worth seeing. Doors open at\nabout 8.30pm and entry is \u00a32 in\nadvance and \u00a32.50 on the door or\n\u00a31.50 Ents cards. There is the usual\nlate bar and also a disco to fill in the\ngaps.\nNext week there should be a disco\nand free band on Thursday or Friday\nand Saturday the 7th sees the first\nComedy Night so keep your eyes\npeeled.\nJohn Noble,\nChairman of Parties Person.\nReview\nThe first of a regular series of gigs\nput on by IC Ents took place last\nFriday when the Ents Room in the\nUnion Building rocked to the sound\nof Circus Circus Circus (or Circus x3 as they proclaimed on the hats and\nt shirts they were busy selling!).\nThe night was advertised as a live\nband and disco starting at 9pm and\nrunning (with bar extension until\n12am) until lam. Surprisingly that's just what it was although the disco\ndidn't really start to fill up until about\n10.15pm in readiness no doubt for the\nband due on stage at 10.30pm. Some\npeople (shock, horror) were even\ndancing to the disco prior to the\nband's entrance! Finally, after a few\nhitches (no one could find the sound\ntechnician), Circus x3 arrived on\nstage at 10.50pm. The first, and only, two words to\ndescribe the band that sprang to mind\nwere 'loud'; there was more than one\nrequest to turn down the volume, and\n'duna mic'; the lead vocalist didn't appear to pause for breath once and\ncontinued to jump around stage\nthroughout the performance.\nCircus x3 are not really to my taste\nand I cannot remember much of their\nmusic except that it seemed to have\nneither rhythm nor tune and the\nvocals were indistinct. Many people,\nhowever, enjoyed the whole evening\nand I think it was more than worth the\n\u00a31 entrance if only for the disco and\nbar extension.\nCUT THE K RAP Cut 'n' Blow Dry \u00a35.00\nWednesday Warn onwards\nin the Ents Room (above the\nNew FELIX Office)\n8 Friday October 23rd1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Careers A POSTGRADUATE COURSE\n(BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE SURE)\nYou're finishing\nyour first degree.\nYou've enjoyed\nyour chosen\nsubject, done\nfairly well in all\nyour exams and\nyou're on for a reasonably good\ndegree. Your first\nfew years at\nUniversity have\nbeen intellectually\nstimulating and\nenjoyable, so\nyou'd like to\nspend some more\ntime at college.\nYou certainly\ndon't feel ready to\nstart a job quite\nyet, so you think\nabout doing a postgraduate\ncourse. Why not,\nyou think?\nWell, one very good reason for\nnot doing a postgraduate degree is\nthat you can't think of anything\nbetter. Once the PG money has run\nout, you are going to be in exactly\nthe same situ t ation again, but, (if\nyou're lucky) with an extra\nqualification of dubious value, or\nwithout one (if you're not). In this\ncase, to have tried and failed is\nworse than to have never have tried\nat all.\nOne even worse reason for doing\na PhD is falling prey to flattery.\nYou may feel that you're immune,\nbut come July and the degree results\nare out, and famous professors ask\nif you would like to do a degree\nwith them; it is all too easy to\nbecome overwhelmed by pride.\nProfessors have reasons of their\nown for wanting PhD students,\nsome of which are not at all\nattractive.\nIf you have enjoyed yourself as\nan undergraduate, consider whether\nthe things you have enjoyed will\ncontinue as a PG. Postgraduate life\nis many miles away from that of\nundergraduates; most of the\nsup rises are pleasant, but be ready\nfor some shocks. Think, for\nexample, whether you could live for\nanother three years on the money\nyou get at the moment (a PG grant\nis no more per week than an\nundergrad ute gets), especially when\nit comes to accommodation; how\nmuch has accommodation risen in\nthe last three years, and what nasty\nshocks have HM Government got\nin store? You can say bye bye now\nto housing benefit.\nBefore you get the idea that I am\ndead set against PG's, there are\nsome positive reasons why you\nshould continue.\nPerhaps you have some special\ninterest gained as an undergraduate,\nand you want to continue in this\nfield. Many a Masters course caters\nfor this need (eg Astrophysics).\nThe most obvious choice is\nvocational; you actually need the\nqualification for your chosen\ncareer. You may feel it will be\neasier to get a job with the extra\nletters after your name. You may\nwant to change to another field (eg\nInformation Technology). Beware,\nhowever, as admissions tutors can\nbe prone to exaggerate how\nvocational their courses are. Be sure\nto ask what their previous scholars\nare now doing; whether they have\njobs and in which areas. You could,\nof course, ask the employers in your\nchosen field (Careers Fair is a good\ntime for this), or talk to a careers\nadvisor.\nThe important thing when\ndeciding about postgraduate study\nis to have positive reasons for\nstaying at university. Enjoying the\natmosphere is not enough, and is\nunlikely to provide enough\nmotivation to get you through the\ncourse. Not only is this a waste of\nyour time, but it stops someone who\nis interested in taking your place.\nIf you are thinking about a PG\ncourse, then there are two things\nthat will really help you. The first\nis to get hold of a copy of the\n'Postgraduate Handbook'. This is a booklet produced by postgraduates\nat IC that gives advice and\ninformation about postgraduate life.\nObviously what is written is biased\ntowards life at IC, but much of it\napplies to other places as well. It is\ndue to be published before\nChristmas, but for those in a hurry\nthere are plenty of copies of last\nyear's edition available (free!) in the\nIC Union office. Last year's edition\ncontains information on courses,\nchoosing a supervisor, money as a PG, and personal views of PG life\nfrom all sides of the fence. It also\ncontains useful information on life\nas a woman PG, and life as an\noverseas PG at Imperial.\nSecondly, you must get about and\nask current PG's, preferably in your\nchosen field, about PG life. Sit them\ndown, buy them a burger or a few\ndrinks. You will learn more like this\nthan by reading a hundred books.\nOK, so you have your heart set\non a PG course. What courses are\navailable? The Careers Office in\nSherfield keeps a reference copy of\n'Graduate Studies', which lists all\nthe PhD, Masters and many of the\nDiploma courses available in the\nUK. They also have information on\nstudying abroad. Ask around in\nyour department. Consider whether\nyou want to stay here, or move\naway.\nThe timetable: you can leave it\nreally late (June even), but don't be\nsurprised if you ending up taking an\nenforced year out! To be safe, start\nmaking enquiries now. For most\nPhD's and Masters, the prudent\napply around Christmas, but for\nmany vocational courses like\nteaching, you will need to apply\nnow. The main deadlines are those\nto do with applying for grants: see\nthe Careers service and PG\nHandbook for more details.\nOne last bit of advice; being a PG\ncan be great, and if you think you\nmay be even remotely interested,\napply. If you get an offer of a place,\nyou can always turn it down, and\nit may well save you waiting a year\nbecause you dithered for too long.\nFELIX Friday October 23rd198725 "
