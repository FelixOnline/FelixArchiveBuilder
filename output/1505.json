    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\n\u2019ve been thinking about boots recently\u2026 is the campest opener I\ncould have written, but it\u2019s true.\nI\u2019ve thought about how amazing they are, and how everyone\nshould have a pair. I mean trainers are\nfine, but they\u2019re just not as versatile. If\nyou want trainers, by the way, definitely\ngo for NikeiD\u2019s. You can make them\nreflect your personality a lot more, and\nwaste a lot of time perfecting them. The\nknowledge that you could quite possibly\nbe the only person with that pair of trainers is also key to their appeal. Even academics\n1\nand business leaders\n2\nhave been\nknown to wear them and think that they\nbestow large quantities of swagger.\n3\nThe\nidea of almost unlimited customisation is\nso good that other companies have stolen\nit, and, as we all know, it\u2019s only the best\nideas that are stolen.\n4\nIt is likely that that\nlast joke will be deemed to in-jokey, and\nso I apologise.\n5\nSo, back to boots. The reason they are\namazing is that they are simultaneously\ncasual and comfortable while being\nsmarter than your average trainer. You\ncan wear them everyday, without looking\noverdressed for lectures; unlike normal\nshoes, which can end up looking incongruously formal with certain outfits.\nTo be slightly more specific, brown\nboots are definitely a must if you ask\nme (please understand that I am definitely not talking about Ugg boots, I cannot stress that enough). Pressed to give\nmore detail, I would say that the slightly\nweathered dark brown variety are my\npersonal favourite.\nBlack boots are fine and can be worn\nwith any pair of jeans, but they\u2019re just\nmore discrete and there\u2019s not as much\nvariation between different pairs. You\nTim Arbabzadah\nAshura: A lesson from Islam\u2019s history\nThey are totally boots-iful\nmay be able to wear them with a certain\ncolour of jeans you like, but you sacrifice\nthe range of choice that other boots can\ngive you. If something\u2019s black, it needs\nto be pretty special to be disguisable\nfrom something else that\u2019s black. Well,\nokay, I may be exaggerating a bit, there is\nvariation, but it\u2019s hard to actually see until you\u2019re up close. I\u2019ll attempt to explain\nwhat I mean; at the distance between your\nhead and someone\u2019s shoes (the usual distance you see boots at) all black boots\nlook pretty similar.\n6\nEven when, for me\n7\n,\nthat distance isn\u2019t as far as I would like it\nto be.\n8\nIf I\u2019m honest, I would advise you\nto get both black and brown boots. I just\ndon\u2019t want to be blamed for encouraging\nirresponsible spending.\nWhen I was shopping around for boots,\nI went everywhere. I even went to the\nhigh-end shops, although, unfortunately,\nmy student loan doesn\u2019t really extend\nthat far\n9\n, so I was only looking to see\nwhat they would be like. To be honest,\nthey weren\u2019t anything special. They were\neither bland and uninspiring or just not\nwhat I was looking for (at a price I was\nnever really willing to pay). In the end, I\nfound that your standard high street shops\nreally are the best bet. River Island is my\npersonal favourite as they have a decent\nrange of boots at a reasonable price tag.\nAll Saints are okay, but they\u2019re all over\n\u00a3100 for something you really can get\nelsewhere. Although, being a man, I\u2019m\nslightly unsure of how much they should\nbe. How do I know what\u2019s a reasonable\nprice for something that I\u2019ve never paid\nfor before? The only solution seems to\nbe to shop around. Eventually, you will\nrealise that, in general, All Saints are a\nrip off, and this isn\u2019t limited to their boot\nsection. Their boots also look as if they\nI\nnstinctively, we all admire the\n\u2018good\u2019 things in humankind \u2013\ncompassion, honesty and justice.\nOur free will to actively pursue\nsuch attributes through our actions is arguably what gives us our worth\nas human beings. But have you ever\nconsidered the lengths you go to in order to stand by what you believe is right?\nWould you die for the sake of freedom?\nMalcolm X once said: \u2018If you\u2019re not\nready to die for it, take the word \u2018freedom\u2019 out of your vocabulary.\u2019\nOne remarkable man has touched the\nlives of many, including Charles Dickens, Gandhi and Antoine Bara. Hussein! Born in 5th century Arabia, he\nwas known for his tremendous generosity and kindness. Being the grandson of\nthe Prophet Mohammed (pbuh), and the\napple of his eye, he was a prominent and\ncherished figure amongst early Muslims.\nYet, Hussein and his family were massacred in cold blood, on the day of Ashura,\non the orders of, ironically enough, the\nMuslim Caliph of the time, Yazid I.\nWhy? Yazid was a tyrannical leader.\nHe was known to rape, imprison and\nsteal; he was swift to silence those who\ndared question his legitimacy as Caliph.\nThrough propaganda and fear-monger-ing, he was able to assume power, and\nmany people felt there was no choice but\nto accept him as leader. Hussein, on the\nother hand, was a man who believed in\ndignity and freedom; he refused to pay\nallegiance to Yazid, a person who had\nlittle respect for his fellow man. Despite\nthe oppressive pressure mounted against\nhim and the almost certain promise of\nbeing killed, Hussein remained defiant\nin his stance and famously said \u2013 \u2018Death\nwith dignity is better than life with humiliation.\u2019\nIn the year 680AD, Hussein, his fami-ly, and 72 of his companions found themselves stranded on the desolate plains\nof Karbala (in modern day Iraq). They\nwere surrounded by Yazid\u2019s army of at\nleast 5000 men, who had their water sup-ply, the Euphrates River, cut-off. On the\nCaliph\u2019s orders, a brief battle of several\nhours commenced, ending in the killing\nof Hussein, and all the men in his camp.\nThe remaining women and children were\ntaken as prisoners of war. Yet amongst\nall this carnage and destruction, a revolution had ignited. The words of S\u00f8ren\nKierkegaard could not be more relevant:\n\u201cThe tyrant dies and his rule is over; the\nhave been designed purely for the use of\nJLS and The Wanted.\nIn conclusion, go to River Island, buy\na pair of boots and wear them with pride.\nHaving re-read this, I feel I should do\nsomething manly. So, I\u2019m off to drink\npints and chant about my credentials as\na Zulu warrior.\n10\nReferences:\n1. Dr M.R. Arbabzadah MA, my brother,\nand noted Classicist (noted here).\n2. B. L.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nt\u2019s the start of a cold winter\u2019s day in\nLondon. A young man gets into his\ncar to drive to work. Amongst the\nbustle of traffic, a pedestrian runs\nonto the road \u2013 the young man sees\nthis, but does not react fast enough. The car\nswerves, bumps into the pavement, and he\nwakes up dazed in hospital a few hours later.\nAt the back of the hospital, a rat scurries\nacross concrete, foraging for food. He senses\na smell that should raise alarm \u2013 a cat. But instead of running away, the scent intrigues him.\nThrowing caution to the wind, he scurries into\nthe open, only to be pounced on by a tabby.\nOverlooking this scene from the window\nof a nearby university, anthropology students are discussing cultural differences\naround the world, debating how these differences might have occurred.\nAre these events completely unrelated?\nThey would appear to be \u2013 but may be linked\nby one, rather unknown little creature; a parasite named Toxoplasma gondii.\nIn rats, the parasite is responsible for a\nphenomenon known as \u2018fatal feline attraction\u2019. The rat becomes less cautious, more\nactive, and even seems attracted to feline\nodour. In this way, T. gondii may have led to\nour rat\u2019s untimely demise.\nAs for our young man, he may have just\nbeen tired and careless \u2013 or more shockingly,\nhis behaviour may have been influenced by\nparasitic infection. T. gondii reduces reaction times in humans, and can increase the\nrisk of road accidents. On a more global\nlevel, it is possible that the prevalence of\nT. gondii infection, through subtly affecting\nindividual personalities, may affect a country\u2019s entire culture.\nThe situation reads as if it were a script\nfrom science fiction. How can a parasite produce such dramatic effects? Until recently,\nthis question has been very difficult to an-swer, but genome sequencing of T. gondii\nhas produced insightful results. Two genes\nin the parasite produce an enzyme that increases levels of the neurotransmitter dopa-mine, which is known to affect mood, per-sonality, and plays an important role in some\nmental illness.\nTo understand why this parasite may possess these genes, we need to turn to our second case \u2013 the tale of the rat and the cat. The\nparasite relies on cats to spread, and an important part of its life-cycle occurs in a cat\u2019s\ngut. Altering the rat\u2019s behaviour to increase\nits chances of being eaten would allow the\nparasite to complete its life-cycle, repro-duce, and emerge in the cat\u2019s faeces.\nGiven this life-cycle, why \u2013 and how \u2013\ndoes the parasite affect humans? It would\nappear that we are accidental hosts; our\nmammalian brains are similar to those of\nrats, but we aren\u2019t affected in quite the same\nway. The main route of transmission to humans is through eating undercooked meat\n(from infected cattle, for example). Humans\ncan also contract the parasite from the en-vironment; soil or unwashed vegetables,\nwhich may have been exposed to cat faeces.\nThe subtle parasite\nMaya Kaushik explains the link between slow reactions and suicidal rats\nMany people around the world are unknowingly infected. The parasite\u2019s effects\nare subtle, and in most healthy people it produces no illness beyond mild flu-like symp-toms. The precise prevalence of infection is\nnot known \u2013 in the UK it may be around 7%;\nin other countries it may be much higher,\nreaching as high as 70% in some parts of\nthe world.\nBut the effects of T. gondii can range beyond just subtle changes in behaviour. Studies show that schizophrenia patients show a\nhigher prevalence of infection, and whilst\nthis correlation does not imply causation,\nthe link is under investigation. People with\nAIDS often suffer from acute toxoplasmo-sis, which can cause an inflammation of the\nbrain leading to severe symptoms, and even\ndeath. Perhaps the best known symptom of\nthe parasite is its impact on foetuses, where\nit can cause spontaneous abortions and severe neural complications.\nFor a parasite that is so common, and has\nsuch a wide range of effects, the mechanism\nby which it works is surprisingly unknown.\nIts lack of obvious symptoms in healthy\npeople has led to it being ignored. My research will help understand how this parasite works in the brain \u2013 is it the increase in\ndopamine that causes the rat to change its\nbehaviour? What does this imply for infected humans? In regions of the world where\nover half the population are infected, the effects of this parasite, subtle or not, can no\nlonger be ignored.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nParasites may be lurking on a cold winter\u2019s day, better off staying in...\nGraphene makes inkjet printer\nelectronics a possibilty\nGraphene is a unique material consisting of single layer\nof carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal pattern. As the\nthinnest and most conductive material ever discovered\nit has countless possible applications in electronics.\nResearch into the material is progressing quickly, with\nthe government setting aside \u00a350m for this purpose\nearlier this year.\nNow a group of engineers from Cambridge University\nhave announced that they have managed to produce\na graphene based transistor using an inkjet printer.\nWriting in a paper published last month on arXiv.org, a\npre-print repository, the team describe how the performance of their transistors is broadly comparable to that\nof traditional semiconductor transistors.\nThe ink for this process was produced by using the\nsolvent N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to strip off single\nlayers of graphene from a block of graphite in a process\nknown as liquid phase exfoliation. While other solvents\ncould have been used, NMP was chosen since it stops\nflakes of graphene in an ink droplet becoming concentrated around its perimeter as it dries on a surface \u2013 a\nphenomenon which is known as the \u2018coffee ring effect\u2019\nand which is highly detrimental to the function of electronics produced in this fashion. A centrifuge was then\nused to remove graphene flakes with a diameter of\nmore than one micrometer, which might have blocked\nthe printer nozzle, and the quality of the ink was assessed using spectroscopy and transmission electron\nmicroscopy. A modified desktop printer was used to\nprint a transistor onto a surface which was coated with\nhexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to further reduce the\n\u201ccoffee ring effect\u201d. The printer was first tested by producing dot based patterns before moving on to attempt\na transistor.\nWhile inkjet printers have already been used to produce conventional complementary metal-oxide-semi-conductor transistors these have proved, unlike those\ncreated by the Cambridge team, to operate far too slowly to be of any practical use. Graphene based electronics are still far more expensive than their conventional\ncounterparts, but the use of simple inkjet technology\npromises massive reductions in price.\nThe wide range of surfaces on which transistors can\nbe printed and the fact that graphene ink is transparent also opens up a wide range of possibilities. The\nteam says that their work \u201cpaves the way to all-printed,\nflexible and transparent graphene devices on arbitrary\nsubstrate\u201d and foresees it being used in the production\nof \u201ctouch screens, electronic paper (e-paper), sensors,\nradio frequency tags, photovoltaic cells, and electronic\ntextiles\u201d.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nFELIX\n10 Friday 09 december 2011\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week professors from various institutions across the UK outlined their fears\nregarding the higher education White Paper in a letter, in particular highlighting\na perceived move that the Paper could\nlead to: a US-style higher education private sector that would see for-profit companies becoming able to acquire struggling universities. Claiming that one of\nthe negative consequences of such a\nmove would be \u201ccrushing levels of debt\u201d,\nthe conclusion that the academics have\nreached deserves at least some analysis,\nespecially considering the ongoing debt\nsituation that graduates already face.\nCritics may initially point out that the\nletter is simply a knee-jerk reaction to the\nchanges outlined by the White Paper by\nacademics unwilling to adapt to the creation of a form of higher education market,\na market that would be responsive to the\nneeds of the student and would potentially lead to far more dynamic changes than\nwe see at present. However, studying the\ngrievances of the professors further sees\nsignificant worry towards an American\nsystem of for-profit business.\nHowever, there is always a possibility\nthat the private sector could allow universities access to greater resources than\nwe can find at present. After all, alumni\nfundraising at UK universities pales significantly in comparison to institutions in\nthe US. Help from the private sector, despite danger from the shareholder, could\nbe immeasurably more profitable than at\npresent.\nAnother comment that the academics\nmake concerns the fact that a move towards a higher education private sector\nwould see a heavy burden on the taxpay-er, as well as the indebted student. Yet\nthe taxpayer, as we are reminded by the\npast government-subsided system and\nfierce critics of the proposals of the current government, currently foots the bill\nfor university degrees across the country.\nWe are heading inexorably towards\n\u00a39,000 fees next year. For better or for\nworse, and whatever your own personal\nopinion on the government\u2019s proposals,\nwe will begin to at least have a better\nidea of the new worth of a degree under\nour current system once the new intake\nof students begin next year. Concerned\nacademics such as those who signed the\nletter to The Daily Telegraph will likely\nhave to wait and see whether the new\nfees will lead to an American system. At\nthe very least, we must have faith in the\ncurrent system and the focus on financial\nsupport that we continue to enjoy.\nFELIX\nConcerns must at least\nbe considered\nFELIX\n20 Friday 09 december 2011\nI\ndiscovered a game called Balderdash at a dinner party last\nweek (I can feel the mid-life\nbeckoning me already \u2013 damn).\nFor those of you unaware of\nthe game, it essentially involves making things up to trick people. A player\nreads something off a card; an acro-nym, a name, a law, or something\nelse of that nature. The other players\nthen have to write down a response;\nwhat the acronym stands for, why the\nname is (supposedly) famous, that\nsort of thing. Answers are collected\nand read out by the individual who\noriginally wrote the card. Following\nthis the players pick what they believe\nto be the correct response and duly\nadvance around the board if they\u2019re\nright. Some of the answers really\nwere absurd; I wish I could provide\nsome examples but they have eluded\nme somewhat (maybe it\u2019s that middle\naged thing again). In essence, you do\nwell in this game by writing bullshit\nthat\u2019s believable. I\u2019ve used the word\n\u2018bullshit\u2019 because I really don\u2019t think\nany other word would portray exactly\nwhat I\u2019m trying to say in this article\n(advanced apologies for the overuse\nof that particular word).\nWhat has struck me since playing\nBalderdash is how much nonsense I\nsee and hear every day. It would appear as if there are two reasons why\nsomeone might bullshit (excluding to\nwin a game of Balderdash, of course);\nfirst off we have the \u201ccry-for-attention\u201d bullshit. I\u2019ve given it that name\nbecause, let\u2019s face it, everyone knows\nsomeone who bullshits for attention\ndue to insecurities \u2013 and even if it usually works it doesn\u2019t make you any\nless pathetic. It may involve deciding\nto sleep on the floor of a lecture theatre during a lecture so that people can\nnotice you and think: \u201cooh they must\nbe really tired\u201d or, more likely, \u201cwhat\na twat\u201d. It could also involve talking\nloudly about how much you\u2019ve been\nbench pressing in Ethos. Yeah, great,\nyou have big pectorals. Good for you.\nThe other type of rubbish that has\nbeen somewhat prominent as of recent\nis the \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m talking\nabout\u201d type (I may regret saying that).\nWhy do people open their mouths\nwhen all that prevails are nonsensi-cal, ill-thought out, feeble and often\ncontradictory attempts at coherent be-liefs? You may or may not have seen\nor heard about a video on YouTube\ncalled \u2018My Tram Experience\u2019 (ap-proximately 48 hours after uploading\nit had close to 3.5 million views). The\npassengers of aforementioned tram all\nbear witness to a white, 34 year old,\nprobably drunk or drugged up woman\nwith her child sitting on one knee.\nThe mother is ejecting racist remarks\nlike a torrent of vomit. Admittedly\nit\u2019s not the worst video I\u2019ve seen in\nterms of racism; in fact, it\u2019s somewhat tame compared to EDL member\n\u2018Cobz Smith\u2019 attacking Asians on the\ntube for no apparent reason other than\ntheir place of origin. Nevertheless,\nit doesn\u2019t exactly make for pleasant\nviewing.\nThis woman clearly had no idea\nwhat she was on about. After accosting another woman because of her\nskin colour she fumbled around for\nwords like Ed Miliband in a union dis-pute, telling her to \u201cgo back to where\nyou come from, so back to Sib... fucking Nig... N*****agua\u201d. I assume she\nmeant Nicaragua. Following this she\nspewed out the following: \u201cYou ain\u2019t\nfucking British! Fuck off! You ain\u2019t\nBritish, you\u2019re black! You\u2019re black!\nYou ain\u2019t British, you\u2019re black!\u201d. So\nit turns out that being black and being\nBritish are mutually exclusive events.\nApparently.\nThis whole Jeremy Clarkson issue\nis a load of rubbish as well. It saddens me how the journalism industry\ncompletely misconstrues a situation to\nmake \u2018news\u2019. If you watch the whole\ninterview you can tell that in typical\nBalderdash and other lies\nGeorge Barnett\nThis is a Christmas themed article.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 11\nFriday 09 december 2011\nProfessor David Phillips, current president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, took to the lectern on November 8\nfor the latest Friends of Imperial College (FOIC) event.\nIn line with FOIC\u2019s celebrations of\nthe UN Year of Chemistry, the Imperial professor emeritus guided the\naudience with an authoritative yet\navuncular manner through a few of\nhis personal predictions for the future\nof chemistry.\nA great deal of the work done by the\nRSC centres on highlighting the key\nchallenges faced by the world today\nfor which chemistry hopes to hold\nsolutions. Foremost amongst these is\nthe development of green chemistry,\nespecially ionic liquids as a substitute\nfor more harmful solvents. Solvents\nare critical in most industrial chemical processes, as illustrated by the fact\nthat they represent 90% of the waste\nproducts in the pharmaceuticals in-dustry.\nRegrettably however these same\nsolvents make up 35% of global emissions of volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs) that give rise to smog and\ngreenhouse gases.\nThere were a few bewildered faces\namongst the group of visiting secondary school students as Phillips cited\nthe case of Viagra production as an\nexample of the improved consumption habits and efficient use of sol-vents. Having required 1300 litres of\n\u2018red\u2019, harmful solvents to produce a\nkilogram of Viagra in 1990, today we\nneed only 6.3 litres of less dangerous\n\u2018amber\u2019 solvents, with the hope being\nthat we might need an even smaller\namount of the ideal \u2018green\u2019 solvents in\nthe near future.\nWill Prince\nA brave new molecular world\nLasers may hold key to cryptography\n\u201cThe generation of random numbers\nis too important to be left to chance.\u201d\nThis was the title of a 1970 article by\nrecognised expert in pseudo-random\nnumber generation Robert R Coveyou. There are many controversies\nsurrounding the various algorithms\nused to generate numbers with the illusion of randomness, but one Ottawa\nphysicist appears to have developed a\nway to generate them truly randomly.\nBen Sussman, who works with\nquantum technologies at the National\nResearch Council, used laser pulses\nwhich last only a trillionth of a second to demonstrate the generation of\nrandom numbers. The laser pulse is\nfired at a diamond and the emergent\nphotons are measured. Due to quantum vacuum fluctuations, the quantum state of the photons which were\nfired are changed. This is due to the\nmicroscopic flickering of the amount\nof energy in a minute point in space.\nIf the method of transforming an\nentity is known to an attacker, the\ncryptographic system the technique\nis applied to can be compromised.\nSussman commented on the photons\u2019\nchanges of state, explaining \u201cwhat\nquantum mechanics tells us is that\nit\u2019s against the laws of physics to\nknow\u201d.\nRandom numbers are used to seed\ncryptographic systems worldwide.\nThey are used in the core security\nalgorithms which provide two way\nprotected communication, site certification and digital signatures. These\nfeatures can then be applied to secure\nwebsite browsing, credit card transactions and other security-intensive\nelements of the digital world.\nIn cryptography, Kerckhoffs\u2019s principle states that only the key of a\nsecurity system needs to remain secret and not the algorithm. In many\ncases, digital keys are formed from\noutputs given by pseudo-random\nnumber generators. If these generators contain flaws, the keys will contain inherent vulnerabilities to attack.\nAlexander Karapetian\nThe Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange system relies on random numbers\nPhillips shared the case of azox-ystrobin, a seemingly paradoxical\nfungicidal fungus discovered through\nblue-sky research by Czech and German chemists. Having found that trees\nwith the fungus strobilurin (the active\nagent in azoxystrobin) grew no other\nfungi, research was undertaken that\nled to a frantic patent battle between\nSygenta and BASF. The former won,\nhanding in their application 24 hours\nbefore the latter, and Sygenta announced annual azoxystrobin sales of\nover $1bn in 2008. Used as a fungicide in wheat, vegetables and a wide\nrange of commonplace foodstuffs,\nPhillips hypothesised that without the\nchemical (and the grasp of chemistry\nto harness its properties) we would see\nfood prices increase by half overnight.\nShifting from the kitchen table to\nthe operating table, Prof. Phillips\u2019\nmost impressive examples of frontier\nchemistry came in medical applica-tions. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)\nenables the treatment of malignant tumours through photosensitive agents\nthat attach exclusively to the tumour\ntissue and bombard it with singlet\noxygen. Talking through the case of\na patient with a tongue tumour, Prof.\nPhillips pointed out that two decades\nago, treatment would have certainly\nresulted in removal of the tongue, rendering the patient speechless for life.\nWith PDT, a technique developed\nfrom research in bio fluorescence, a\npatient can expect to see the tumour\nin remission within a week of treatment and be fully healed in a matter\nof months.\nIf things couldn\u2019t get any better, the\nprocedure is minimally invasive and\ntumours hold no possibility of developing a resistance.\nNaturally accustomed to political\npersuasion through his role at the\nRSC, Phillips took every opportunity\nto impress upon his audience the merSussman\u2019s method of taking advantage of quantum mechanical effects\nto produce random numbers has the\npotential to produce large quantities\nof random numbers very efficiently,\nwith the added benefit that the method of generation, how the quantum\nstates were changed, is impossible to\ndeduce.\nThe one-time pad cipher, known to\nbe information-theoretically secure,\nis a mathematically perfect means of\nsecuring information. The drawbacks\nare in the effort required for its successful implementation. One requirement is the use of truly random numbers as keys. Sussman hinted at this\nin his comments, noting \u201ca truly random number generator will provide\nimpenetrable encryption for communications\u201d.\nWhile some scientists continue to\nunderstand more about the mysteries of quantum mechanics and probe\nwhat we can and cannot know math-ematically, others utilise the latter to\nbenefit those requiring secrecy.\nits of blue-sky research \u2013 how whilst\ntoday it may seem aimless, it will no\ndoubt form the springboard for the\ngreat leaps of tomorrow. Given the\ncurrent economic climate, he proposed that support for the sciences\nin the UK would sow the seeds of future prosperity, highlighting that even\ntoday apparently trivial discoveries\nmade two decades ago are finding\nlife-enriching and economically beneficial applications. Are you reading,\nMr. Cameron?\nAn explanation of Viagra\u2019s applications and an anecdote involving Prince\nPhillip later, the look of confusion on\nthe faces of school students quickly\nchanged to one of horror, probably as\na result of mental images that the wizened prince and a sex-drug together\nmight evoke.\nWhilst some of the more virile\namong us might question whether the\nefficient production of Viagra represents a key global challenge, the\nimportance of securing a safe, environmentally friendly food supply is\nundoubtable.\n\u201csupport for the\nsciences in the UK\nwould sow the seeds\nof future prosperity\u201d\nProfessor David Phillips, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 17\nAre you a Gangster?\nSerge Vasylechko\nThe Imperial Entrepeneurs tell us the story of a new kind\nof \u2018gang warfare\u2019 within the Social Media, and how it is\nbettering the work of young entrepreneurs\nWalking up towards the exit from\nthe SAF lecture theatre I saw two\npeople approach me who asked that\nexact question. \u201cAre you a gangster?\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, it made a few other\npeople turn their heads around in\nwonder, as they were also leaving the\nlecture hall after a presentation on\nsocial economy.\nLittle did they know about what made\nthese two strangers say this and how it\ncould be connected to one Christian\nVanizette. Despite what some friends\nmay say for the usual joke this had\nnothing to do with my Russian/Ukrainian background and the tales of Russian mafia wars...\nAs I smiled and replied \u201cyes\u201d the\neavesdroppers drew closer towards us\nto try and understand what was going\non. In fact, what these two strangers\nwere referring to was a movement that\noriginated in France about a year ago\ncalled MakeSense. It challenges people\nfrom around the globe to help social entrepreneurs to solve some of the world\u2019s\nmost stressing problems by organising\ncreative brainstorm sessions that are\ncalled \u2018hold-ups\u2019 (yes, just like the\n\u2018robbery at gunpoint\u2019). When a hold-up\nis organised, 6 to 15 gangsters (that is,\nmembers of this movement) come together to meet one social entrepreneur\nwith a specific problem to solve.\nThe challenge could be anything\nfrom the basic question of \u201cHow do I\nbuild an online community for my fair\ntrade business?\u201d to more complex ones\nsuch as \u201cHow do I scale internationally\nto support my microfinance charity in\nIndia?\u201d or \u201cHow do I introduce new\nstreams of revenue for my environmental initiative in Chile?\u201d The case is then\nbrainstormed in a structured way so that\nafter two hours the gangsters are able to\ncome up with 100 ideas and five possible solutions to a given problem.\nOf course, the answers are not always\nright, and in fact, quite often they are\ntruly out-of-the-box, but what MakeSense-ers are able to do is to give to the\nsocial entrepreneur an outsider\u2019s per-spective. By breaking down the business concept into tiny pieces, thinking\ncreatively, and reconstructing it with a\ndifferent view, MakeSense gangsters\ngive the entrepreneur an opportunity\nto see those crucial improvements and\nflaws in their initiative \u2013 something that\nis paramount to any business survival\nand success.\nOne could compare it to a cool consulting case study, or an engineering\nproblem. Whatever you may call it,\nthere are a few of things that make\nhold-ups very special indeed. Firstly,\nby working with real world businesses\nthat pursue an ethical mission to tackle\nan environmental or a social problem\n\u2013 the definition of social enterprise \u2013 it\noffers a sense of real achievement. Secondly, it teaches participants to think in\nreal business terms \u2013 a skill which most\nof us don\u2019t get taught in the classroom.\nLastly it also provides a point of contact\nwith lots of ambitious people who are\npassionate about making a difference.\nAs MakeSense is growing and new\nmembers are adding up, more and more\nhold-ups are being organized around\nthe world. In the past 6 months it grew\nfrom a small community of around 100\ngangsters based in Paris, to more than\n500 across London, Vienna, Berlin,\nSan Francisco, Shanghai and even Melbourne. The gang recently reached the\nhallmark of 100 organized hold-ups,\nand is growing exponentially as I write.\nIndeed, right now, the Paris hub is leading six hold-ups simultaneously to help\nimprove six unique social businesses.\nSo, what kind of businesses do MakeSense gangsters get involved in any-way? One of the new enterprises that\nthe London MakeSense gang is planning to work with is GiveMeTap, a social business that aims to create UK\u2019s\nfirst free water refilling network. The\nidea is that anyone who has bought a\nGiveMeTap refillable water bottle can\ngo to the nearest cafe or restaurant\nwhich is signed up to the scheme and\nget a refill of clean drinkable tap water.\nTruly inspiring, this business hits on\nmultiple social problem areas at the\nsame time. Not only it is trying to tackle the stigma around drinking tap water\n(despite it being safe due to Health &\nSafety regulations for retail environ-ments), and unthinkable masses of\nlandfill waste that get packed up with\nplastic water bottles, it also challenges\nour perception of water as a \u2018paid for\u2019\ncommodity. A lot of people today may\nfeel too shy about asking for tap water\nin a restaurant as it is seen as an act of\n\u2018cheapness\u2019 rather than a basic right.\nGiveMeTap is trying to challenge that\nnotion and save the environment at the\nsame time. Moreover, 70% of its profits\nfrom the sale of refillable bottles go towards building sustainable water projects in Africa.\nHowever, despite all this, as the\nfounder describes it \u201cthe challenge for\nGiveMeTap is to be able to scale significantly enough so that there is a refillable station every 500m around big UK\ncity hubs.\u201d It will inarguably struggle\nto gain a mass following unless one of\nthe bigger retailers, such as Starbucks,\nwill sign up to its scheme. Herein lies\nthe challenge to solve for gangsters of\nMakeSense.\nAnother interesting business that\nMakeSense had previously organized a\nhold-up with is a microfinance startup\ncalled Emaji. Currently in its early stages of development, Emaji is building an\nonline marketplace which will allow\nentrepreneurs in the developing and\nthird world countries to sell their products directly to consumers in the west.\nThe current issue with many market\nmakers, especially Emaji\u2019s main target\nmarket \u2013 craft-makers \u2013 is that they receive only a tiny profit from the products they sell in their localities, which\noften is not enough for sustaining their\nfamilies. Drawing on their passion\nin entrepreneurship, the founders of\nEmaji plan to develop an easy-to-use e-commerce platform which will connect\nconsumers with craft makers and their\nstories. The challenge posed to MakeSense gangsters was to think bold and\nto answer \u201cHow can Emaji become a\nFacebook of Fairtrade?\u201d.\nStill, if you feel that your greatest\nskill is not in strategy or marketing, but\nrather, for example, your coding abili-ties, there are gangsters who do just\nthat. Earlier last week, Mike Mompi\nfrom MakeSense London gang helped\norganize a two day \u2018hack-a-thon\u2019\nwith Random Hacks of Kindness and\nMyBnk Social Enterprise, which challenged the problem of financial illiteracy and financial inclusion. The event\nbrought together developers, designers\nand financial experts who attempted\nto come up with new solutions on the\nsubject of matter and tested them right\naway.\nQuite a bunch, isn\u2019t it? The current\nstatus of social enterprise as a branch of\nentrepreneurship, or indeed as the sole\nway to do business, looks likely to grow\nexponentially as more and more people\nbecome empowered with technology,\nespecially that of social networking. Increasingly, corporate social responsibility is becoming essential for support of\nlarge businesses and, logically, the next\nlevel up would be to build businesses\nwhich have a social aspect deeply integrated into their business concepts.\nLast but not least, given the recent\nevents of political and economic instability the politicians often agree that\nthe old systems need to be reformed to\nbecome more socially responsible. In\nfact, UK is already a leader in social innovation with 1.7m people working in\nthe social sector jobs and one in three\nstartups having a social aspect in their\nbusiness models.\nSo, if you still dream of changing\nthe world and want to hang out and\nlearn from social entrepreneurs feel\nfree to email us at entrepreneurs@\nimperial.ac.uk. We\u2019ll make sure to\nlet you know about the next hold-up,\nand more importantly, hail you as a\ngangster.\nWise guys (from left) Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe\nPesci play old-school gangsters in Scorsese\u2019s GoodFellas (1990)\nPaul Newman (right) and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the 1969 film of the same\nname.

He is now taking full advantage of his forces to crush dissent from\nSunni opposition and liberal media.\nNot only would a full scale invasion\nallow us to free the Iraqi people from\nan oppressive regime, but would give\nus a strategic position in the Persian\nGulf and increase oil security. Besides,\nwe\u2019ll easily have the military capacity\nwhen we finally withdraw troops from\nIraq at the end of the year.\nIRAN Iran\u2019s supposedly peaceful nuclear programme is the greatest threat\nto the stability of the earth.

This is not like Iraq in\n2003 \u2013 not only do they have a lot more\noil, but the IAEA\u2019s report has made it\nclear that they are developing weapons\nof mass destruction. They might even be\nable to deploy them within 45 years.\nGREECE Germany and France are\npresently requesting Britain\u2019s financial help in bailing out Greece. What\nthey really need is a bailiff, and that\nis a role that I think this country is\nwell-qualified to assume, given its\ntradition of colonialism for furthering\neconomic objectives. In addition, occupying Greece would also provide a\nstepping stone from which to launch\nan invasion to reclaim Cyprus, in order to secure sandy beaches and gaudy\nnightclubs regularly frequented by\nBritish tourists.\nW\nith a recent cut in\npublic sector wage\nrises for the next\ntwo years leading to a pay cut in\nreal terms, and a call to reduce public sector pensions, civil servants and\nother affected parties went on srike\nlast week. This forced approximately\n58% of schools in England to close\ntoday, along with affecting roughly\n6,000 routine medical operations.\nThe strikes also had the effect of increasing the number of middle aged,\nmiddle class people handing out flyers on the streets and standing around\nwith neatly printed posters. While this\nhas given printing companies a slight\nboost in revenue, these events caused\nannoyance for people on the street as\nthey had to put more effort into not\naccepting flyers or making eye contact on their way to pick up lunch.\nThe government gleefully reported\nthat less than a third of civil servants\nwere on strike, having been sneakily\nchained to their desks the previous\nevening after carefully scheduled office parties around the country. However, our sources tell us that these\nparties were funded by budget cuts\nin government departments forcing\nthe closure of toilets in all publicly\nowned office spaces.

Today I\u2019ve been talking to a few of the settled protestors\nto understand their motives. So far it\nseems that the people gathered here are\nunited with a single purpose, to show\ntheir dissatisfaction with the current\ndemocratic system of government. In\nfact, these protestors are calling for an\nend to democracy in the White House\nand the introduction of open corruption and dictatorship to the head of the\ncountry.\nI had a conversation with the leader\nof the movement, Dick Jersey, who\nelaborated on the ethos of the group:\n\u201cWell Pete, it\u2019s like this. America\nis hurting, and we the people find the\nAdministration guilty of negligence.\nHowever this negligence is not a\npassing phase, we believe this insti-tutionalised negligence is a result of\nthe poison of democracy. We believe,\nthat it is time for the Federal Government to step aside and allow one man,\na politically powerful, well connected\nand wealthy man, to take control of our\nblessed country and steer it in the direction of it\u2019s future glory!\n\u201cFor too long we have suffered the\nindignity of decency, having to always\ndo what\u2019s right in the eyes of the world,\nbeing champions of justice and fairness,\nand now it is our time to prosper. America is a humble and poor nation, we\nrule the world fairly, often at a cost to\nourselves, and we even sell our excess\nfood to inhabitants of less privileged\ncountries, giving them to chance to enjoy American food. However, thinking\nonly of others and not for ourselves is\nTHE NEWS THAT\u2019S NOT\n\u201cBringing accurate, fictional news to readers around campus\u201d\nWho will we invade this Christmas?\nBy Rajat Jain and Veli Akiner\nAmericans Protest in Central Park\nhurting our fair nation, and it\u2019s time to\ndo something about it!

Without a dictator\nwe are lost sheep, subject to the whims\nof squabbling politicians, each trying to\nshout louder than the other in order to\nmake their voices heard. It will be tough\nand the change will encounter friction,\nbut if we want to be able to compete\nwith our peers in the Arab States and\nAfrica we will need to evolve and adapt\nto face this ever-changing world!\u201d\nThe protestors wish to broadcast their\nmessage to the world in hope that they\nwill find comradeship amongst like-minded groups with a passion for ac-tivism.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 23\n\u201d\nD\nid you know that voting for First Year Entertainments Committee\nMembers opened last\nweek? Nope, me neither \u2013 until it was pointed out to me. In\nfact, for that matter, I never knew that\nyou could stand for it!\nImperial\u2019s Union is a very democratic affair, and this is a good thing\n(though it is possible to have too much\ndemocracy, I may return to this in the\nfuture); it allows us, the students, to\ndecide how our Union is run. Which\nis important, considering we are the\nones who will use the services that the\nUnion provides, and therefore it is in\ntheir interest to tailor it to our interests\nso that we actually give them money.\nThe thing is, if this election (which is\nan excellent idea, in my opinion) is to\nbe of any worth, you actually need to\npromote the damn thing.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the Union\u2019s\nwebsite. There is no mention of the\nelection. Doing a search for the \u2018ents\ncommittee\u2019 does bring up some ar-ticles, but they only say that elections\nfor the first year will only occur in\nthe autumn. There is also the Union\u2019s\nelections page, which hasn\u2019t been updated since the year rep and council\nelections earlier this year. It will be a\nmiracle if people actually knew that\nvoting was open.\nMaybe I am being too harsh. Taking\na quick look at my emails does show\nan email from the President dated November 23, which does say when nom-David Bowe\nPhilip Kent\nStuff your job, mate\nEnt committee elections? What a joke!\ninations and voting can be performed,\nbut this isn\u2019t really good enough.\nMany people probably do not read\nthese emails (I certainly glanced over\nthis one, though that was because my\ninbox was a mess at the time), therefore leaving them completely ignorant\nand locked out of the democratic pro-cess.\nNow, let\u2019s say you did know about\nthe election, and you logged on to\nvote. You may not have seen any campaigning (I gather this is because the\ncandidates were not told when they\nwere allowed to), so you have to turn\nto the manifestos (something that you\nreally should be doing anyway). If you\ndid, you would\u2019ve seen a complete\nlack of photos and manifestos. I\u2019m not\nentirely sure whether this is the candidate\u2019s or the Union\u2019s fault, but either\nway, it is not helpful \u2013 and does not\nallow me to make an informed choice.\nLuckily I spoke to a few of the can-didates, and actually found one who\nhad good plans for entertainment at\nICU; therefore, I was able to cast my\nvote. However, not everyone would\nhave had this opportunity, leading to\npeople making either uninformed de-cisions, or just choosing not to vote (or\nvoting RON) because they were not\nprovided with the right information.\nAll this does is ruins the democratic\nprocess that usually serves the Union\nso well.\nYou may argue that this is just the\nEntertainments Committee, and therefore it doesn\u2019t matter. To a certain deI\nthink I\u2019m like most students heading into their last year of college.\nI like my student life and the\nthought of giving it up in place of\na serious job is enough to make\nme want to repeat. Truth be told I\u2019m a\nlittle terrified of stepping out into this big,\nbad world and experiencing life without a\nmidweek party. Unfortunately for me, it\nseems the lunge is coming fast and I still\nlack that elusive spot of maturity which\nmight actually make me in some way\nemployable.\nHowever, all is not lost because my\nplan is simple. I\u2019m still young with little\nconcern and plenty of unquestioning, ill\ndirected enthusiasm. Even though I\u2019ve\nhad the responsibility of my own passport\nfor several years now, the inner pages still\nsit idly blank and the most action it\u2019s seen\nis during a lads holiday to Majorca two\nyears ago. So at this point, I think there is\nonly one reasonable conclusion.\nNow I\u2019m no master of languages and\nif I\u2019m honest English still presents a\nproblem, but even so, a trip to the far end\nof the world sounds like a well thought\nout plan to me. I\u2019m dying to take a few\nmonths in Africa\u2019s deep jungle or Australia\u2019s precarious outback, but when I delve\ninto the nitty-gritty most of what Google\ncomes back with informs me that I\u2019ve\njust become an unsuspecting millionaire.\nLuckily there are some flowers in the\nmuck, and I did find an organisation that\ncould help me with my traveling troubles.\nWhen I browsed what they have to offer,\nthings started to look a whole lot brighter\nand ideas I would never have considered\nbegan to play in my mind.\nWhile I began with wild dreams of remote locations unknown to man, I have\nbeen charmed into a more civilized approach to travel; somewhere a little more\naccommodating, namely Canada. I know\nwhat you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s a far cry from\nmy first speculative ambitions, but the\nfact is there are not many places better,\nat least not for someone like me. Crucially, I\u2019ll still be able to knock back beers\nwith people who speak in a way that\u2019s\nconceivable to me, but they also have a\ncompliant visa policy, good standards of\nliving and probably best of all, some of\nthe best ski resorts in the world.\nYes, skiing may be somewhat of a mystery to me but it\u2019s not going to dampen\nmy spirits. I can still get a decent wage as\na barman, and live in a flat that won\u2019t eat\ninto my student loan as much as a parking permit here in London. Ski resorts\nare full of young people looking to take\nadvantage of the seasonal work, and if\nyou\u2019ve ever heard from anybody who\u2019s\nspent time in these places you\u2019ll find their\nbanter isn\u2019t bad either.\nThe organisation that I\u2019m going with\n(BUNAC, if your interested), seem really\nhelpful and look like they\u2019re able to sort\nout most of what I need. In all honesty, I\nhaven\u2019t had to do much apart from send\nan email or two so far and things already\ngree, you may be right. As a person\nwho really doesn\u2019t like clubbing (or\nalcohol), the work of this committee\nis going to make very little difference\nto my life here at Imperial. However, I\nremain a principled man, and I refuse\nto believe that this disaster doesn\u2019t\nhave any chance of being replicated\nin a more important election in the fu-ture, such as for faculty union representatives \u2013 or God forbid, future sab-baticals. ICU, please sort it out.\nOn a related note, if any of the people standing had planned to campaign\nagainst entry charges for the Union on\nFridays, they would have instantly got\nmy vote. As you may or may not know,\nit\u2019s Felix Drinks on a Friday evening,\nseem to be well on their way to being\norganised. Although I am probably a bit\nahead of myself, which is a nice new\nchange, it\u2019s hard not to get a little excited.\nAll I that is left right now is to find somebody else eager to try something similar\nto ensure I\u2019ll not spend my nights eating\ndinner alone.\nThe trouble is that it\u2019s easier said than\ndone as most people I know have been\nswept up in the whirlwind frenzy for\ngrad jobs. Honestly, I think this kind of\nthing should be made more apparent for\nthose of us clinging to our last days at\nthe student union. It\u2019s all too easy to get\ncaught up in Imperial\u2019s endless battle to\nget ahead but employers recognise these\ndifficult times and showing some independence like this will never be frowned\nupon. Personally, I would advise anyone\nin two minds, or struggling with assessment centres, to just go out a do it before\nwork inevitably takes us over. You\u2019ll\nnever have a better opportunity than now.\nThe thing is, if this\nelection... is to be\nof any worth, you\nactually need to\npromote the damn\nthing.\nand if I am running late I don\u2019t really\nwant to pay for the privilege of getting\ninto the place where I can have a drink\nwith my fellow Felixians. One of the\nsection editors also mentioned that he\nhad to pay to get in to the office on\nWednesday to put together his pages,\nwhich is an even more serious problem\nthan my inability to get a drink.\nIt is a ridiculous charge. I can understand charging for entry into Metric,\nsince you\u2019re under no obligation to\nbuy anything when you go clubbing,\nbut if you are going to FiveSixEight,\nyou are pretty much guaranteed to buy\nsome food or drink!\nPlease get rid of it, and both Common Sense and I will be pleased.\nA portrayal of how exciting being elected on the ents committee is\nThe thin\nThe thi\nelection\nelection\n\u201d\nIt\u2019s all too easy to\nget caught up in\nImperial\u2019s endless\nbattle to get ahead...\n\u201c\nIt\u2019s all to\nIt\u2019s all to\nget caug\nget caug\nOne of my little helpers told me that the views expressed here are the opinions of the authors, not\nFelix.\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 43\nMario Hayashi\nComing to a Wonderland near you: M\u00fcnchener Currywurst!\nWinter is coming.\nAnd so, as autumn draws to a close,\nwe must all brace ourselves for the season to come.\nBut not all is lost amid chilly temperatures and shorter days: after all, it\u2019s the\ntime of year when penguins suit up for\ntheir annual winter ball. With the holiday season just started, there\u2019s plenty to\nbe celebrated and feasted on. Food, once\nagain, has taken centre stage.\nEnter Winter Wonderland. For those\nof you who\u2019ve not yet been: situated\nin London\u2019s historic Hyde Park, it\u2019s\nan amusement park within convenient\nwalking distance from our college. Ever\nnotice the Ferris Wheel at Hyde Park\nCorner? That\u2019s the place I\u2019m talking of.\nAs if modelled after a traditional German (or allow me to interject, Austrian!)\nChristkindlmarkt, food and souvenir\nstands exhibit an uncanny similarity to\nthose found on the Continent. What\u2019s\nmore, the rides and attractions are all\nsourced from (presumably) Germany\nand Bavarian flags dominate the wonderland scene. Welcome to Europe!\nBack to our foods menu: Winter Wonderland offers nothing short of roasted\nchestnuts (nut-lovers you\u2019ll love this),\nmulled wine, Hungarian Langos and\ngoulash. But the real highlight of the\nwinter night? Hot dogs. They\u2019re literally\neverywhere, and for good reason: the\nauthentic German Weisswurst, grilled\nto perfection, tastes heavenly and can\u2019t\nbe missed out on. By far the greatest\nGerman invention, the M\u00fcnchener Currywurst is a one-of-a-kind sausage that\nexperts unanimously agree to be the\nlong reigning king of the Wurst arena.\nA range of beers are served too and are\nbest enjoyed at the Bavarian beer hut,\nwhere dance beats of the 80s and 90s\nliven up the atmosphere.\nWhile the foods are delicious, the prices are a shocker. All foods are expensive and I\u2019ve come to discover that hot\ndog prices vary from stand to stand. So\nwatch out folks. Also, there are no free\ncash machines (there\u2019s no such thing as\na free lunch, after all), so make sure you\nhave cash at hand when you visit.\nFinally, Winter Wonderland offers an\nice skating rink too, for those who want\nto work off the delicious drinks and food\nwith some exercise.\nEnjoy!\nFrosty the Cupcake\nWarm up the kitchen with some classic Christmas baking\nFollow these guidelines on how to make\nyourself the perfect base and frosting in\ntime for Christmas!\nBase\nIngredients\n1 1/2 cups cake flour\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nPinch of nutmeg\n85 grams unsalted butter at room temperature\n1/2 cup granulated white sugar\n1/4 cup light brown sugar \u2014 packed\n1 egg lightly beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n3/4 cups full-fat yoghurt\n3 large nectarines, peeled, cored and\nchopped into 1-inch cubes\nMethod\nSift flour, baking powder, baking soda,\nsalt and nutmeg. Mix dry mixtures thoroughly to ensure that everything is well\nmixed. Set mixture aside.\nPlace butter in a large bowl and beat\nwith an electric mixer (or with a wooden spoon and sufficient arm grease) until mixture is soft, about 3 minutes.\nTip in the white and brown sugar and\nmix with the mixer until mixture is pale\nbrown, creamy, and velvety, about 8\nminutes. Remember to scrape down the\nsides of the mixing bowl every once in\na while to ensure that all sugar is well\nmixed. Whisk marks left by the beater\nshould be visible in the luxuriously\nfluffy mixture. This step incorporates air\ninto the batter to ensure that the resulting cupcake is light and the crumbs are\nsoft. Do take time to beat well.\nAdd the egg and beat it into the mixture well, scrape the sides of the bowl\nbefore beating for another 30 seconds.\nMix in the vanilla extract and the full-fat yoghurt, and mix well.\nAdd the prepared dry ingredients and\nthe cubed fruits. Mix by hand using a\nwhisk or large spoon until everything\nis mixed. Try and resist the urge to be\noverzealous when stirring. Mix only\nuntil everything is just combined. Overmixing would result in tough cupcakes.\nDivide batter into muffin trays that\nare either lined with muffin paper cases\nor greased with baking spray. Fill each\nmuffin wells to about 3/4 full, any more\nand the mixture would overflow in the\noven. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes at 150C\nor until a toothpick inserted into the\nmiddle of the cake comes out without\nwet batter. Do not open the oven door\nfor the first 10 minutes.\nWhen cupcakes are done, remove\nfrom the oven and cool cupcakes for\nfive minutes in the tin. After five min-utes, turn out the cupcakes and cool\ncompletely on a wire rack.\nAt this point, the cupcakes can either\nbe frosted with cream cheese frosting,\nor eaten just as they are.\nFrosting\nIngredients\n45 grams of unsalted butter \u2014 room\ntemperature\n2.5 cups icing sugar\n125 grams cream cheese \u2013 fridge cold.\n1/2 teaspoon lemon juice\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nMethod\nEnsure that butter is at room temperature and that cream cheese is fridge\ncold. Cut cream cheese into cubes before placing back into the fridge for at\nleast 30 minutes.\nBeat the butter with all the icing sugar\nuntil sandy. Start mixing really slowly\nto prevent inhaling icing sugar.\nThe mixture will look like yellow\nsand.\nAdd the cream cheese, vanilla and\nlemon juice; beat with an electric mixer\n(or with a wooden spoon) until mixture\nforms stiff frosting. The mixture may\nseem like it is never going to come\ntogether as it may look very dry. Give\nit time and don\u2019t add any more liquid.\nDon\u2019t beat for more than two minutes or\nthe frosting will be too runny.\nTop the cooled cupcake with about\none tablespoon of frosting. Ensure that\nthe cupcakes are completely cooled to\nprevent the frosting from melting.\nYap Chin Hua\nYou might not find a free lunch within Hyde Park this winter, but headaches are a real possibility\n\n"

Read on to the very end,\nand you could get involved and start\nyour beautiful career.\nImperial College Fives society kicked\noff a promising start to the season after representing at the Universities Eton\nFives Championships at Eton College\non 12th November and in the BUCS\nRugby Fives Championships at Marlborough College.\nIn fives, a ball is propelled against the\nwalls of a special court using gloved or\nbare hands as though they were a rac-quet. Basically, you could say it was\nsquash\u2019s naughty ambidextrous steps-ibling.\nRugby fives is very much that, a fast\nand furious game played with hands\nand can be played in doubles or singles.\nEton Fives is a solely doubles game,\nand was modelled on the walls of Eton\nChapel, and involves playing in a 3\nwalled court with a buttress on the left,\nand many ledges to render the game\nfast, furious and very unpredictable!\nSo, first off, with the Eton Fives\nChampionships, this year, as we had so\nmany players, we are able to represent\nprestigious institution and form an autonomous Imperial College team. There\nFives: much more than\njust a prime number\nwas blood, sweat and many a tear shed\nfor University bragging rights as we\ntook down 5 players, 3 of whom, in the\nform of Christopher Clarke, Mitul Palan and George Shillam were complete\nfresh faces to the Universities tournament circuit. Their progressive gameplay was very impressive, which meant\nthey were truly ambidextrous by the end\nof the day, and striking hard cross court\nshots any professional would be proud\nof.\nOur first pair, Abhishek Bhattacharya and Alun Meredith battled hard after missing out on the group stages to\nbeat Manchester and Exeter and progress into the Plate Finals, where they\npersevered but had to settle for runner-up against a strong Queen Mary\u2019s pair,\nsadly losing 15-8.\nThe BUCS Rugby Fives Championships a fortnight later saw 3 players in\nthe form of Michael Squire, Abhishek\nBhattacharya and our resident expert\nChristopher Burrows (currently rated\n13th nationally) locking horns against\nthe other Universities, representing in\nboth the singles and doubles tourna-ments.\nThey all fought with a determined attitude with Michael and Abhishek, first\ntimers on the BUCS circuit, unable to\npass through the group stages, but successfully staying determined enough to\nprogress into the quarter-finals of the\nplate.\nChristopher in his own inimitable\nstyle eased into the semi-finals, taking\nno mercy on his opponents, crushing\nCambridge, Oxford and Durham, but\nencountered difficult opposition in the\nsemi-finals against a Loughborough\nplayer, who went on to take the title.\nMichael and Christopher also represented the doubles tournament, and\nplayed impressively to reach the Plate\nquarters! In all, Imperial reached an\nimpressive 5th place out of 10.\nMassive thanks for all the members\ntaking part so far in Fives Society, but of\ncourse, we are on the lookout for more!\nIf you\u2019re looking for a sport to do on\nWednesday afternoons, that is mega\ncheap and cheerful (we won\u2019t bite!),\nthen do contact us at fives@imperial.\nac.uk .\nWe are lucky to have expert coaches\namongst our members so there is no prior experience needed \u2013 indeed 2 of our\nplayers in our tournaments have started\nfrom scratch!

Next\nterm, more interviews are planned\nas well as possibly the odd com-Abhishek Bhattacharya\npetition or two, so keep reading!\nWe were told to inject some Christmas cheer into the section but\nthought that photoshopping red\nhats and snowflaxes into every\npicture would be a bit heavy-hand-ed (so we just did it on the back\npage).

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 09 december 2011\nScience Editors Alexander Karapetian and Kelly Oakes bring you an inside look into snowflakes\nA magnified snow crystal and three iterations of the Koch Snowflake fractal curve\nLet it snow, let it snow...\nS\nnowflakes start out life as\nsmall particles of dust in a\nhigh up cloud. Water freezes\naround the dust particles,\nforming tiny ice crystals. At\nfirst, the ice crystals grow slowly, developing flat sides known as facets. At this\nstage they are hexagonal prisms, with\neight sides or facets \u2013 two shaped like\nhexagons and six that join the two hexagons together to make the prism. All facets grow at equal rates and, for a while,\nthe ice crystals slowly get bigger. Once\nthey reach a certain size, branches sprout\nfrom the six corners of the crystals. The\nbranches grow at the same rate to begin\nwith, because the atmospheric conditions\nare the same all around the crystals.\nBut once the weather starts to get better\nand a crystal is blown around in its cloud,\nthe surrounding temperature changes\nrandomly. Crystal growth rate is linked\nto temperature so the branches start to\ngrow more erratically. All sides of the\ncrystal experience the same conditions at\nthe same time, so they grow at the same\nrate - but that rate changes with the constantly changing temperature, resulting\nin the beautifully complex structure we\ncall a snowflake. Each snowflake looks\nslightly different thanks to its unique\ngrowing conditions, but has six-fold\nsymmetry because of its early life as a\nhexagonal prism.\nAt least, that\u2019s what a snowflake looks\nlike in theory. In practice, two branches\ndo not always grow at exactly the same\nrate even if they both exist in exactly the\nsame conditions. So not all snowflakes\nhave perfect six-fold symmetry \u2013 but\nthey come pretty close.\nTechnically, an ice crystal in the shape\nof a hexagonal prism is a snowflake. It\nwould not be difficult to find two of these\nsmall snowflakes that looks essentially\nidentical. Once they get larger and more\ncomplex, however, you would be looking for an increasingly long time \u2013 possibly forever \u2013 to find two the same.\nWhat an individual snowflake looks\nlike depends on a fine balance between\ntwo processes: faceting and branching.\nFaceting is the formation of flat sides\nand branching is the formation of, you\nguessed it, branches. These processes\nare both affected by temperature and\nother atmospheric conditions. Once a\nsnowflake leaves the hexagonal prism\nphase of its growth and starts branching,\nespecially under changing atmospheric\nconditions, it diverges from the simple\nhexagonal shape and becomes complex\nrather quickly.\nAn individual snowflake is the result of so many \u2018choices\u2019 \u2013 which way\nto branch, how fast to grow \u2013 that the\nchances that two of these complex snowflakes will be the same is very small. If\nonly a hundred choices were made in the\nformation of a snowflake, there would be\n10158\npossible different resulting snow-flakes. That\u2019s seventy orders of magnitude more than the number of atoms in\nthe universe. In reality, there are many\nmore choices made, and many more\npaths the snowflake could have gone\ndown in its formation \u2013 resulting in an\nalmost unimaginable number of possible\nsnowflakes.\nPutting aside the complex branching\nthat goes on, the stuff that snowflakes are\nmade of can also be the source of much\nvariation. Snowflakes are typically made\nup of around 1018\nwater molecules. All\nwater molecules are not created equal:\nmost will be exactly the same, but in one\nin five thousand a deuterium atom will\nhave replaced one of the hydrogen at-oms, and in one in five hundred, a slightly heavier isotope of oxygen will replace\nthe usual oxygen atom. The probability\nthat two snowflakes have these molecules laid out in the same way is very,\nvery small.\nThe shape of snowflakes has been familiar to many of us from a young age,\ninstilled in our minds by media ranging from cartoon depictions to weather\nreports. Their symmetry has been a research topic for some time; Olaus Magnus, a Swedish writer, published one of\nthe earliest snowflake diagrams in 1555.\nResearchers, philosophers and the curious eventually began to know more, with\nRen\u00e9 Descartes publishing a study for\nthe crystallization process in 1637. Just\nunder thirty years later snow crystals\nwere observed under magnification, in\nwhat was to become the first major publication of the Royal Society of London by\nRobert Hooke. His book, Micrographia,\ninspired a wave of interest in bringing the\nworld of the small to our eyes by way of\nmicroscopes, and further research catalogued the various types of crystals involved in forming snowflakes.\nBy the 1900s, we had 97 types of snow-flakes, and had studied the relationship\nbetween temperature and water vapour\nsaturation. Japanese physicist Ukichiro\nNakaya, who famously said that \u201csnowflakes are letters sent from heaven\u201d,\nlooked into how snow crystals naturally\nform various patterns, with his Nayaka\nDiagram outlining relationships among\nvapour, temperature, supersaturation and\nexcess vapour density in clouds. Nayaka\ncreated over 3000 photographic plates\nof the various shapes and was driven to\ncreate artificial snow from ice crystals\ngrown in his laboratory. His technique\nof using a cooled dual-layer hollow glass\ntube failed to create snowflakes. He did,\nhowever, manage to produce a snow\ncrystal on the tip of a single hair of rabbit fur \u2013 three years after his first attempt.\nIn 1983, snow crystals were made in\norbit on the Challenger Space Shuttle\nwhile testing biological materials in\nelectrical fields under microgravity. The\nNakaya diagram was confirmed shortly\nafter, with artificial snow crystals made\nin an updraft. Now, scientists can create artificial snow at will, with a deep\nunderstanding of the environmental and\nchemical processes involved.\nThe shape of snow crystals has also\nbeen intriguing to mathematicians. The\nKoch snowflake, named after Swedish\nmathematician Helge von Koch, was one\nof the earliest fractals to be described. It\nconsists of equilateral triangles drawn\non to segments of an existing triangle\nrepetitively. Adding triangles to every\nside of the previous state is one iteration.\nThe Koch snowflake is what you end up\nwith as the number of iterations tends to\ninfinity.\nConsidering the fractal as a mathematical curve, it would be continuous across\nthe real numbers but differentiable no-where, similar to the curious Weierstrass\nfunction that holds the same properties.\nThese functions challenged the once-believed idea that every continuous\nfunction was differentiable except on a\nset of isolated points. They, like fractals,\nexhibit self-similarity; a zoom anywhere\non the curve would look exactly the same\nas the bigger picture.\nFractals such as the Koch snowflake tend\nto have simple rules for generation but\noften result in complex plots after few\niterations. A mathematician called Felix\nHausdorff introduced a means of better\nunderstanding how fractals fill space in\n1918, called the Hausdorff dimension. It\nwas used in cases where the space was\nbetter described with non-integer values,\nas opposed to those in classical topological dimensions. The Sierpinski triangle,\na famous fractal, consists of three copies\nof itself after each iteration, with each\ncopy shrunk by a factor of a half. The\nHausdorff dimension provides a more\nintuitive means of describing the space\ntaken up by each iteration by taking into\naccount a ratio of the natural logarithms\nof the amount of copies created and their\nrespective scale factors.\nA Sierpinski hexagon, or Hexaflake, is\nbuilt with the presence of a Koch snowflake at all zoom levels, and is a generalisation of the traditional shape used,\nallowing snowflake-like fractals to be\ngenerated from arbitrary polygons tes-sellated recursively. The Hexaflake has\na larger Hausdorff dimension than the\nKoch snowflake, with features including\nthe replacement of each flake with smaller polygons on each iteration. Several\nfractals have been classified successfully\naccording to this method of calculating\nthe space they use, but some have no\nanalytical solution as yet.\nSnowflakes have always been a symbol representative of the festive season,\nand Felix Science is keeping its fingers\ncrossed for a white Christmas.\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 33\nThis is an official announcement\nI\nam a great admirer of Charlie Brooker.\nHe is a master of satire and biting social commentary and so I had very high\nexpectations of his latest work \u2013 the\nthree part anthology miniseries Black\nMirror, the first episode of which was broadcast this Sunday. I am happy to say that these\nexpectations were more than fulfilled.\nThe title Black Mirror is a reference to monitor screens and each of the episodes focuses\non the darker side of technology, especially\nsocial networking and new media. Brooker\nsays that the inaugural episode, entitled The\nNational Anthem, was inspired by \u201cthe kerfuf-fle over superinjunctions\u201d and how \u201cGordon\nBrown was virtually commanded to apologise\nto Gillian Duffy\u201d. The episode opens with\nPrime Minister Michael Callow being woken\nup to be told that the popular Princess Susannah has been kidnapped and will be killed\nunless he performs... well, let us say \u2018certain\nacts\u2019, with a pig on live television. The public are initially sympathetic to his plight but\nseveral incidents involving social media cause\nthe situation to deteriorate before he almost\nliterally has no choice but to acquiesce to the\ndemands.\nThe program is certainly very funny, the\nbest part coming near the end when we see a\ncrowd in pub watching a message broadcast\nby the government on all television channels\nproclaim: \u201cthis is an official announcement \u2013\nin a few minutes the prime minister will perform an indecent act on your screen\u201d. This is\nof course followed by the entire group, including old ladies, laughing uproariously. The\nscene becomes far more amusing, or, if you\nprefer, far more disturbing, if you are aware\nof Brooker\u2019s well publicised dislike of David\nCameron.\nThe main focus of the episode, however, is\nhow new technology means that the government has lost even a semblance of control over\nthe media and how much it is now under the\nsway of the fast changing whims of the masses.\nThis is helped by there actually being a strong\nsense of realism in how the situation escalates.\nAs with all good satire there is a feeling that,\nif the all the superficial, more ridiculous elements were removed, this would be a situation\nthat could happen in the real world.\nThe National Anthem deserved its 1.86 million viewers \u2013 the biggest audience for any\nfirst episode of a Channel 4 drama series this\nyear. Brooker has created something truly special \u2013 a show that is both relevant and funny.\nI am also pleased that he has decided to use\nthe now rarely seen anthology format \u2013 which\ncan offer a very different experience than a serial or one off feature length presentation. In\nBrooker\u2019s own words, it provides a great avenue \u201cfor exploring ideas\u201d. I\u2019m certainly looking forward to the remaining two episodes and\nI advise you to tune in too.\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nChristmas Choice\nHave your highlighter and\ncopy of Radio Times at the\nready\nMaciej Matuszewski likes the latest from Charlie Brooker\nFancy winning a copy of Michael Portillo\u2019s Great British Railway Journeys (Series 2)?\nHeard of Wikipedia?

    "content": "DPhil in Theoretical Chemistry. Despite the tragic death of his supervisor\npart way through, he persevered and\ncompleted his DPhil, whilst in fact\ndiscovering that he was a much better\npractical Chemist than a theoretical\none. As a result, he moved to Cambridge University where he did a Post\nDoc in practical chemistry that lead\nonto a Research Fellowship there.\n\u201cMost of my career I\u2019ve been an\nacademic Chemist working at research\nfacilities. After 25 years in Cambridge,\nthings were going very well, but I really\nfeared getting into a rut.\nOne of the things you\u2019ll find as you\ngrow older is that the opportunities for\nchange will get less and different, and if\nyou simply want a change for the sake\nof a change, that\u2019s actually not so easy.\u201d\nFor Professor Rayment, however,\nchange did come several times. After\nholding the position as Chair at Birmingham University for three years,\nthe position as Science Director came\nup at Diamond in 2008, for which he\nwas asked to apply, and he has held the\nposition ever since.\nWhen he arrived at Diamond, Phase\n1 of its construction had already been\ncompleted with 7 beamlines already\nunder full operation, and Phase 2, for\nthe further construction of 15 beam-lines, was underway.\n\u201cMy job was to bring the new beam-lines from construction to operation,\nand then in operation, to make them\ninto mature beamlines with a strong\ncompetitive international science programme carried out on them.\n\u201cI am here to share the leadership of\nD\niamond Light Source,\nthe UK\u2019s national synchrotron facility, sits\nin the form of a gigantic steel ring amongst\nstretches of the green countryside surrounding the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. Less\nthan a decade old, this facility is at the\ncutting edge of research and luckily\nfor me, having interned here for eight\nweeks, Professor Trevor Rayment, Director of Physical Sciences at Diamond,\nhas managed to find a few minutes in\nhis busy schedule for this interview.\nDiamond Light Source is the UK\u2019s\nlargest science experiment, and is a\nthird generation synchrotron that accelerates electrons to almost the speed\nof light in order to produce synchrotron\nlight. This light, ranging from IR to XRay in wavelength, is then split off to\nbeamlines, of which there are currently\n32 under operation around the 561m\nring \u2013 all to help deepen our knowledge\nof science, from chemistry and materi-als, to engineering and earth sciences.\nAfter a brief introduction, I sheepishly admit to Professor Rayment that\nI don\u2019t know much about his past other\nthan a brief summary of his education\nhistory. \u201cGood, that sounds about right\u201d\nhe replies, \u201cin these days of the internet,\nI prefer people to ask me in person.\u201d\nIn a place of such responsibility,\noverlooking the entire operation of the\nphysical sciences sector of the UK\u2019s\nbiggest research facility, Professor\nRayment admits that it wasn\u2019t a path he\njust fell in to.\n\u201cFrom the age of 12, I\u2019ve dreamt of\nbeing a scientist; it\u2019s what I wanted to\ndo. One of my earliest memories is going into a public library and picking out\na book on nature of some sort.\u201d\nHaving completed his degree in\nChemistry at Durham University, Professor Rayment decided to move south\nto Oxford University to study for a\nthe science division at Diamond and\nto make it into a world-class research\ninstitute. A research institute that is\nfocussed on delivering science to the\ncommunities of academia and industry.\n\u201cDay by day, it\u2019s full of all different\nsorts of meetings, mostly management.\nI spend around a day a week doing my\nown science \u2013 well that\u2019s the dream\nanyway, but the rest of the time I do\nwhat managers do, which is to listen to\nand talk to people. I need to understand\nthe organisation well enough to be able\nto make the short-term decisions in\nsuch a way as to maximise the long-term benefits.\u201d\nPicking up on the dream of spending\ntime working on his own experiments,\nI ask whether the practical chemist in\nhim misses the hands-on science.\n\u201cI would like to do more of my own\nscience of course, but that\u2019s the same\nwith every academic you ever see.\n\u201cHowever, one of the privileges of\nsynchrotron science is that experiments\ncome around on a periodic basis that\nyou really can get involved with. When\nwe\u2019re doing experiments on the beam-line, I help on a practical basis.\u201d\nProfessor Rayment admits that his\nknowledge and experience has come\nwith \u201can unimaginable number of mistakes\u201d, and it is the lessons he has learnt\nfrom these that allow him to recognise\nthe mistakes of others and solve them,\nsaving crucial time on experiments that\non average last only 48 hours.\nDespite its undeniable presence, both\non the physical landscape and on the\nhorizons of ground-breaking science\nresearch, Diamond Light Source is not\na name that many are familiar with.\nProfessor Rayment feels that this may\npartly be due to many journalists avoiding scientific writing as a result of their\nlack of scientific background, as well as\nscientists themselves not being able to\nexplain their own experiments.\nHe goes on to explain that with only\n400 members of staff and a comparatively modest budget, Diamond believes that is, in fact, \u201cpunching above\nits own weight\u201d in terms of getting the\nword out and engaging with the scientific and non-scientific communities.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of science carried out in the UK and we underpin a\nfair proportion of it. In many cases,\nthe work done at Diamond was absolutely vital, but it\u2019s underpinning and so\ndoesn\u2019t make headlines.\u201d\nI question Professor Rayment further\non the topic of Diamond\u2019s funding, and\nif the government\u2019s recent budget cuts\nhave affected the facility.\n\u201cDiamond is 86% funded by the UK\nResearch Council and 14% by the Wellcome trust. When there have been cuts\nin funding, Diamond has felt it, but we\ndo the best we can to make sure the\nusers don\u2019t feel it. This is a user syn-chrotron, and the users are kept first by\nmaking sure the people who work here\nare scientifically great. All of our principle scientists are researchers in their\nown right.\u201d\nMoving on, I question further into\nDiamond\u2019s employment schemes and\nhow current science graduates can get\ninvolved.\n\u201cFor people wanting a career here, if\nyou are one of the principle or beamline\nscientists, we want people to have an\nindependent academic research profile.\n\u201cIn the science division, there are also\npositions for Postdocs. We support research students, offer internships and\nevery beamline has two students that\nwe co-fund with a university. We also\nhave an engineering division.\u201d\nCurious as to what the Professor\nwould look for in terms of skills when\nemploying, I ask more about his opinions on science careers.\n\u201cMy personal experience of recruiting Postdocs and students is that you\nlook for ability in their grades; you\nlook for their vision, passion and en-thusiasm.\n\u201cTo be a successful academic you\nneed a whole variety of skills. I think to\nbe a good researcher; you actually need\nto have a passion for the subject, and\nyou have to learn to fail, and learn from\nthose failures.\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learnt is that\nyou always keep on learning. Over\ntime, I\u2019ve also learnt that sharing what\nyou learn and what you know with others is exceptionally valuable. One of\nthe characteristics of an academic life\nis that it can be quite solitary; it\u2019s a\nfeature of academics to want personal\nrecognition. That can be positive, but it\ncan also be destructive.\n\u201cDoing research is hard work, and\npart of your responsibility is to communicate it to other people. If you\u2019re not\nexcited about your research, then you\u2019ll\nnever excite anyone else about it.\u201d\n\u201cTo be a successful\nacademic you need a\nwhole variety of skills\u201d\nInterview: Trevor Rayment\nAlice Yang talks to the Director of Physical Sciences at Diamond Light Source\nFEATURE\n6 FELIX\nFriday 09 december 2011\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nDirector of Physical Sciences at Diamond Light Source, Professor Trevor Rayment\nHarwell Science and Innovation Campus, home of the synchrotron facility\nAlice Yang\n\n"

There is one familiar rule which simply says\nthat \u201cRed with meat, white with fish\u201d. Is it correct though? In most cases, a red wine is more\nsuitable for a meat-based dish, simply because\nthe tannins (particular ingredients of red wine)\nbind the proteins of meat, resulting in a harmonic\nmatching. Moreover, white wine and seafood have\nmany things in common, like their flavour \u2018intensity\u2019 and texture.\n2. Do you know a rule without any exceptions?\nOf course not. This is also the case for the previous point, where exceptions arise because of the\nuniqueness of each particular recipe. For example,\nimagine a meal with chicken in a white sauce with\nmushrooms. We can combine it with a mature\nwhite wine without feeling guilty, as the flavour\nand texture of meat will allow for it now. Surely,\nthough, it is a matter of taste what you will choose\nin these cases.\n3. Wine is extremely sensitive to temperature\nvariations. For this reason it is crucial to store\nour wines in a place where the temperature is as\nstable as possible.\n4. You should never put wine in the freezer, for the\nreason explained in the previous point. It\u2019s better\nto put it in the bin straight away.\n5. Finally, our shelves should allow the horizontal\nplacement of the bottles. The reason is simple;\nwhen the bottles are horizontal the cork is washed\nfrom the wine and remains moist and elastic,\nmaintaining the ability to adjust well on the neck\nof the bottle. Therefore, the wine is protected from\noxygen.\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nWine Culture\nMichael Krestas makes his top festive food and drink decisions\nA luxurious hotel must always include\nking size bedrooms, royal breakfast, at\nleast one swimming pool, a spa, a gym, a\nposh bar or... just the greatest chocolate\nin the UK!

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal\nWill Prince\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nt was with great surprise, even perhaps shock, that I opened an email\nfrom the Editor a couple of weeks\nago inviting me to review this play. It\nwas not only the fact that I was being\nasked to write again for this paper (my previous comment articles were met by some\nmisguided opposition) but that the show\nitself was so aptly named. Now to all you\ndoubters out there: no, there has not been a\ntypo in the subheading. The Seven Lessons\nof George Howard was indeed a genuine\npiece of fringe theatre. Unfortunately, this\nwas not a play in homage to my life thus far,\nthough it most certainly came close to being\nequally thought provoking and stimulating.\nSeven Lessons follows the relationship\nbetween George, a once-famous theatre\ndirector turned teacher, and a new student,\nAgnieska, who has never acted before.\nAgnieska brings with her a play she has\nwritten and persuades George to use it as\nthe focus of their classes. Her motives are\nunclear from the start, but as the play progresses the audience sees both teacher and\nstudent adapt to their characters within the\nplay, and develop their own personal mo-tivations.\nI attended the world premiere of this show,\nby the relatively unknown playwright Chris\nJohnston, and was billed as still \u2018a work in\nprogress\u2019. Put on a with a small budget at a\ncosy theatre in Islington, it would be easy\nfor your average theatre buff to turn their\nnose up and resort to a more established location and work. Yet it was these very characteristics \u2013 the intimate, \u2018in the round\u2019 set\nand the emphasis on dialogue and character\nrather than on flashy technical gimmicks \u2013\nthat worked in the show\u2019s favor. Through\nthis unique setting, the audience was drawn\ninto the thoughts and motives of George and\nAgnieska; how they evolved throughout the\nplay. As the story unfolded, questions as to\nthe motives behind making theatre itself\nwere highlighted and misunderstandings of\nvarious viewpoints were explored.\nthe popularity it once had. The main problem is, I feel, not to do with the quality of\nshows (although this is definitely important!).\nIn fact I believe that nowadays mainstream\nHollywood movies and the like (with scripts\nthat even the dullards of Made in Chelsea can\nunderstand) have rendered the art of theatre\ncomparatively too inaccessible to the common person; the appeal of a night out at the\ntheatre is simply too intellectually strenuous\nto be seriously contemplated. Why would\nanybody delve into the complexities of Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot when they could so\neasily have their desire for entertainment satiated by the latest installment of Desperate\nHousewives.\nThe solution to this lies, in my opinion,\nnot with the dumbing down of theatre (how\nwould all those pretentious, alternative, artsy\npeople with their silly jeans and headwear get\ntheir air of superiority otherwise) but instead\nwith the opening up of plays to more audience\ninteraction. For example, at the end of Seven\nLessons, the audience was invited to have\ndrinks with the cast to give instant feedback\non the show. How better to get enthused about\na play than by interacting with the company\nafterwards? It\u2019s like backstage passes for ev-erybody!\nNot only was Seven Lessons an entertaining production, but also a perfect example of\nhow theatre is adapting to the modern entertainment scene. Fringe theatre will always retain that sense of alternativeness that appeals\nto some, but is definitely adapting to a wider\naudience. I would urge you to therefore, perhaps once a month, abandon your widescreen\nTV and M&S Dine in for Two deal and experience what London\u2019s theatre scene has to\noffer.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 19\nfor basic goods, not to mention luxury\nones. Fortunately, credit was cheap, so\nconsumption was kept up with debt.\nAs Alan Greenspan and company lowered interest rates further, they fuelled\nthe late economic bubble, which finally\nburst. After it burst, all that remain were\nheaps of debt to be repaid.\nIn this sense, the UK is amongst the\nhighest debtors in the world, owing\nabout 450% of its GDP, and with a government debt of around 85% GDP. But,\ndespite having a deficit higher than that\nof Portugal, Italy, Greece or Spain, and\nbeing far more indebted, \u201cthe markets\u201d\nare not attacking the UK. Why so? Osborne claims this is due to the credibility his austerity measures have given the\nUK. Most analysts, however, believe it\nis due to a complicated combination of\nfacts. On one hand, most of the potential\nattackers dwell in the City of London,\nand some believe that \u201cone does not\npooh where he eats\u201d. Besides, the maturity of British debt is of 13 years on\naverage, meaning smaller refinancing\nneeds, and the quantitative easing program seems to be buying so much UK\ndebt anyway that markets are not seeing\nmuch of it. Furthermore, the economic\ngrowth being so low and the austerity\nmeasures so tough, it is believed that the\nBank of England will not dare to raise\nthe interest rates in the years to come.\nHence, any eventual UK bankruptcy is\ndeemed unlikely.\nHowever, these measures have flooded the markets of the pound, and along\nwith the slim growth, explain the pound\nsterling\u2019s recent devaluation. They also\naccount for one of the most dramatic\nconsequences of this gambit: the UK\u2019s\nhuge inflation. With figures of around\n5% in the last two years, Mervin King\nforlornly pointed out that inflation,\ncombined with the crisis, the budget\ncuts and the loss of social benefits were\ndramatically harming UK citizen\u2019s standards of living. Recent projections expect them to be at the same level of 2001\nby 2017. This is as bad as Greece, and\nunprecedented in the UK; something\nsimilar in the 1970s cost Callaghan his\npremiership. But with the markets especially sensitive to high indebtedness,\nand with a stagnant economy, Osborne\ncan only keep his cuts, and the BoE can\nonly keep his QE and low interest rates\n\u2013 at least, in appearance.\nThose being the structural problems\nof the UK \u2013 a weak industry and high\nindebtedness \u2013 the Tory agenda seems\nto have miserably failed; none of its\npromises have been delivered, nor it\nseems they will; neither has the private\nsector overtaken the public one as the\nmain driver of the economy (has Osborne done anything after all to enforce\nthat?), nor do the British people live any\nbetter than they used to; the Cameron\ngovernment has actually made them\nworse off. It could be seen as a matter of political inexperience \u2013 after all,\nneither Cameron nor Osborne had any\nbefore coming to power \u2013 combined\nwith too much ideology and too little\npragmatism.\nFor, if the reader wonders whether\nanything better could have been done,\nhe can kindly turn his gaze towards\nSweden, where the conservatives rule\na non-Eurozone country, and by wisely\ncombining mild budget cuts, fiscal stimuli and political discretion rather than\nconfusingly mixing savage cuts, fiscal\nausterity and neo-liberalist fanaticism,\nthey have been able to maintain their\npeople\u2019s standards of living.\nI\nn last Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement, George Osborne confirmed\nthat the UK economy\u2019s health was\nfar worse than his office had ex-pected. He blamed the ongoing\nEurozone crisis of negatively affecting\nthe UK\u2019s economic growth, by pointing\nout the negative impact the former had\nhad in our country\u2019s exports.\nThe effect of the Eurocrisis in the UK\nhighlights that, despite having its own\ncentral bank with all the freedom to buy\npublic bonds, to devalue the currency,\netc, the UK economy is so interlinked to\nthat of the Eurozone that all their troubles\nare the UK\u2019s too. Nowadays, the UK is\nthe eurozone\u2019s second commercial partner both in commodities and in financial\ntransactions; in 2009, the UK exported\n\u00a3103bn worth goods to the Eurozone,\nrepresenting around 77% of the UK\u2019s\nexports.\nThat is, there is no doubt that the Eurozone is the UK\u2019s main commercial\npartner. And right now, like it or not, it\nis its position as a member of the European Union that sustains UK economy.\nAnalysts from Foreign Policy wondered\nwhat would happen to the UK if it were\nto abandon the European Union and get\nthe same commercial status as other non-EU European countries such as Switzerland have. Their conclusions were not\nvery encouraging: the degree in which\nUK economy depends on that of the EU\nis far greater than that of Switzerland,\nand the commercial treaties Switzerland\nhas are so stiff and strict that the Swiss\ngovernment usually thinks of Brussels as\nthe \u2018house of pain.\u2019 It was deemed that\nwith the same levels of custom duties\nand financial transaction checks as those\nof Switzerland, the UK economy would\nnot survive.\nAll in all, the recent eurozone events\nhave lead to the proposal of a new financial transaction tax by some of its\nmembers and the European Commission.\nAimed at \u201cspeculative transactions\u201d,\naccording to the EC\u2019s proposal the tax\nwould consist of a 0.1% tax on bond and\nequity transactions, and 0.01% on derivative transactions between financial firms.\nThe money thus collected would be used\nto support European countries in crisis.\nThis tax, proposed within the framework of the Eurozone, could harm the\ninterests of the City firms, who mostly\ntrade in this kind of financial products.\nThey are, as a French commentator put it,\n\u201cexperts in exporting financial rubbish\u201d.\nDespite the protests of the Prime Minister, it seems he can do little to prevent this\ntax from becoming reality. After all, the\nEurozone has all the right to tax whatever\nit wants in the same way the UK has, and\nif its protests are not heard it is just because it deliberately chose not to be part\nof the Eurozone.\nHowever, if one considers the level of\ndependency the UK has with the Eurozone, and on top of that, the obvious benefits it gets out of being a EU member,\nit could be argued that its position as a\neurozone outsider is harming the UK\u2019s\nnational interests. The UK should join\nthe euro, and it should join it soon.\nThis might sound surprising; after all,\nthe euro has been considered doomed\nmany times by UK media; so was the EU\nin the 1992 crisis. But, as the unfolding\nevents are showing, it was not the euro\nthat was flawed, but the lack of a unified\nfiscal policy within the Eurozone. Now\nthat the latter is heading towards a fiscal\nunion, the euro is expected to stabilize.\nWhat comes next is a highly unified\neurozone working on its own interest,\nexcluding non-eurozone countries from\ndecisions such as the financial tax that\nmight affect the UK.\nIt could be argued that by joining the\neuro, the UK would lose a great deal of\nmonetary and fiscal sovereignty. But in\nreality, the UK is not exerting it in essentially a different way to the European\nCentral Bank. It is true that the Bank of\nEngland is being noticeably more flexible in buying public bonds than the\nEuropean Central Bank, but the latter\u2019s\nreluctance is explained by the lack of an\nunified fiscal discipline within the euro-zone; and as Merkozy already hinted,\nthat could change once the fiscal union is\nimplemented. Besides, even with its \u201cindependence\u201d, the BoE and the government have been utterly unable to prevent\nthe UK from reaching the sorry state the\nUK economy is in right now: the UK is\nnot gaining anything from having its own\ncurrency.\nHence, with such an interlinked\neconomy, and with a fiscal and monetary policy akin to its own, not being\npart of the Euroclub seems pointless. By\nbeing a member, the UK\u2019s voice would\nbe rightfully heard in Brussels, and the\neconomic benefits it is already extracting\nfrom being part of the EU would only be\nenhanced.\nThe UK should adopt\nthe Euro\nDimitri Raphaelovich argues that the UK should become part\nof the Eurozone\nAfter a good lunch, George Osborne was happy to show his confidence\nin his plan\nThe euro sign, illuminated in the European Central Bank logo, outside the ECB HQ in Frankfurt, Germany\n\n"

Whilst exhibitors tend to come from the\nsmall clutch of countries in which cannabis cultivation is legal (the homespun Dutch growers dominate\nthe line-up), the attendees predominantly come from\nthe States. Naturally there are stereotypes of those\nwho smoke cannabis and each was ably represented\nat the Borchland.

After witnessing their outstanding musical performance and poetry recital we were eager to find out\nmore about this curious bunch.\nOne Brotherhood veteran, who wished to remain\nanonymous, gave us an insight into his early life: attentive Imperialites could learn a thing or two. \u201cWe\nused to surf all day, then spend our weekends crashing\nother schools\u2019parties and stealing their girls.And then\nwe discovered psychadelics and, it was like, uh-oh!\u201d\nUh-oh indeed: the group rose to notoriety and unfortunately attracted the attention of the authorities, and\nas such many members were arrested while the rest\nscattered around the globe.\nWhen questioned about the use of drugs by younger\npeople, the Brotherhood spokesperson went on to describe an alternative solution based on personal an-ecdote: \u201cthe best time to get them [children] started\nis very young. If you catch them doing them alone,\nsimply take them by the hand and show them the path.\nMy daughter and I are now closer than ever: after taking LSD and gazing into each other\u2019s eyes for hours,\nshe took me to new levels that I didn\u2019t think were possible.\u201d Rather than turning a blind eye to drug con-sumption, perhaps UK authorities could instead see\nthe obvious benefits to the Brotherhood\u2019s approach.\nI would liken us to children in a sweetshop, except\nI imagine in the sweetshop they weren\u2019t handing free\nsamples of everything.

Sadly, rather than be\nconscientious Charlie Buckets and resist the temptation before our slightly pink eyes, we dived lungs first\ninto the occasion.\nTwo hours later, we were flat on our backs in a\nquiet corner of the convention centre, each us having\nretreated, stupefied, to some dark recess at the back\nof our minds. Either watching the passersby with vacant eyes or locked into the mellowest game of Angry\nBirds we\u2019ve ever played. After the umpteenth, we resolved to scrape ourselves off the floor and embark on\nthe journey back.\nHaving lost all inhibitions, it took a little while to\nrationalise the difficult concepts of roads and traf-fic. After what felt like an eternity we hobbled from\nthe bus into Amsterdam traffic, crossed the road unscathed and clambered into chilly hostel beds, where\nwe remained unconscious for several hours.\nWe awoke on day two refreshed and ready to face a\nsolid day of investigative journalism. Instead of reiterating the wake and bake of the first day, we focused our\nattention on attending the countless sessions on offer\nat the expo. From a presentation on how to properly\nutilise fertiliser, to a hash making class, to jolly sing-alongs \u2013 High Times\u2019expo managed to encompass the\nsublime, the ridiculous and everything in between.\nAfter attending a presentation on the endless benefits\nof hemp, followed up by checking out the cracking\nrack on Miss High Times 2011, we proceeded to track\ndown some of the big names in the industry.\nWe took our seats at the front of a hash making class\nled by the legendary hash professor Mila Jansen, who\nspent 14 years living in India learning the ways of the\nlocals. In 1995, she came to fame for developing the\nPollinator, a device described as \u201ca personal solution\nfor hand turning leaf material to separate the resin\nfrom the plant material\u201d, that is effectively only useful in hash-making. Resembling a washing machine\non it back, you place dry ice and your \u2018leaf material\u2019\ninto the drum and allow to spin before removing the\nmixture and shaking out the powdery precipitate. Cue\nwide-eyed gasps of awe as Mila\u2019s assistant sprinkled\nlight green snow over a glass-top coffee table and\nbiblical scenes as the crowd swarmed to the front to\ncollect a free sample. Speaking to Mila after the class,\nshe shared with us a few croaky anecdotes of her time\ntravelling Asia, perfecting the art of hashish. \u201cI love\nAfghani hash! I love Afghanis!\u201d\nWith the Dutch government\u2019s recent aborted attempt to tighten cannabis laws, the future of legislation was a hot topic on the convention floor. Dale was\nconvinced that our generation would see the widespread decriminalization of cannabis, Dan Skye, High\nTimes editor, was hopeful but tempered his optimism.\nCasually dressed and well spoken, Skye, who initially\ndonated the press prizes to the Felix Travel competi-tion, had a good chat with us about his views. Unsurprisingly, these mostly echoed Imperial\u2019s very own\nCouncil Chairman Baroness Manningham-Buller and\nProfessor David Nutt.\n\u201cCurrent drugs policy needs some serious re-think-ing, and as long as people aren\u2019t harming anyone they\nshould be allowed to use any substance they like,\u201d\nsaid Dan. \u201cWe have to overcome this illogical drug\nwar and put aside the rhetoric and propaganda.\u201d Cutting through the hysteria \u2013 the proposed restrictions\non cannabis tourism were dropped a few weeks before\nour visit \u2013 Dan was confident that the Cannabis Cup\nwould go on for years to come in the Netherlands, regardless of what happens in his less liberal home in\nthe States.\nDanny Danko, senior cultivation editor approaching\nhis tenth year at High Times, painted a less rosy pic-ture, telling us of his torment growing cannabis in the\nface of draconian US laws. \u201cI found it very stressful,\nvery hard on the psyche. All the secrecy and being in\nfear all the time, its not always a very natural way to\nlive.\u201d With unnerving undertones of a man oppressed,\nhe explained how every time he leaves Amsterdam,\nhe feels he is making a mistake but is too rooted to his\nlife in his homeland. In the case of Danko, who grows\nreasonably large quantities at his home in New York,\nproposed that much of the paranoia they say comes\nfrom marijuana actually comes from marijuana pro-hibition. Resigned, he concluded, \u201cafter all, it\u2019s just\nnutrients and fertilizer.\u201d\nEven though we were strictly in Amsterdam on\nbusiness, no trip would be complete without the mandatory victory lap through the red light district. Stoned\nas a rock and floppy as a 3 \u00bd inch floppy disk, Charlie, Mandy and Meow-Meow parted ways and rendezvoused at Central Station a good 20 minutes later.\nThe flight home was somewhat less problematic\nas the outward journey, and we sat in silence, struggling to compile our thoughts under the comfort of\nblankets. We staggered to our lectures feeling brighter\nand warmer than ever. To say that we are now richer\nfor the experience would be an understatement. The\ncombination of enlightened minds and magical herbs\nhas made us all better people, and the wise words of\nthe Brotherhood will stay with us for many reincarnations yet to come.\nIn spite of it being switched off, the visuals were still incredible... GREEN powder? That I CAN\u2019T snort? Well, that makes a change...\n\n"

The debate came as a result\nof an e-petition to put Babar Ahmad on\ntrial in the UK securing over 141,000\nsignatures within three months.\nThe CPS has already admitted that it\nhad never reviewed the evidence against\nBabar Ahmad (who was an employee\nof Imperial College\u2019s IT department at\nthe time of his arrest in 2004) before\nit was sent to the US. The CPS claims\nthat it was not aware of all the evidence\npossessed by the US authorities even\nthough the British police had seized all\nthe evidence in the UK. The CPS has\nnevertheless repeatedly refused to prosecute Babar Ahmad in the UK claiming\nthat there is \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d.\nConsequently, Caroline Lucas MP\ncalled for a full public inquiry into the\nCPS and their handling of the evidence\nof Babar Ahmad\u2019s case.\nStephen Phillips MP said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by what Caroline Lucas revealed,\nadding that it was a \u201cstain on justice in\nthe UK\u201d for Babar to have been imprisoned for over seven years without trial.\nFather of Babar Ahmad, Ashfaq Ahmad said: \u201cThe government continues\nMPs call for applied changes to Babar Ahmad case following evidence admissions\nAemun Reza to dodge the serious questions raised by\nDr Caroline Lucas in relation to the CPS\nbehaviour. The CPS has allowed Babar\nto languish in prison without trial for\nover seven years claiming there is \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to prosecute him,\nevidence which they now admit they\nnever even saw.\u201d\n\u201cWe fully support Dr Lucas\u2019s call\nfor a full public inquiry into the CPS\nactions in this case and call on the Attorney General to direct the Director of\nPublic Prosecutions to review all the\nevidence against Babar with a view to\nprosecuting him in the UK.\u201d\nA motion was passed for the UK\u2019s extradition laws to be urgently reformed\nin order to strengthen the protection\nof British citizens.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTips & Hacks\nTechnology Editors: Chris \u201cThe Snowman\u201d Bowers\nFeroz Salam under the mistletoe\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSpotify launches app platform\nSpotify launched an app platform last week that\nwill allow developers to add features to the standalone Spotify application. The first applications announced include the Guardian app, which allows\nusers to read reviews and new music recommen-dations, as well as similar apps from Rolling Stone\nmagazine and Pitchfork. London\u2019s Music Hack Day\nsaw a few more interesting apps released: Chordify\nallows you to select a song and automatically finds\nyou guitar tabs for it, and CTRL allows you take control of a virtual turntable, giving those Spotify party\nmixes some extra effect.\nWhile the app model will definitely see some interesting software being released for the platform,\nit is worth asking whether every piece of software\nadapting the model adds much of value. Bloat is an\nunavoidable feature of most commercially released\nsoftware, and an app system for what is essentially\na music player is perhaps a step too far.\nMerry Christmas from the\nFelix Technology team!\nEnjoy this USB Christmas tree,\nonly \u00a312.99 on Amazon\nFELIX\n12 Friday 09 december 2011\nW\nhen Nokia announced their\npartnership with Windows\nPhone 7 instead of Android\nback in February I honestly\nthought that they\u2019d made\none of the biggest mistakes in the company\u2019s\nhistory. How wrong I was.\nWindows Phone 7\nAs much as I\u2019d like to talk about the physical\nphone, the truth is, just like the iPhone, the greatest feature of the Nokia Lumia 800 has got to be\nthe operating system. Having previously owned\nan iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS and a HTC\nDesire I\u2019m quite familiar with iOS and Android,\nthe two biggest mobile phone operating systems.\nSo I put my bias against Windows Phone 7 to\none side \u2013 just for a day \u2013 to try this OS out,\nand I wasn\u2019t disappointed. We were used to listening to Steve Jobs at every keynote speech,\nconsistently overusing the words \u201cinnovation\u201d\nand \u201crevolutionary\u201d until they almost had no\nmeaning. Yet what Microsoft have done is truly\ninnovative and, well, genius. Windows Phone 7\nhas struck a perfect middle ground between iOS\nand Android: it looks slick, it\u2019s incredibly fast\nand most importantly, it\u2019s unbelievably intuitive\nto use.\nPrice\nAt \u00a3350-400, depending on what network you\u2019re\non, it\u2019s \u00a3100-150 cheaper than an iPhone 3G or\nSamsung Galaxy S2. It\u2019s even cheaper on con-tract. For example, I pay \u00a326 a month for 600\nminutes, unlimited texts, unlimited data, 2GB\nfree BT Openzone a month and 4 months insur-ance, and get the phone for free.\nIntegration\nThe integration of several separate applications\ninto one phone is one of the main successes. I\u2019ll\nquickly give you two of many examples. The\nfirst is games: all games go through a very slick\nXbox Live interface which, if you have an Xbox,\nis made even better. The other is social networking integration: if you click on a group of con-tacts, e.g. \u201cChemistry\u201d on \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d there\nis a feed of all your friends\u2019 updates, Facebook,\nTwitter, Live Messenger, Google+ and even\nLinkedIn.\nEven with messaging it integrates social net-working; imagine if text, MSN, Facebook Chat\nwere all in one thread \u2013 on this they are. You can\nbe messaging one of your friends using Facebook and, when they go offline, you just tap a\nbutton and you can send them the message as a\ntext, it\u2019s all part of the same interface.\nProductivity\nThis phone isn\u2019t only great on a personal use lev-el, it\u2019s great for work. Microsoft Office has OneNote, Excel, Powerpoint and Word so that you\ncan edit all your documents from your SkyDrive\noffline or online, on the go \u2013 great for some last\nminute edits to your lab reports.\nAnother awesome feature for productivity is,\nbecause it\u2019s Microsoft, Outlook and Calendar\nare by a long way the best I\u2019ve ever seen on any\nphone (or even tablet). It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s\nGmail, Yahoo, Hotmail or, for best functionality,\nOutlook Exchange, it\u2019s quick, slick and intuitively designed for navigation and organisation.\nFor example, threads of e-mails are kept\ngrouped, much like in Gmail, and you swipe\nfrom \u201call\u201d to \u201cunread\u201d to \u201cflagged\u201d to \u201curgent\u201d\nand you can link as many inboxes together as\nyou like.With calendar, not only do you get your\n\u201cday\u201d and \u201cagenda\u201d from your e-mail calendar\n(that is how I organise my life) but you have the\noption of including Facebook events and other\ncalendars (which are all kept colour coded). This\nalso links in with \u201ctasks\u201d of the \u201cto-do\u201d list as\nit\u2019s called on the phone, organised in level of pri-ority, deadline and again, colour coded. If you\nkeep yourself organised online using Google or\nOutlook it\u2019s an absolute lifesaver and helps keep\nyou exceptionally well organised.\nCriticism\nNo phone is perfect. The two biggest flaws with\nthis phone are, firstly, the battery life, and sec-ondly, the limited amount of apps.\nBut I\u2019m pretty sure Nokia and Windows Phone\n7 know about these. Nokia has a \u201cbattery saver\u201d\noption you can turn on, or to automatically come\non at \u201cxx%\u201d. The \u201cMarketplace\u201d may be sparse\nin its range of products, but at the moment it has\neverything I can think of that I would want on a\nphone, and it seeing as its relatively young for an\napp market, it\u2019ll definitely grow.\nConclusion\nI can honestly say I never thought I\u2019d be in favour of, let alone endorse any Windows attempt\nat a mobile OS, but here I am, in ownership of\nthe best phone in the world.\nThere is so much more to this phone than I can\nwrite, but I\u2019m running out of space. I guess the\npoint I\u2019m trying to get across is, forget your bias\nagainst Microsoft, get that iPhone out of your\narse and just try this thing out. You will not regret it.\nNokiasoft: a match made in heaven\nJason Parmar coos over his new Nokia Lumia 800\nIt\u2019s love at first sight for Jason Parmar\ndeadmau5 helped to launch the Nokia Lumia 800 at Millbank Tower in late November\n\n"

There are even online tutorials for the\nmany different ways they can be worn: as hair-bands, in braids and as turbans\u2026 this isn\u2019t just\nany scarf; this is a Liberty\u2019s scarf. -AY\nDearest female-friends, should you be feeling on\nthe generous side this Christmas, why not buy\nyour male-counterpart something a bit more spe-cial?

It\u2019s the\nValhalla of ganja, marijuana\u2019s answer to Davos, the\nmeeting place for all that is great and good in the\nworld of green \u2013 it\u2019s the Cannabis Cup.\nIn spite of everyone\u2019s best efforts to get out of\nbed and check in at Gatwick for stupid o\u2019clock, the\ntrusty pilot at RyanJet decided to fuck up our day\nand show up late. I wish I could recollect a riot\nscene \u00e0 la August in Croydon, but that\u2019s far from a\nstoner\u2019s nature. Instead there were a few apathetic\nsniffs and whimpers, as most would-be Cup-goers\nsat with lips pursed, longing for the sweet scent of\nTHC and greasy fried chicken chaser.\nThe delayed flight gave plentiful time and an\nadequate sample size to give us a good idea as to\nthe demographic of Cup-goers. An entire spectrum\nof people was present: everything from investment\nwankers right up to hoodie-sporting CoD aficio-nados. Men and women, of all ages, shapes and\nclasses \u2013 it seems there is some truth in EveryoneDoesIt.com\u2019s beloved domain name. After a few\nrounds of Angry Birds EasyAir finally got their shit\ntogether and we were off on our merry way.\nWe decamped at the hostel, breakfasted like\nchampions on some chicken strips and, buoyed\nby a sense of adventure, hit the atmospheric Hill\nStreet Blues coffee shop to warm up. As the saying\ngoes, when in Amsterdam, do as the tourists do.\nHSB is your classic coffeeshop, dark, hazy and\nfrequented by people who look like they popped in\nfor a doob in 1992 and just never really got around\nto leaving. For someone who ordinarily finds\ndreadlocks repulsive, to say I was impressed by\nsome of the examples on show so says a lot. Anyone who can grow it out and backcomb enough to\nlook like Star Wars\u2019 Bib Fortuna deserves credit.\nA couple of drinks and a zoot of Hill Street\u2019s finest later and we were probably about as outwardly\nlethargic as we were at the start, but inside we were\npumped. We shot each other the kind of look that\ngladiators give one another in the tunnel waiting to\nface the lions. We knew why we were here, so we\ntrundled out to the bus stop.\nThankfully the good folks at High Times provided us with the perfect means of transport to get\nto and from the event. A far cry from the bog standard buses of London town, the \u2018cannabus\u2019 was\nkitted out with comfy chairs, strobe lights and \u2013\nof course \u2013 ashtrays. We rumbled through to the\nmisty outskirts of town as the reggae blared and\nconversations flowed, as the residents of Amsterdam gawked at the big metal box of lunatics that\nCannabis Cup Highlights\nzoomed by.\nTo be blunt (pun intended), the journey was\ntip-top-terrific. We aggressively worked our way\nthrough the rest of our spliff and spoke endless\ncodshite to our fellow Cup-goers, at least until the\nfumes got the better of us and we were forced into\na silent submission. Before the haze and glaze, we\ndid manage to muster up some top quality investigative journalism.\nimportant in life until you almost don\u2019t have it, and\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve found it\u201d. With a puff on his pipe and\na tip of the hat, he wishes us a good Cup and enters\nthe madness.\nIt was now that shit got real. As if a converted,\ngraffitied bus with strobe lights and ashtrays hadn\u2019t\nhit it home enough, the arrival at the Borchland\nprovided the finish. None of us had any idea of\nwhat lay in wait for us through the double doors\nof this unassuming out-of-town conference centre.\nNaturally our minds had run wild over the past\nweeks, but we knew nothing, the whole affair was\nshrouded in myth and mystery.\nPicture a careers fair, except instead of rows\nof banks lining up to hand out boiled sweets and\npens, you have stall after stall offering everything a\nstoner could desire. Oh, and also the 30ft high conference hall is dense with the fruitiest smoke that\never washed over your olfactory receptors. The\nHigh Times employees made us feel immediately\nwelcome with their Southern Californian warmth\nand candour, as they handed out our judges passes\nand a bunch of free stuff. I couldn\u2019t help but pinch\nmyself when, confused by who wanted what t-shirt, the assistant serving us let slip, \u201cman, I\u2019m too\nhigh for this shit.\u201d You certainly wouldn\u2019t get it in\nStarbucks (or at least they wouldn\u2019t admit to it).\nWithout many other similar events anywhere else\nin the world, the Cannabis Cup commands global\n\u201cit was Willy Wonka\u2019s weed\nwet dream\u201d\nFelix Travel competition winners Charlie, Mandy and Bobby B\nFriends in high places\nPot smoke and phallic objects: two favourite things\nKnocking shoulders with self-proclaimed LSD experts The Brotherhood of Eternal Love\nCannabis Cup winners\nAs you\u2019d expect, competition at this year\u2019s Cannabis Cup was fiercer\nthan ever, as companies far and wide competed for that most\ncoveted of trophies.

Gamers were originally\nleft in the dark about the whole sit-uation, with Sony initially only\noffering the explanation that\nthere was an \u2018external intrusion\u2019. It took Sony days to\neven admit that addressed\nand payment details may\nhave been stolen \u2013 with\nsome reporting malicious\nuse of debit cards.\nSubscribers did get a substantial apology from Sony \u2013 as\nwell as identity theft protection for\ntheir US users, customers got two\nfree games as well as their memberships extended for free. However, the damage was done;\nSony estimated the costs from the break-in to\namount to $171m for the 23 days the PSN was\ndown for.\nValve had some bad news too. The Steam forums suffered from an attack last month, with\nValve also deciding to go silent and pretend that\nthe site was down just for some maintenance.\nWhen they did admit the extent of the damage,\nwe learnt that a Steam database had been broken\ninto, with passwords and credit card details potentially in the hands of criminals.\nLuckily for Steam users, the forums returned\nin just a few weeks, and it didn\u2019t affect the entire\nservice, though, it is a stark reminder of the risks\ninvolved with \u201ccloud\u201d gaming services such as\nSteam and the PSN.\nReleases Galore\nThere has been plenty of good news this year\nthough, with lots of major releases to keep your\nfingers occupied with. The first was back in\nMarch when the much-anticipated Crysis 2 was\nreleased, which reached over three million sales\nby June, and was generally decided to be an excellent title by the critics. Crytek\u2019s rhetoric machine was in full force for this release, with executives saying that Crysis 2\u2019s graphics, AI and\ngameplay are the best in video gaming history.\nValve also put out a new title: the equally anticipated Portal 2. Even if you got tired of Cave\nJohnson\u2019s voice, Portal 2 has much to offer,\nwith hilarious dialog, challenging puzzles and\ncooperative multiplayer. This also saw the start\nof Valve\u2019s obsession with hats, which developed\nfurther in June when Valve rereleased Team\nFortress 2 as free to play, with added benefits\navailable to those who pay. You can also\nspend some of your hard-earned cash\non hats, with a Proof of Purchase\nhat available for those who shell\nout for the premium version of\nTF2.\nFans of war games were\nalso not disappointed in\n2011, thanks to the release\nof both Modern Warfare 3 in\nNovember and, surprisingly,\nDuke Nukem Forever. MW3\nwas well received, and also saw\nthe launch of the Call of Duty Elite\nweb service, allowing die-hard fans to\nkeep up to date on every single statistic, improve their game with \u201cdeep strategies\u201d and\nmuch more.\nDuke Nukem, on the other hand, was a bit\nof a disaster. It may have taken 14 years to be\nreleased (an event which many may still find\nshocking), though this didn\u2019t lead to quality\n\u2013 Metacritic scores gave it a verdict of being\nmerely average. And the bad news didn\u2019t end\nthere \u2013 reviews slammed the game for its im-maturity; the Official Xbox Magazine UK even\nsaid \"isn't so much offensive or misogynistic as\njust suffering from an adolescent fixation with\nboobs and crowbarred-in innuendo.\"\nFor those who preferred something a little bit\nlighter, the third Humble Indie Bundle was released in the summer, with many excellent titles\nsuch as VVVVVV, Clash of the Titans and And\nYet It Moves. The \u2018pay what you want\u2019 model\nraised over $2m, of which part went to charity.\nThis was followed by additional Frozen Synapse\nand Introversion bundles.\nAnd, of course, no wrap up of the year\u2019s big\nreleases is complete without Skyrim, one of a\nfew games to receive universal acclaim. Steam\nshowed 230,000 concurrent players on the day\nof release, and approximately $450m in sales\nover just five days, making it the second best\nselling game this year, beaten only by Modern\nWarfare 3.\nAs 2011 draws to a close Philip Kent summarises the big events of the year \u2013\ngaming related, of course\n\u201cThe Humble Indie Bundle\n\u2018pay what you want\u2019 model\nraised over $2m\u201d\nConsoles on the way\nBar the Xbox 360 dashboard being revamped a\ncouple of times, Microsoft and Sony have been\nmute regarding new consoles. Nintendo, on the\nother hand, kicked off the year with the 3DS, an\nimproved version of Nintendo\u2019s\nhandheld games console, but\nwith the unusual ability of supporting 3D gaming without the\nneed for bulky glasses. It is,\nhowever, not perfect. The 3DS\ncomes in at \u00a3120, with games\nranging from \u00a330 to a hefty\n\u00a340, and suffers from a poor,\n5-hour battery life.\nWhat may be more successful\nfor them is 2012\u2019s Wii U, the successor to their last\nconsole in 2006. This was unveiled at June\u2019s E3,\nand features a touchscreen on the controller, in addition to the high definition playback on the televi-sion. This would be in addition to using the older\nWiimotes, and backwards compatibility (at least\nfrom an optical media angle) would be restricted\nto Wii games, owners of large GameCube libraries\nmay have to repurchase their titles from whatever\n(if anything) succeeds the Virtual Console.\nSome of the big games from 2011 (From top left, clockwise: Crysis 2, CoD: Modern Warfare 3,\nPortal 2, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim)\nThe one time betting on Duke is a less than\nstellar idea\n\u201cSteam showed 230,000\nconcurrent players on the\nday of Skyrim\u2019s release\u201d\nWhat can we expect in \u201812?\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what will happen next year. One\nof the arguments against the high price of the 3DS\ngames is the high cost, especially when you consider the increasing number of people gaming on\ntheir mobile phones, thanks to app store\nmania. This definitely seems to be the\nway things are going \u2013 Atari released\n100 of their classic games onto iOS, and\nthere have been calls by Nintendo\u2019s investors to do the same.\nPC gaming has had a bit of a renaissance year, and hopefully this is\na trend that will continue. Services\nlike Steam are continuously becoming\nmore popular, though with EA pulling\nall their games off of Steam to sell solely on their\nown Origin service, it may be that fragmentation\nwill lead to harming the use of the PC as a gaming\nmachine.\nAs ever, time will tell.\nValve\u2019s revolutionary gaming platform Steam\n38\n\n"

    "content": "You could say he\u2019s DEAD classy (I\u2019m here all\nnight folks)\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 37\nGAMES\nDancing the Grim Fandango\nI\nhave come to realise that there is one\nthing that gamers crave above all else in\ntheir video games: uniqueness. It's something that we only seem to see fleeting\nglances of in the modern day. Where did\nall the innovation and inspiration go? Well, a lot\nof it was spent in 1998 with the conception of\nGrim Fandango.\nThis is a game that manages to combine many\napparently unrelated elements seamlessly, so\nthat they all come together in a way that makes\nperfect sense. Specifically, the game creates a\nmelting pot of Aztec beliefs in the afterlife and a\nFilm Noir style, with heavy influence from films\nlike Casablanca. The characters take the intriguing form of skeletons in the mould of \u201cCalacas,\u201d\nideas of which originate from Aztec times.\nYou play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent in\nthe \u201cLand of the Dead\u201d who is working to pay\noff a debt owed to the powers that be. His job is\nto escort lost souls after they die, with the most\ndesirable outcome being a ticket on the Number\n9 Express, taking said souls to their final resting\nplace, \u201cThe Ninth Underworld\u201d. Unfortunately,\nnot all are deserving of this reward, and so they\ncome to Manny to see how he can help them.\nFrustrated at always being given the worst cli-ents, Manny ends up stealing a client from another travel agent. His quest to get this apparently deserving customer, \u201cMeche,\u201d a ticket on\nthe Number 9 Express turns out to be far bigger\nthan he can imagine as the player unravels a tale\nof friendship, corruption and betrayal.\nNow, what I've told you about the story may\nmake this game seem just a bit too wacky for\nanyone over the age of eight. However, once you\nare experiencing it first hand you realise that it is\ngenuinely superb. You want to know what happens next, you want to tie off all the loose ends,\nand you really want Manny to succeed in his\nquest. The characters drive the story along bril-liantly, and the voice acting in this game is some\nof the best I have heard in any video game, with\nthe standouts being Manny and his oversized\nfriend, Glottis.\nThe dialogue is very amusing and charming,\nand every single character has a unique personality with completely different voices, which\nmeans you care about their fate. Even the minor characters are brilliantly voiced and manage\nto be unforgettable, something many modern\ngames fail to achieve (I\u2019m looking at you Fallout\n3). Manny himself is one of my favourite video\ngame characters of all times. He is unassuming\nand socially awkward, but he has many hilarious\nanecdotes to relate to the player in the form of\nsoliloquies. He is simply brilliant.\nSo what do you actually do in this game? Well,\nI would define Grim Fandango as a puzzle game,\nalthough simply labelling this game as just another puzzler would be very wrong. You normally arrive at a location with a set of tasks you are\nsupposed to complete to help Manny advance on\nhis epic adventure. As you explore an area, you\ndiscover different items, characters, and locations that fill in the gaps in your knowledge, and\ngive you clues as to how you can progress. The\ngame play normally consists of finding different\nitems strewn across the fantastic environments\nand working out how they can be used to achieve\nto goal in hand. This normally involves combining different items at certain locations.\nThis process requires thought, patience, and\ntrial and error in equal portions. There may be\ntimes where you have 10 items in your inventory\nand not a clue about how any of them can help\nyou do what you want. There is no hint system,\nso you may feel a little lost at some points. But\nas you persevere, the answer will normally reveal itself. The puzzles in one area all link to-gether, so solving one will lead onto another,\nand eventually onto the advancement of the storyline (marked by a cut scene). The puzzles, in\ntune with the rest of the game, can be very weird\nand wonderful and require some imagination to\nsolve, with only one or two that seem counter-intuitive, which is impressive for a puzzle game\nof this size. In general they feel both clever and\nnatural, and are difficult enough for you to get a\nsense of achievement when you solve one.\nThe game was designed by Tim Schaffer (of\nPsychonauts and the Monkey Island series),\nwhich means you expect something a bit special,\nand you are not disappointed. Grim Fandango\ndeserves the numerous awards it has for its artistic design. The game plays out with characters moving around static backgrounds, which\nchange as you move Manny to the edge of the\nscene. The levels are very detailed and highly\nvaried, and although you will return to some of\nthe locations that you visit early in the game, you\nare never bored of the environment you are in.\nThe visuals are mind blowing for the time, not\nnecessarily in terms of graphical performance,\nbut in terms of the boldness of everything on\nscreen. It holds up even to this day, with the\ncharacter models being the real highlight. You\nwould think that the skeletal figures you meet\nmay appear recycled, repetitive figures, but they\nall have an individual styling and you can tell\nthat great care was put into each and every one\nof them. Remember, this is from 1998, so don\u2019t\nexpect full HD graphics. However, when I tried\na patched version recently it ran like a charm and\nthere were no frame rate issues to speak of.\nSam Horti takes a look back at one of gaming\u2019s unique classics, Grim Fandango\n\u201cEvery single character\nhas a unique personality\nwith completely different\nvoices, which means you\ncare about their fates\u201d\n\u201cThe puzzles, in tune with\nthe rest of the game,\ncan be very weird and\nwonderful and require\nsome imagination to solve\u201d\nThe controls may appear puzzling themselves\nat first, but you very quickly get used to them.\nManny is moved around his 3D environment\nwith the 4 directional keys, with different buttons\nassigned to different actions, such as picking up\nitems, examining your inventory or attempting\nto use items. At its core, the game play is very\nsimple. If you\u2019re looking for action packed thrills\nand spills you won\u2019t find them here. The action is\nreserved exclusively for the cut scenes, and the\ngameplay is decidedly slow paced. However, the\nstory that drives the gameplay is the real point of\ninterest, and as you always have a goal to accomplish you will never feel uninterested.\nI absolutely love this game. I can\u2019t recommend\nit highly enough if you like a game with a superb\nstory and terrific characters. Even if you don\u2019t\nlike puzzle games, I feel you should try this\ngame for an experience that few other games can\ndeliver. Manny Calavera and his great adventure\nwill stick with you for a long time. The interest-ing, challenging puzzles will keep you hooked,\nand the fact that you cannot fail to care about the\ncharacters mean you will definitely want to see\nthis stunning adventure through to its satisfying\nclimax.\n\n"

He was\noddly chilling, yet appealing, as Rochester\nin Jane Eyre, he added layers of intensity\nand anger to Magneto in X-Men: First Class,\nhis restrained performance in A Dangerous Method was a fascinating one, and his\ntop-notch performance as a sex addict in\nShame is already generating much awards\nbuzz after his Best Actor win at the Venice\nFilm Festival. All of this in a single year. A\nrising star indeed.\nSpecial Award:\nAndy Serkis\nSerkis may never win an Oscar for his role\nin Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but his\nmotion-capture performance is such a\nmesmerising piece of cinema acting that\nwe just could not stand not acknowledging him for an award. If you watch some\nof the \u201cmaking-of\u201d footage for Rise of the\nPlanet of the Apes, you will see that not\nonly are his postures perfectly captured,\nbut also his subtle facial expression. He\nvirtually has no words to say, but he still\nmanages to deliver something so powerful in his incredibly detailed and dedicated\nperformance.\nRising Star Award:\nJessica Chastain\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to begin with Chastain. Virtually unknown in 2010, a year later,\nshe\u2019s possibly one of the most talked-about\nactresses around, thanks to a number of\nfilms (The Help, The Debt, The Tree of Life,\nTake Shelter) being released within months\nof one another. She gives varied performances in very different films, the kind of\nversatility a lot of actresses struggle to\nachieve in a lifetime. Her presence is felt in\nall the films she has starred in, and the genuinely talented actress will hopefully have a\nglowing career, with her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 padded like\nnever before.\nSpecial Award:\nWoody Allen\nIt takes a unique kind of genius to write and\ndirect every year \u2013 and Allen is that man. He\nattracts the starriest ensembles, picks the\nperfect locations, shoots with his traditional modest style, and somehow manages\nto produce embracing romantic-comedies.\nHe makes hiccups here and there, but who\ndoesn\u2019t? For a man who has given us more\nthan forty films over his distinguished ca-reer, Allen shows a high level of consistency\nin his work, and is most certainly an exceptional gem of a director/writer.\nFilm of the Year:\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\nIt\u2019s a great-looking, well-acted, smartly-written, completely absorbing spy drama,\nand its slow, patient pace works as a great\nadvantage. It\u2019s layered with so much depth\nand detail that it does the great John Le\nCarr\u00e9\u2019s novel justice. The highly underrated\nGary Oldman falls beautifully into the role of\nGeorge Smiley, whose mission is to identify\na Soviet mole hidden in the high levels of\nBritish Secret Service. It\u2019s a complex ride\nbut completely worth paying attention to; a\ntriumph in every sense.\nBrit Film of the Year:\nDeathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\nIt took ten years, eight films, millions of dol-lars, and hundreds of cast and crew to get\nthe final film of the Harry Potter franchise\nabsolutely right. There is action, magic and\nmost importantly, heart. With actors having matured into their roles over the years,\nand a faultless supporting cast boasting\nsome famous English names, the finale to\nthe most successful series in the history\nof cinema is a more than satisfying one, a\nreal British triumph, and something every\ngeneration can embrace with pride.\n\n"

Bloody Christmas time.\nYou\u2019re probably reading this\nright now with the most appalled look on your face. I suggest you remove it before someone\nnotices. \u2018But why? Why do you hate\nChristmas?\u2019 You must be asking. Well\nlet me tell you. Because its frickin\u2019 ir-ritating. Irritating as hell.\nWhere do I even start? Well let\u2019s\nbegin with the obvious: Christmas\nisn\u2019t even real. What is Christmas\nexactly? It\u2019s a celebration of Jesus\u2019\nbirthday, the Son of God and our\nsaviour (as people believe). Here\u2019s a\nnews flash for you: Jesus wasn\u2019t born\non December the 25th. He was actually born somewhere in the spring-time. The day everyone is really celebrating is actually a Pagan holiday\nthat Christians chose to replace with\nChristmas, as it was easier to choose a\nday that everyone already celebrated\nwhen Christianity was just starting.\nWeirdest thing? Loads of Christians\nalready know this! They accept that\nJesus wasn\u2019t actually born in winter\nbut say it\u2019s still a good reason to celebrate God or something. This defeats\nthe original purpose about Jesus being born or whatever\u2026 but okay. So\nChristmas isn\u2019t actually Christmas,\nit\u2019s Pagan-mas. But I guess that\u2019s not\nas catchy.\nAnd so what if Jesus wasn\u2019t born\non Christmas? Most people who celebrate Christmas nowadays don\u2019t even\nbelieve in Jesus. It\u2019s a known fact that\nChurch attendance is falling every\nyear. How many people go to Church\non Christmas anymore? I don\u2019t really care. And neither do you, because\nmore likely than not, you probably\ndon\u2019t go to Church on Christmas. So\nif you aren\u2019t celebrating God or Jesus\nor anything else of a religious nature\nthen what are you celebrating? Oh\nthat\u2019s right, consumerism! The most\ncelebrated part of Christmas is pres-ents. We\u2019d like to think of ourselves as\ndeep and moral people, but the truth is\nthat we bloody love stuff. Christmas\npromotes materialism. Children come\nrunning down the stairs on Christmas\nmorning to open presents and stock-ings. I mean, what would Christmas\nbe without presents? Face it; it\u2019d be\nreally boring. What else would have\nyou running down those stairs? A tree?\nLet\u2019s not go into how environmentally\nunfriendly Christmas is in regards to\ntrees \u2013 that\u2019s obvious enough.\nDare I even mention \u2018Christmas\ncheer\u2019? Yes, because it\u2019s insanely in-furiating. Everyone gets \u2018merry\u2019 and\n\u2018joyful\u2019 around Christmas, simply because it\u2019s Christmas time. Seriously?\nIt\u2019s just a time of the year. I\u2019m not\ngoing to get randomly cheery just because it\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon or because Jupiter has aligned with Mars.\nWhen someone smiles and wishes me\na Merry Christmas it feels so fake I\npractically want to slap the smile\noff their face. Also, don\u2019t start looking forward to Christmas in October.\nWhat is that about? You\u2019ve got two\nmonths! At least allow Halloween to\npass. But that\u2019s not even the worse\npart. It\u2019s the stupid \u2018post-Christmas\ndepression\u2019 that everyone goes into\nonce Christmas is over. What the hell\nis wrong with you? It\u2019s just one day\nof the year! I don\u2019t get depressed after\nmy birthday (apart from when I cry\nover how old I\u2019m getting). It\u2019s understandable if you feel a bit down after\nsummer but that\u2019s because university/\nwork is starting. But you shouldn\u2019t get\ndepressed because Christmas is over;\nthere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\nGet over it and get on with your life\nplease. Thanks.\nChristmas songs. I want to rip more\nthan just my hair out when I hear one,\nI want to rip my whole frickin\u2019 skull\nout. If that isn\u2019t false cheer I don\u2019t\nknow what is. Throw in some stupid\nshallow competition for the \u2018Christmas No. 1\u2019 and have 20 different\nsongs released in the same week about\nmistletoe and shit and I\u2019m just about\nready to smash my radio in. Christmas loses a lot of sentimental meaning and value when you have so many\ncheesy songs about it. It\u2019s a quick way\nfor celebrities to make a lot of money.\nIn fact, Christmas in itself is one big\nmoney making machine. Card companies must love it. And obviously with\nthe aforementioned present buying,\nretailers must be raking it in. Also,\nwhat is with shops being open on\nChristmas nowadays? Who on earth is\ngoing to go to McDonald\u2019s on Christmas day? A very lonely person, that\u2019s\nwho.\nBut I\u2019m not going to deny that\nChristmas does have some good\npoints. I mean the lights are beautiful and they make people happy. I can\nagree that Christmas dinner is special\nand damn well delicious (I bet the\npoor turkeys wouldn\u2019t agree though).\nAnd the Christmas drinks they do at\nStarbucks are awesome (especially the\nEggnog Latte). The main point is that\nChristmas is a good way to bring family together. There are very few times\nin the year when all the family get\ntogether and just well\u2026 spend time\ntogether. The fact that you need one\nday in a year to bring all the family together is a different problem in itself,\nbut at least it can be counted as Christmas\u2019 redeeming quality. It makes it\nvery depressing for those who spend\nChristmas alone, but for those of you\nthat are lucky enough to spend it with\nfamily: good for you. Just remember\nthat it isn\u2019t always about the presents,\ncards, trees or decorations. So if you\ndon\u2019t get the present you wanted this\nChristmas, or your tree isn\u2019t as big as\nyou wanted it to be, then just take a\nmoment to shut the fuck up and stop\ncomplaining. Christmas is primarily\nmeant to be about all that sentimental\nstuff (or the religious stuff if you\u2019re\nreligious). Having said that, Christmas still annoys the shit out of me.\nOr maybe I just hate the way society\nperceives Christmas. Or maybe I just\nhate society. Who knows?\nHe hates Christmas, I hate writing witty captions to please the masses\n\u201d\nIt\u2019s just a time\nof the year. I\u2019m\nnot going to get\nrandomly cheery\njust because it\u2019s a\nTuesday afternoon\nor because Jupiter\nhas aligned with\nMars.\n\u201c\nIt\u2019s jus\nIt\u2019s jus\nof the\nof the\n...\u2018post-Christmas\ndepression\u2019 that\neveryone goes into\nonce Christmas is\nover.

Though run\noffs will eventually determine dis-tribution, the moderate Islamist\nFreedom and Justice Party and\nthe radical Salafi Islamist Al Nour\nParty are clearly dominant. This\nmeans the new constitution and\nlegal framework is likely to have\nstrong Islamic influences including implementation of Shariah law.\nThe results have caused alarm in\nIsrael, where Egypt\u2019s previous dic-tator, Mubarak, maintained good\nrelations. Coptic Christians, who\nmake up between 10-15% of the\npopulation, are particularly nervous that Egypt could become the\nnew Iran and many are planning to\nleave the country.\nThe BBC has received over\n30,000 complaints about Top\nGear presenter Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s comments on the One\nShow. Clarkson and the BBC\nhave apologized for the com-ments, which included mention\nof people who commit suicide\nby jumping under trains being\n\u2018selfish\u2019 (which they kind of are,\nright?) and the most contentious point: Clarkson\u2019s view that\npeople striking should be shot\n(a prison sentence clearly being more appropriate).

However, the German leader has said that a new\ntreaty will be signed, whether it\nbe between all 27 members or\njust the Eurozone 17. This leaves\nCameron the choice of being\nisolated from Europe or supporting the treaty and being isolated\nfrom his party, who are demanding a referendum on any changes\nto the EU treaty.\nVladimir Putin\u2019s party looks set to\nlose its two thirds majority in the\n450 seat State Duma, Russia\u2019s\nlower house.

Punk isn\u2019t Green Day\nand Blink-182, punk isn\u2019t green hair and safety\npins. Punk is an attitude and it can take any\nform you like. For Minutemen, that form was\n2-minute bursts of jazzy, bombastic R&B, but\nin their attitude to playing \u2013 to recording, to\ntouring, to what it meant to be in a band \u2013 Minutemen were the epitome of punk.\nMinutemen (1980-1985) was a three-piece\nin which bass player Mike Watt\u2019s sound \u2013 his\n\u201clow flow\u201d \u2013 was as prominent as the bright\nguitar playing of his childhood friend D Boon.\nTheir early output eschewed choruses and guitar solos \u2013 what they deemed commercialisms\nof rock music \u2013 and stuck to the short, sharp\nshocks typical of hardcore punk. Armed with\nsuch material, they played their first show\nopening for Black Flag. However, though the\nsong-writing changed, embracing not only\nchoruses and guitar solos but jazz licks and a\nlittle of Captain Beefheart\u2019s avant-blues, the\ncommitment to anti-commercialism would define the band.\nFor Minutemen, a band wasn\u2019t a get-rich\nscheme or a path to glory, it was a way of life.\nThey kept their day jobs and they jammed \u201cecono\u201d: they rented studio time during off-peak\nhours, they used second-hand tape, rehearsing\n1994). With Crawford on guitar, fIREHOSE\nflew the DIY flag for almost another decade,\nbut Watt also contributed to the Sonic Youth\nalbums EVOL (1986) and Daydream Nation\n(1988) and played with The Stooges. These\ndays Watt is a punk statesman, driving himself\naround in a van, playing his \u201cboom-stick\u201d in a\ngrab-bag of side projects, telling everyone he\nmeets to start a band.

They drove themselves around\nto shows they\u2019d set up themselves and they\npreached what they practised. There\u2019s a book\nabout the 80s US punk scene called Our Band\nCould Be Your Life and the title\u2019s taken from\nthe first line of a Minutemen song. It\u2019s a statement that simply and inclusively says, \u2018you can\ndo this too\u2019. That\u2019s the punk ethos.\nMinutemen ended when Boon was killed in a\nroad accident.

Maybe the mix of new progressive rock\nand electro is too much for the general public.\nAs this was their final gig, they decided to\nleave us with a two hour concert consisting of\ntheir first, and arguably their best, album The\nDark Third, played back to back in its original\nform. This suffered from a lack of a fifth member who left the band whilst touring in 2006: as\na quartet they unfortunately had no choice but to\nuse extensive backing tracks for this final ren-dition. But it is more than made up for by the\nthree-part vocal harmonies which are what set\nthis band apart from most other bands trying to\nresurrect prog rock.\nThe second half was a meant to evoke a party\nmood with a focus on their more upbeat electro\nsongs from their latter two albums ending on a\ncrowd favourite \u2018AVO\u2019, a stripped down song\nwhich captures the essence of the band.

Movember, an annual event in November,\nis a campaign that seeks to raise awareness and\nfunding for men\u2019s health \u2013 specifically, prostate and\nother common male cancers. Originating from Melbourne in 2003, Movember has since grown into\na worldwide movement involving more than 1.1m\nparticipants.\nMovember participants receive sponsorship for\ntheir efforts in growing and maintaining moustaches for the full 30 days. Participants and companies\nalike have come up with various incentives and novel ideas to raise as much as they can for the cause\n\u2013 such as restaurant chain Byron\u2019s offer of a free\nburger a day for registered Movember participants.\nIn 2010, a total of \u00a311.7m was raised by Movember participants across the UK \u2013 money that has\nsince been used to fund significant research programmes on prostate and testicular cancer, with\none such programme being carried out by Honorary\nResearch Fellow Dmitry Pshezhetskiy here at Imperial College London\u2019s Hammersmith campus.\nCarol Ann Cheah\nNiki Kesharaju\nthat this was an attempt to entice more tenants in to fill up the empty studios, which\nare still not at 100% occupancy.\nImperial and Berkeley sold the property to Legal and General Property (LGP)\nfor \u00a3116m in September, contributing to\nBerkeley\u2019s 64% increase on profits from\nthe same period last year. LGP will lease\nthe property to Imperial for a 45 year pe-riod, thereafter returning the property.\nAn Imperial College spokesperson com-mented, \u201cAs is often the case with new\ndevelopments, there have been occasional\nissues during initial occupancy\u2026 the Residence Team and the developer have been\nworking closely with the residents to resolve any problems.\u201d\nGriffon Studios is still in its infancy, at\njust one term into occupancy. The Residence Director and team welcome feedback\nopenly, addressing issues raised through\nemail. Some residents have expressed hope\nfor their future tenancy. 2012 is almost\nupon us and perhaps with it comes a new\nterm and new improvements. Indeed, it has\nbeen noted by some residents that the situation has improved.\nDoes this excuse the failings observed so\nfar? As a student the mind always returns\nto the issue of money. With prices of up\nto \u00a3300 per week, students at Griffon Studios will likely have little time for excuses,\nespecially over the coming holiday period.\nAvoid student scammers\nSince the start of term Imperial students have\nlost thousands of pounds to practised conmen\nand women. \u2018How could they be so stupid?\u2019\nyou might wonder\u2026 it\u2019s not as straightforward\nas that. These people employ all sorts of tactics\n\u2013 and they\u2019re doing their Christmas shopping.\nBelow are examples of the three most common\nscams, all of which have happened to IC students since the beginning of term:\n1. Help me, I\u2019m in a pinch! In this scam, a female (though it could just as easily be a male)\napproaches a student claiming that she lives in\nEnismore Gardens, she has been locked out of\nher house, her children have been in a car accident and she has no husband. She then asks\nfor money to pay for a taxi to the hospital. She\nhas stolen significant sums this way.\n2. Help me I\u2019m having a hard time \u2013 I used to\nbe rich. Here, students meet a model who has\nfallen on hard times but has suitcases full of\n(fake) designer gear. They are leftover from his\ncatwalk days; he is willing to part with them\ncheap cheap cheap. \u2018Come in the car \u2013 we\u2019ll\njust go to my flat.\u2019 At this point most students\nsay \u2018no Thank you.\u2019 Usually this is fine. Sometimes the \u2018model\u2019 and his \u2018friend\u2019 get aggres-sive. When students get into the car, which\nthey have in the past, the real trouble starts.\nDon\u2019t let it happen to you.\n3. You sir \u2013 yes, you sir, STOP, I\u2019m the police!\nMan A: \u201cExcuse me, do you have the way to\nthe Royal Albert Hall? I think it\u2019s here on this\nmap.\u201d Imperial Student: \u201cBut of course, I\u2019m\nkind and helpful, it\u2019s just this way.\u201d Men B and\nC pretending to be police: \u201cOi, we suspect you\nof a drug deal. We need to search you.\u201d Imperial student, in good faith: \u201cOh, ok, of course.\u201d\nPolice impersonators then empty the student\u2019s\nwallet and run. Not good. Many students do not\nknow how to distinguish a police impersonator\nfrom the real deal, or what a proper Stop and\nSearch looks like. Whether you agree with the\nprinciple or not, the police do stop and search\nand it\u2019s worth knowing what a warrant card\nlooks like (see photo). To watch or take part in\na Stop and Search, to find out more about these\nscams and others, and to learn how to protect\nyourself, come to the Safety Session in Pippard\nLecture Theatre in Sherfield at 12:30pm on\nTuesday 13 December. Good personal safety\nfreebies will be available! Feel free to email\ndpwelfare@ic.ac.uk with any questions.\nNicolas Massie\nIssues with\nBattersea\n\u2018GradPad\u2019\n...Continued from Front Page\nAcademics criticise White Paper\nIn a letter to The Daily Telegraph this week, aca-demics, including professors from Imperial College\nLondon, Oxford and Cambridge, criticised government White Paper proposals for higher education\nreform, specifically the idea of universities being\nrun by private companies, i.e. for profit. They warn\nit will be to the detriment of students, graduates\nand taxpayers. They believe the proposed system\nwill emulate private universities in the US, claiming\nthat in the US higher education system, \u201cfor-profit\ncompanies offer derisory graduation rates, crushing levels of debt and degrees of dubious value.\u201d\nThe letter demonstrates fears that universities\nrun by profit-driven firms will provide a poor service\nto students whilst maximising short-term gain for\nshareholders, all at the expense of the taxpayer.\nThis is shown by a claimed statistic mentioned in\nthe letter, which states: \u201cAccording to the US Education Trust, only 20 per cent of students at for-profit colleges complete a four-year course and the\nsame proportion of those who do finish default on\ntheir loans within three years.\u201d\nThe government plans would, according to the\nsignatories, facilitate universities becoming private sector bodies by enabling private providers\nto gain degree-awarding powers, which are likely\nto seen by private providers as a desirable intellectual property right. Potential advantages of\nprivate investment might be increased funding to\nprovide a better service to students particularly in\n\u2018struggling\u2019 universities without dependence on\nthe taxpayer. Nevertheless academics are urging\nthe government to reassess its plans in order to\nprevent \u201cstudents and taxpayers suffering the consequences\u201d.\nAlex Nowbar\nA genuine police warrant card\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\niCU Cinema All-Nighter\nTuesday 13 December\nIt\u2019s that time of year again, when it is so brutally\ncold outside that finding a good night out where it\u2019s\nsocially acceptable to stay wrapped up in blankets\nis the stuff of dreams. Fortunately, it is also the\ntime when iCU Cinema brings us the Winter AllNighter \u2013 the first all-nighter of the academic year,\nand a fantastic opportunity to catch all the films you\nmight have missed over the last few months for only\na tenner.\niCU Cinema will be featuring the following six films,\nback-to-back, from 6pm on Tuesday 13 December,\nto 7:30am the next day \u2013 the ultimate test for the\ntrue cinema fan:\nJohnny English Reborn (6pm)\nThe sequel heralds the return of Rowan Atkinson \u2013\npossibly one of the most popular comic actors \u2013 in\nthe titular role. Parodying the ever-ridiculous British\nspy genre, this is a welcome reminder of Atkinson\u2019s\nirreplaceable talent for slapstick in this reprisal.\nDrive (8:15pm)\nIn this crime drama, Ryan Gosling stars as a stunt\ndriver who moonlights as a getaway driver in the dark\nLA underworld. The film, also starring Golsing\u2019s impressive costars Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks and\nChristina Hendricks, received rave reviews and the\nBest Director award at Cannes 2011. A must-see.\nReal Steel (10:30pm)\nHugh Jackman leads in this sci-fi story of robot-box-ing, playing a former boxer who, along with his young\nson, builds up a junkyard robot to battle the slick\ncyborgs that dominate the world of robot boxing. A\nclassic underdog story, this film is a straight-up action film for the purpose of pure entertainment.\nPaul (1:15am)\nThe latest from the unshakable duo of Simon Pegg\nand Nick Frost, Paul is the story of two comic book\nnerd friends who encounter Paul \u2013 an off-beat alien\n(voiced by Seth Rogen) on their roadtrip. What follows combines the best parts of today\u2019s British and\nAmerican comedy genres, with Rogen being the perfect addition to Pegg and Frost\u2019s team. Expect perfect comedy, together with endless sci-fi references.\nContagion (3:30am)\nThe serious feature of the evening, Contagion boasts\nan impressive cast includig Matt Damon, Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Capably directed by Steven Soderbergh, this modern-day thriller follows the\nprogression of a deadly virus as it sweeps the world.\nAn tense, impeccably-acted and fast-paced thriller.\nTroll Hunter (5:45am)\nAnd now, what better film to end the All-Nighter and\nsend you off to lectures than this Norwegian mockumentary that follows a group of students who find\nthemselves tracking a giant, violent troll through the\nwoods. Critically acclaimed for its originality and flair,\nthis film is fantastic example of how low-budget films\ncan produce some remarkable results.\nThere is really is no good reason to miss this line-up. Tickets can be bought in advance for \u00a310 from\nwww.icucinema.co.uk or for \u00a312 on the door. For\nthose who cannot handle the full night of films, individual tickets can be bought for \u00a33 each. Food and\ndrinks are available all night, and full details can be\nfound online.\nFELIX\n34 Friday 09 DECember 2011\nFelix Film Awards \u2013 celebr\nActor of the Year:\nMichael Shannon\nTake Shelter\nWhat makes Take Shelter such a harrowing experience is not down to its\nmarvellously restrained special ef-fects. Instead, Shannon\u2019s intense\nperformance as the unstable, paranoid family man is what grips us from\nstart to finish. These alarming apocalyptic visions that haunt his everyday\nlife; is he a prophet? Or is he showing signs of schizophrenia? Known\nfor reliably playing loony characters,\nthe consistently superb Shannon is\njust as good, if not better, in a lead\nrole of his own, as he creates one\nmemorable American hero.\nActress of the Year:\nMichelle Williams\nMy Week with Marilyn\nWilliams absolutely nails Marilyn\nMonroe\u2019s looks, voice, and speech.\nBut her performance stands out as\none of the best this year because of\nher more silent, behind-the-scenes\nportrayal of the tragic, insecure movie star. The pain and suffering she\nconstantly endures from both her\npersonal and professional lives are\nwell shown in the actress\u2019 masterful\ntransformation, and for anyone who\nintends to play Marilyn Monroe in\nfuture productions that are bound to\nmaterialise at some point, Williams\njust set the bar a whole lot higher.\nSupporting Actor\nof the Year:\nNick Nolte\nWarrior\nI\u2019m a sucker for emotional dramas\ninvolving dysfunctional families with\na hint of redemption involved, so\nWarrior was right up my alley, and\nthe insanely kinetic, inventive mixed\nmartial arts fight scenes were an extra bonus. But the family dynamic,\ninvolving two wronged sons (Joel\nEdgerton, Tom Hardy) and an ex-al-coholic, apologetic wreck of a father\n(Nolte), is the solid base this sports\ndrama builds itself on, with Nolte giving one heart-wrenching, vulnerable\nperformance as the born-again, sorry\nfather who seeks forgiveness.\nSupporting Actress\nof the Year:\nOctavia Spencer\nThe Help\n\u201cEat ma shit,\u201d will be the three\nwords most people take away from\nThe Help, uttered so hilariously by\nthe irreplaceable Spencer. That\u2019s\nnot all; her character Minny loves\nher chickens too (bear with me\nhere). When her kind-hearted white\nboss suggests burning some of her\nfried chicken to give to her husband,\nSpencer pauses in absolute shock\nand disgust as she says, \u201cMinny\ndon\u2019t burn chicken.\u201d Spencer is an\nabsolute class act, and is every\nbit deserving of all the supporting\nawards there are.\nDirector of the Year:\nLars von Trier\nMelancholia\nEnd of the world can be beautiful\nin von Trier\u2019s eyes, and he creates\nsomething truly illuminating and\ncaptivating as he focuses on sisters having to face difficult issues\nof their own, whilst a large planet\nseems to be heading to Earth on a\ncollision course. Von Trier is hardly\nknown for his socially acceptable\nbehaviour, but when it comes to\ndirecting something that carries a\ndramatic punch, he\u2019s the master of\nutilising his talented cast, steady\ncamera-work, restrained script, and\nin this case, some beautiful effects.\nEnsemble of the\nYear:\nBridesmaids\nThere isn\u2019t a single character or comedic performance to fault here;\nwhether it\u2019s the horny mum of three\nsemen-covered teenage boys Rita\n(Wendi McLendon-Covey), the sweet,\n\u201cI\u2019ve only slept with one man\u201d Becca\n(Ellie Kemper), the plus-sized, strong\nand confident Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the rich, bitchy Helen (Rose\nByrne), the fun bride (Maya Rudolph),\nand ultimately the insecure, rambly\nmaid of honour (Kristen Wiig). The\ngirls of Sex and the City should eat\ntheir hearts out, because female-driven wedding comedies should be\nexactly like this; with humour, rich\ncharacters, and a hint of vomit and\nlava-like diarrhoea (you know what\nscene I\u2019m talking about).\n\n"

Just Facebook \u201cSB Imperial\u201d to find the\ngroup and join. It provides a forum for news,\nphotos, videos and most importantly details of\nupcoming sessions! If you don\u2019t have Facebook contact Ed Brial (eb1409@ic.ac.uk) and\nwe\u2019ll add you to the mailing list (when it goes\nlive).

The group will also have media tentacles and travelling legs, photographing and\nfilming whatever goes down , whilst planning\nsome National and International trips in the fu-ture. Watch out for our pub skate-crawl at the\nstart of next term, where we\u2019ll aim to get everyone together and kickstart Imperial\u2019s BMX\nand skateboard community.\nSo if you\u2019re interested, Facebook \u201cSB Imperial\u201d and join, or email Ed, turn up to one of\nthe sessions (we\u2019ll share our boards and bikes\nif you don\u2019t have one yet) and we\u2019ll help film/\nphoto/ride/skate with you.\nThe sign clearly states pedestrians should walk to the left of the rider.

Some have even\nargued that this lack of knowledge, connections and analysis could pose a risk\nto democracy. The right to Freedom\nof Speech, however, keeps governing\nbodies in check. Already the White\nHouse and Congress are subject to reduced coverage due to cost cuts. Events\ncould happen unnoticed and uncovered.\nGovernments have discussed taking action to help newspapers. In France, the\nstate will provide free subscriptions to\n18-year-olds for a year, in the hope of\nturning them into loyal readers and cus-tomers. Then again, relying on Governments to save the paper industry could\ngo against the freedom of the press to\na certain extent. Newspapers would be\nbiting the hand feeding them.\nDemocracy, however, need not worry,\nbecause the big boys are still out there.\nThe greater use of cameras and microphones means that news coverage is\nwider and faster, not missing the smallest detail. Obama and Sarkozy\u2019s little\ngaffe (muttered complaints about the Israeli PM while their microphones were\non for all the press to hear) earlier this\nyear is probably not going to be the last\nof its kind. Newspapers still have the re-sources, influence and power to hold an\nimportant place in the world. Wikileaks\nis the perfect example for this; Assange\nleaked information for a few years and\nwas only noticed by the public eye\nwhen the US diplomatic cables were\npublished in three, then five major\nnewspapers, namely The Guardian, The\nNew York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde\nand El Pa\u00eds. The impact would not have\nbeen as strong without the unprecedented collaboration of news giants.\nIn fact, going online is a drive for\ncompetition and higher quality and even\nmore free speech. Bloggers hold journalists accountable and open a platform\nfor discussion. News is becoming more\nsocial and papers are beginning to understand this. The New York Times has\nreceived accolades based on its use of\nsocial networks. Its employees have aggressively adopted Twitter and, on aver-age, a Times story is tweeted every four\nseconds. British papers have followed a\nsimilar course by developing Facebook\napps. By the end of November 2011,\nfour million people had signed up for\nThe Guardian\u2019s app. These produced\nmassive increases in readership, especially amongst young people. Social\nnetworks are being used as a platform\nfor debating, commenting and sharing\nnews stories. Google is also participating in improving the quality of webpage\ncontent with Google Panda. This algorithm pushes \u201clow quality\u201d (containing\nlarge amounts of advertising) websites\nto the end of search results and \u201chigh\nquality\u201d (large amount of text, news and\nsocial networking) websites at the top.\nFurthermore, the web represents a new\nmarket for papers as they reach more\npeople. The Guardian now counts half\nas many American readers as British\nones.\nThe move from readers to the web is\nforcing newspapers to find a new model\njust to survive. For the moment, a hybrid between paper and webpage is still\nneeded. Not enough money is made online for papers to survive. An example is\nPolitico which has three million online\nreaders but printed ads account for 50%\nof its revenues. Internet returns are not\nincreasing as fast as hoped for, but this\nis slowly changing.\nThe most effective model so far has\nproven to be the limited free access \u2013\npay walls set up by The Financial Times\nand The New York Times, for example.\nThe New York Times experimented with\na first pay wall that resulted in a big drop\nin readership and was therefore scraped.\nThis also happened to The Times in the\nUK when it first launched its pay wall.\nCurrently The New York Times and Financial Times allow free access to a\nlimited number of articles per month\nand increasing levels of access for a\nsubscription charge, the lowest being\n$15. This generates enough traffic for ad\nrevenue and encourages people to sub-scribe. The results are very promising.\nTraffic is up 2% on the New York Times\nwebsite and total digital earning reached\n$210m \u2013 enough to operate a profitable\nnews room. Theoretically The New York\nTimes could stop printing tomorrow and\nsurvive. Similarly, The Financial Times\nhas seen an increase in 30% for online\nsubscriptions and The Berliner Morgenpost has doubled the traffic on its website since its pay wall went up.\nThe other model for which a number\nof groups have opted is the non-profit\norganisation. An example is ProPublica,\nfounded by Paul Steiger, a former Wall\nStreet Journal managing editor. This\nNGO specialises in investigative journalism \u2013 a rather costly business \u2013 and\nrelies entirely on donations. So far support has only increased, reaching more\nthan $10m in 2010, but this might not\nlast forever.\nOther than bankruptcies, some great\nfailures have also occurred as news corporations try to find their place in the\nnew technology age. Murdoch launched\nan iPad exclusive newspaper, The\nDaily, available for 99 cents a week.\nThe app needed 500,000 subscribers\nto cover costs. It had 120,000 users in\nOctober, eight months after being made\navailable. Knowledge of the \u201cold\u201d paper\nindustry is not enough.\nBrand loyalty, perhaps also known\nsimply as trust is going to be a determining factor in the survival of newspapers.\nBig and respected names that provide\ngood analysis will make it through this\ncrisis. Trust is also essential as shown\nby the phone hacking saga. Community papers, affecting smaller and well\ndefined groups of people will maintain\ntheir place. Turning a failing newspaper into a free daily has had its success\nstories too. Even if it leaves the paper\nbehind, the newspaper industry has survived the rise of the radio and the television and is not likely to end now. This\nnew challenge will only make it come\nout better and stronger. So enjoy your\nnewspaper while it lasts and get your\ntablet ready.\nMobile technology and social media networks played a key role in the uprisings of the Arab Spring such as the\nones in Egypt pictured above. Twitter identifies streams of trending topics allowing users to follow and contribute to the breaking news. The most-used hashtag of 2011? #egypt\nA printer laboriously works a 16th century screw press. These archaic\nprinting presses were developed by Gutenberg based on similar designs\nused for the crushing of grapes to make wine\n\u201cNewspapers need a\nnew model to survive\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 21\n\u201d\nI\n\u2019m too young to properly remember what the run-up to the invasion\nof Iraq was like, but I imagine it\nwas rather similar to the situation\ntoday with Iran. UN inspectors\nfind no conclusive evidence of weapons,\nthe media spreads irrational panic, diplomatic ties are removed, and then the\ncarpet bombing begins. Fortunately Iran\nis yet to experience that final step, but a\nwar is looking increasingly likely. Which\nbrings me to my main point: if Britain\ngoes to war in Iran and if even one civilian\nis killed as a result, I will quit my degree\nin protest, I\u2019ll go to Iran, and I\u2019ll see what\nI can do to help. That is, if I can muster\nenough confidence.\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve read the IAEA\n(International Atomic Energy Agency) report in full, and there\u2019s no real evidence\nof any nuclear weapons. What the inspectors discovered was \u201cequipment, materials\nand services which, although having other\ncivilian applications, would be useful in\nthe development of a nuclear explosive\ndevice.\u201d In short, Iran has some objects\nthat might be part of a nuclear weapon,\nbut could also be part of something else.\nThis is rather like finding an alarm clock\nand some wires in someone\u2019s house and\nsuspecting them of making a bomb.\nAs a science student, I am aware that if\nyou make a claim the onus is on you to\nprove it. Evidently, the members of the\nUN Security Council could do with a few\nmore years of university: they introduced\na resolution in 2008 that ordered Iran to\nperform the impossible task of proving it\nhad no nuclear weapons, or face \u201csanctions\u201d. Obviously Iran could not do this,\nStephen Smith\nWho did that? \u2013 A letter to the Editor\nIf Britain attacks Iran I\u2019ll quit my\ndegree in protest\nso now Iran\u2019s enemies can claim Iran has\nbroken international law and can thereby\nlegitimise invasion.\nAnother quote from the IAEA report\nis a good example of this stupidity: \u201cThe\nAgency is unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared\nnuclear material and activities in Iran, and\ntherefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\u201d In\nother words, they have no proof of nuclear\nweapons, but they also have no proof of no\nnuclear weapons, so they cannot conclude\nthat Iran\u2019s nuclear program is peaceful.\nAll of this comes under the title \u201cPossible Military Dimensions to Iran\u2019s Nuclear Programme\u201d. This would explain\nthe headline on Radio 4\u2019s news bulletin\n\u201cA report released today talks of military\ndimensions to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\u201d\nSelective quotation from the report allows\nnewspapers to mention \u201cserious concerns\u201d\nabout \u201cthe development of a nuclear explosive device,\u201d to back up an otherwise\nnonsensical argument. For example, an article titled \u201cUN Watchdog reveals \u2018serious\nconcerns\u2019 about Iranian nuclear weapons\nresearch\u201d was published in The Guardian\non the day of the report\u2019s release.\nRecent chaos in UK-Iranian relations,\nincluding the cutting of financial ties and\nthe attack on the British Embassy in Tehran, has led to the current situation where\nthe Iranian Embassy in Kensington (just\na few roads away from Imperial, as it\nhappens) has been closed and the British\nambassador to Iran is now back in Britain.\nFor lack of a better phrase, this is very,\nvery bad. Diplomacy prevents wars, and\nwhen diplomacy is removed, war is often\nDear Sir,\nSince the beginning of this term Mech\nEng students and staff, who are in early enough have boarded the lifts in the\nmorning only to be assailed through\nthe nostril by what appears to be last\nnight\u2019s curry chemically processed\nthrough the duodenum to a noxious\nmixture subsequently evacuated to at-mosphere. Being gentile and reserved\nmost engineers hesitate to confront\ntheir immediate colleague for want\nof embarrassing them in public. The\nsimultaneous presence of fruit flies in\nthe lifts was something unusual but\nwas no more remarkable than a student\nfrom CEP taking the lift up one floor.\nHowever the recent colder weather\nhas led to the closing of windows in\nthe lift halls and the reserved gentlefolk of the MED have noticed that the\nsmells are getting more distinct and\nall pervasive, that there is a pattern to\nthese smells and it emanates only indirectly from the inhabitants. For some\nsix weeks the College FM (Facilities\nManagement) team and concerned citizens of the MED have been trying to\nsource the of the smells which arrive\nwith each lift carriage door opening to\ntogether with relevant aphids. At this\npoint first year fluids will be useful\ninsofar as the mains sewers are above\nLevel 0 and all toilets empty into the\nspace below Level 0 where a large\ntank is situated. The perspicacious\namongst you will notice that we will\nneed to pump the stewing sewage up\nand out of the tank into the main sewers using the famous sewage injector\npumps.\nSelf evidently the collection tank is a\nprime source for these odours especially as it has been modified by the ongoing project to refurbish the lower levels of the Mech Eng Department. The\nproject and project management have\nresourcefully denied all responsibility\nfor the smells for some six weeks but\nusing the College\u2019s specially designed\nimminent. The United States and its allies are gearing up for war, which (if Iraq\nand Afghanistan are anything to go by)\nmeans hundreds of thousands of dead ci-vilians, lucrative opportunities for western\noil companies, and very little else. Which\nbrings me back, again, to my main point:\nif Britain goes to war in Iran and if even\none civilian is killed as a result, I will quit\nmy degree in protest, I\u2019ll go to Iran, and\nI\u2019ll see what I can do to help.\nOf course, I severely doubt I\u2019ll have the\nconfidence to do this. If I do, nearly all future career paths will close, and I\u2019ll probably never be able to get into academia.\nQuitting a degree definitely doesn\u2019t show\nsufficient dedication to one\u2019s subject. But\nfaced with the huge numbers of people\nwho will die as a result of a war, my plight\nis negligible. Who cares if I don\u2019t get a\n\u201cproper job\u201d? Does it matter at all, when\nclothes peg Purple Team from FM\nhave found at least one source where\nvapours from the tanks are escaping\nand making their way into the lift shaft\nto be pumped throughout the building.\nThe contractors and project management in the form of ISg and Arup are\nfinally admitting that they may have\nsome culpability in the smells so don\u2019t\nthink any less of the person next to\nyou in the lift \u2013 this is something you\nor someone else may have done days\nago.\nRegards,\nA shit stirrer\nWho cares if I don\u2019t\nget a \u201cproper job\u201d?\nDoes it matter at all,\nwhen compared with\nthe future destruction\nof Iranians\u2019 lives?\n\u201c\nWho ca\nWho ca\nget a \u201cp\nget a \u201cp\ncompared with the future destruction of\nIranians\u2019 lives? Or does it matter when\ncompared with the vast amounts of preventable suffering all over the world?\nI know that as much as I want to help\nin Iran, I\u2019ll just keep working in science,\noccasionally reminding myself (as a morale boost) that at least I didn\u2019t go into fi-nance. But when I\u2019m old, I know I\u2019ll look\nback at this time and wish I\u2019d been brave\nenough to take that step into the unknown,\nbrave enough to challenge the ubiquitous\nschool-university-work-retirement life\nthat I am expected to lead. I\u2019ll look back\nat my life as comfortable but ultimately\nhighly selfish and I\u2019ll wish that I could go\nback to those university days and make\nthe right choices. When I can see all the\npossible paths in front of me, it\u2019s a terrible\nfeeling to know for certain that I\u2019m going\nto take the wrong one.\nThis letter has not\nbeen edited in any way.\nThe views expressed\nare of the author,\nwho wishes to remain\nanonymous.\nIf you want to write a\nletter, to be published\nhere, email:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWell, at least the military look is in nowadays...\n\u201cBah Humbug!\u201d, I hear you cry. \u201cWhy are the first two\npages of Comment devoid of Christmas cheer?\u201d Never\nfear child, all your festive desires will be fulfilled on\npages 24 and 25.\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 09 december 2011\n18\nWhy is the UK economy sinking, too?\nIf the Good Ship Eurozone goes down, we are going down with her, explains Albert Nickelby\nT\nhe Eurozone crisis has all\nthe traits of a perfect sto-ry: a choral drama with a\nfuzzy and mistrusted anti-hero, pompous and obscure\nvillains, few and powerless heroes, and\nmany victims; the plot is so twisted that\nits outcome remains as mysterious as\nexciting, and its consequences so open\nto chance and mishaps that any guess in\nthis respect is but a fools errand. Hence,\nit comes to no surprise that the UK press\ndevotes so much ink to the Eurozone\ncrisis: it is where the news seem to be.\nThis, of course, has the intriguing\nconsequence of neglecting domestic\naffairs: \u201cthe European Union could be\ndoomed, so why would we care about\nthe UK economy at all?\u201d Consider this\nexample: in 2009, as the Euro crisis\nunfolded, Larry Elliott, professional\ndoomsayer and, sometimes, The Guardian\u2019s business editor too, adopted this\npeculiar point of view and decided\n\u2013 and he has been rather consistent in\nthis for the last two years \u2013 that the Eurozone crisis arose due to the existence\nof the euro alone \u2013 which the UK did\nnot adopt, and the lack of monetary sovereignty amongst its members this im-plied: they cannot devalue their curren-cies, nor use their central banks to buy\ntheir own debt. No matter that even a 1st\nyear economics undergrad would know\nthat devaluating currency, buying bonds\nand printing money are but short-term\nmeasures that do not generate wealth\n(they only water it down and generate\ninflation), Mr Elliott concluded that\nit was that inflexibility that had made\nmake the euro fail and the Eurozone\nbreak up; after all, \u201cit is a newspaper\u2019s\nduty to print the news and raise hell\u201d.\nThank goodness \u2013 Mr Elliott would say\n\u2013 the UK, with its own central bank, is\nso far away from the euro trap that none\nof its limitations and their consequences\ncould affect it. Hence, it is most curious to realise that, despite all that, the\nUK economy is sinking as badly or even\nworse than that of the Euroclub. How is\nthis possible, being outside of the euro?\nTwo weeks ago, the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development made public its half-yearly\neconomic outlook report and, albeit\nhistorically the credibility of its predictions has been similar to those of\na drunken fortune-teller, it still offers a useful analysis of the economic\nhealth of each country. The UK\u2019s was\nas bleak as Mr Elliott\u2019s account on the\nissue was lukewarm: unemployment\nhad increased, inflation was on the rise,\neconomic growth had been almost non-existent, public indebtedness had not\nbeen halted. As an outcome, it predicted\nthe UK economy would enter recession\nin this last quarter and next year\u2019s first\none. The economic growth forecast for\n2012 was reduced to a mere 0.9% GDP\n\u2013 as opposed to the previous prediction\nof 2.5%. These gloomy forecasts were\nfollowed by those of Mervin King, the\ngovernor of the Bank of England (BoE),\nwho pointed in the same direction:\nGeorge Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer was urged to stick to his austerity measures, and the BoE to continue\nits quantitative easing program. Finally,\nlast Wednesday, in his address to the\nHouse of Commons, Osborne reluctantly admitted defeat. He acknowledged\nthat, as the economic perspectives for\nthe UK were turning drearier than he\nhad expected, the austerity measures\nwould have to continue beyond this Parliament (2010-2015).\nAt the same time, Osborne pointed out\nthat even though the UK government\nwould be forced to borrow more, the\nUK public debt was cheaper than ever,\nso the borrowing costs would be lower\nthan expected. Indeed, for three days\nduring last week (Monday, Tuesday\nand Wednesday), UK public debt was\ncheaper than German one; on Thursday,\nthe fickle debt markets broke the trend\nOsborne was apparently hoping for the\nnext few years. Of course, the House of\nCommons was not satisfied with faintly\noptimism alone, so Osborne was force\nto name a culprit, which he found in the\nEurozone crisis negatively affecting UK\nexports.\nIt is most ironic that such a eurosceptic as George Osborne would implicitly\nacknowledge that the UK economy is\nso dependent on that of the Eurozone\nthat the latter can actually lead the former to recession. Indeed, the UK is the\nEurozone\u2019s second commercial partner\n(just behind China), and as for financial\ntransactions, it is also its second partner\n(right after the USA). One wonders, this\nbeing the case, how long it would take\nfor the UK to go bankrupt if it were to\nabandon the European Union altogeth-er... But, despite this easy pun, Labour\ncame up with a perfectly valid excuse to\nattack the government: it could be, after\nall, that the severe austerity measures\nOsborne has taken so far were done too\nsoon; that Osborne\u2019s inexperience had\nlead him to lift too soon the economic\nstimuli Gordon Brown had implemented and dramatically decrease government expenditure, thus depressing\nthe economy. This is the stance some\nrenowned international commentators\nsuch as Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz\nhave taken: it is not the time for tackling\ndeficits, but for making the economy\ngrow; rather than budget cuts, governments should develop fully expansive\nmonetary and fiscal policies aiming at\neconomic recovery.\nIt might be that both Labour and Osborne are right in their analysis, and that\na combination of the austerity measures\npenalising consumption, and the Eurozone crisis penalising exports, is most\nlikely a reason. But it might also be that\nthis is not all the truth at all, nor a true\ncause. Chris Giles, from the Financial\nTimes, pointed out several weeks ago\nthat UK exports remain at the same level as they were in 2008 \u2013 before the Eurocrisis \u2013 and that, whereas in countries\nsuch as Spain exports had contributed\nby 6.3% towards economic growth,\nthose of the UK had done so by only\n2.5%. He concluded that the UK\u2019s economic health was weak; the cause of it\nwas, according to him, structural: over\nthe last decades, as the UK industry sector underwent several crises, it appears\nthat most of its activity did not recover.\nThink, for instance, of the Manchester industrial belt and how, in general,\nnorthern UK economy, traditionally\nreliant on industry, has not fared quite\nas well as that of the more service-fo-cused southern England. According to\nMr Giles, the UK economy has been\nremarkably bad in creating substitutes\nfor foreign imports, even after the British pound depreciated by 20% during\nthe crisis.\nFurthermore, the crisis seems sys-temic. As it happened in so many other\ncountries, at some point during the\ngilded 90s and 2000s, economic figures stopped reflecting reality. After a\ntrip to London during the early 2000s,\na Canadian analyst from the Toronto\nStar pointed out he could not understand how UK citizens could afford to\nlive in London: their salaries were, it is\ntrue, higher than those of Canada, but\nthe cost of living was also in propor-tion, extremely high. Indeed, at some\npoint after reaganomics kicked in, salaries and pensions stopped reflecting re-ality: they were just not enough to pay\nAn allegory of the current state of the UK\u2019s economy: as Great Britain sinks under the burden of its debts and weaknesses, the Palace of Westminster\nis flooded with problems\n\n"

This chap has the ability to \u2018quantum translocate\u2019 \u2013 he can create a black \u2018shadow\u2019 that he\ncan teleport to at will, conserving all his current\nmomentum. Using this ability you can jump up high\nledges, avoid death traps and generally mess with\nyour head.\nThe game requires a mixture of timing, logical\nthinking and quick reflexes, and is certainly a great\ngame to flex a little bit of your grey matter.\nK.O.L.M.\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/556643\nK.O.L.M. is another game that\u2019s more of an artpiece\nthan a game. You play as a little broken robot who\u2019s\nbeen tasked with rebuilding himself for Mother,\nstarting off slow, dim-sighted and defenceless.\nAs you explore the labyrinth you\u2019re stuck in, you\nfind your eyes, legs, and weapons, along with other\nparts that allow you to reach previously inaccessible areas. Closed areas open up, allowing you to\ndiscover more of the small world you play in.\nIf you\u2019re into action, this isn\u2019t the game for you.\nIf you enjoy calming music, mild puzzle solving and\nsomething generally quite relaxing, K.O.L.M. is the\ngame for you.\nPopCap Goodie Bag Competition!\nHoly moly, a competition? It sure is! PopCap have sent\nus a whole pile of goodies, and we have four gift packs\nto give away, including games, writing pads and collectible models. If you want a chance to win, simply answer\nthis fiendishly difficult question:\nWhich of these games was NOT designed by PopCap?\na) Ski Region Simulator\nb) Plants vs. Zombies\nc) Peggle Nights\nd) Bejewelled Twist\nTo win, email games.felix@imperial.ac.uk with your an-swer. Entries close at 14:00 on Dec 12. All winners will\nbe selected at random.\nTeam Fortress 2 is not a new release for\n2011. But the renaissance it underwent over\nthe last 12 months means it might as well be\ntreated as such. A huge number of new ideas\nhave been ploughed into this game, and it remains as fresh, vibrant and playful as it ever\nhas been. The humour, the experimental nature and the inventiveness of Valve has been\nevident in every update, every store release\nand special event, and it continues to shine.\nIt's lost a lot of followers over the years,\nand those it gained back through free-to-play\nmechanics may have found themselves bewildered by the ever-shifting nature of its UI,\nclass system, and bugs. But the servers are\nstill flourishing, the unusual and rare items\nstill enticing. Having given rise to the Steam\nWorkshop, Trading and Cloud, I'm excited to\nsee what the next twelve months herald for\nthis game. No doubt I'll still be playing.\nDead Space 2 is a game I maybe slagged off\na little bit in the past, but let\u2019s be honest here\n\u2013 I foul-mouth most games. Dead Space 2, at\nthe end of the day, is a solid game with solid\n(and fairly original) gameplay mechanics; I\nhave yet to play another game where dismembering your enemies plays such a crucial role\nin surviving. You can shoot the necromorphs\nin the chest all you want, but it\u2019ll leave you as\nso many bloody pieces on the floor.\nThere\u2019s been a fair amount of DLC offered\nfor the game, all of it free, which keeps everything interesting (if not somewhat imbalanced\nin single player). Hardcore mode still presents\na deadly challenge, and to this day I\u2019ve still yet\nto get through the game on the three saves\nthe mode allows you. The multiplayer aspect\nof the game has died down a little bit since re-lease, but on the basis of single player mode\nalone it gets my vote.\nMichael Cook goes for Team Fortress 2\nT\n2\nt\nt\nh\nm\nh\nt\ne\na\nM\nLaurence Pope picks Dead Space 2\nWhy am I getting two bites of the apple? Why\nam I selecting a game that technically came\nout in 2010 on the XBLA? Because I\u2019m the\nGames editor that\u2019s why, and if I can\u2019t exert my\ninfluence in real life I\u2019ll darn well exert it here to\nboost my meagre sense of self-esteem.\nLimbo is dark, depressing and an absolute\ngem. You play as a young boy, stuck in a world\nfilled with devices and creatures that just want\nto kill you.\nYou face buzzsaws, rolling stones and giant\ncreepy insects, all black and featureless, only\nadding to the sense of foreboding the game\nseeks (and manages) to create.\nUnlike Dead Space 2, Limbo is not for those\nlooking for a high-energy, high action thrill ride.\nUltimately, it boils down to a side-scrolling horror experience that aims to creep you out, and\ndoes so masterfully. Give it a shot.\nOh, and it came out on Steam in \u201811, so hah!\nLaurence Pope (also) suggests Limbo\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n46\nTRAVEL\nTravel Editors: Dushi Arumuganesan\nChris Richardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 09 DECEMBER 2011\nChristmas in the capital\nW\nith just over two\nweeks left to go,\nthe capital has been\ntransformed into a\nbeautifully illumi-nated, life-sized snow globe (minus the\nsnow) in the countdown to Christmas\nday. So here\u2019s your guide to enjoying\nthe best of London\u2019s Christmas highlights this year.\nAs far as traditional Christmas fairs\ngo, Hyde Park\u2019s Winter Wonderland\nmay seem an obvious first choice, and\nyes, there\u2019s nothing to get you in the\nmood quite like mulled wine, German\nbratwurst and knitted woollies. However, for those of you who\u2019d prefer to\nfeast on your Bavarian bangers without\nfeeling as though you\u2019ve been packed\ninto a tin of sardines, the Southbank\nCentre\u2019s Winter Festival presents a\ngood alternative to Hyde Park. Over\nsixty market chalets spaced out along\nthe south bank of the Thames offer\nfestive fare, both edible and otherwise,\nmore or less identical to that of Winter\nWonderland, but with the advantage\nof fewer tourists, toddlers and Evel\nKnievel wannabes armed with perambulators waiting to knock it all out of\nyour hands.\nNaturally no festival would be complete without its own carousel, and\nwhile Winter Wonderland\u2019s may be\nset against a background of the beautifully lit-up Observation Wheel, the\nSouthbank\u2019s slightly smaller merry-go-round is dwarfed by the London\nEye, no less. Admittedly there are no\nother rides, let alone an ice rink, available at Southbank, but who needs that\nartificial rush when you\u2019ve got the\nentirety of London\u2019s skyline from the\nvantage point of Embankment pier in-stead? The view is better, the sausages\nDushi Arumuganesan\u2019s guide to London\u2019s most festive frolics this winter\n\u201cyou cannot go wrong\nwith a Christmas\nspent in London\u201d\nGeneric Imperial student: \u201cRUUUUUN! It\u2019s Godzillaaaaa!\u201d\nare juicier and there\u2019s even a book\nmarket to boot \u2013 the Southbank Centre\u2019s Winter Festival is a must-do this\nyear.\nIf however you feel that Christmas\nwouldn\u2019t be the same without a session on ice, then why not skate against\nsome of London\u2019s most striking backdrops on the temporary ice rinks being constructed all over the city? The\nopen-air rink at Westfield Stratford\nCity provides views of the new Olympic park, and Canary Wharf\u2019s rink\noffers an equally imposing setting of\nthe city\u2019s most dizzying towers. Those\nafter more picturesque landscapes\nshould head to the Tower of London,\nSomerset House, the National History\nMuseum or Hyde Park where the rinks\nare all set in the midst of London\u2019s famous landmarks.\nRoad market (open late every Wednesday until Christmas day) in the East\nEnd and the twice weekly Camden\nPassage market in Islington.\nFinally, if you just want to spend\ntime walking around London, soaking\nin the city\u2019s Yuletide spirit, there is no\nshortage of places to go. Covent Garden has been revamped on all sides: in\naddition to the bewitching Christmas\nlights, there has been a visual display\ninstalled on the North East piazza in\nthe form of a digital painting that shifts\nbetween nativity scenes throughout the\nday. On Saturdays reindeer-petting is\nan activity on offer alongside all the\nmarket stalls. Meanwhile, a 32 foot\ntall topiary reindeer watches over the\nEast piazza: an oddly frightening sight\nfrom afar after dusk, but impressive\nnonetheless.\nAnd of course, because it\u2019s that time\nof year again, minor celebrities have\nbeen resurfacing all over the country,\nwith D-list stars and reality show remnants everywhere being recruited for\nthe action. London\u2019s Christmas lights\nhave been switched on, and there are\nfew surprises in the best of this year\u2019s\nbunch. If you begin your evening at\nTrafalgar Square\u2019s giant Norwegian\nChristmas tree, making your way\ndown the very festive Regent Street\nand under the dazzling snowflakes of\nOxford Street before ending your night\nat St. Christopher\u2019s Place surrounded\nby floating baubles you would have\ncovered those of the capital\u2019s lights\nmost worth seeing.\nHowever, there are some equally\nexceptional lighting displays off the\nbeaten path such as in the Angel, Islington and on South Molton Street,\nwhere you can walk through incandescent arches as you shop. Carnaby\nStreet is an especially good spot for a\nromantic walk for two, beneath lit up\nsprigs of mistletoe and holly garlands\nof gargantuan proportions.\nWhichever of the above you choose\nto indulge in, you cannot go wrong\nwith a Christmas spent in London\n\u2013 this is one time when quantity and\nquality both compete with each other\nto provide one of the best cities in the\nworld in which to live come winter-time.\nTourists stop and gawk at Covent Garden\u2019s big, red, throbbing balls. Aw, yeah...\nFor best results, drop a couple of tabs of acid before hitting the rink: you\u2019ll skate like a pro. Or perhaps not\nMore and more of us are resorting\nto online shopping each year in a bid\nto avoid the frenzied crowds of shoppers at Oxford Street. For those of you\nwho haven\u2019t given in yet, your best bet\nwhen hunting for those quirky one-of-a-kind Christmas gifts is to avoid\nmore commercial shopping centres\nand districts, and instead trek it around\nsome of London\u2019s markets. Of course,\nthere\u2019s Portobello Road and Spitalfields markets on either side of London, each overflowing with vintage\nclothes, books and ornaments. But\nthere\u2019s more of the same at Columbia\n\n"

His dimples how merry!\nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\nAnd the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.\nThe portal placement device he held tight in his hands,\nAnd the smoke it encircled his head like Jupiter's bands.\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly,\nThat shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!\nHe was chubby and plump, and his figure brightly glowed,\nThe turrets swooned when they saw him, in spite of their code!\nA wink of his eye and then they all knew,\nThat like all human children, he loved them too.\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,\nAnd filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.\nAnd laying his finger aside of the trigger,\nAnd giving a nod, ran through the portal with vigour!\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\nAnd away they all flew like the down of a thistle.\nBut they heard him exclaim, \u2018ere he drove out of sight,\n\"Happy Christmas to all, and keep safe.

The Ministry of Defence have been supporting\nthe work of the Imperial Blast group\nsince 2009 and will continue to contribute clinical experience and resources,\nensuring that the research focuses on areas of most value to military personnel.\nHowever, it is hoped that knowledge\nacquired could also be of benefit to injured civilians, for example, following\nterrorist attacks.\nRoadside blasts not only cause dam-Royal British Legion provides \u00a35m towards understanding roadside bomb injuries\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSophia David age to extremities, but also affect the\nbody internally, damaging whole organs\nsuch as the lung, symptoms of which\nmay not show for days. Therefore, it\nis crucial to understand system-wide\ninternal trauma, information which\ncould lead to new therapies and better\noutcomes for patients. Researchers at\nthe Centre are aiming to develop a test\nto diagnose Blast Lung, the most common cause of death among people who\ninitially survive an explosion. An early\ndiagnosis could help prevent complications such as fluid build-up in the lung,\nimproving the chances of survival for\npatients.\nOne model that Imperial Blast is already using for its research is an Antivehicle, Underbelly, Blast-Injury Simulator (AnUBIS), the only device of its\nkind in the world, which can simulate a\nroadside bomb blast in laboratory con-ditions. This device is able to reproduce\nthe velocities seen in the floor of vehicles targeted by bombs by accelerating\na 42kg plate. This enables scientists to\nassess the effect of leg orientation and\npositioning on injury severity and thus\ndevelop preventative strategies to minimise damage.\nThe research centre should have a\nsignificant impact on those serving in\ncurrent and future conflicts, thereby limiting the long-term effects of blast injuries on individuals and their families.\n\u201cWe urgently need to\nknow more, so that\nwe can... treat people more effectively\u201d\nDinner in the House of Lords, anyone?\nThis Wednesday the Royal College of\nScience Union (RCSU) announced via\nemail to the Faculty of Natural Sciences\nthat it will be holding the Science Challenge 2012 Final in the House of Lords.\nThe Science Challenge is the RCSU\u2019s\nannual essay competition and this year,\nentrants will be given four questions to\nchoose from, all set by distinguished\njudges.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX Friday 09 december 2011 27\nThe auditorium dims, the stage lights\ngo up, and I\u2019m faced with a sixty-six-year-old woman lying on a bed, masturbating to phone sex.\nIt is safe to say I didn\u2019t know what I\nwas getting myself into when I agreed\nto review A Round-Heeled Woman and\nI admit, I\u2019m still a bit shell-shocked.\nThe play is based on the true story of\nJane, a woman so bored after her thirty\nyears of celibacy, that she publishes an\nad in the classified section of The New\nYork Review of Books: \u201cBefore I turn\n67 \u2013 next March \u2013 I would like to have\na lot of sex with a man I like. If you\nwant to talk first, Trollope works for\nme\u201d. The show follows the antics that\ndevelop from the sixty odd replies she\nreceives from men aged 32-82.\nThe first half is all about the sex;\nI found myself watching most of it\nthrough my fingers, cringing at every\nline as a group of mature women chat\nabout blowjobs, sucking on clits and\nthe feeling of being filled by a penis.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Sex and\nthe City as much as the next girl but\nmy toes are still uncurling from the\nmemory of the onstage conversation\nabout the challenges that being sexually active aged over 60 presents (cue\nerectile dysfunction and the need for a\nlot of lube). It is, however, undeniably\nlaugh-out-loud funny; I suffered from\nchildish giggles or spurts of hysterical\nsurprise as line after line of explicit\ndialogue is exchanged.\nOn the other hand, the second half\nis a complete contrast as the story\ndigs deeper into the life that Jane has\nlived up to the point of posting the ad.\nIt addresses the issues she\u2019s struggled\nwith: her unplanned pregnancy, failed\nmarriage, disapproving mother and estranged son whom she hasn\u2019t seen for\neighteen years. It gets more emotional\nas relationships founded through the\nad cause heartbreak and rejection, and\nthe audience start to sympathise with\nJane\u2019s uncouth character.\nTrauma GV Art\u2019s new science-inspired\nexhibition revolves around the different\nmanifestations of trauma. The exhibition explores physical and biological\ntrauma, revealing the effect they have\non those who suffer from them and investigating our own personal perception\nof them.\nScience-inspired art goes beyond\nmerely ripping off striking images of a\nscientific nature. It takes the knowledge\nbeyond the lab and the blackboard, beyond the books, opening it up to be in-terpreted, to be put to measure with the\nhuman lives it affects.\nDespite the diversity of materials and\nstyles, the inner story of Trauma subtly\nweaves all the pieces together. Trauma\nitself is apparent in the violence and expressivity of the pieces, such as Andrew\nKrasnow\u2019s Hollow Muscle that presents\na sculpture made out of thick leathery\nstrips contorted to form a heart out of\nhuman skin. However, upon reading the\nhistory behind the piece, the anguish acquires a new dimension as it is lit by the\npersonal struggles of the artist.\nIn spite of the exhibition\u2019s gloomy\ntitle, it is unlikely the viewer will leave\nwith a bleeding heart, but rather with\nan enchanting feeling of fascination\nevoked by the hypnotising artwork, especially Luke Jerram\u2019s glass sculptures\nor Susane Aldworth\u2019s lenticular prints.\nLuke Jerram\u2019s glass sculptures magnify what is hidden to the human eye,\nrevealing the beauty encapsulated in the\nperfect lethal geometry of a virus. The\nchoice of clear glass as a medium strips\nhis work of the distractions of colour\nand creates a mesmerising eye-catching\ngleam. Upon further reflection the viewer is drawn to consider how viruses such\nas HIV or malaria have scarred the lives\nof thousands of individuals; viruses are\na constant menace on human life, with\nnew breeds presenting daunting challenges for health specialists.\nSusan Aldworth uses lenticular print-ing, a technique that allows images to\nfortune and suddenly found herself\nreceiving an influx of marriage pro-posals. Unfortunately I am completely\nignorant of Trollope\u2019s 19th century\nnovels and therefore a lot of the references made in the play were lost on\nme. That being said, the constant appearance of Miss MacKenzie\u2019s ghost\nwas an interesting addition to an already complex plot.\nThe storytelling is engaging through-out, and the sexy Sharon Gless, who\nSexagenarian eager beavers\nRoc\u00edo Molina Atienza\nLaura Johnston\nThroughout the play, parallels are\ndrawn between Jane\u2019s relationship\nfaux pas and that of Trollope\u2019s famous\ncharacter Miss MacKenzie, an unattractive spinster who inherited a small\nchange when viewed from different\nangles, to give an interpretation of the\nelectrical outburst in the brain that occurs during an epileptic seizure, all\nbased on her own personal experiences.\nThis series of three prints presents fiery\nlines, smoothed by a white cloud as the\nviewer moves across them, invoking the\nmental image of a bright explosion.\nFor anyone interested in the encounter\nbetween the Arts and Sciences this is a\nmust-see exhibition. However, I would\ndefinitely recommend it to anyone who,\nas a scientist, is interested in a novel\ntake on his or her subject. With its unusual collection of pieces, it certainly\ndoes provide food for thought. As a final note, it is worthwhile to reflect on\nwhether, in our highly technified twen-ty-first century society, science-inspired\nart will become what pop-art was to the\nconsumerism-based sixties.\nTrauma at GV Art, 49 Chiltern Street\nLondon W1U 6LY \u2013 December 1\n2011 to February 18 2012\nplays Jane, is absolutely exceptional;\nshe\u2019s witty and charming, and her\nportrayal of a female orgasm was particularly convincing.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScientists at Imperial College have devised an\nevolutionary model based on climate change\nand a study of grey wolves.\nIt has long been known that environmental\nfactors play an important role in the evolutionary development of species. This is best\nexemplified by the fact that the same species\nmay have a different phenotype when living\nin different environments. For example, grey\nwolves\u2019 coat colour is dependent on their loca-tion. Recent changes in the climate have also\nled to drastic changes in certain species, such\nas the rapid physical shrinkage of the polar\nbear.\nPredicting the influence of these environmental changes on species\u2019 development is\nimportant, especially for species at the top of\nthe food chain, as their development influences\nchanges lower down the chain.\nProfessor Tim Coulson of the Life Sciences\nDepartment of Imperial College and his colleagues observed a group of 150 grey wolves\n(Canis lupus) in Yellowstone National Park for\nthe duration of 15 years. The scientists tracked\nthe wolves\u2019 reproductive success, genotype\nand body weight and mapped these against the\nenvironmental changes in the park. With this\ndata they created a mathematical model that\ncan predict future evolutionary changes in the\nobserved factors in the grey wolf species.\nThe wolves were exceptionally good subjects for the study as they had only been introduced to the Yellowstone Park in 1995,\nafter humans populating the area had driven\nthem out of their original habitat. The wolves\nin Yellowstone National Park are therefore all\ndescended from the original pack that moved\ninto the park. The Yellowstone Park is a closely monitored nature reserve, and so a lot of\ndata is available on the changes that occurred\nwithin the park over the decades.\nThe results showed that overall changes in\nthe environment had a greater impact on wolf\npopulations than year-to-year fluctuations. AnWolves help predict climate effects\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nA pack of wolves bed down in Yellowstone National Park\nPandas arrive in Edinburgh\nTwo giant pandas arrived in Edinburgh, Scotland,\nlast weekend after a nine hour non-stop flight\nfrom China. The pandas, Tian Tian and Yang\nGuang, are the first to live in the UK for 17 years.\nThe eight-year-old pair will live at Edinburgh Zoo\nfor the next ten years, and the Zoo hope that\nthey will eventually have cubs.\nKelly Oakes\nother important result was that changes in the\nwolves\u2019 characteristics depend on which part\nof the wolf\u2019s life cycle is most impacted.\nThe model will now be applied to a wide variety of species to see if it is globally applica-ble. Unfortunately, such extensive data as for\nthe Yellowstone National Park wolves is not\navailable for many other species.\nIf the model works more globally, it can be\nused in helping to set conservation policy.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1209441\nFELIX\n8 Friday 09 December 2011\nScientists have discovered how sharks are able\nto swim faster than most other fish. Making\nuse of an advanced imaging technique, they\nwere able to examine how sharks swing and\nstiffen their tails to swim more efficiently.\nSharks, like all fish, wag their tails to propel\nforward. However, sharks, unlike most fish,\nhave tails that are not horizontally symmetri-cal. Instead, the top of a shark\u2019s tail protrudes\nfurther back than the bottom, giving the shark\na lift while swimming. Sharks do not have natural buoyancy and sink when they stop mov-ing, so the lift generated by their tails\u2019 shape is\nindispensable in helping them stay at constant\ndepth. In 2005, Harvard biomechanist Brooke\nFlammang discovered a muscle in sharks\u2019 tails\nthat activated at various times during the tail\u2019s\nstroke cycle. A new study, published recently\nin the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, observed the tail\u2019s movement in close detail to\nexamine the muscle function.\nTo detect the finer details of tail movement,\nresearchers scatter small particles in the water.\nLasers are shone on the particles, which can\nthen be detected by high-speed cameras that\ncapture the reflected light. The tail pulls the\nparticles along as it swings, and so the tail\u2019s\nmotion can be reconstructed by tracking the\nparticles. This technique had, up until now,\nbeen two-dimensional. The particles\u2019 movement was tracked in the horizontal and the vertical directions only, and movement perpendicular to those was only estimated. However,\nFlammang wanted to directly detect movement along depth as well, and so added a third\ncamera. This method, known as volumetric\nimaging, had been used only by engineers to\nstudy water flow. Biomechanist Frank Fish of\nWest Chester University notes that its use constitutes an entirely novel approach in biology.\nFlammang and her team put two spiny dogfish and two chain dogfish in a water tank with\na constant water flow so that the sharks could\nswim in place, along with a robotic shark tail.\nThe current understanding is that, as fishes\u2019\ntails swing, they send the water to one side,\nand then push it away, abruptly changing its\ndirection and thus causing vortices. Most fish\ncause a single water \u2018ring\u2019to propel backwards\nat the end of their tail\u2019s stroke, and sharks were\nthought to produce two rings because of their\nasymmetric tail. As expected, the robotic tail\ncreated two rings of different size.\nHowever, the group reported that real sharks\u2019\ntails produce the larger, second ring as they\nreach the shark\u2019s midline, contradicting the\ncurrently accepted model. A set of dual-linked\nvortex rings are produced each half-stroke,\nwhich, as Flammang states, is greatly advantageous since the shark \u201chas added thrust midswing\u201d. She believes that the muscle she had\npreviously discovered is used to stiffen the tail\nmid-swing, changing its shape and even possibly its texture, to facilitate the creation of the\nsecond ring.\nMIT ocean engineer Michael Triantafyllou\nobserves that the discovery has the potential\nto be applied to the better design of underwater vehicles. While he warns that it might be\ncumbersome to design shape-shifting compo-nents, Flammang expresses her desire to build\n\u201ca fully functioning shark tail model\u201d that can\nchange its stiffness.\nDOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.0489\nHow sharks swim faster than you\nSotirios Karamitsos\nHabitable planet found\nScientists have discovered a new planet outside\nof our solar system that might be capable of supporting life. The planet, known as Kepler 22-b,\nlies within the habitable zone around its star,\nwhich means that if water exists on the planet it\nshould be in liquid form. Kepler 22-b has a relatively comfortable surface temperature of 22\u02daC.\nBut those harbouring hope that we may be able to\nmove there one day will be disappointed to hear\nthat it lies 600 light years away \u2013 even if we were\nable to travel at the speed of light, it would take\nus at least 600 years to get there. The planet was\ndiscovered by NASA\u2019s Kepler mission that has so\nfar discovered 28 confirmed planets outside our\nsolar system and a further 1,235 planet candi-dates.\nKelly Oakes\nSophie Buijsen\nSharks, unlike most\nfish, have tails that\nare not horizontally\nsymmetric.\n\u201d\ny\n\u201c\nShar\nShar\nfi h\nh\nDOI stands for digitial object identifier.

Could they represent a light\nthat illuminates a whole city, country,\nor even the whole world? Could they\neven be an image of a light that illuminates the whole of our existence \u2013\npast, present and future? It sounds cra-zy, I know. Maybe Macbeth was right:\n\u201cout, out, brief candle! Life is a tale,\ntold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nsignifying nothing?\u201d What I\u2019m hinting\nat is a promise made before the beginning of time, with implications that\nrun further into the future than even a\nPhD physicist can imagine; a promise\nbrought to light that first Christmas.\nThat first Christmas was nothing\nlike ours. Most of us shell out our\nstudent loans to buy people gifts that\nthey probably don\u2019t want \u2013 I know I do\nanyway. We all end up having to fake\nthat look of surprise and awe when we\nreceive presents that don\u2019t turn out to\nbe that iPad 2 we wanted so badly. But\nwhat if we got something much better\nfor Christmas? Something worth immeasurably more than we can imag-Rhys Davies\nGuy Schofield\nThere\u2019s something about Christmas\nWhat are the lights for?\nine; something that even the richest\nperson couldn\u2019t afford to give, which\nwould never wear out and you\u2019d never\nget tired of. Is that what Christmas is\nall about \u2013 presents that knock those\nnew holly adorned socks off your feet?\nWe all know Christmas isn\u2019t really\nabout presents. It\u2019s about spending\ntime with your family: the people who\ngive you full acceptance the moment\nyou walk in the door, as if you were\nnever away. It\u2019s about catching up\nwith all that\u2019s been going on, with everything you\u2019ve missed on your family Skype sessions and those calls you\ngot from your parents while you were\nin Sainsbury\u2019s. But that is hardly akin\nto the first Christmas now is it? I mean\nthey didn\u2019t have Skype 2000 years\nago, in a time when people barely\nleft their home town, there was never\nmuch catching up to do with family.\nHang on a second. Maybe Christmas\nreally is about our catching up with\nfamily, and awesome presents and\nbright lights, which illuminate our\nexistence. That could be what the first\nChristmas was all about.\nImagine Macbeth going up into his\nAttic to find his Author. Where would\nMacbeth find the light which makes\nsense of his whole story \u2013 brief can-dles, murdering wives and all? But\nwhat if Shakespeare wrote himself\ninto his own story, and stepped onto\nthe stage in his own play? Just imagine for a moment that the child that\nwas born, Jesus, was also God himself writing himself into history. Why\nwould God do that? The first Hebrew\nT\nhe entire final quarter of\nthe year snowballs towards the 25th of December with the unstoppable\nmomentum of an avalanche on a skateboard. Even by November, the excitement runs at fever\npitch levels. In fact, there is a spike in\nA&E admissions that coincides with\nthe first screening of the Coca Cola ad-vert. Even after seeing it for so many\nyears previously, I had to have a lie\ndown with a stiff drink afterwards.\nThere are so many things that\nmake Christmas\u2026 Christmas. Mince\npies and mulled wine, carol singing,\nChristmas shopping and all the events\nthat follow: all little quirks and traditions that make this time of the year so\nspecial, so magical.\nExcept they don\u2019t. A mince pie is\nnothing more than pastry, fruit and\nbrandy. Carols are just songs and\nhymns that no one lets you sing at any\nother time of the year \u2013 much like anything by ABBA really. The only difference between braving the heaving\nmasses at this time of the year compared to any other is that we have a\nstrangely increased tolerance for it.\nThere is nothing special about any\nof these things. There is no magic to\nChristmas. It is all utterly meaning-less. Much like the sum of all human\nexperience. Ugh, how grim. I feel like\nI\u2019m in a Frank Capra movie.\nIf there\u2019s anything special about\nChristmas, it\u2019s people. Oh, I know\nthere are people all year round \u2013 in\nLondon I can\u2019t seem to escape them.\nBut the way people act at Christmas\nis interesting to say the least. In this\nwintry season, the evidence is greatest that we are living in a cold and, at\nbest, uncaring Universe. Yet, instead\nof rallying against the darkness, we\nsing carols to it.\nWe take random chemical signals\nfrom a world malevolent to our existence and somehow try to make sense\nof things. The revolution of the Earth\naround the Sun is a thing of beauty.\nWatching some overgrown boys kick a\nball about sweeps people away on the\nwings of passion. Despite having no\nreason for it, I am rather keen to preserve my life and deprive that leopard\noutside my window of his next meal.\nThe fact that we can enjoy life despite its meaningless makes us rather\ncurious creatures. It is us who say that\nmince pies and mulled wine are special and can only be consumed at this\ntime of year. It is us that enjoy carols.\nIt is us who, if not enjoy, then suffer\nthrough Christmas shopping so we\ncan bring joy to the people in our lives\nwho we have decided are so important\nto us.\nChristians understood it was because\n\u201cHe is not ashamed to call them broth-ers. Since the children have flesh and\nblood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break\nthe power of him who holds the power\nof death \u2013 that is, the devil\u201d. I think\nthat is the present. The end of death it-self. How can we do anything but live\nwhen death has lost its power? So we\nhave life. Forever.\nI think that changes things, that\nsheds some real light, not just on\nChristmas, but on where all our lives\nare heading. But you know what I love\nmore than a good present? The person\nwho gives it. God has come to earth\nso that we can really know him; the\nbible even says that when we accept\nThere is absolutely nothing magical\nabout Christmas, except the magic that\nwe decide it has. The fact that there\nis a time of the year that we have set\naside to come together and share our\nsilly traditions is a little bit special.\nI think people get fooled by Christmas. They think that Christmas is all\nabout gorging yourself on turkey and\nother middle eastern states/fowl, ice-skating at the Natural History Museum\nand sledding down the hill on the first\nsnow of the season. These all mean\nnothing. They think that is where the\nmagic is but it is just a ruse for people\nto get together: to share close communion and fellowship. That is where the\nreal magic is.\nThere\u2019s something about Christmas,\nisn\u2019t there? Somehow in the coldest of\nweathers, we can share with one another the warmest of hearts.\nMerry Christmas, one and all!\nI think it\u2019s time to\nreally get to know\nthe God that gives\nus the ultimate\ngift, to catch up\nwith He who has\nbroken into history.\nhis gift we are adopted into his family\nand become his children. I think it\u2019s\ntime to really get to know the God that\ngives us the ultimate gift, to catch up\nwith He who has broken into history.\nThat is what I shall be thinking about\nas I look up to those lights strung\nacross London; as I give and receive\ngifts and as I catch up with my family\nback home. The last verse of the carol\nOnce in Royal David\u2019s City sums it up\nperfectly:\nAnd our eyes at last shall see Him,\nThrough His own redeeming love;\nFor that Child so dear and gentle,\nIs our Lord in heaven above:\nAnd He leads His children on,\nTo the place where He is gone.\nYeah, he thinks he has a lot of work around this time of year.
