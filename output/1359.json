    "content": "mean we have a far more powerful\nvoice than your bog-standard uni-versity. The top universities in the\nUK have interests so far removed\nfrom some of the current members\nof the NUS that the link between us\nall as students is at best tenuous.\nOur needs are different from most.\nWe have a far greater number of research and overseas students than\nyour average institution. Employers are perfectly aware that not all\nuniversities are equal. If we joined\nthe NUS then our voice would carry\nequal weight to an institution that\nmatches us in terms of quantity but\nnot in terms of quality of students.\nWith around 50% of school leavers\nnow entering higher education the\nidea that they will all have the same\npriorities that NUS representatives\nlobby for is a bit far fetched.\nIn conclusion, unless you are\nparticularly worried about nuclear\nmissiles being stationed on Queens\nLawn, then the NUS is irrelevant to\nyou. At best it is a well meaning, but\nultimately feckless, (top up fees are\nhere to stay, well done NUS!) lobbying group. At worst it represents\nwhat we hate about career politicians the most as at times it seems\nto be acting less like a representative body for students and more like\nagraduaterecruitmentprogramme\nfor the Labour Party. The question\nwe will all have to ask ourselves is\ndo we want our money spent so that\nsome of our more politically ambitious colleagues can sanctimoniously grandstand on our behalf or\nwould we rather the money was\nkept in South Kensington? Personally, I\u2019d rather spend the cash buying everyone a pint than giving one\npenny of it to a bunch of self-serving\npoliticos.\nNUS: Is there any point?\nT\nhose of you new to IC\nmay be unaware that\nour student body is notoriously apathetic. You\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed\nthis if you were accosted at the\nFreshers\u2019 Fair by one of the many\nindividuals armed with clipboards\nseeking your signature for a petition for a referendum on affiliation\nto the national student body. Well\nits good to know there are so many\nvolunteers committed to the spirit\nof public debate that they will give\nup an entire day to promote one.\nWas that not selfless of them? Everybody loves a good argument and\nI was so impressed I even signed\nmyself. However I was slightly saddened to find out that in retrospect\nthis was nothing but a stunt by an\nassorted collection of Marxists,\nNew Labour apologists and the\nplain na\u00efve. Unsurprisingly, these\ngroups are all strongly in favour of\njoining.\nAt the last referendum on whether\nor not we should affiliate to the National Union of Students the result\nwas an overwhelming 72% in favour\nof ICU retaining its independence,\npreferring instead to stick with\nULU for external representation.\nWith Imperial leaving the University of London we are no longer eligible for ULU membership so again\nour involvement with student collectives is up for discussion.\nDepending on whom you ask, the\nNUS will be described in various\nways. Those in favour of joining\nspeak of it as a nice fluffy organisation of discount cards and individuals who dedicate their lives to the\nstudent welfare cause. Others are\nmore sceptical, instead seeing it as\nnothing but a talking shop for wan\u201cAt times the\nNUS seems to\nact less like a\nrepresentative\nbody for students\nand more like\na graduate\nrecruitment\nprogramme for\nthe Labour Party.\u201d\nnabe waffle spewing politicians.\nIf we are going to have a debate\nlet\u2019s go back to first principles and\ntry and define what the NUS is actually for. What does it mean for it\nto be a \u201cNational Union\u201d? Apparently one of the benefits of joining\nis that NUS representatives can\nlobby ministers. I find this a rather\nstrange concept since education\npolicy has now been devolved to\nEdinburgh and Cardiff. This makes\nit a bit silly for the NUS to claim\nthat it can effectively lobby on behalf of the whole of the country. If\nthey let the Scots join in the party\nthen why not the French, Mexican\nor Sri Lankan universities? The\ntruth is that the NUS spends a lot\nof time (and students\u2019 money) on\ndebating and passing motions with\nlittle direct relevance to us. According to NUS records in January 2006\na motion was passed which seems\nto give them a mandate to campaign against the renewal of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent. Pros and\ncons of nuclear weapons aside, I\u2019m\nsure we can all agree that this has\nabsolutely nothing to do with life on\ncampus. It just serves to illustrate\nhow useless an organisation it is\nwhen the NUS has absolutely no\nimpact on the issues that matter,\nsuch as top up fees, but its officers\nseem to have plenty of time to waste\ndebating and campaigning on what\ncould best be described as ethical\nniceties. I would love to be paid to\nsit around to pontificate the world\nbut I don\u2019t think its an appropriate\nuse of our money.\nNow we need to discuss what it\nmeans these days to be a student.\nA recent league table ranks Imperial as one of the worlds leading\nacademic institutions. This should\nStephen Brown voices his concerns about student politicians abusing their mandate\nin an attempt to further their chances of fulfilling their political ambitions.\nI\nts 6.45am. Most students are\nstill asleep or just crawling\ninto bed but for the poor sod\nthat is the third year medical\nstudent, life is different. The\ndaily grind consists of early mornings and late evenings in a place\nwhere anonymity and lack of identity is rife. Where one is expected\nto enjoy humiliation, where the\nexpectation is to don a white coat\nand creep to impress seniors. One\nshould not speak one\u2019s mind or talk\nout of place. One should be seen\nand not heard. One should only\nspeak when spoken to. One is expected to accept that they are insignificant and should remain humble\nand grateful if anyone notices them.\nOne should understand the concept\nthat the Consultant is God, the only\nGod and that no other God exists.\nOne should always be God-fearing.\nGod is always right, God is allowed\nto be late and God is allowed to bully you and say what he likes about\nyou in front of the angels that work\nfor him. God is not so merciful and\nforgiving anymore.\nThe angels rush about stressed\nand sweaty, taking blood, asking\npatients \u2018targeted questions\u2019 and\nsquirm whenever God enters the\nward looking angry. The difference\nbetween this God and these angels and those that are believed to\nreside in what is currently a grey\nand cloudy sky is that key desirable\nqualities (compassion and empa-thy) have faded. The focus of hospital medicine is somewhat corrupt\n\u2013 it\u2019s less about care for the patient\nand more about personal profit.\nCompetitiveness is the universal\ntheme, a drive to be the best aca-demic, the best at networking. It\u2019s\nterribly ironic that in a place which\nis meant to be about caring for people who are sick; caring people are\nfar from being omnipresent. Humanity, also, is a rare gem. The job\nhas become a lot more mechanical,\na robot could do it now \u2013 actually,\nsome robots are doing it now.\nDoctors and medical students\nseem more geared towards selfish gain than patient care. \u2018Doctor\u2019\ncomesfromtheLatinword\u201cdocere\u201d\nmeaning \u201cto teach\u2019\u2019. Shouldn\u2019t doctors be using their knowledge to\nhelp people? I went into Medicine\nthinking it was about being part of a\nservice to others. I thought doctors\nwould show humility and compas-sion. I was na\u00efve enough to think\nthat doctors and medical students\nwould have a genuine motive behind their work and actions.\nOnly now, dumped in the midst\nof it all, do I realise that being a\nthoughtful, attentive and caring\ndoctor is not easy in the hospital\nenvironment. It takes someone who\nhas decided to train as a doctor out\nof sincerity. It takes someone who\ncan endure all the financial and time\npressures that the NHS prescribes\nsparingly and free of charge, someone who can rise above the dog-eat-dog, back-stabbing environment. It\ntakes someone who wants to care.\nUnfortunately, it seems that this\nmodel is temporarily out of stock\nand too expensive for the NHS.\nSo you think you want to be a doctor?\nSeema Pattni\nW\nhen joining any\nwardening team\nyou\u2019re bound to\nget told that it is\na stressful but\nfulfilling experience, that you need\nto keep your wits about you at all\ntime and that the first weeks can\nbe very hectic. It is this last point\nthat invariably gets overlooked.\nWhen the hall seniors move in you\nend up in some sort of a teambuild-ing scenario \u2013 rafting, paintball,\ncamping, depending on the Warden\u2019s levels of sadism \u2013 and start\ndoing a million and one things that\ntransform a hall from a hostel into\nsomething approaching a home.\nNow, Piccadilly Court is what we\ncall an \u201coutlying\u201d hall, which usually leads to a large number of questions before term starts, that go\nalong the lines of: \u201cI really hoped\nto live next door to College and roll\nstraight out of bed into the lecture\nhall. Could you do something about\nit? Yours truly, xxx\u201d. To which I\nusually reply with a reflection on\nthe beneficial aspects of book-read-ing on the Piccadilly Line. Adding\na book recommendation, if I feel\nwordy. Still, once people move in,\nthey tend to see the good sides of\ntheir predicament too \u2013 the West\nEnd, Camden, a 55\u201d plasma screen\nand a courtyard to name a few.\nThe idea of the first week of term\nis to get students to meet as many\nother residents as possible. There\nare some tried and tested ways of\nachieving this, like the boat party.\nThe principle underlying the boat\nparty is that a group of people will\nturn to each other for comfort and\nsupport, if left with no other option.\nSince our budget does not allow\nus to stage a fully-fledged Lost\nre-enactment and hire a tropical\nisland, placing everyone on a boat\nfor good five hours is an acceptable\nalternative. Our crowd this year\nseemed to have enjoyed them-selves, helped by an enthusiastic\nDJ who took upon herself to teach\nthe entire room some latino moves.\nLater this term we\u2019ll be taking the\nstudents to a gala evening with a\nmasquerade theme and to a string\nof other events. The other, less\nvisible but more important, side\nof wardening starts now as well.\nMany of the students who moved\nin will run into problems with their\ncourse, the new surroundings and\ncultures. We try to step in when we\nnotice this happening and we are\nalways on hand for help. Plus, we\ndon\u2019t mind being woken up at 3am\nfor a good reason.

The\nUniversity\u2019s press statement expressed regret at having to make\nthe decision to close the depart-ment, adding that this was brought\nabout by \u201cthe current funding context\u201d for higher education institutions in UK, requiring that the\nlimited resources of the university\nshould be focussed on \u201cacademic\nareas of comparative strength\u201d,\nsuggesting financial woes are the\nreason for the decision.\nThe Institute of Physics (IOP) has\nbeen very critical of the decision,\nwith Science Director Peter Main\nsaying: \u201cThe Institute of Physics\ndeeply regrets the proposed closure\nof Reading University\u2019s physics\ndepartment.\u201d In an interview with\nthe Guardian, Mr Main discussed\nthe impact of the A-level choice\nof sixth-formers in determining\nwhich subjects would be funded:\n\u201cthe future of Britain\u2019s science base\nrests on the university choices of\nsixth-formers.\u201d\nThe IoP\u2019s press release warned\nthat if universities continue to allow physics departments to close,\nthere would be a shortage of physicists within a few years. The Institute says that since 2001, 30% of\nuniversity physics departments\nhave either closed or merged. The\nlast department to be closed was at\nNewcastle University, in December\n2004, which sparked controversy\nwithin the national press.\nThe head of the department, Professor John Blackman, said that he\nhad been fielding calls and visits\nfrom unhappy students and parents concerned over the future of\ntheir course. He made clear in a\nstatement that no current students\nwould be affected by the closure,\nand that any student enrolled in the\ncourse would be given a chance to\ncomplete it.\nThe decision to close the department will not be taken until the University Council meets in December.\nProfessor Blackman, commenting\non whether the decision will be con-firmed, commented that this would\ndepend on the reaction to it: \u201cWe\nwill wait to see whether the university feels that the whole thing is\nworth a rethink.\u201d\nOpposition to the plans has been\nstrong both on and off campus.\nDave Lewis, President of Reading University Students\u2019 Union\n(RUSU), sent an email to the entire\nstudent body, questioning the validity of the university\u2019s decision, saying that the union was \u201cshocked,\nappalled and disappointed\u201d. He refers to an earlier statement by the\nuniversity, stating that they were\ncommitted to a future for physics at\nReading, made six months ago, and\nthat the arguments presented then\nfor keeping the department open\n(good student satisfaction, good\nfinancial income, and strategic im-portance) are still valid today. He\nalso organised a number of events\nand talks, including as speakers\nProfessor Blackman, the head of\nthe Student Physics Society, and\nrepresentatives from university\nmanagement. RUSU has also set\nup a blog, physicsatreading.blogs-pot.com, which keeps students up\nto date on developments.\nThe department has recently received a \u00a35m investment, which\nwent into refurbishing laboratories,\nand the creation of a high-tech ul-tra-fast laser lab and advanced\nmicroscopy centre. In addition, the\ndepartment, in collaboration with\nthe chemistry department, has\nreceived two out of 40 Research\nCouncil UK Academic Fellowships,\nwhich are \u201cdesigned to reward institutions with innovative research\nstrategies\u201d. These two posts were\nadvertised in the same week as the\nclosure, and remain on the Reading\nPhysicswebsite.Manystudentsand\nstaff are puzzled at the rationale behind the closure when the department appears to be succeeding.\nThe closure also ignores a recommendation made by the Science\nand Technology Select Committee,\na parliamentary committee, that \u201cit\nshould be mandatory for universities to alert Hefce [High Education\nFunding Council for England] to\nproposed departmental closures\nin Stem subjects not less than 18\nmonths before the changes in provision are due to come into effect\u201d.\nIn April 2006, Reading University\nassured students and staff that\nphysics was central to its plans,\nand abandoned this view \u201cwithout\nconsultation\u201d according to RUSU\u2019s\nstatement.\nPhysics and chemistry departments around the country have\nbeen under threat for several years,\nwith admissions falling as undergraduates settle for what are seen\nas \u201ceasier\u201d degrees.\nNo, that\u2019s not photoshopped \u2013 some students have decided to steal the P from the physics building.\nfelix 1,359\nFriday 13.10.06\nathletes enhance their\nperformance with it, and 300\nyears ago, it could be used\nas grounds for divorce.

    "content": "Wielding the\nmighty organ\nE\nditorials. At least 300 words of varying coherence about either a) the editor\u2019s recent\nexploits, or b) some kind of topical comment\non a recent issue. Inspiration was sparse the\nmorning I wrote this, so I took a little drift\nthrough the archives to see what prior holders of this\npost wrote. They vary from the dry and informative (cf.\nDave Edwards) to the rather vitriolic rants about the\nCollege\u2019s latest idiotic move (cf. Alex Coby), via catharc-tic diary-esque confessions (cf. Will Dugdale). Being, as\nI am, gradually sobering up from numerous glasses of\nICU house wine, I thought: hey, I could do all of those\nat once.\nFirst up: dear diary. When I stood for this position,\nmany, many moons ago, it hadn\u2019t really filtered in to my\nconciousness that the workload would be so overwhelm-ing, despite having seen editors come and go. However,\nI will not whinge about my lack of a social life outside\nthe confines of this Union building, or about the fact that\nmy house has become somewhere I merely shower and\nsleep. I will however, whinge about the fact that life loves\nto kick you over and over again, in the crotch, when you\nleast expect it.\nSecondly, I\u2019ll be informative. Although it\u2019s been repeated countless times to the point that it\u2019s become dangerously cliched, Felix is your student newspaper. You may\nhave noticed the first two issues of the term were rather\nskinny, and some of you made your feelings clear on the\nmatter while I was distributing the newspaper around\ncampus. If you want to write features, help me research\nnews stories, write reviews, start a new section, vent\nyour thoughts onto medium-quality newsprint, or help\ndesign the newspaper, then get in touch with me. I\u2019m\nin the office most days, in the bar most nights, and you\ncan always e-mail me on felix@imperial.ac.uk. We\u2019re a\nfriendly bunch in the West Basement.\nI would rant here about some idiotic move of the College or the Union, but it appears that both bodies are\neither horribly corrupt and incredibly good at hiding it,\nor are in fact doing quite a good job. The new Graduate\nStudent Association elections have the appearance of\nbecoming a complete farce, with a single person standing and very little advertising. Though the redevelopment of Da Vinci\u2019s was rushed to open, the bar is beginning to look more homely by the day, and your editor\nhas high hopes that it will become a rather nice drinking\nestablishment before the term is out. The sabbs are beavering away quietly, and Freshers\u2019 Fair was really quite\nenjoyable.\nOn the subject of freshers: man, you guys look happy.\nI sincerely hope that your good spirits aren\u2019t broken by\neither your departments or the rather mopey older stu-dents. I\u2019ve found you both approachable and cheerful in\nmy travels around campus. Keep it up.\nDo politicians really believe in what they tell us? Hugh StickleyMansfield discusses whether politicians sell out in pursuit of power.\nDear Felix,\nHaving just spent the last hour of my\nlife running around chasing swipe\ncards and discovering that not only\ndoes it state my details from my UG\nbut as a result was sent to completely\nthe wrong department. Consequently,\nI\u2019ve been missing the all important bit\nof plastic but then, having gone to the\nID card desk, I find that the problem is\nwith registry who a) have the longest\nqueues in the world, can they please\nhire a new member of staff and generally sort their lives out, and b) forgot to\ntick one box on my profile which, had it\nbeen done in the first place by someone\ncompetent would have saved myself\na great deal of time and effort and\nreduced their queues.\nIn summary, Registry is a big heap\nof steaming\u2026surely they could at least\nhire a temp for the start of term when\nthey are in particular demand. Can we\nplease destroy it and replace it with a\nservice with greater capacity, shorter\nLetters to the Editor\nqueues and more and better staff? I\nwill happily volunteer to start doing a\nBerlin wall job and tearing it apart with\nmy bare hands. Why does it have to\nsuck so much?\nPeter Burgess\nDear Editor,\nHugh Stickley-Mansfield makes a valid\ncase against the increasing racism\ntargeted towards Americans. Such an\nattitude is both reactionary and missing the point. A little like Hugh\u2019s arti-cle. Opposition towards the American\nnation from those of us who care about\nglobal injustice and inequality stems\nnot from a lack of friendliness or intelligence of those Americans we meet on\nholiday, nor from a jealousy towards\nAmerica\u2019s \u2018success\u2019 since they \u2018kicked\nthe British out\u2019. America is a country\nwith much to offer the world and has a\nculture which every other society could\nlearn much from.\nHowever, current antipathy towards\nthe country is driven by its political\nsystem \u2013 one that requires Senators, Congressmen and Presidents to\nbe multimillionaires with extensive\ncorporate backing; that produces a\npresident with too much control over\ninternational affairs; that pursues global hegemony ruthlessly and imposes\ndemocracy upon sovereign nations in\nthe face of national, regional and world\nopinion.\nTo most of US critics, the US is a\ncountry run by corporations negligent\nof humanity and the environment.\nWhether you believe it is through\nignorance, religious zealously, propaganda or disillusionment, the government have successfully secured the\nsupport of the citizens they can rarely\nbe said to represent. It is this system\nthat most of us despair against. AntiAmericanism should never mean the\nrejection of the American people them-selves, but the role of their government\nand its military across the world.\nDarryl Croft\nPower over principle?\nE\narlier today I was astonished\nto hear previous Conservative leader William Hague on\nthe radio, sounding perfectly\nreasonable. What was even\nmore astounding was that this was the\nsecond time in recent months that this\nhas happened.\nOf course, what I would consider to\nbe reasonable is not the same as what\nmany others would, and I do not doubt\nthat thousands of people considered\nmuch of what he said whilst leader of\nthe opposition to be every bit as reasonable as I see him to be now. However,\nthat I should agree with everything he\nhad to say is certainly surprising, given\nhow rarely I did so beforehand is quite\nstriking.\nThe shift may well be at my end, it\ncertainly is not unusual for someone\u2019s\npolitical leanings to err more toward\nthe right as they grow up, but it seems\nunlikely. I hold fairly centrist views now,\nand have never been much of a supporter of the left, even as a na\u00efve youth (or,\nif you prefer, as a more na\u00efve youth), so\nthe change seems more likely to have\noccurred at Mr Hague\u2019s end. Regardless of where the change may lie, I find\nit very disconcerting to find a man I had\nlong considered anathema to my own\nposition echoing my views so closely.\nThis is by no means the first time\nI have found this to be the case; for a\nlong time I considered Robin Cook to\nbe a thoroughly unpleasant chap, but\nhis resignation restored my faith that\nthere are principled politicians in this\ncountry, and I was terribly moved by\nhis death not too long afterwards. A\ncynical mind might claim that I simply\ndislike politicians, only seeing the good\nin them once they had had their wings\nclipped or fallen on their swords but,\nknowing myself far better than this hypothetical observer, I would disagree. I\nthink it more likely that so many of the\npoliticians with whom I disagree hold\nsimilar views to my own, but are fully\naware that they would be thoroughly\nunelectable if they told the public that\nwhilst they were looking to come to\npower, or even to retain it.\nThis comes back to a point I touched\non earlier, in that it may well paint me\nas somewhat na\u00efve in believing that\neveryone in power secretly agrees with\nme. But of course, I don\u2019t believe everyone in power does, merely that there\nare more who do than is apparent from\ntheir rhetoric. More significantly, the\nthought is far from a happy one since\nthe core of it is that even those who\n(perhaps) think as I do cannot be seen\nto pursue policies that I would support,\nwhich would make the whole situation\nseem utterly hopeless, were it anything\nmore than idle conjecture.\nUnfortunately, my theory is backed up\nby the party with whom I most associate being almost universally accepted\nas being entirely unelectable. Understandably then, I have noticed a worrying tendency in myself to consider watering down my principles in order to\nmake myself more appealing to potential voters, should I ever stand for election (to be fair, it would be a damn sight\neasier than anything else that might do\nso, such as not shouting at people with\nwhom I disagree, writing more concisely or making less oblique jokes).\nHowever, what I find most disturbing\nis the one piece of evidence that most\nshows my arguments to be more than\na little flawed - as David Cameron settles in, he seems more and more to be\naligning himself with my own positions\non many issues.\nThe upshot of this is that, at least initially I would be happy for him to win\nthe next election, which is not something about which I am entirely happy.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

In the UK in\nparticular, music is seen as a hobby or a\npassing fad.\u2019 This last point is very notwor-thy since magazines like the NME promote\nnew and up-and-coming bands. This creates\nan atmosphere of disposability \u2013 although\nironically it seems these days that said publication seems to put the same bands on\nthe cover despite being about new music.\nGreat bands who keep going out of passion\nfor what they are doing without much recognition rely on passionate music fans who\nshare their vision.

I also recommend you go to record\nshops where they put up gig posters on the\ntwo pillars in Notting Hill. The Covent Garden Rough Trade has posters all over the\nwall. You can also see posters in various\nMusic and Video Exchanges \u2013 Notting Hill\nbeing one of the best for displaying posters.\nThere should also be flyers dotted around. I\nrecommend that you have a look around and\ngo to one of the gigs. They are usually very\ncheap to get in and it is amazing that more\npeople don\u2019t just take a risk sometimes.\nAlso in this article I mentioned quite a few\nbands that might be a bit obscure. I hope\nthis doesn\u2019t put you off and you investigate\nas much as you can, not to sound patronising but you more than often get out what you\nput in.\nIf you fancy putting on your own gigs or\nputting out your own records then it is very\neasy to do. In London though, because there\nare lots of people doing their own thing you\nshould look to what you can provide that is\ndifferent from all the others. This may sound\nobvious but you want to cultivate an audience and it\u2019s good for people to know where\nto go for a certain genre or what to expect.\nAnother point raised by from Chris is, \u2018If you\nknow there is an artist you want to see and\nthey haven't got a show in your town, put the\nshow on yourself. It is a lot easier than you\nmight think. If you want to see them there\nis a likelihood other people will want to as\nwell.\u2019 Also small DIY promoters tend to be\nfriendly, passionate and enthusiastic about\nmusic so if you want to start out then I\u2019m\nsure they\u2019d be happy to help you.\nNow to more local things. This may be\nshameless self-promotion but you can get\ninvolved in putting on gigs through the Alternative Music Society at Imperial. I am responsible for organising the gig night Kids\nWill Be Skeletons and we bring in many\nbands from all over the country and occasionally abroad. It is a great way to get involved with music through the practical runnings of promoting bands and gigs. We work\nfor a DIY ethic by making the entry cost for\nthe audience as cheap as possible so that all\nthe money goes to covering the transport\ncosts for the bands. A lot of bands who play\nat these shows tend to want only basic costs\ncovered such as transport. If you would like\nto get involved then tell the society. There is\na poster for the next gig night on the back\nof Femm.\nAnother DIY legacy is the zine, this is a\nsmall magazine of reviews and features that\ntalks about small bands usually and you\u2019ll\nfind many music zines on the internet. The\nidea of the zine has been around for a long\ntime starting with black and white A4 typewritten sheets. With the internet it has become easier to spread the word with online\nzines.\nI could devote a whole article to zines\n\u2013 and I probably will \u2013 but part of the music section at Felix are involved with www.\nTheMusicZine.com. This website along with\nmany small zines is run by voluntary contributions so if you\u2019d like to contribute then get\nin touch.\nI hope this article has given you an insight\ninto what DIY is all about. Like I\u2019ve said,\nit varies from person to person but what it\nmeans to most people can be summarised in\nChris Tipton\u2019s words: \u2018DIY is a state of mind\nand a declaration of intent.\u2019\nthe\nscene\nfemm\n5 Friday 13 October 2006\nThe aftermath of a XBXRX at Upset The Rhythm (top) and the other pillar in the\nNotting Hill Rough Trade (bottom)\nSome Promoters/Labels/Venues\nUpset The Rhythm\nSilver Rocket\nEcstatic Peace\nKill Rock Stars\nK Records\nStolen Recordings\nUndereducated\nUnluck Recs\nMiles of Smiles\nNo Signal\nThe Bears\nAll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\nThe Luminaire\n12 Bar\nBarden\u2019s Boudoir\nZines/Online Sources of Information\nLoose Lips Sink Ships\nDusted Magazine\nWikipedia Article on DIY\nwww.upsettherhythm.co.uk\nwww.silverrocket.org\nwww.ecstaticpeace.com\nwww.killrockstars.com\nwww.krecs.com\nwww.stolenrecordings.co.uk\nwww.undereducated.com\nwww.myspace.com/gettogether\nwww.milesofsmiles.co.uk\nwww.no-signal.net\nwww.myspace.com/bearspunx\nwww.atpfestival.com\nwww.theluminaire.co.uk\nwww.12barclub.com\nwww.bardensbar.co.uk\nwww.llss.tv\nwww.dustedmagazine.com\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic\nDIY Promoters and Useful Links\nMATTY\nHOBAN\n\n"

    "content": "reviews\nalbum\nlive\nNowadays you can\u2019t buy anything for six\nquid. For example, that is just enough to\ncover two trips on the tube, or a large McDonald\u2019s meal and not even two gallons of\ndiesel. So naturally I was well chuffed to\nhave only paid six of the Queen\u2019s finest to\nsee Four Tet last night (October 4th).\nFor those not in the know, Kieran Hebden\naka Four Tet is a master of electronic mu-sic, a well spoken middle class guy sporting\njewfro and crafting some of the most beautiful songs ever. His second album, Rounds,\nis a must have for any record collection. I\nwas quite excited about seeing him live, not\nonly because I am a pretty big fan, but also\nthe gig was at Plastic People, a hole in the\nground cum club just of Old Street.\nArriving at doors open we found that in\nfact they weren\u2019t open, so we looked to Cargo just around the corner for some sneaky\nrefreshments. Returning half-an-hour later\nthere was a small rabble milling around the\nmetal grill of a door that was the entrance.\nWhile we waited a young guy came out of the\nVietnamese restaurant next door, and pops\nin the club past the bouncer before suddenly reappearing. It turns out it is Kieran\nhimself. How cool, he does it a couple more\ntimes with excited whispers going around\nthe expectant fans every time, until we are\nallowed to filter into the club itself.\nOnce inside he reappears, this time with a\nJD and chatting to the crowd, to start with it\nwas kind of surreal but as time went by and\nthe dubious fat-guy-from-Hot-Chip-look-a-like DJing played more and more obscure\ntracks I came to appreciate how great the\natmosphere was. People weren\u2019t mauling\nhim and he wasn\u2019t being a pompous tit;\nthere was just a great vibe. Now let\u2019s talk\nabout the set, and oh what a set, brandishing two laptops and creating complete sonic\nmayhem, Keiran crafted a symphony of out\nof each track, moulding them from a mix of\nchirps, beeps and feedback.\nClassics such as Smile Around the Face\nwere recreated in the most original ways\nlive and unlike many electronic artists it\nturned out to be a real performance and not\na case of just pressing play. With Hands finishing a set that also covered Spirit Fingers\nand A Joy, along with almost everything\nelse he has done in one guise or another, it\ncouldn\u2019t have been a better set or more intimate setting. With a wave and a thank you\nhe went into the \u2018back-stage\u2019 area, basically\nan alcove behind were he performed and\ncheck his phone, like a real person. I can\u2019t\nA packed room full of ebullient teenagers\nfrom Lancaster\u2019s Indie scene sporting\noutsized necklaces, big glasses and stripy\nknee high socks, cigarette smoke wafting\ninto the rafters and a ripple of excitement\nas Hows My Pop come onto the stage. The\ndrum beat of the hugely popular Laura\nLaura kicks in and the audience go mad.\n\u2018Laura Laura are you gonna get home\ntonight?\u2019 they scream at Andy Raven, the\ncharismatic lead vocalist. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve\nall been injected with an amazing concoction of Pro-Plus and Lucozade.\nWe all know a Laura. Drinks alcopops to\nget smashed, tears up a club dancefloor\nand passes out into taxi cab. This is one\nof the band\u2019s biggest strengths. They sing\nlike they mean it, and make us believe it.\nI came here not knowing anything about\nthe band but a murmur of hype and I\u2019m\nloving it. The atmosphere is electric with\ngirls throwing themselves at the stage\nand singers stage-diving off.\nThe best song for me though, is the\nperky Turn off your Television (Turn on\nyour brain) with its insanely catchy guitar\nchords and cleverly written lyrics. A cross\nbetween Razorlight and The Ordinary\nBoys with an electro twist, meet pop-rock\ngroup Hows My Pop. Comprising Tom\nDiffenthal mastering the keyboard and\nsynth, Chris Macneil on the drumset and\nMatt Canty strumming the bass. Citing\nBob Dylan and The Jam as their influences they joined their musical talents alongside Raven whilst studying at college and\nnow are gigging with a full set of massive\ndirty guitar chords, plinky Northern notes\nand a huge amount of enthusiasm.\nIf you like your rock and indie, I definitely recommend checking this band out.\nThey\u2019re rocking out venues all around\nthe North and hopefully will be coming\ndown here too. They usually have CDs at\ngigs too for less than a fiver, so it might\nbe worth digging out those coppers and\ntaking one home. Try www.myspace.com/\nhowsmypop for a taster. The band are\nawesome live and deserve to be signed to\na label. Snap them up while you can!\nPriya Garg\nOn a cold September night traffic is heavy,\nlights glisten off the gleaming wet bus lanes.\nOverhead the vast expanse of Piccadilly Circus neon signs shine down on the countless\nfaces below. Some are tourists, some are in\nsuits, some are freshers exploring their new\nsurroundings, and some are on their way to\nsee Private View, the recently re-named Indie Rock trio of Goldsmiths fame.\nThe venue\u2019s stairs lead down to a cramped\nbasement with stocky walls. The diminutive\nman at the door has all the fans fooled. This\nguy has the power to book bands for the\nMetro Club on Oxford Street. Most think\nhe\u2019s just another landlord who plays host to\nwannabe rock stars or anyone who\u2019s willing\nto make a stand and entertain the masses.\nLook how wrong you can be. The bands tonight are uncommonly good for a pub event.\nThe Neon Eyes keep the growing crowd lucid in the tightly packed venue, people forget themselves and the shrinking room that\nslowly encases them. Then its time for Private View.\nThings start happening. As the band set\nup on stage the tall, elegant figure of Charlotte Cray graces the stage. The band\u2019s a\ntrio but there\u2019s an extra mic set up. An impromptu alteration makes the trio a quartet.\nThe expectation grows as final preparations take place. An unintelligible mumble\ncomes from the stage and then, it happens.\nIt comes from out of nowhere. One minute\nquiet expectation, the next everyone in the\nroom has the sense knocked out of their\nbodies. It\u2019s like a bomb just hit in a perfectly\nexecuted, synchronous assault on the mind,\nthe stomach and every sense in the body.\nUsing lucid phrasing on the guitar and well\nweighted lyrics Cray turns this immense\npower into a strangely uplifting blaster of a\nrock song.\nThe bassist, Chris Sharples has gone nuts.\nNME\u2019s best description of the man is \u2018on\nthe cusp of genius and insanity\u2019. You can\ntell why, he\u2019s everywhere. Any more inspiration and this lot would be a jumbled mess\nof indistinguishable genius, This experience\nwas augemented by Miss Cray\u2019s backing vo-cals, whether she\u2019ll stay in the band I don\u2019t\nknow, but I hear she has been in the studio\nFour Tet\nRemixes\n(Domino)\nHHHHI\nFour Tet\nPlastic People, Old Street\ndescribe how normal he was or how great it\nfelt to mingle with the artist before the show\nbut out of it all I think everyone in the audience now harbours ultimate respect for one\nthe most likeable guys in the industry.\nNick Simpson\nHow\u2019s My Pop\nThe Gregson Centre, Lancaster\nPrivate View\nThe Comedy, Leicester Square\nwith them.\nLook out for Kick Me Out, Just Like We\nPlanned and The Only Girl I Want. Go\nto their Myspace page; www.myspace.\ncom/mypictureband.\nDavid Ellis\nfemm\n3 Friday 13 October 2006\nKieran Hebden (the sole member of Four\nTet) is seen by many as a pioneer and yet\nnot many (outside of muso circles) have\nheard his music. Those who do know about\nhim have developed a platonic love for his\nmusic. If I very rarely DJ at anything I often\nput on Smile Around The Face and whilst\nmany will dance to it they are still baffled by\nit, and pretty much every time someone will\naccost me and ask, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\nWhether this is a good reaction or not, I\u2019ll let\nyou decide.\nHowever, the first time I heard Pause (his\nfirst album) I pretty much had the same response as the inquisitive soul above. There\nis something unique about hearing Four Tet\nfor the first time.\nThere is also something unique about\nHebden, he has used his position of remote\npopularity to dedicated people to promote\nmusic as much as he can. He has been involved numerous times with the promoters\nEat Your Own Ears and the exposure of\ncountless brilliant acts.\nKieran Hebden has also recently collaborated with legendary free-jazz drummer\nSteve Reid. It was a collaboration that somehow made a lot of sense since Hebden has\nshown glimpses of his free-jazz-loving-side\nin his live shows and on longer tracks on\nhis albums. So it comes as no surprise that\nthe first track on Remixes is a remix of Tics\nby Lars Horntveth. It sounds similar to the\nHebden/Reid collaboration and is delightful to hear organic laptop manipulation, as\nI didn\u2019t know it was possible to use a laptop\nand sound that organic.\nTo those not familiar with such obscurities (and to be fair, I wasn\u2019t familiar until\nI discovered this music through Four Tet\nand others) the second track is a remix of\nthe Radiohead track Sktterbrain. One of the\nmore accessible remixes with a straight hip\nhop beat and lots of reverb on Yorke\u2019s vocals\nmakes the originally tedious and frankly,\nwhiny song more emotionally powerful.\nFor hip hop fans, the remixes of two Madvillain songs; Money Folder and Great Day\nadd a refreshing approach to the genre. The\nattention to detail in the samples is what\nmade hip hop so great in the first place and\nFour Tet\u2019s approach shows a lot of respect.\nMoney Folder is also brilliant to put on and\nnod your head like all good gangsters.\nThe remix of Carmella, originally by\nBeth Orton has a big Phil Spector beat and\nsounds like it could\u2019ve come out of TamlaMotown. The diversity of sounds in all the\ntracks is what is brilliant and displays all\nsides to Four Tet\u2019s musical appreciation.\nHebden doesn\u2019t just handle more obscure\nmaterial, he also reworks So Here We Are\nby Bloc Party and puts an emphasis on\nthe jazzy ride cymbal. He also manages to\nproduce the wall of sound that should\u2019ve\nbeen on the original by playing the main\nriff forwards and then backwards. The\nremixer makes a point of holding off the\ndrums and creating a building tension until the drums erupt at the end in a perfect\nclimax. It\u2019s all rather coital.\nRemixes is a 2 disc package and the second disc is called Remixed and as you can\nguess, it consists of many artists remixing\nFour Tet songs. The opening track features Percee P on MC duties and makes\nthe original sound all the darker and more\ndriven. It must be incredibly difficult to\nremix a Four Tet track since there is so\nmuch going on; you\u2019d be afraid to lose\nsomething in the remix. But even tracks\nlike the boring No More Mosquitoes get a\nbrilliant reworking.\nMatty Hoban\n\n"

    "content": "Introducing \u2018The Guardian\u2019\nAshton Kutcher and Kevin Costner team up for an action-packed adventure.\nKevin Costner returns to the silver\nscreen with The Guardian. Taking\nthe lead as Ben Randall, he is a legendary Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer and we join Ben at the scene\nof his unravelling. At the height\nof a massive storm, Ben Randall\nloses his best friend and the rest of\nhis rescue crew when he attempts\nto save a boat of shipwrecked\nfishermen.\nSent on an unwanted sabbatical\nto recuperate from the accident, he\nis forced to teach a new batch of recruits who want to be Rescue Swimmers like himself. At \u2018A School\u2019,\nthe academy to train rescuers so\nthat others may live, Ben Randall\nlocks head with cocky swimming\nchampion\nJake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher).\nJake is a mystery by himself, he\nis a swimming champion and he\nhas been offered scholarships to\nIvy League universities but he has\nchosen to eat humble pie as a Rescue Swimmer. He proves to be the\nstrongest and the fastest among all\nthe recruits and yet he fails to obtain Ben\u2019s approval until a bar fight\nturns these rivals into comrades.\nThe Guardian is a story about the\nunsung heroes from the U.S. Coast\nGuard, which has been aptly described by Ashton Kutcher as one\nof the few branches that the U.S.\nGovernment trains only to save\nlives, not take them. It must be\nnoted that the action scenes in the\nstorm benefited tremendously from\nAndrew Davis\u2019 meticulousness and\nexpertise in cinematography.\nUnfortunately for The Guardian,\nthe story is largely predictable and\nit is a strange mixture of Top Gun\nand Ashton Kutcher\u2019s famous comedic personality. The length of\nthe film was also a bit of a drag and\nthe cheesy ending left the audience\nwith a bitter aftertaste. However,\nJake Fischer\u2019s confrontation with\nBen Randall was extremely realistic and demonstrated a side of Ashton Kutcher\u2019s talents which have\nnot been immediately obvious in his\nprevious films.\nFortunately for Felix, we managed\nto ask Ashton Kutcher his opinion\non the films he has made so far and\nthe kind of films he prefers to be in\nhenceforth.\nAshton: As a young actor, you\ndon\u2019t have a lot of choices in the\nbeginning. However, now that my\nchoices have grown, I like to be in\nmovies with a story I like to tell. It\ndoes not matter if it\u2019s a romantic\ncomedy, horror or action film. It is\nthe story that matters.\nAnother interesting piece of news\nis that the U.S Coast Guard set up a\nrecruiting booth at the official opening of The Guardian in Chicago.\nIt is rather inspirational to watch\npeople risking their lives to save\nothers. However, will it encourage you to do the same? You be\nthe judge when the film opens on\nOctober 20. Ashton Kucher and Kevin Costner star in The Guardian.\nAt first glance, you might wonder\nwhy Felix has dedicated its film\nsection to reviewing a pornographic film. Despite the title, there is\nno sex at all in the film. Scenes Of\nA Sexual Nature is a movie about\nrelationships, an interwoven net of\nemotions of seven different couples\nwho were all spending a sunny afternoon in Hampstead Heath.\nAndrew Lincoln stars as Jamie,\na middle-aged married man who\nsuddenly becomes transfixed with\na schoolgirl\u2019s underwear. This turn\nof events does not bode well with\nhis wife, Molly (Holly Aird) who had\njust voiced her doubts about their\nmarriage. The brilliant aspect of\nthis scene is the indirect method\nwith which Molly expressed her\nworries. Unfortunately true for the\nrest of the world, some women can\nbe dreadful bush-beaters but not\nall will be as ingenious as Molly to\nmention it with the help of Cosmo.\nOther notable couples in the\nfilm include an elderly couple, Iris\n(Eileen Atkins) and Eddie (Ben-jamin Whitrow). When visiting their\nfavourite viewpoint in Hampstead\nHeath, they meet and discover they\nwere each other\u2019s dream lover 40\nyears ago. Seizing the rare chance\nof getting to know a stranger you\nfell in love with, they spend an afternoon getting to know each other.\nIt is not always a good idea to meet\nthe person of your dreams. Funny\nman, Noel (Tom Hardy) tries to chat\nup Anna (Sophie Okonedo) who has\nSome people just don\u2019t know when to give up.\n23\nfelix\nFriday 13 October 2006\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm times for Fulham\nBroadway from Friday,\nOctober 13 to Thursday,\nOctober 19, 2006\nPaid Previews\nBarnyard (PG) (RT 1h50) Sat/\nSun only: 11.10 13.40 16.00\nThe Guardian (12A) (RT 2h40)\nSat/Sun: 18.30 Thurs only:\n17.30 20.40\nSubtitled Shows\nThe Queen (12A) (RT 2h5)\nTue 18.30\nAudio Description\nThe Queen (12A) (RT 2h5)\nDaily: (13.40 16.00 Not Sat/\nSun) (18.30 Not Sat/Sun/Mon)\n21.40\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre:\nThe Beginning (18) (RT 1h55)\nDaily: (11.45 Sat/Sun only)\n14.05 16.20 18.50 21.15\nSat only: 23.40\nThe History Boys (15) (RT\n2h10) Daily: (10.40 Sat/Sun\nonly) 13.10 15.50 18.20\n20.50 Sat only: 23.30\nOpen Season (PG) (RT 1h50)\nDaily: (11.00 Sat/Sun only)\n13.30 15.40 18.10 20.20\nThe Devil Wears Prada (PG)\n(RT2h10) Daily: (10.30 11.30\nSat/Sun only) (13.00 Not Sat)\n14.00 15.30 16.30 18.00\n19.00 20.30 21.30\nSat Late: 23.00\nThe Departed (18) (RT 2h55)\nDaily: (10.00 Sat/Sun only)\n13.20 14.20 16.40 17.40\n20.00 21.00\nClick (2006) (12A) (RT 2h10)\nDaily: 12.20 (17.50 Not Thur)\nThe Queen (12A) (RT 2h5)\nDaily: (13.40 16.00 Not Sat/\nSun) (18.30 Not Sat/Sun/Mon)\n21.40\nHoodwinked (U) (1h45) Daily:\n(10.10 Sat/Sun only) 12.10\nThe Children of Men (15) (RT\n2h15) Daily: 15.00 (20.40 Not\nThur) Sat only: 23.15\nTalladega Nights (12A) (RT\n2hr10) Sat only: 22.30\nGeneral\nshowings\nNew\nreleases\nEwan McGregor in sexual scenes?

Instead of his usual cheeky\nmischievous girl-chasing self, he is\ntrying a new sport i.e. boy-chasing.\nIt might be shocking to imagine how\ntrendy playing a gay character is in\nthe film industry. However, the biggest shock comes from how realistic and convincing Ewan McGregor\nis as the promiscuous homosexual,\nBilly. His life-partner, Brian (Doug-las Hodge) is desperate to have\nBilly all to himself. However, Billy\ndemands a high price for his com-mitment. He wants to adopt a baby.\nBrian doesn\u2019t want a baby but will\nhe compromise his own desires for\nthe sake of love? Not to be cynical,\nbut it isn\u2019t even a blood agreement.\nThe film is interesting and it is a\nlight-hearted way to spend 93 min-utes. However, the lack of change in\nscenery does lend a slight monotonous disadvantage. While the script\nis highly entertaining, it is a film\nwithout a true conclusion. When\nyou watch this film, it feels like you\nhave just been given a strange intimate perspective of these seven\ncouples\u2019 lives for an afternoon. Its\nbest advantage is it lacks the happi-ly-ever-after and cheesy characteristic that usually defines a romantic\ncomedy. In this case, Scenes Of A\nSexual Nature\u2019s uniqueness might\nleave the audience semi-puzzled at\nthe end of the show.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nYuen Ai Lee\n\n"

Admittedly festivals are very cool, wonders such\nas T in the Park and Leeds consistently have excellent line-ups\nready to entertain you all day and\nnight. But in recent years there\nhas been a rash of new festivals\ncropping up all over the place and\none such festival is Get Loaded in\nthe Park, part of the Metro Weekender (yes, that\u2019s a festival ran by\na free newspaper). Running on\nthe Sunday of August bank holiday it follows on from South West\n4, a \u2018dance\u2019 festival on the Saturday, aptly named after the local\npostcode.\nThis festival is a bit of an odd-ity, located on Clapham Common\nthere is no camping over the\nweekend, not that any one would\nwant to anyway since both days\nlie at different extremes of music taste. Because there are no\ncampers so there is no feeling of\ncontinuity across the event and\nnone of that happy go lucky atmosphere that permeates every\nfacet of Glastonbury.\nTurning up an hour after the\nevent started, the site was dead.\nI saw more press photographers\nthan bona fide audience members\nalthough some did have mighty\nfine cameras. But festivals are\nabout the music I hear you cry, so\nlets talk about the line-up. It was\nall very generic; Lilly Allen, Babyshambles, the Buzzcocks, James\nLavelle and the list goes on. The\nartists were all of a certain quality and I was mildly excited about\nthe whole thing, they even had 65\nDays of Static and Vitalic playing\ntent sets. Adam Freeland and\nJuice Alheem was one act I was\ncertainly looking forward to and\nas soon as I arrived I bought an\nover-priced programme (like V,\nthe only way of knowing what is\non is paying through the nose for\nsome laminated cardboard). To\nmy horror the genius organisers had decided to put one of the\nmost talented acts on the main\nstage at 12 noon, i.e. playing to a\nplastic bag and about ten thousand fag butts trodden into mud.\nDisappointed and heart broken I wandered about, avoiding the Cuban Brothers on the\nMain Stage and looking in empty\ntents until I got so bored I went\nto Sainsbury\u2019s. Then a sandwich\nand a McDonalds later (plus a\nfree Coca Cola glass!)\nI returned to the \u2018arena\u2019 for\nmore fun and games. Vitalic\nplayed a reasonable set but it was\nmid-afternoon and the mood was\nnone existent. Perhaps it was\njust not a good day for electro, so\nI went over to see 65 Days of Static. On arrival some gypsies were\non the stage and playing in the\nslot for 65DoS. On closer inspection they turned out to be a band,\nnot gypsies and were covering\nthe gap in the schedule where 65\nhad dropped out! Could it get any\nworse? Not really, I studied the\nprogramme some more and sat\ndown to read the Sunday Times\nfor a good 30 minutes, basking in\nthe sun like the the good old days.\nFinally, I gave up. The last act was on at\n8pm, presumably because none of the residents living around the park would want\nrock blaring from the common at 11pm, the\ntime was currently 5pm and there was no\nway I was going to hang around for another\n3 hours for the gamble of Babyshambles actually turning up at all, so I caught the 345\nhome and had a Nesquik.\nI think I maybe being a little harsh to the\nwhole event, if you do like Lilly Allen and the\nin your face style of comedy which had its\nown tent all day, or in fact the feel good indie bands and general off centre alternative\npop then Get Loaded in the Park is for you.\nOtherwise I recommend going to a more established event.\nALL\nPHOTOS\nBYGREG\nMEAD\nEscape Festival (Clockwise from top-left); Random dude, Erol Alkan and crowd for Pendulum; Babyshambles at GLITP (below)\njoin the ranks of the dancing. We finally did\nwhen Marco V hit the stage and began to\nblare out some beats that we couldn\u2019t re-sist, everyone was enjoying every minute.\nYet our time at the Radio One Stage was\nsoon to end, for the Raveology Arena was\ncalling us. The late afternoon sun brought\nwith it the start of a packed night of rav-ing, the time for some Drum \u2018n\u2019 Bass was\nupon us.\nThe Raveology arena was a slight surprise but mostly a good one. It wasn\u2019t quite\nas full as I expected, yet it meant like all\nthe other stages you could freely get right\nto the front and have room to dance. In effect it had exactly the right amount of people to give it the atmosphere needed and\nnot feel claustrophobic. We were there\nto catch the beginning of Pendulum, one\nof the acts at the top of my list and they\ndidn\u2019t disappoint.\nThe final plan for the evening was to\ncatch the end of Erol Alkan\u2019s set, even\nthough we see him every week at Trash,\nhis set was largely more electro in style\n(predictably) and followed on perfectly to\nMylo where we could catch the last of the\nsummer sun whilst enjoying some relaxed\nand funky beats. This truly was one of my\npersonal highlights, as again we strolled\nright to front of the crowd to join the mass-es. The sun, sound and setting were perfect for that point in the evening and I\u2019m\nsure all those in attendance would agree.\nWe then caught the end of Armin Van\nBuuren, Groovrider and Fabio, and the\nrest of the night till close was lasers, bass\nand air horns galore, what else can I say?\nNot much. I was enjoying myself too much\nat this point to note anything more.\nAll good things come to end. With most\npeople having vacated the site by midnight\nin a manner that has been applauded by\nthe police, which is a credit to everyone.\nSo off it was to buses, taxis and the like,\nwith many heading back to hotels. Or for\nthose like me who forgot to book one, it\nwas off to a club to continue the party until 4am, before strolling the cold streets of\nSwansea waiting for the first trains.\nfestivalsGet Loaded in\nThe Park\nEscape Festival\nSwansea\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a one\nday dance festival organised by Godskitchen, and pretty damn sweet it is. Running for\nits 7th year in a row, the place was packed\nout and considering the line-up, it\u2019s not\nsurprising. It\u2019s not every day that so many\nworld class acts turn up in Swansea. Only\nonce a year and we were there.\nThe festival being in Wales, and us being in\nLondon unfortunately resulted in us starting our mission at the obscenely early hour\nof 9am. Setting off from Euston station, with\nonly a bottle of vodka to keep us company,\nwe gradually watched the train fill up with\nmore and more festival goers, all wearing\nsunglasses and most of them babbling in\nsome form of incoherent Welsh accent, but\nthat didn\u2019t matter, it was great fun. 3 hours\nlater and we were there.\nThe first thing that struck me about the\nsite on arrival was how full of people it was\nalready, after only being open for 2 hours,\nobviously it was pretty popular with the lo-cals. The second thing that struck me was\nthe temperature; it felt like my face was\nabout to evaporate whilst my skin caught\nfire. Perfect conditions to dance in for 8\nhours straight!\nThe acts we were planning on seeing\ndidn\u2019t come on until in early evening, so we\nexplored the site. The site is basically on a\nhuge hill with two fields in it, with the Radio\n1 Stage at the bottom of one and the Godskitchen Stage at the bottom of the other\nwith Raveology and Urban Arenas in covered tents half way down, and random attractions dotted around the place.\nWith 4 or 5 beers in me it was about time\nto check the place out. We caught the end\nof Akira The Don on the Urban stage which\nwas great, despite the crazy heat in the tent,\nthe lead singer kitted out in orange jump\nsuit with orange goggles to match. They also\nhad the honour of being the only act with a\nguitar at the festival.\nGetting more into the party mood when\nTall Paul came on, we felt more compelled to\nfemm\n7 Friday 13 October 2006\n\n"

A\ndynamic new organisation created\nby active student entrepreneurs\nfrom within Imperial wants to\nchange that for the better. Sumon\nSadhu, President & Co-founder of\nImperial Entrepreneurs, who previously worked under Dragon\u2019s\nDen judge Doug Richard, explains\nfurther: \u201cThe perception of business plans and suits is dated. Real\nentrepreneurs define themselves in\nterms of what they\u2019ve actually done\nwhen opportunities arise, not what\nthey procrastinated. We\u2019re here to\naddress that image.\u201d\nIndeed, some of the biggest businesses in the world didn\u2019t follow\ntheir first business plan. Microsoft,\nfounded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in a Harvard dorm room in 1975\nwould have folded had it followed its\noriginal plan to avoid operating systems in the first place. The stories\nof Microsoft, Dell, Google and Apple all started in dorm rooms, and\nillustrate what\u2019s possible by going\nbeyond the lectures and problem\nsheets. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no better\ntime to start a venture than now,\nsurrounded by some of the smartest people you\u2019ve ever met, and\nsome of the best opportunities,\u201d\nsays Sebastian Wolf, co-founder of\nImperial Entrepreneurs.\nApart from acting to change the\nperception of entrepreneurship,\nthe society has made headway in\nthe entrepreneurial world itself. It\nhas already established significant\npartnerships with The Glasshouse,\ndescribed as \u2018the epicentre of London\u2019s internet scene\u2019 and TiE-UK,\nthe UK branch of the largest entrepreneurial network in the world.\nThesepartnershipswillopenunique\nopportunities for IE members to\nnetwork, find mentors and above\nall, learn from real-world entre-preneurs. In addition, the society\u2019s\nwebsite, imperialentrepreneurs.\ncom, is powered by the \u2018Synergy\u2019\ndatabase. This database allows all\nmembers to list their interests and\nactively seek out potential partners\nto start ventures with.\n\u201cEntrepreneurs are real people,\nand they\u2019re probably some of the\nmost interesting characters you\u2019ll\ncome across as they\u2019re always striving to think differently. We want to\nconnect our members to the community that exists here in London,\u201d\nsays communications officer, Mahmoud Usman.\nThe registration-only Launch\nParty for Imperial Entrepreneurs\nwill provide the ideal opportunity\nfor IC students to come in contact\nwith the London entrepreneurial\ncommunity. Building its reputation,\nthe society has attracted big names\nsuch as Alex Tew (founder of mil-liondollarhomepage.com), Michael\nSmith (co-founder of Firebox.com\nand MindCandy Design CEO) and\nCharlie Osmond (founder of Freshminds) as speakers for its launch\nevent on October 19.\nImperial Entrepreneurs forms\nthe sixth society in a network of\nnationwide entrepreneurship soci-eties, acting to change the culture\nat UK universities. This group includes Oxford and the LSE, with\nwhom the society is hosting events\nlater this year.\n\u201cImperial Entrepreneurs is here\nto provide people with the inspira-tion, education, networking and experience to empower their ideas.\u201d\nWolf says. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing\nstartups everywhere around Imperial. This gives us an opportunity\nto link together students who are\nthinking different.\u201d\n\u201cWith or without grand visions of\nthe future, or an idea ready to go,\nentrepreneurship can become very\nreal for anyone who chooses it.\u201d\nWolf explains, \u201cAnd that\u2019s just it.\nEntrepreneurship isn\u2019t a job, it\u2019s a\nmindset. Even if you don\u2019t want to\nstart a company, you can still nurture the inner entrepreneur. Talk to\nthe beautiful stranger, find the best\nin each problem, don\u2019t stop at setbacks in any walks of life \u2013 in short,\ngrab life and live it!\u201d The future for\nImperial Entrepreneurs at this university definitely looks bright.\nThe Imperial Entrepreneurs\nlaunch party is on October 19 at\n7.00pm in the Tanaka Business\nSchool.

GimperialClothing.com\nwas founded by IE committee\nmembers to prove this point.\nIn a single Saturday afternoon,\nIE\u2019s President, Sumon Sadhu,\nand Secretary, Sebastian Wolf,\ncomposed T-Shirt designs, created a website and advertised\nthe venture on facebook.com.\nBy Monday, a profit had already\nbeen made. \u201cPeople may have\nthought it was just a great idea.\nWe actually went out and did it\nfor fun,\u201d Sadhu says. \u201cThat\u2019s the\nmessage we want to convey:\nDon\u2019t dream it, do it.\u201d The following is a selection of entrepreneurs who didn\u2019t just dream.\nAlex Tew,\nMilliondollarhomepage.com\nDreaming up ways of funding\nhis way through his degree, Alex\nended up with the intention of\nfinding a way to earn a million\ndollars. He came up with the\nidea of creating a website with\none million small pixels which\nwould be sold to advertisers for\n$1 each. Rather than throwing\nthe idea out as crazy, Alex decided to take a leap of faith and\nstart it off. Interest in the idea\nsnowballed and Alex used this\nto his advantage culminating in\nhim making $1million in just 5\nmonths. Alex only had time to\nattend two lectures that term,\nbecause of his success.\nMichael Smith,\nFirebox.com &\nMindCandy Design\nAfter leaving university, Michael\nand his friend Tom Boardman\nimagined creating a website\nsolely focussed on selling boys\u2019\ntoys and gadgets.

    "content": "Civil Engineers explore El Salvador\nRepairing the earthquake of 2001 with an NGO in El Salvador; concrete, gangs, spiders and more concrete\nI\nn 2001 several large mag-nitudeearthquakesshook\nthe small Central American Republic of El Salvador. The effects were\ndevastating on an already\nstruggling country where\ncivil war had ended less\nthan two decades earlier. In 2002,\nstudents from Civil Engineering at\nIC volunteered to work on a development project in one of the poorest communities. Since then, the\nproject has developed into a pioneering annual student-community\nparticipation scheme working with\na local Non Government Organisation (NGO).\nThe volunteering projects, working with the Salvadorian NGO,\nREDES, involve students from several universities and disciplines.\nStudents travel to El Salvador and\nwork with the community for five\nto seven weeks on various development projects.\nOver the past five years the\nprojects have included a seismically resistant adobe pre-school, concrete block model house, construction of pit and compost latrines,\nconstruction of drainage pits, retaining walls, steel frame houses\nand various social welfare projects.\nThis year\u2019s team, comprising of\n11 students of the Civil Engineering Department (first year to PhD)\nand two architecture students from\nUCL, travelled to El Salvador to\nwork on four separate projects. The\nproject was completely organised\nby the students and funding gained\nfrom industrial sponsorship. Once\nagain, it was in conjunction with\nREDES but also included other\nNGOs in keeping with the group\u2019s\nhope to expand. These projects included the expansion of a school\nand nursery in Santa Marta, a radio\nstation in Victoria and a compost latrine project in Pepto, Gualcimaca.\nA bit about the\nprojects\nThe projects in Santa Marta include\nthe construction of more classrooms in their local high school\nand nursery - over time we came\nto know these as the Escuela and\nla Guarderia. As many of the older\ngeneration were lost to the war,\nSanta Marta is a fairly a youthful\nvillage being largely populated by\npeople under 20. Thus the school is\nimportant in bringing together and\nstrengthening the community.\nOutside of Santa Marta, in the\nclosest town, our other project in\nVictoria required us to build a new\nradio station. The objective was to\nhelp the community rebuild their\nradio station, a valuable cornerstone to the surrounding isolated\nvillages like Santa Marta. It provides information about the outside\nworld such as current affairs, public services and announcements\nthat are free from government cen-sorship. A new and larger station\nwould provide extra room for more\nvolunteers to work and large areas to hold seminars and education\nprograms for the local people.\n\u201cIt has been over six weeks since\nI returned from El Salvador, and\nhow can anyone forget: making\nconcrete in blistering heat, being stalked by little monkey kids\nduring dinner, having your life\nflash before your eyes when encountering the local gangsters,\nwatching a guy taking a dump\nin his own backyard (while he\nwas suppose to be \u2018mining\u2019 for\naggregate), fabricating our own\nbuilding tools and, of course, our\nfavourite pastime in El Salvador,\nmaking sweet and sexy concrete.\nIn one of the most beautiful yet\ntroubled countries I have ever\nencountered, I have had one of\nthe greatest experiences of my\nlife. And if anyone were to embark on this trip, they will never\nforget this lovely country and the\nlovely people that live in it.\u201d\nPaul \u2018la cabeza\u2019 Wong: fourth year, scared of spiders\nand MS 13 (a local gang), built like a Greek god\n\u201cI\u2019m currently spending fourth\nyear in Paris and responsible for\ninflicting a bunch of students on\na country with worse things to\nworry about. I went to El Salvador in 2003 and had such a good\ntime I decided to go back. I miss\nthe banter with the various characters we worked with, my lively\nfamily and kicking back at the\ntienda after work with a well deserved pilsener. With this project\nyou get out what you put in and\nmore, so would recommend it to\nanyone who doesn\u2019t mind a few\nspiders in their boots.\u201d\nDan \u2018ear licker\u2019 Woodier: currently\nspending his fourth year in Paris.\nResponsible for inflicting a bunch\nof students on a country that has\nmany worse problems\n\u201cIt was seeing the report from the\ngroup who went out in 2004 that\nmade me decide to come to El Salvador. I think I was seduced by the\npicturesque sunny beaches and\nlush green mountains and the idea\nof working on such an exotic construction site; it felt like the furthest\nplace possible from London. There\nwas much more to the El Salvador\nproject than manual labour. We had\ndinner in the home of a famous El\nSalvadorian artist, attempted to\nlearn salsa in the clubs of San Salvador. I had such an amazing time I\ndidn\u2019t really want leave.\u201d\nAlice\u2018nodaysoff\u2019Clarke:nowinthe\nsecond year of Civil Engineering,\nsuffered from pizza sweat\nOur fourth project brought us\nwith CIRES (a different NGO) to a\nremote settlement called Pepeto\nNorth East of Chalatenango. It\ncould only be reached on foot or in\na 4x4 on a good day meaning transportation of building materials was\ntricky. CIRES, unlike REDES, concern themselves with medical aid\nand they are not engineers. Their\nprojects mainly raise health awareness and supply aid to places which\nhave no free government care due\nto inaccessibility.\nOur aim was to build five compost\nlatrines to improve health thereby\nreduce disease and illness such as\ndiarrhoea, vomiting, headaches\nand dizziness.\nThe extent to which the community was deprived meant that sanitary facilities were very limited and\nwe had to walk for ten minutes to\nget a wash.\nThis village had little in the way\nof hygiene and sanitation, consequently providing compost latrines\nis a big step forwards. Unlike the\nprojects at Santa Marta and Victoria where we had a Maestro, here,\nwe were given full flexibility for the\nengineering of the latrines. The\nconcrete mix, the foundation size\nand the mortar and blocking of the\nlatrines were all coordinated by\nourselves.\nNext year\u2019s group\nThere is great potential for future\nyears. This year\u2019s group had managed to establish and strengthened\nmore ties with local NGO\u2019s and new\ncommunities in El Salvador.\nThe various projects in conjunction\nwith ADES, CIRES and REDES for\n2007 could include: water collectors near San Miguel; libraries and\ncomputer labs for schools; and construction work with El Salvadorian\nStudents.\nThough the structures designed\nby REDES are modern block and\nreinforced concrete buildings the\nonly thing not so modern about it\nwas the way in which they were\nbuilt. Excavations, concrete mixing\nand pouring, bar bending and soil\ncompacting were all done by hand.\nBut this experience isn\u2019t only about\nmanual labour.\nREDES feel that this volunteer\nprogramme is as much about our\nexperiencing the country and its\nculture as about the engineering\nside. They organise a punishing\nschedule of tourist excursions that\nyou would never get out of a guide\nbook, from Mayan ruins to the\nbeach and also talking to some of\nthe most interesting people you are\never likely to meet. With the work\nduring the week you can sometimes\nfeel like time off.\nIt may not be a large country but\nyou\u2019ll soon realise that six weeks is\nnot long enough.\nFor more information about the\nprojects (past, present and\nfuture), upcoming presentations\nor about participating in this\nscheme please e-mail:\nneal.turkington@imperial.ac.uk\nWe returned from El Salvador\nabout one and a half months ago\nand since then a lot of people\nhave asked me about the trip.

    "content": "There were a few more things to get\nused to. Firstly, our strange hours:\nup at 4 or 5am, bed at 6pm. Then\nthere was the mountain food: chocolate for breakfast (sometimes a bit\ndifficult to stomach!), peanuts and\nraisins for lunch and a cooked meal\nin the afternoon (a choice between\nnoodles, couscous or pasta with\ntuna or corned beaf) plus powdered\ndeserts (custard being the favour-ite). There were also lots of skills to\npick up from the more experienced\nmembers of our group: crevasse\nrescue (conducted at base camp,\ncare of a fairly rotten looking tree!),\nice-axe arrest (acts as a brake if you\nfall over), how to walk in crampons,\nhow to tie into the rope and taking\ncare to avoid tripping over it.\nFor the majority of us, it was our\nfirst experience at that altitude.\nWhile no-one suffered severe ef-fects, we all quickly learnt the importance of looking after yourself\nin that environment. When you\nconsider a mountaineer expends\n300-800 calories and can lose up to\na litre of water an hour, you need to\neat and drink properly.\nThe second day on the glacier\nwas spent climbing up to the col\nEmile Pic (3,483m), after which\nwe did a ridge traverse (over some\nvery lose rocks!) to Pic de Neige\nCordier (3,614m). Glissading down\nfrom the col was definitely another\nhighlight. Rain back at camp sent\nmost of us sheltering in the tents,\nbut it didn\u2019t stop Bernard, Matt and\nJoe exploring some rock routes on\nthe slabs behind. More rain delayed\nour start the following day, but it\ncleared up later and we decided\nto climb the ridge on the right side\nof the col beneath Pic du Glacier\nBlanc. This was quite exposed at\npoints, giving us fantastic aerial\nviews of the glacier below. Most of\nus descended after the first part of\nthe ridge, but Alex, Ben, Bernard\nand James continued up to the top.\nWe watched from camp as their tiny\nsilhouettes climbed on pinnacles\nalong the ridge. Our final day in the\nmountains saw us tackle the Barre,\nafter which, everyone except for\nBen, Alex and Bernard went down\nfrom the glacier. They stayed to\nclimb another ridge the next day\nwhile the rest of us descended the\n2,500m back to base camp for some\nrest and relaxation.\ncontinued on page 97\nTo find out more about how to\nget involved with Outdoor Club\ncontact Daniel Carrivick\ncarriv98@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cCome on, get up! Time to go!\u201d\nAlex\u2019s 4am wake-up calls filtered\ninto my barely conscious head.\nSluggish limbs shook off sleep and\nattempted to pull on clothes for the\nmountain. Conditions were good:\nwe could set out to conquer our\nhighest peak yet. Boots were done\nup, crampons fastened, backpacks\nput on, the rope tied into, and soon\nwe were off on the 1\u00bd hour walk to\nthe base of the beast: the Barre des\nEcrins peak.\nWe trudged single file in the dark-ness, illuminating sparkling snow\nwith our head torches, treading\ncarefully over the crevasses. Arriving at the base of our climb, we\nset a steady pace and managed to\novertake many of the other people\non the same route. Our three hour\nascent took us past amazing snow\nsculptures (\u2018meringue\u2019 formations),\na particularly deep crevasse, and\nclose to the summit, a long row of\nhuge icicles hanging precariously.\nAll our efforts were rewarded by the\nincredible views at the top: mountains extended in every direction.\nWe were on the highest point for\nmiles around - 4,015m to be precise!\nIn the very distance, mountain ridges looked unreal, with a two-dimen-sional, cardboard cutout quality. For\nmost of us, this was the mental and\nphysical high point of the trip. This\nyears Outdoor Club summer tour\nto the Ecrins National Park in the\nsouthern French Alps was a truly\naction packed two weeks, where\nactivities such as mountaineering,\nhiking, rock climbing and mountain\nbiking were experienced.\nA couple of days after our arrival,\nwe seized a weather window and\neagerly headed up to the glacier. After a couple of hours walk we set up\ncamp above the Glacier Blanc refuge (2542m) to allow us to acclima-tise. The next day started at 6.30am\n\u2013 for all except Bernard, that is,\nwho had to be shaken from his biv-vy \u2013 something that became a fairly\nregular occurrence on the trip! We\ncontinued our trek up, arriving at\nthe base of the glacier Blanc, where\nwe donned crampons and walked\nup the path past huge fissures and\ncrevasses. By the time we had set\nup camp, complete with an expertly\ncrafted snow wall, it was still early\nso we got in some practice by walking up to the col beneath Pic du Glacier Blanc (3,463m).\nOur four days spent on the glacier transported us into a different\nworld. It was a desert of snow and\nrock; freezing at night and burning\nhot by day - I was naive in thinking\nI\u2019d never get a sun tan on a glacier!\nOutdoor Club\nSummer Fun\n29\nfelix\nFriday 13 October 2006\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Outdoor Club enjoy a brief moment of respite in the fluffy snow\n\n"

My caving\nbuddy hammered a bolt into the\nwall and we tied on a rope so we\ncould abseil down. Once at the bottom we were in a never-before explored part of the cave, walking into\nthe unknown.\nClambering over the boulder\nstrewn ground we noticed the\ngaps between the rocks, wedged\ntogether 2m above the \u2018real\u2019 floor.\nUnsure how stable our footing was\nwe treaded with caution further\ninto the cave. We felt the character of the passage change; an eerie draught started sucking along\nthe passage, our voices starting to\necho off something a very long way\naway. As we passed the last corner we suddenly emerged into the\nblackness, our lights swallowed up\nby the sheer enormity of the chasm\nthat opened up before us.\nWe hurled a chunk of rock into\nthe pit, counting the seconds until\nit reached the floor. One\u2026 two\u2026\nStill nothing. Three\u2026 boom, rat-tle, rattle! Fifty metres deep. This\nwas a real monster, and would need\nmore time to conquer than we had.\nLonger underground would risk\nworrying the rest of the team who\nawaited our return, snug in our\nmountain-top camp, so we had to\nleave. Five hours later the two of\nus were standing at the entrance\nto the cave, cold and exhausted but\nwith an immense sense of achieve-ment. We staggered back to our\ncamp, navigating by cairns that\nhad been erected over the previous 4 weeks in good time to join our\nfriends around the campfire, to chat\nelatedly about our discoveries over\nfantastically warming curry before\ncollapsing into our sleeping bags.\nDoes the cave continue beyond\nthat last enormous drop? Nobody\nknows. There could be kilometres\nmore to find, or it could end around\nthe next corner. It will take another\nexpedition in another year to find\nout \u2013 only this time you could be\nthere as well.\nAlthough caving is certainly chal-lenging, both physically and psycho-logically, it is neither competitive\nnor macho. Caving is the perfect\nteam sport: since everyone\u2019s safety\ndepends on the group, there is no\nroom for showing off. The aim is to\nuse people\u2019s different skills in coop-eration, to further common goals\nof exploration and enjoyment. No\nprior experience is required: all the\nnecessary training is done within\nthe club, drawing on the experience\nof our older members. All trips are\ntailored to the skills and wishes of\nthose taking part and you will never\nbe asked to do things that you are\nunhappy with or that we do not feel\nyou are ready for yet.\nICCC runs regular weekend trips\nto caving destinations around the\nUK \u2013 usually costing \u00a325-30 inclusive of all training, equipment,\ntransportation, accommodation,\nfood and leadership. As well as\nour summer expedition (normally\nto Slovenia), we have a week-long\ntour in Easter to somewhere warm,\nand long-weekends to destinations\naround Europe in the spring and\nsummer. We meet weekly on Tuesdays in the Union from 7.30pm to\ndiscuss past events and future excursions over a pint or two. There\nwill also be additional rope-climb-ing practice in the trees in Princes\nGardens during this term.\nTo find out more about how you\ncan get involved in Caving check\nout the website, www.union.\nic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/ or e-mail\nICCC President, Sandeep Mavadia\nat ic.caving@gmail.com\nSandeep Mavadia\nSnow?

    "content": "femm\nFriday 13 October 2006\nfeatures\neditorial\nHello and welcome to the first ever Felix Music Monthly or Femm as I have dubbed it. It\nis Felix\u2019s music-loving girlfriend \u2013 but don\u2019t\ntell them that we\u2019ve have them both neu-tered. If you haven\u2019t guessed by the name\nthis is a pull-out that will occur every month.\nThe role of this pull-out is to discuss music\npast a few reviews and inane comment from\nyours truly. We care about music and hope\nyou do too, so we are going to present features to you as well as reviews.\nThis week we will be looking at the DIY\n\u2018scene\u2019 in London in the section that is funnily enough called The Scene. It will hopefully be a regular section unearthing new\nmovements, record labels or things of in-terest. We will also have a regular section\ncalled Bitrate \u2013 which you can see below\nthis editorial. In this section we will have\nsomeone (Gregory Mead if he has time) to\ntalk about some of the technological ways in\nwhich music is presented. This week Greg\ndiscusses the internet phenomenon that is\nLast.fm; it is a clever music player plug-in\nwhich compiles all the music you listen to,\nthus deciding your personality.\nOur other feature is a long overdue retrospective of three of the summer\u2019s festivals;\nReading, Get Loaded in The Park and Escape Festivals with all three covering the\nspectrum of how festivals could turn out.\nWhat with no Glastonbury this year, the focus was obviously diverted to Reading and\nyet it didn\u2019t completely disappoint despite\nan unimpressive line-up.\nWe always need contributors in the music\nsection of Felix and if you have any features\nor you want to raise some issues then that\nis what Femm is for. We always have plenty\nof free CDs up for review and free gigs are\navailable to those who want them. Music\njournalism is a tough business and this is a\ngreat way to get into it if you ever wanted to.\nAll you need is enthusiasm.\nTo celebrate the launching of Femm the\nUnion has allowed us to put on a band as\npart of a line up tonight (Friday 13th October) and called the night Felix Live. Popular act at the minute, Ross Copperman\n(www.rosscopperman.co.uk) will be headlining around 11pm. There is another band\nthat is to be confirmed on before them and\nat 9pm, the first band on will be The Sailplanes, a band we picked. They are from\nLondon and are currently making a brilliant noise in the vein of Sonic Youth and\nSleater Kinney. It is free to get in before\n9pm so turn up early to see The Sailplanes\n(www.myspace.com/thesailplanes). It is \u00a33\nto get in after 9pm so I do strongly recommend turning up early.\nWe are also going to run a competition\nso you can get FREE entry all night and\nTWO FREE BEERS. We have ten free\ntickets with two free beers for each ticket\nto give away, all you have to do is email us\nat music.felix@ic.ac.uk asking for a free\nticket. Nothing more, nothing less. Since\nwe go to press on the day of the gig, you\nbetter be quick with the emails. See below\nleft for advertisement.\nTo get a free download of a Ross Copperman song text ROSS to 81330. He is signed\nto Sony BMG and has gone down so well\nat other universities that he has extended\nhis tour of them. Also, we at the music section will be DJing throughout the night!\nMatty Hoban\nbitrate\nAre you bored of constantly listening to music you hate on the radio? Or maybe you like\nlistening to music but don\u2019t have the time or\nenergy to actively search out new bands that\nyou may like the sound of? Tired of listening to lame recommendations of crap bands\nfrom your friends? Probably. I could go on\nall night with the rhetorical questions, but\nthat\u2019s not the point, the point is they don\u2019t\nmatter. There\u2019s no need to watch the pap\nfilled commercial shite music TV stations\nany longer. If you don\u2019t believe me, I suggest you smash up that radio churning out\nmind numbing XFM \u2018alternative\u2019 crap and\nget yourself over to Last.fm. (It\u2019s a website\nby the way).\nFor those of you who have been living underneath an internet music rock, helping\nRupert with the curse that it Myspace, or\neven worse, iTunes; there is salvation for\nyou. Last.fm solves all the above problems\nand more in one go. The idea of Last.fm is\nsimple, you install a plug-in into your iTunes/\nmedia-player/whatever and it logs the music you listen to, the plug-in then sends this\nlog to your personal Last.fm page (similar\nto a myspace page) and over time, it builds\nup a profile on your listening habits. It even\nworks with iPods.\nYou can see all the music you\u2019ve been playing since installing the plug-in. It also builds\ncharts showing your habits, tells you your\nfavourite stuff on a weekly basis and you can\ncheck your overall top artists, top tracks,\nand top albums as well as weekly top artists and top tracks. You can see what you\u2019ve\nlistened to recently or even what you are\nlistening to right now! It makes you graphs,\ntables, charts, album art mosaics, spinning\nwheels of doom and yep, everything.\n\u2018But oh no!\u2019 I hear you cry, \u2018Now my elitist\nmusical friends will be able to see I\u2019ve played\nBritney Spears and S Club 7 on loop for 18\nhours straight!\u2019 Well, fear not, because the\nlovely people who made the site even allow\nyou to delete any embarrassing entries from\nrecord, so we can still pretend that our taste\nin music is uber-tastically cool and hip.\nAnyway, back to the problems I first out-lined, I mean, who cares if I can see what\nmusic I\u2019ve listened to right? Surely I know\nthat anyway, and I can just tell my friends\nit too, assuming they care. Well, luckily for\nyou, you ungrateful, demanding scamps, if\nthe amazing charts system still isn\u2019t enough\nto convince you to join, there are a plethora\nof other functions, most based on the simple method called \u2018tagging\u2019 that the website\nuses to categorise the bands. Basically, helpful users tell Last.fm what genre of music\nthey think a band is. It\u2019s that simple. After\ntens of thousands of users have told them\nwhat they think an artist is like, be it indie,\nhip hop, electronica or whatever, you can\npretty much be sure that the top ten genres\nit lists for them (yes, a band can be classed\nas more than one genre don\u2019t you know) are\ngoing to be correct, the huge number of \u2018taggers\u2019 makes any silly prankster who might\ncategorise your favourite Coldplay track as\ndeath-grindcore totally insignificant.\nSo, in theory this means no more blanket\nterms that cover 23,784,276 different artists\nto describe a band you like. If you listen to\npost-hardcore-glitch-techno-electro-grime\ncut with cartoon soundtracks played through\na vocoder and 8 different effects filters, then\nthis is what it\u2019ll be categorised as. Not \u2018alternative music\u2019 or \u2018shit\u2019.\nWell great, now that my favourite bands\nare correctly categorised, big deal, so\nwhat? Well I ask, do you possess all knowing knowledge of all similar bands? Do you\nknow every single artist who plays your\nfavourite genre? Can you tell me all the\nartists who rap with a classical orchestra\nin the background? No, I didn\u2019t think so.\nI\u2019m the only person who can do that, but\nanyway, this system allows Last.fm to recommend similar artists to you, which you\ncan then go out and buy after checking the\nfree sample tracks they provide, and deciding if you like them. This also forms the\nbasis of their online radio station, which\nonly plays (theoretically) music that you\u2019ll\nenjoy, even if you\u2019ve never heard it before.\nNot only does it recommend similar\nartists to you, but it even tells you other\nusers (known as \u2018neighbours\u2019) who have\nthe same music tastes as you do; you can\nthen add these users as friends just like\non Myspace. So now you can chat to your\nheart\u2019s content with people with the same\nmusic taste as you and you can impress\nthem with your superior knowledge of all\nthings musical; basically anything you can\npossibly imagine.\nFinally, for those money grabbing cheapskates out there, grabbing their purse\nstrings shouting, \u2018How much? How much?\nHow much?\u2019 Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all free and\nthere is no spyware or adverts in sight, infact for all you computer science students\nout there, it\u2019s even open source so you can\nmodify it to your hearts content. By the\nway, I don\u2019t work for them.\nGregory Mead\nLast.fm user weekly top artists.\nfemm 2\nFriday 13 October 2006\nEditor-in-chief\nMatty Hoban\nPublic Relations Editors\nJenny Gibson and Tom Whitson\ne-mail music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nphone 020 759 48072\nDIY\nFestivals\n4\n6\nGig Poster 8\nfelix live TONIGHT!\nIf you head into the Union tonight (Friday 13th October) you\ncan see three bands for FREE\nbefore 9pm.

    "content": "This week\u2019s business news\n\u25a0 A US federal judge made an\nhistorical ruling against tobacco\ncompanies. A claim filed in 2004\nalleged that products were misleading consumers by marketing\n\u201clight\u201d cigarettes as comparatively safe. The ruling in favour\nof this claim could pave the way\nfor a class-action suit that would\ninclude millions of smokers, making it the largest civil law suit that\nAmerica has ever seen. Share\nprices in tobacco companies fell\nsharply.\n\u25a0 Oil prices rallied after representatives from the Organisation\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) informally agreed\nto cut output by 1 million barrels\nper day. The move was the first\nreduction since 2004, and was\nwidely anticipated after Nigeria\nand Venezuela announced they\nwould step down production. The\nmove come amidst concerns that\noil prices would fall if the market\nbecame oversupplied.\n\u25a0 Eurozone interest rates are\nlikely to rise before the end of the\nyear. The comments came from\nJean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank (ECB) after\nan meeting in Paris. A quarter of\na percent rise is set to come about\nbefore the end of the year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest level\nsince January 2000. Some economists are critical of the index\u2019s\ncapacity as a barometer for the\nUS economy since it is comprised\nof only thirty share prices.\n\u25a0 Rupert Murdoch, owner of News\nCorporation, announced plans to\nrelease a version of MySpace\u2122 in\nYou are going to pay me how much?\nJane is in her final year of Mechanical Engineering. She has got a good\nmaster\u2019s degree coming, is the\npresident of two societies, and all\nher friends say she is golden com-pany. After three brain-crunching\nyears of polymers and stress-analy-sis, the opportunities of the wide\nworld are open to her. NASA? Nah.\nR&D? Wrong. No, Jane is off to become an investment banker. Why\nnot; after all, the pay is stellar and\nmost of her friends are doing it too!\nHer friend Nasser has got the top\nscore in Physics. Theoretical phys-ics, particle physics, you name it\n\u2013 he has been through it. And where\nis he going to work? You guessed\nit. Nasser studied neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay and quantum\nteleportation, and yet he is sitting\nwith Jane on the Equities Floor of\nMorgan Someguy, cracking out his\nseventeenth hour of derivatives\ntrading.\nInvestment banking. The mere\nname is a synonym for the big green\nbucks and your own self-image at\nthirty, on your way to the Wharf or\nthe City in the brand new Maserati\nthat last month\u2019s bonus easily cov-ered. Work hard, play hard, they\nsay; sounds just right for Imperial\nstudents.\nBut what is this banking world;\nmore than a cluster of skyscrapers where the financial elite trade\nin invisible shares worth more than\nanything you have ever, correction,\nwill ever, own?\nTo me, it\u2019s an academic black hole.\nI don\u2019t know about other places, but\nat least 75% of my department\u2019s\ngraduates migrate to investment\nbanks. That\u2019s a lot of minds gone\nto the wind. It is also the driving\nreason behind half of our MEng\nstudents changing to the three year\nBEng course. That sounds like kidnapping to me.\nNow, before things are taken the\nwrong way, let me say this: investment banking can be very intellectually challenging. Believe it or not,\nsome people are born and bred for\nthese positions - trust me, I know\na few. But is it not puzzling (and\nperhaps worrying) that Jane and\nNasser have all this specialised\nknowledge under their belts, but\nwe still find both of them clicking\naway stocks from NASDAQ? Where\nis our average Joe \u2018LSE\u2019 Johnson?\nWill Piovano\nBusiness Correspondent\nMichael Olymbios\nBusiness Editor\nHas he grown bored of the suit-and-tie and fled to a PhD in neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay?\nI don\u2019t know. All I know is that the\nbanking world has more perks to\noffer than any of its competitors. I\nknow, I\u2019ve been there. Where else\ncan you get paid such a ridiculous\n- it really deserves a grander adjective - salary. One gags on one\u2019s\ntongue when reading the contract.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll take it\u2026\u201d\nKa-ching! Dollar signs slot down\nover the eyes. \u201cI could just do two\nyears, then go on vacation\u2026\u201d Before you know it, you\u2019re sitting in\nthe toilet cubicle on the fourteenth\nfloor, absently reaching for the roll\nof twenty-pound notes, which have\nreplaced toilet paper, and counting the seconds lost away from the\ntrading desk.\nVariety is the spice of life. If we all\nbecome bankers, life will be boring,\nand everything will be expensive.\nMake sure it\u2019s what you really want\nto do. Ah, but who are we kidding?\nWhen that phone call arrives, and\nthe sweet voice of Ms HR whispers\ninto your ear, I\u2019ll hear that same\nold phrase which shatters every\nman\u2019s resistance: \u201cYou\u2019re paying\nme what?!\u201d\nChina. He bought MySpace\u2122 last\nyear as part of his digital-age strat-egy. MySpace\u2122 became one of the\nmost visited sites on the internet\nbecause of the ease with which people could share text, pictures and\nvideo. Mr Murdoch said MySpace\u2122\nChina was likely to have local partners who would own fifty per cent.\n\u25a0 The share prices of online gambling firms collapsed after new legislation was passed stopping banks\nand credit card companies making\npayments to them. This has effectively banned American punters\nfrom using such sites.\n\u25a0 Sony\u2019s share price fell sharply after two new companies \u2013 Toshiba\nand Fujitsu \u2013 reported problems\nwith laptop batteries having the potential to overheat. The issue was\nbrought to light when an IBM laptop caught fire at a Los Angeles\nairport. Subsequently, Dell and\nApple recalled the battery model.\n\u25a0 The days of market rumours\nspread on exchange floors are\nnumbered as market gossip\nhas found a high-tech forum. A\nnew automated system will sift\nthrough forty million sources\neach day, from blogs to news-wires. The platform, called Monitor110, is to be run by a former\nDeutsche Bank executive who\nis selling the software to hedge\nfunds.\n\u25a0 Europe\u2019s biggest low-cost air-line, Ryanair, launched a takeover bid for Aer Lingus. The Irish\nairline made its stock debut last\nweek, prompting Ryanair to begin the acquisition by purchasing\n16 per cent of the shares on offer.\nThere are two distinctive types of\nbanking: commercial banking and\ninvestment banking. Commercial\nbanking involves financial interme-diation, i.e. the borrowing and lending of cash between individuals and\nsmaller companies.\nA commercial bank\u2019s role includes the finding of those seeking\nto borrow and to lend, the drawing\nup of contracts, and calculating the\nprobability of the debtor being unable to pay the loan. The greater the\nrisk that the borrower will default\non the loan, the\nhigher the interest rate will be.\nThe banks profit\nby charging a\nhigher rate of interest to borrow\nthan they pay\nout to those depositing funds.\nInvestment\nbanks do not\nhave inventories of cash for\nthe purposes\nof lending. Although the\nstructure varies from bank to\nbank, broadly speaking, there are\ncorporate finance, financial instrument sales and trading and syndicate divisions.\nThe corporate finance division\nis responsible for equity (shares),\ndebt underwriting and mergers\nand acquisitions (M&A). These activities involve raising capital for\ncompanies by selling shares in the\ncompany or by selling debt prod-ucts, and advising on and implementing the joining of or selling-off\nof businesses.\nThe job of a trader is to facilitate\nthe buying and selling of financial\ninstruments, e.g. stocks, bonds,\ncurrencies and a vast range of\nproducts. Traders provide \u2018liquidity\u2019, allowing traders to buy and sell\non demand, without having to wait\nfor an individual executing the opposite trade. Propriety traders take\npositions on behalf of the bank. This\nmeans that they buy and sell in the\nhope of benefiting from a rise or fall\nin the market directly.\nThis introduction will have hopefully sparked interest and given you\nan insight into the banking world.\nBanking in brief\nThe newly opened Tanaka Business School demonstrates the\nincreasing demand for finance sector jobs\nUS federal judge makes historical ruling against tobacco industry\nDo you have an\nidea for a business\nbut do not know\nwhere to begin?\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/\nentrepreneurship/\nentrepreneurschallenge\nShould we worry about the increasing trend of graduates forsaking further education for a city career?\nWall Street: the place to find most investment banks\n4 felix Friday 13 October 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

When informed\nby the exec of their plans, the Union President, John Collins, initially banned the event from taking\nplace. However, the exec promised\nMr Collins that the breathalyser\nwould be \u201cused as an educational\ntool\u201d to demonstrate the effects of\nalcohol on those who are not used\nto over-indulging, and to raise\nawareness of drink-driving, which\nhas been a concern in Wye over the\nyears. The advertising for the event\nwas amended to reflect this, and\nsubsequently Mr Collins allowed\nthe event to go ahead. The staff at\nthe campus, including the assistant wardens, asked the exec not to\nrun the event, but this request was\ndeclined.\nA case of beer was offered as a\nprize for the person who scored the\nhighest on the breath testing ma-chine. The winner, who has not been\nnamed, scored 2.4 on the meter, indicating a very high blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC).

The students he was\nwalking with took him to a nearby\nhall of residence, where College\nSecurity were called. Security then\ncalled an ambulance and alerted\nthe campus authorities. At the time\nthe ambulance arrived, the student\nwas in a semi-conscious state.\nThe student was rushed to the\nnearby William Harvey Accident &\nEmergency department and was\nplaced in the Clinical Decision Unit\n(CDU) where he was monitored\novernight and into the next day.\nAnother student was found lying\nin the main road near the campus,\napparently unaware of his situa-tion. A group of students found him\nand took him home, supervised by\nCollege Security, who made sure\nthat when the student passed out\nhe was laid on his side in bed, and\nthat his friends stayed with him.\nThe event has been heavily criticised by both the Union and College authorities, with one member\nof Wye\u2019s campus staff calling it \u201cirresponsible and dangerous\u201d. The\nUnion President, John Collins, has\ninitiated disciplinary procedures\nagainst the Wye President and\nthose responsible for the event,\nadding that he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the conduct of the\norganisers. Concerns have also\nbeen raised over the fact that students were still being served in the\nbar, despite being clearly drunk.\nThe disciplinary tribunal is scheduled to take place on 16 October.\nThere is some doubt over who will\nbe implicated in any possible disciplinary measures, given that the\nWye campus is unusual in that the\noutgoing exec organises the fresh-ers events rather than the incoming exec, as is the case at South\nKensington campus.\nThe Union\u2019s disciplinary procedures cannot remove a student\u2019s\nmembership of the Union, and\ncannot expel them from the College. The Union Council can, how-ever, remove them from their post\nshould evidence of negligence be\npresented at the tribunal. The most\nsevere punishment the tribunal\ncan impart on those reponsible is\nto hand the matter over to a College disciplinary committee, which\nhas the authority to expel a student\nfrom the College. However, this is\nunlikely in this case.\nRector tops out\nnew Southside hall\n\u201cBreath testing night\u201d leaves one student in hospital after fall\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, buried a sprig of yew in the last\nbeam of the new Southside building last Thursday as part of\na traditional building rite.

    "content": "feature\nDoing It Yourself\nThanks to the internet (amongst\nother things) it is now easier to find\nbands, have them play at a show\nor put out a record by them. This\nway of taking control away from\nthe established music business has\nbeen around for ages. What is it all\nabout? By Matty Hoban.\nO\nbvious furniture\nand Ikea jokes\naside, doing it yourself or DIY in music encompasses\nan ethical code and\noutlook as opposed\nto an actual sound.\nBack in the day \u2013 I\u2019m not sure which day\nit was, let\u2019s say Monday \u2013 the idea of a\nmusic business was new, and then before\nyou knew it, it was the 1970s. This decade\nsaw the arrival of supergroups, prog-rock\nand so many other evils that Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses were practically foaming at the\nmouth at the thought of the rapture finally\narriving. What the people needed was music to get back to its grassroots after a period of time consisting of saxophone and\nguitar solos. As many know, punk was the\ninevitable reaction to the corporate face of\nstadium rock, and along with the back to\nbasics approach to music that was punk\ncame the ethics of DIY. Record labels such\nas Factory were more than a label; they\nwere an ideology. Record shops such as\nRough Trade popped up in 1976 and sells\nrecords by more obscure acts focussing\non creativity rather than accessibility and\nremaining firmly independent.\nThe decade of excess and privatisation\nthat was the 80s brought a refinement of\nmusic and it was inspired by punk and it\nwas called New Wave. Music was heading in the right direction but these bands\nquickly went to selling out stadiums and\nthus formed the cleverly-titled No Wave\nscene in New York. The music varied from\nangular atonal noise to noise attached to\nclassic punk beats a la Sonic Youth. DIY\nwas never always about music and the\nNo Wave Cinema movement in New York\nwas influential on underground cinema\nthrowing up Jim Jarmusch and Steve\nBuscemi amongst others. The central\nidea is reject the accepted rules and to\ntake control of music by giving bands who\ndeserve exposure \u2013 but might not be that\naccessible \u2013 and give them that exposure\nwithout working for a profit. This is a major tenet of DIY, being not-for-profit and\npro-creativity.\nSo DIY had established itself as a way\nto do things; put on gigs, put out records\nand make small magazines all celebrating\na love for music and not money. There are\na lot more to the ideas and ethics behind\nit and has a long and interesting history\nwith many great bands. It is not the only\nway to do things, nor is the right way to\na lot of people. To more modern and local things, there are many people in London putting on gigs with a wide variety of\nbands/artists/acts. One of these people is\nChristopher Tipton who founded Upset\nThe Rhythm; they put out records and\nput on shows with bands predominantly\nfrom the US. He is also an Imperial alumnus\n(he studied Biology) and was President of\nthe Alternative Music Society \u2013 a highly-es-teemed position that this journalist held. He\ntook the time out of organising Frieze Music\n2006 \u2013 on tonight and tomorrow (13th and\n14th October) featuring Sunn O))), Burning\nStar Core, Liars and Erase Errata \u2013 to express his views on what he thinks DIY is all\nabout.\nThere is no real one way of going about doing things yourself as it obviously varies with\nthe person who is doing it, and not everyone\nshares the same beliefs. This comes across\nwhen Chris says, \u2018I don\u2019t really believe in\nthe DIY aesthetic if this means something\nis defiantly amateur. Things have moved on\nsince the early nineties. As much as I love\nK records (independent label based around\nOlympia, Washington) etc, this isn\u2019t the only\nmodel of DIY available to us.\u2019 One problem\nwith DIY is that not many people are aware\nof it. This breeds a certain snobbery and\n\u2018There are a lot of people out there who use\nobscure music and the concept of DIY to be\ncool but it shouldn\u2019t be about elitism. It\u2019s not\ncool by virtue of the fact that barely anyone\nknows about it.\u2019\nUpset the Rhythm started, \u2018Because bands\nI loved were having a bad time in the UK,\nwere playing bad shows, were poorly paid\nand some were even avoiding the UK on\ntheir touring schedules to Europe, because\nof the costs and the hassle. I knew there was\nan audience for these artists and couldn\u2019t\nbelieve someone else wasn\u2019t doing some-thing. So I did it myself.\u2019 Many other promoters (such as Damn You! in Nottingham)\ntook this affirmative action in relation to\noverseas bands. Chris and the rest of Upset\nthe Rhythm started by working everything\nout for themselves as they didn\u2019t know many\npromoters when they started or how they\nworked. However he did \u2018\u2026have an immense\namount of respect for Tony Green from Rare\nPleasures. He used to do a lot of shows in\nLondon and his heart is in the right place.\u2019\nChris continues that, \u2018I used to see him at\nshows, handing out flyers for his own shows\nthat he had made himself and he would talk\nto you about the upcoming shows, what they\nwould be like. This enthusiasm and attention\nto detail inspired me. As a result I don\u2019t hire\nflyerers and do it myself or with other Upset\nthe Rhythm members.\u2019 One of the focuses of\nDIY has been to establish a community that\nresults in a dedicated audience for bands\nand \u2018They are the lifeblood.\u2019\nThere are other promoters in London\nwho work in a DIY way and are doing similar things. There is Miles of Smiles put on\nbands who vary from avant-rock in the form\nof Enablers to elegant folk in the form of Viking Moses. The bands tend to be from the\nUS and abroad with local bands supporting.\nThere is also Undereducated and Unluck\nwho respectively cover alternative-indie-femm 4\nFriday 13 October 2006\nnoise and post-rock-noise bands. All this\ntalk of noise is not to deter you, those who\nmake noise in a pretensious way aim to challenge the listener and those use it as a way\nto heighten the music. Also of note are Silver\nRocket who put on brilliant gigs of heavy-rock bands from home and abroad with a\nbrilliant dancing session afterwards.\nOne thing you may have heard of as well\nis the festival called All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties. This is an independent festival hosted\nin holiday camps in Camber Sands and now\nDorset. It started off with Barry Hogan\n\u2013 suspiciously similar-looking to my name\n\u2013 wanting to get bands over from the US to\ncurate or hand-pick the bands that will play\nat the festival. The bands or people that cu-rated brought over many brilliant bands and\nthe next festival is in early December and\nThurston Moore is curating, expect some\navant-garde legends to be playing. All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties also put on gigs in London\nwith people such as Ennio Morricon, Calexico and Isis taking part.\nHowever in regards to a scene Chris Tipton\nthinks that, \u2018There isn't really a scene per se.\u2019\nBut \u2018There are people doing similar things\nand you see this when you book UK tours,\nother people doing shows like yours who\nreally care. London is more fragmented\nand driven by commercial promoters and\nclub nights, there is competition rather\nthan cooperation in the main. There are\na couple of promoters we have worked\nwith but relationships are casual.\u2019 The\nword scene is often associated with journalism to generalise what is happening. I\nmay come across as a hypocrite by calling\nthis section The Scene and you\u2019d be write,\nI am a hyprocrite. But then so are all of us\nand it is silly to suggest otherwise.\nInstead of a scene there is more of an\nethic associated with DIY. This ethic can\nbe seen as anti-capitalist and I guess it is,\nwhere capitalism stands for competition\nand profiteering, the DIY ethic is about\nhelping each other out for mutual benefit\nand if you happen to make money at the\nend of the day, you put it back into your\nenterprise or pay the bands more.\nTo get an insight into the ethics Chris offered up this, \u2018Ethically, you have to be\nOne of the pillars in the Notting Hill Rough Trade displaying posters for shows, you\ncan display these posters for free and they even give you a staple gun\nMATTY\nHOBAN\n\n"

Well, it turns\nout he\u2019s started doing something\ncalled cosmic ordering, which apparently changes your life and\ngets you a slot on daytime TV and\ninto housewives\u2019 hearts.\nWe at Felix are constantly worried about the effects of stress on\nIC students, so we\u2019ve teamed up\nwith Noel to offer one lucky end-of-their-tether reader a signed\n(yes SIGNED) copy of Noel\u2019s new\nself-help book, Positively Happy.\nTo win, just answer this simple\nquestion: \u201cWhat was the name of\nNoel\u2019s hit 1990s TV show?\u201dSend\nme your answer by Tuesday 5pm\nto arts.felix@ic.ac.uk. Signed\nphotos for two runners-up to\ndrool over.\nSomething strange is growing in the\nSerpentine, and it isn\u2019t mould from\na tramp who fell in and drowned\nlast week. No, it\u2019s sculptor Tony\nHeywood\u2019s newest piece, SuperAlgal Bloom.\nInspired by microscopic photography of phytoplankton and zoo-plankton, and by the blue and green\nalgal blooms that regularly appear\nin the Serpentine, Heywood has\ncreated a set of serenely colourful\npieces that dance gracefully on the\nsurface of the lake.\nCatching your eye as you cross\nthe bridge, they glitter like crystals\nin the sunshine, and reflect so perfectly that it\u2019s hard to tell where the\nbejewelled forms end and the lake\nbegins.\nDespite being based on algae, the\nforms are strangely reminiscent of\nmutating watery forms. From gliding swans to clam shells, they seem\nperfectly in harmony with their\nsurroundings, and Heywood has\navoided the easy trap (so completely fallen into by Jim Lambie\u2019s 2005\nTurner work) of making sculpture\nwhich is garish and tacky.\nBut the sculptor had a darker\nmotivation in this piece. He wants\nto comment on the appearance of\nmutant algae strains in reaction\nto changing environmental condi-tions. Indeed, one can imagine in\nthe half-light of dusk that the sculptures would take on an eerie fairy-tale-like quality, gliding across the\nlake like a deformed sea monster.\nThe sculptures will be there until the end of October. If you crave\nrespite from the pressures of university life and have an hour or\ntwo to spare I highly recommend\nthat you take the time to wander\nthrough Kensington Gardens (head\ntowards the Serpentine Gallery) to\nsee them.\nNoel when the BBC loved him\nSuperAlgal Bloom by Tony Heywood. On show next to the Serpentine Bridge in Hyde Park until the end of the month.\nUsually, theatre reviews are intended to give the reader an idea of\nwhether a given play is worth going\nto see. Once they have been given a\nfew hints as to the plot, the cast, and\nthe quality of the production, the\nreader may be tempted into seeing\na play that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise,\nor to avoid a disgusting piece of self-conscious pretentiousness.\nBy those criteria, this review will\nbe almost utterly useless. Piano/\nForte finishes its month-long run on\nSaturday, which is the day after this\nedition of Felix will be published.\nThat gives you, dear reader, two\npotential nights to buy tickets and\nsee this play. I urge you to sell your\ndead grandmother\u2019s gold teeth if\nthat\u2019s what it takes to get seats for\nPiano/Forte. You will not see such\na vivid, chaotic and furiously engaging stage production for quite some\ntime.\nTerry Johnson, fresh from sending up the godfather of cinematic\nsuspense in Hitchcock Blonde,\nwrites (and directs) Piano/Forte\nespecially for its two leads: Kelly\nReilly (Pride & Prejudice, The Libertine) and Alicia Witt (Cybill, Vanilla Sky).\nThe opening scene shows Abigail\n(Alicia Witt), a disturbed, agorapho-bic, quiet (the Piano of the title) but\nastoundingly gifted pianist (Alicia\nWitt is a concert-standard pianist\nand plays all of the music that is\nheard onstage). She is alone in the\noak-panelled house in which she\nwas raised and now lives, looked\nafter by her mother\u2019s Australian\nbrother Ray (Danny Webb).\nThis peaceful idyll is then utterly\ndestroyed by the return of her sis-ter, Louise (Kelly Reilly), an equally\ndisturbed, angry, maniacal hellraiser (the eponymous Forte in the\ntitle), whose only skill is causing\nchaos. This prodigal homecoming\nis precipitated by the impending\nwedding of the girls\u2019 father to a vacuous page 3 model. The marriage\nsymbolically coincides with the anniversary of their mother\u2019s shotgun\nsuicide in the barn outside. When\nthe couple arrives, the heated verbal exchanges shift to a barrage of\nvicious semi-accusatory barbs from\na topless Louise, ceasing only when\nthe father leaves the stage.\nFrom this point onwards, the\nmovement turns into a chaotic cre-scendo, and to describe it would\ndo it no justice. We are then left to\npick over the obviously broken lives\nonstage; a set of hurt and damaged\npeople, for whom normalcy is not\npossible.Blamebecomesirrelevant.\nWhen the end comes, it does so in\na totally different kind crescendo,\nand finishes in a gunshot. Abigail\nis alone onstage, playing Ravel.\nThe beauty of the play lies in the\ndisturbed lives and minds of characters who have failed to move on\nfrom the suicide of the person that\nthey all loved. The play becomes a\nstunning study of the varying types\nof insanity that trauma can engen-der, especially the martyrdom-ob-sessed and dysfunctionally furious\npersonality of Louise (Kelly Reilly\ndeserves a special mention for her\ntempestuous portrayal) and the\nquiet madness of Abigail.\nPiano/Forte has a range like few\nother plays, from the chaotic farce\nto pathos, romance, vicious wit and\nangry youth.\nAndrew Somerville\nThe cacophony of Piano/Forte\nEmily Lines\nArts Editor\n21\nfelix\nFriday 13 October 2006\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\nthink I decided at about\nmy fifth year I was\ndetermined to make\nit ten in-a-row, and\nfingers crossed there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to have been much that has\nstood in my way or as yet stands in my\nway of making it - festival apathy due to\nthe increasingly downhill line-ups, aside.\nIn fact, the festival is such an old haunt of\nmine that in order to do this year\u2019s festival justice for the purpose of this review\nI shall attempt to imagine the experience\nthrough the eyes of a festival newbie. This\nwon\u2019t be that easy. But then considering I\nspent most of the festival in a drink and\nsmoke filled haze of insanity, I don\u2019t think\nit will be so hard either.\nI shall begin my review at the festival\nMain Gate on Friday at about 1pm.(Yes,\nyes a bit late for a \u2018first timer\u2019 I know but\nafter almost a decade I don\u2019t need the\nextra days in a tent to warm up to it all.)\nHere goes nothing. After the weeks of saving up and then waiting for the ticket to\narrive and then feeling it in my grubby\nhands and all the mental planning and\nsleepless nights of excitement, Reading\nFestival here I come! It\u2019s just like I always\nimagined. Only with more strange smells.\nSo many people, so many, many people,\nsome strange looking and some just like\nme. Everybody was herded like ants or\nweird Amazonian, brightly-coloured flies\nin the same direction, generally carrying\nat least twice their body weight in either\nbooze or other such related paraphernalia destined to help them survive the next\nthree days.\nWe proceed to march confidently\nthrough the gates of fire, past the people\ntrying to get a ticket and the touts trying to\nsell you one, past the people handing out\nleaflets on Christianity and how to avoid\nthe lure of the devil. Then past the yellow\nday-glow jacket wearing arena staff wafting the crowds this way and that and along\nthe long dusty dirt road into the camping\narea. WOAH! No, that\u2019s not my reaction to\nthe sheer size of this small city in a field,\ncomprised mainly of balloon-like coloured\npebbles, that is the cry of one caught in a\nbreeze of portaloo stench and it\u2019s only Friday. Wahey!\nUndeterred and our tent up, we\u2019re ready\nto grab a piece of the action. First up on our\nlist of bands to see is Belle and Sebastian.\nWe fight our way through the masses to a\nquiet pocket to the front-right of the Main\nStage crowd and with only part of my view\nblocked, braced ourselves to begin jumping around like happy indie sweethearts\nto all our favourite suicidal lullabies. Although the band certainly do have bags of\nsing-a-long shoegazing melodies in their\nrepertoire, I didn\u2019t feel this late afternoon\nslot on the largest stag did them justice.\nEverything sounded a bit same-y to me,\neven for them, and I felt watching them\nwas more of a nostalgic exercise than a\nsatisfying musical moment.\nThe Mystery Jets however, were really tight and definitely on form. I saw them\nopen the Carling Tent last year and it is really great to see how their fanbase has blossomed and how much confidence they have\ngained. They played some of the stuff off the\nnew album and it was a pleasure to see it all\nworking with their usual style. Definitely a\nband to catch now while you still can get to\nsee them in a venue you won\u2019t get lost in.\nTo be honest I felt like the days highlight\u2019s\nwere going to be The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The\nVines and Primal Scream, and I certainly\nwasn\u2019t disappointed. Apart from one of our\ncrew having a major white out during Maps,\nI couldn\u2019t have asked for my experience to\nbe more rockingly festival-tastic. Uninspired\nby the line-up we had all been a bit liberal\nwith our alcohol intake and I\u2019m pretty sure\nit was during our early evening sing-a-longs\nwhile linking arms and fisting the air, that I\nremember vaguely remarking to myself that\nthis was starting to seem like the bona fide\ntime I had been promised.\nThe crowd lapped up the YYYs, the majority of which were made up of 16-19yr olds\nsuitably and impeccably dressed and acces-sorized. The band played like they had been\nwaiting all year for this slot and they were\nthe perfect prelude to the rest of the week-end, if only there had been something a bit\nless of a letdown than The Chiefs to follow\ntheir stomping footsteps. In my personal\nopinion the Chiefs are the most overrated\nthing since Hovis started mixing flour, yeast\nand water, and to be honest looking at the\nwaning size of the crowd at the Main stage,\nI\u2019m probably not alone in my thinking.\nWhether you love or hate Craig Nichols,\nThe Vines are a band who are very good\nat what they do, and the atmosphere in the\ntent was forgiving as well as vibrantly loyal.\nThey may have been off the map for a while\nbut the first 15 rows of the Radio One tent at\nleast knew all the songs and sung to nearly\nevery chorus. A long time coming perhaps,\nbut the steady fanbase and sophistication of\nthe band live prove they obviously haven\u2019t\nbeen resting on their laurels.\nSaturday\u2019s highlights will be easy for me\nto recount seeing as for me there were only\nabout a handful of bands I wanted to see.\nMain Stage headliners Muse, of course, because it seems no matter how many times\nyou see this band there will always be something dramatic, fresh and untamed about\ntheir performances. With a huge selection of\nwork to get through they picked a varied but\nmostly Hullaballoo-era set and the crowd\nloved it.\nSunday was all about the dance tent and\nthe lead up to headliners Soulwax\u2019s Niteversions set of 2 Many DJs and Vitalic was\njust about enough to send us into orgasmic\noverload. Sadly, the Vitalic set wasn\u2019t all\nI had dreamt of it being and although the\ntemperature and atmosphere inside the\ntent was rising fast, the sweat from dancing\nmixed with jets of cold water sprayed by the\nsecurity at the front gave it an Alton Towers\ntwist I wasn\u2019t so sure I enjoyed. For our fi-nale, 2 Many DJs were greeted with the kind\nof screaming appreciation that an internationally revered live dance act could expect\nand they gave us back exactly what we were\nafter. In short, they rocked!\nFestival season\nis over. For now.\nChecking out festivals large and small this summer,\nReading fares well in 2006, dispite a less than\naverage line-up.

The site has\nalso won praise within the more\ntechnically inclined members of\nthe student body for conforming to\nmodern web standards.\nThe website cost \u00a340,000 in total\nto build, and went live at the start\nof this term after extensive testing over the summer vacation. The\nUnion bought extra capacity for the\nsite, in order to cope with the rush\nthat was expected after Freshers\u2019\nFair with students joining and rejoining clubs and societies. So far,\nthe site has coped admirably with\nthe almost 27,000 page impressions\nper day.\nThough the vast majority of payments for club membership went\nthrough without problems, around\nten students found their payment\nbeing declined when the system\nwas in fact taking payment. This\nproblem was identified quickly, as\nthe site is being closely monitored\nto ensure it is functioning correctly,\nand the money was returned to the\nstudents without them even realising what had occurred.\nIn addition to the online payment\nof club membership, the new site\nhas become a far more valuable resource for clubs and societies officers than the previous website. Some\nclub content is currently missing\nfrom the site, though this is mainly\nsocieties that are defunct, or did not\nsubmit information for the Clubs &\nSocieties A to Z.\nThe response from students and\nclub officers has been strongly positive so far, with a number commenting this reporter that the site has\n\u201cmade our lives easier\u201d. Instead\nof having to fill out forms and cash\nand track the money they receive\nfrom club members, the online system allows the money to be deposited directly into the clubs\u2019 accounts.\nAdditionally, the Student Activities\nCentre is encouraging students to\nuse the site to sign up members, as\nit reduces the amount of paperwork\nUnion website up!\nThe new Union website has proved to be worth the rather steep\nasking price, comparing favourably with UCLU\u2019s new site\ntheir student volunteer staff has to\ndeal with. However, not enough students are using the site to sign up\nyet, though the number is rapidly\nincreasing as awareness of the new\nfunctionality spreads.\nThe new University College London Union (UCLU) website reportedly cost around \u00a380,000, or twice\nthe amount that the Union paid for\nthe new site, and has been widely\ncriticised on the UCL campus for\nbeing, as one disgruntled student\nput it, \u201ccrap\u201d.\nSabbatical team in disarray?\nTempers are running high in the\nsabb team, with tensions reaching\na head on Tuesday, with at least two\nmembers of the team drafting resignation letters.\nAt Council on Monday evening,\nthe sabbaticals and the Felix Editor presented their first reports,\ndetailing their actions over the preceding months to those attending.\nThe Deputy President (Graduate\nStudents), Shama Rahman, faced\na number of questions from several\nmembers of Council, including her\nfellow sabbaticals.\nQuestions were put to Ms Rahman during the presentation of her\nreport about the upcoming Graduate Student Association (GSA) elec-tions. So far the elections are giving\nevery appearance of becoming a\nfarce, as the traditional publicity\nfor the elections has been minimal,\nand only one person is standing,\nin the role of Communications Officer. Asked if she knew how many\npeople were standing for positions,\nshe replied that she did not know to\na somewhat stunned Council and\nreferred the question to the Union\nPresident, John Collins.\nA member of the sabbatical team\nraised questions over Ms Rahman\u2019s\nperformance at Freshers\u2019 Fair\nwhere she was manning the GSA\nstall.ItisreportedbyFelix\u2019ssources\nthat Ms Rahman arrived well after\nthe fair started, and was seen packing up at around 3pm. This no doubt\nantagonised the other sabbaticals,\nwho were clearly visible on the site\nfrom set-up to tear-down. Mr Lai\u2019s\nreport to Council also noted that he\nhad received complaints about the\nGSA stall.\nFelix has learned that, allegedly,\nsome sabbaticals drafted their\nresignation letters after Council,\nthough it is not clear whether this\nis in protest at what they perceive\nas Ms Rahman\u2019s poor performance\nin recent weeks, or whether they\nfeel the team is no longer viable.\nThe sabbaticals contacted by this\nreporter denied that any resignations would be taking place.\nIn Ms Rahman\u2019s defence, she did\nnot have a handover, and the current team could not rely on Luis\nHui, the previous DPGS, to provide\ntraining. Some disgruntled hacks\nhave suggested that perhaps the\nother members of the sabb team\nshould have made more effort to\nensure Ms Rahman understood\nher role.\nIC ranked 9th in the world\nImperial College is the ninth best\nuniversity in the world according\nto the latest Times Education Supplement, having soared from thirteenth place in last year\u2019s survey to\nbecome the only newcomer in this\nyear\u2019s top ten.\nMost of the leading universities\nhave maintained their positions\nwith Harvard retaining the top\nspot above Cambridge and Oxford,\nwhich ranked second and third\nplace respectively. Indeed, American institutions continue to domi-nate, filling 11 out of the top 20 slots\nas well as being well-represented\nthroughout the table. However, despite their world-beating private\nfunding, this year America has\ngiven way to a greater number of\nEuropean and Asian universities in\nthe top 20. Furthermore, the seemingly unbeatable Harvard University has reduced its lead from a\nsizable 10% to less than 4% from its\nnearest rival.\nImperial\u2019s rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, has commended Imperial\u2019s\nhigh ranking: \u201cthis underlines Imperial\u2019s status as an internationally\nleading centre of knowledge and\nscholarship, and is an excellent position from which to enter our Centenary year. Above all, it\u2019s a tribute\nto the world-class staff we are able\nto attract, both academic and non-academic, and I hope all members\nof our community will join with me\nin celebrating.\u201d Imperial\u2019s recent\ndecision to split from the University of London and become independent by 2007, its centenary year,\nis reinforced by the Times\u2019 results,\ngiven that they far outranked all\nother London institutions: LSE finished at seventeenth place, UCL at\n25 and Kings College at 46.\nWhether or not prospective students choosing universities can rely\non these figures is debatable. The\ndifficulty of sourcing truly international data and agreeing on a comprehensive framework has meant\nthat global ranking of universities\nstill remains a controversial issue.\nYet, in the face of increased globali-sation, there is a definite need for a\nreliable ranking system as universities shape an international identity for themselves. But different\nmethodologies and criteria have\nled to many different lists that have\nvariable rankings for the same uni-versity. In Newsweek, for example,\nImperial was ranked considerably\nlower in seventeenth place.\nThe Times ranking is based on\nboth qualitative and quantitative\nmeasures including but not limited\nto: peer review by academics, the\nnumber of citations per academic\nand the ratio of students to academic staff. Encompassing both research and teaching quality, it aims\nto give a reliable picture of where\nuniversities stand on an international platform.\nThe ICU website (left), and the more expensive UCLU site (right)\nThe College beat US universities like Princeton to claim 9th place\nThe sabbs at Council; Shama Rahman (DPGS) is second from right\nPriya Shah\nFelix shortlisted five times in\nfour categories for Guardian\nStudent Media Awards 2006\nFelix and its staff have been shortlisted in the prestigious Guardian\nStudent Media Awards.

    "content": "27\nfelix\nFriday 13 October 2006\nDuring my first two years at Imperial, I became depressingly aware\nof the Imperial College students\u2019\napathy.\nDuring anti-war campaigns we\nwent unnoticed in the hoards of\nstudents who had travelled from\naround the UK. At the Campaign\nagainst Climate Change, five year\nold children were clearly more\nentertained, and entertaining,\nthroughout the march.\nBut worst of all, and this the\nfreshers should particularly look\ndown on us for, at the top-up fees\nmarches our Students\u2019 Union took\nno significant role in representing\nthe students and we ourselves never lifted a finger.\nAs a result of this apathy, places\nlike Southside have become mere\nlegends to most student. For those\nwho had the pleasure of experiencing the halls (and bar) you will never forget their intricate maze-like\ndesign. It was possibly the easiest\nbuilding to get lost in, yet as a result\none of the most fun to walk into.\nBut Southside should teach us\nall a good lesson. Imperial was not\nalways the dull quiet place that it\nis today. It would probably shock\nmost of you to find that Southside\nwas designed to prevent riots.\nScarily enough, it would probably\nshock the students who first lived\nin Southside even more to find that\nour generation did nothing more\nthan sign a petition when the halls\nwere knocked down and the bars\nclosed forever.\nAs former Felix editor, Rupert\nNeate, wrote on the subject \u201ceven\nin my wildest imagination I cannot\nthink of any cause against which we\nImperial students would riot. Perhaps the library not being open 24\nhours any more?!\u201d\nBut I\u2019m not here to complain\nabout our students, I\u2019m here to encourage people to be a little more\nlike our predecessors: a little more\nvocal. We are not a lost, but we\nhave to work a little harder at being\nheard.\nAs many may already know last\nyear the Environmental Society organised the first ever Green Week.\nWith a large group of students concerned with the College\u2019s disregard\nfor its own environmental responsiJo\u00e3o Vitor Serra\nEnvironment Editor\nRaising our voices\nbilities, Green Week aimed to raise\nawareness and asked the College\nto committee to certain targets. As\na result, this is the first year that\nstudents can find recycling in all\ndepartments.\nOthers will also remember the\nHIV/AIDS campaign Positively Red\nWeek organised by MedSIN, another student society. The week was\nfilled with workshops and lectures\nand the students flaunted Red ribbons to show support for the cause.\nIn the coming year, this section\nhopes to become an open arena for\ndiscussing topics varying from global health to global warming and\nfrom education to poverty.\nSocieties are welcome to write\nabout their events and campaigns,\nthe purpose of this section is for\nyou to have a means to communicate with students. Individuals are\nequally welcome to speak their\nminds or tell a story.\nI encourage all students and staff\nto be a little less apathetic than we\nhave recently been and bring back\nthe Southside spirit by raising their\nvoices and sharing your views. Who\nknows, maybe some time in the future the College will have to rebuild\nSouthside so as to cage the beasts\nthat are Imperial students.\nIn the spirit of Southside\u2026 let us defeat Imperial apathy\nSouthside: initially built to contain riots, but now this legend merely\nrepresents a time when students still had an opinion.\nApproximately 600 million people are at risk of contracting schistosomiasis becase they live in tropical\nregions where water supply and sanitation are inadequate or non-existent.\nBe a little less\napathetic and\nbring back the\nSouthside spirit\nby sharing your\nviews.\nMedsin-Imperial is a group of students motivated to raise awareness\nof humanitarian and health related\nissues on a global and local level by\norganizing projects and campaigns,\nand we have been running for more\nthan 8 years!\nMedsin is the UK branch of the\nInternational Federation of Medical Students\u2019 Association (IFMSA),\nmade up of local branches at all\nthe major medical schools in the\ncountry.\nAt Medsin-Imperial, through our\ncampaigns covering issues such as\nHIV/AIDS and sanitation, we raise\nawareness and lobby for change.\nWe also run a wide range of hands-on projects throughout the year.\nLearning sign language, teaching\nAnenta Ratneswaren\nMedsin Imperial\nCPR to children in schools, encouraging people to donate bone marrow or volunteering at orphanages\nin the Balkans are just some of the\nthings you can get involved in, but\nif that\u2019s not enough, you could even\nset up your own project.\nSome of the many events and\nactivities we have planned for the\nyear include: Positively Red AIDS\nWeek, running from 26th November\nto 1st December 2006, as well as the\nnew Global Health Forum, which\nis a program of fortnightly Medsin\nevents aiming to stimulate interest\nand promote awareness of important issues in international health\nthrough diverse talks, debates and\nfilms.\nOur first event this year, held last\nTuesday was \u2018The Vicious Cycle\nof Worms\u2019, a lecture given by Prof\nAlan Fenwick OBE. Professor Fenwick is a leading expert in tropical\nparasitology and the direct of the\nSchistosomiasis Control Initiative.\nWe have also just launched a\nnew project called Sexpression,\nenabling medical students to raise\nawareness about sexual health issues both in local schools and within the university.\nIf you\u2019re interested in any of our\nprojects or campaigns, or if you just\nwant to find out more about Medsin,\nvisit us at our \u2018Medsin Explained\u2019\nevent on Tuesday 17th October,\n6.30pm.

    "content": "It\u02bcs a new academic year and change is\neverywhere in Imperial. The JCR no longer\nresembles an airport lounge, pink appears\nto be College\u02bcs favourite colour and new\nundergraduates are now paying \u00a33000 for the\nprivilege of coming to study at Imperial. Yes,\nafter the demonstrations, lobbies and media\nfrenzy over top-up fees two years ago they\nare \ufb01nally arriving on campus. After all, what\nbetter way to celebrate the College\u02bcs centenary\nthan by giving that most special of gifts; debt.\nSeveral years hence the bright-eyed Freshers\nthat appeared on campus last week will emerge\nbleary eyed into the real world with not only a\ndegree but up to \u00a344,000 of debt.\nThe principle of free higher education is dead.\nFees have been with us since 1998, in the\nintervening years student debt has rocketed\nand more and more students have had to take\npart time employment to ensure that they can\nsurvive at university. This increased pressure on\ntime and money prevents students from making\nthe most of their time at university with both\nacademic and social lives su\ufb00ering. If this is the\nlegacy of paying up to \u00a31200 in tuition fees,\nthen the impact of top-up fees will be far worse.\nOf course, the outlook could be even poorer.\nWhen top-up fees were introduced our Rector\nwas one of those arguing bitterly that \u00a33000\nsimply wasn\u02bct enough \u2013 why not charge more?\nWhy not charge \u00a312000 more? Of course, he\nhasn\u02bct changed his mind since then. Top up\nfees are capped at \u00a33000 (give or take in\ufb02ation)\nuntil 2010, at which point the government\nhad promised a \u201creview\u201d. The College, along\nwith other leading\ninstitutions, has already\nbegun lobbying hard\nto remove the limit on\nthe amount they can\ncharge students. Four\nyears may be an awfully\nlong time in politics,\nbut if we are to win\nthe battle against the\ncomplete marketisation\nof education we need\nto start \ufb01ghting now. And we can\u02bct a\ufb00ord to\nrely on the public\u02bcs sympathy for poor, starving\nstudents \u2013 we need solid arguments to support\nwhat we know to be right.\nWe need to remind the government and the\ngeneral public that a university education\ndoesn\u02bct only bene\ufb01t the individual. The bene\ufb01t\nto industry, business and society as a whole\ncannot be understated. The students of today\nwill be the leaders of tomorrow in \ufb01elds ranging\nfrom politics to nano-technology.\nTo start the debate, NUS are organising a\nnational demonstration as part of a wider\ncampaign against top-up fees and raising the\ncap on Sunday the 29th October. Despite not\nbeing NUS members Imperial College Union\nwill be joining the demonstration. More details\nand publicity will be heading your way in the\nnot too distant future, but if you want any more\ninformation or would like to get involved in\norganising this campaign please get in touch\nwith me at dpew@imperial.ac.uk.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nBen Matthews\nDeputy President\n(Education & Welfare)\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk\nAll about\u2026 Fees.\nThe fight is not over\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nDear All\nAs Ben is writing the lion\u02bcs\nshare of this week\u02bcs page, I\nwill try to keep my column\nbrief. My main message to\nyou this week is that the\ndeadline for elections is fast\napproaching (nominations close\nthis Sunday night) and there\nare still a handful of vacant\npositions up for grabs. This month we are running\nelections for IC Union Council members, Faculty Union\nOfficers, Graduate Student Association Officers and ULU\nDelegates. Being a Union Officer can be an interesting,\nfun and enjoyable experience and holding a position of\nresponsibility will encourage you to develop new skills\nand interests. Becoming a Union Officer can also be a\ngreat way of improving your CV - I regularly receive\nphone calls and emails from graduate employers who\ntell me that they speci\ufb01cally target students who hold\npositions of responsibility in the Union and other\nextra-curricular activities. So, if you are interested\nin standing then please go to our website www.\nimperialcollegeunion.org/vote and if you want to know\nmore about these elections and the positions that are\nopen for nominations this month then please email me\nat president@imperial.ac.uk.\nIf you want an opportunity to question the candidates\nwho are running for these positions, then please come\nalong to our public hustings. These will be taking\nplace in the JCR at lunchtime and the Reynolds bar in\nthe evening on Thursday 19th October. Finally, please\nremember to vote in these elections - all voting is\nonline and only takes a moment of your time. I will\nsend you an email as soon as voting opens towards the\nend of this month\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\n! !\n!\nSTAND\nStand in the Council Elections 2006\nPlaces are available for Ordinary Members of Council, Equal Opportunities Officer & Welfare\nCampaigns Officer and ULU Delegates.

Well, you\u2019ve picked\na good week for it. Starting\ntonight, at 18.30, David Bullock\nis talking about \u201cConservation\non the grand scale\u201d at Birkbeck\nCollege. Be there, or be whatever is the opposite of green.\nIf you\u2019re a scientist, but want\nto make money, find out how\non October 17 at the Tanaka\nBusiness School. Dr John Hassard, an Imperial alumnus, is\ncoming to talk about his very\nsuccessful company deltadot.\nThe event is free, sponsored by\nIC Entrepreneurs.\nFor over 18s only, the Dana\nCentre is holding a two-day\nevent \u201cFairground: Thrill Laboratory-Pleasure\u201d starting October 17. The event costs \u00a310 and\nincludes live experimentation\non the \u201cMiami Trip\u201d as well as\ncanap\u00e9s, fizzy pop, oh, and a\nnumber of talks.\nAnd finally: reading list looking too long? No need to read\nthe entire IC library, just mosey\non down to G16, Sir Alexander\nFleming Building at 6.30pm on\nThursday, October 19, hand\nover your \u00a38, and listen to Dr\nArmand Leroi, Maggie McDonald, and Tim Radford who\u2019ll tell\nyou what you need in their talk\n\u201cThe best science books ever\u201d.\nKrystyna Larkham\nScience Editor\nIt\u2019s illegal in parts of Northern\nThailand, hospitals and universities run on it, endurance athletes\nenhance their performance with it,\nand 300 years ago, it could be used\nas grounds for divorce. Only the oil\nindustry has a greater volume of\nworldwide trade. As I drain my coffee cup a fourth time this evening\nand feel renewed strength running\nthrough my veins, I look back at\nthe humble caffeine molecule, and\nwhat makes it so dear to our faster\nbeating hearts.\nThe story goes that around\n850BC, an Ethiopian goat herder,\nKaldi, noticed his goats getting high\non some pretty red berries, and decided to give them a taste himself.\nThe craze soon spread, and before\nlong coffee trees were being grown\nall along the Arabian peninsular.\nThe drink soon took on religious\nconnotations, being used as a meditative drink within the Muslim tra-dition. It was so sacred that those\ncaught drinking coffee in Constantinople, home of the world\u2019s first\ncoffee house, were beaten the first\ntime, and if caught again, thrown\ninto the river sewn in a leather bag\nto drown.\nThe caffeine molecule itself mimics the shape of adenosine, a neurotransmitter involved in suppressing many cell pathways. It binds\nto adenosine receptor molecules\nin the synapse, allowing chemical\npathways to continue unhindered,\nhence caffeine\u2019s stimulatory role.\nAn overdose can be fatal, and even\nat \u2018normal\u2019 (student) consumption,\ncaffeine can result in reduced fine\nmotor co-ordination, increased\nheart rate, insomnia, nervousness and dizziness. The blocking\nof adenosine receptors causes the\nbody to manufacture extra ones to\ncompensate, so a drop of caffeine\ncauses oversensitivity to the neu-rotransmitter. This results in a dramatic drop in blood pressure, leading to the \u2018give me coffee\u2019 headache\naround half past three.\nIt\u2019s not all bad though. A cup of\ncoffee a day makes you significantly less likely to top yourself, and it\ndoes wonders for the sex life of the\nelderly.\nMeanwhile, a tiny espresso taken\nwith a Gaulouises and a hefty dose\nof French philosophy is almost\ncertain to get you laid in certain\ncircles, and even the most dyed-in-the-silicon computer scientist won\u2019t\nmistake the meaning behind \u2018Do\nyou fancy coming up for a coffee?\u2019\nSo put the kettle on, put your feet\nup, and give thanks to the humble\ncoffee bean, preamble of first dates\nand saviour of students. After all,\nheroin is so pass\u00e9.\nRe-printed by kind permission\nfrom Varsity.
