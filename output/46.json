    "content": "FELIX PROFILE WILLIAMS AND WITH ROBINSON William Sandwith Robinson, known to most of us as just\nplain\" Bill\", born at Uoreoambe in1930, has crowded an\namazing number of achievements into his comparatively young\nlife. He was educated at -.'ore cam be \"co-ed\" Grammar School\nuntil1945 when he went to Nottingham High School to comp let e his school education. Whilst at Nottingham he became\nhead of the school, captain of the rugby XV and swimming\nVIII besides representing the school at cricket and athletics It is interesting to note that at some point during\nhis school career he wa.s awarded a prize, for the boy who\nhad the Viest influence on the school ( all done by kindness!)\nIn 1949 Bill first graced I.C. with his presence,\nentering the Royal School of Mines with an oil scholarship\nand graduating in oil technology last year - he is now\nstudying for a Ph.D. Academically speaking Bill is not\nexactly dumb having'been awarded the Institute of Petroleum\nprize for all round excellence together with the Charlton\nprize. During his stay at I.C. he has held many offices executive and sporting. Apart from being the Secretary of\nR.S. M.in195152 and their President this year he has been\non I.C. council for three years.\ncontinued in next column\nRegarding Bill's sporting achievements, although he\nis a swimmer of no mean ability. and dabbles in a few\nracket games, Ma;r \u00ab .\n*\n\u00ab\n*\nr gene is rugby.\nLast season he had the honour of captaining the Univ ers it y rugby team, during which they built up the best\nrecord the club has ever had. Furthermore Bill himself\nset up another record for the club by playing in only one\nmatch, a severe shoulder injury keeping him out of the game\nfor the entire season. However in spite of this and numerous other injuries of a less serious nature (such as having\nan ear almost torn off!) he is* now back in the game again.\nApart from having had county trials for Notts, Derby, lines and Middlesex, promotion came rapidly in the rugby world,\nfor during his first term at I.C. he played on three consecutive occasions for i! ines, I.C. and U.L. There is no doubt that W.S.R. is unique in more ways\nthan one. He is proud of possessing two cauliflower ears\nand of being the only man who tried to go to a Saturday\nnight hop at 4 o 'clock in the morning. The story is told of how on one Saturday evening, Bill returning very tried and a little under the weather from a rugby match decided\nto have a sleep before going to the hop. Awakening from\nhis slumbers and thinking that it was time to trip the light. fantastic, he went down to the Union to find the whole\nplace in darkness - not unusual at 4 o 'clock on a Sunday\nmorning.\nOutside college duties Bill has many wide and varied\ninterests, but the list is too long to discuss here.\nHowever, he is usually seen at Carnivals dressed in a MineE\nrugby shirt, and it is said though with what truth I don't know, that he was well-known for regularly attending\nSt. George's Hospital for a long time after recovering from\nhis injury! Although living in Nottingham Bill iBa very stout\nLancastrian and has been known on several occasions to\nargue With Welshmen on matters political and national such\nas rugby and cricket. IC.\"Y ES\"T OG.i The FELIX Survey of General Studies has shown\nseveral facts which may be of Interest to the\ncollege in general. The opinions of1 J0 students were obtained, mostly by interview, bu ta dozen from your written replies to the FELIX questionnaire. Twenty six percent of the replies were Of\nthe opinion that the present Tuesday and Thursday timetables were not Justified by the good done\nby the Lectures. Most of these were people who\ntravel a considerable distance to the college.. The re st,1AY, were quite happy about the system; and many of them were very enthusiastic. A few\npeople suggested that Mondays and Fridays should be used for the Lectures, or that they should be\ngiven in the evenings. We put these suggestions to the others, and they were rejected by a large majority. Thus it can be concluded that, despite resistance In some quarters which ought to know\nbetter, the new timetable is very acceptable to3 students out of A. Even among the objectors, violent cases were rare. Regarding attendance at the Lectures, we\ndivided replies into four categories: often, sometimes, seldom, never. While this sort of loose thinking may be objected to, we would point out that lt Is difficult to find numerically how\noften people go to the Lectures, since they are inclined to vary week by week. The results which we recorded were gene; al Impressions.28/\" attend the Lectures regularly( one or more each week),15? \u00b0 never go at all. The rest divide equally between those who go \" sometimes\"( one a week to one a month), and the rest, who go seldom. One student had never heard of the Lectures. Supposing our sample to be representative of I.C., then about a quarter of the students,(400) form a nucleus of attendance, one or more\na week. We asked whether attendance at the Lectures Increased and broadened the interests of those who went. This Is a difficult question to ask. People, when Interviewed, tended to become a little embarrassed about it. Our results show\nthat AO?' of our sample of130 students consider themselves broadened;2 A% feel that they only get enjoyment. A\" test\" case was that of the Picasso Lecture by E.H. Go mbr l ch. Many students referred to this as approaching the ideal in so\nfar as the diffusion of new knowledge is con-cern ed. Many peon le came away from that Lecture with the feeling that they were on better terms with Picasso: that he had become an aesthetic reality instead of an incomprehensible Joke. Forty percent: almost600 students feel their interests( largely cultural) are expanded by the Lectures. Heard in a Nursing Home.\n\"Is this your first baby?\"\n\"It's our first, but between you and me, it's my\nsecond.\"\n^ 7 4 \u00ab ? o LIKE TIMETABLE:28<*> KEEN SUPPORTERS.\nWe asked for suggestions for the Improvement\nof the Lectures. Those which were received' in our early questioner y were put to people whom we\ninterviewed later. The most ^ cu a i and lng conclusion obtained by\nua from the whole survey is that there is a very wide demand for more Lectures on cUR RB NT AFFAIRS,\nboth locals nd international. The majority are Interested in information, as unbiased asp ossi hig, but a strong faction also wants politics. There\nis a feeling that the lectures have been too uno on t rovers i al. In fao t, apart from establishing without any trace of doubt that the Lectures have been widely acknowledged by the students as a very Fine thing, thus giving them a solid foundation for their further progress, our survey has pointed out the most common er it lois m. MORE\nCURRENT EVENTS AND CONTROVERSY.\nWe asked a lot of people whether they favoured scientific Lectures. Tour out of five were convinced that they wanted anything rather than science. There is a widespread demand for more' films, but in a large room. The large physics lecture theatre is criticised: a micro phone is needed for many speakers. Bad timing comes in for a good deal of com-ment. The general opinion is that Lectures should finish strictly at2,20, though some ( not many) think they should be ten minutes shorter. It is felt that the student chairman has become\na clich ema oh in e: he is often not competent to deliver a good vote of thanks. There are often three good Lectures together; and sometimes three bad. This is a very sub-j ect ive criticism, but a lot of people have made\nit, Tuesday is generally better than Thursday; but the trouble he relies in the amazing popularity of the s cries of music Lectures given by Dr. Jacques. whenever there is a really good Lecture on a Tue s4ay, a large collection of fans is torn between loyalty to a Lecture which will certainly be good, and another, more doubtful, but with an\nattractive title or speaker. Apart from Dr. Jacques, the names of Dr. Go mb rich, L.A.G. Strong, Dilys Powell, u en ry S here k,C, Day Lewis are mentioned as outstanding lecturers; but the general opinion is that the standard of last term's Lectures was very high: it is doubted whether it can be kept up.\nThe Physics Theatre door should be oiled. There should be talks on archeology. The music concerts should be made tree, without a silver collection. These and many open suggestions illustrate the lively and highly critical interest\" in the Lectures which made such an impression on\nour interviewers.

It has taken members of the team some time and good groundwork,.both in\nHockey and socially, to obtain this recognition. In hockey\ncertainly, U. L.H.C. has attained the standard of both Oxford and Cambridge.\nI.C. is indeed unlucky ih that the University draws on\n5 players regularly, and occassionally the odd player on J the eve of the match. J.G. Smith at centre-forward, has\nscored an alarming number of goals\u2014 alarming, that is, for the opponents. B.D. Smith gives of his best and is much\nimproved. H.I. Hayes, the Hon.

Against Bristol University the l3t XV fought out a draw although pressing for most of the game. A blustering\ncross wind at Harlington was the real villain of the piece\nand effectively blocked all attempts to play open rugby.\nOn the same day the 2nd XV lost their unbeaten record,\nlosing to Wasps 'A'. A glance at their points total, how-ever, Bhows how they have in general outclassed their\nopposition. At the time of writing the 2nd have scored\n238 pts. and have had only 28 scored against them.\nThe *A* XV have recently beaten C.E.M.1 st XV 9-0\nand lost heavily to a very strong St. Mary's side.\nKitchener's teem is rapidly assuming the nature of a convalescent home with guests from 1st and 2nd XVs trying\nout their injuries. It is understood that application a for permanent positions from a former University Captain\nand a County player are being favourably considered. The\nlatest results are a190 win over, Charlton Park and a135 loss to Richmond Ex. \"A\". Whan this article appears I.C. will have played Wye\nCollege in the semi-final of the University Cup and although\nit is unlikely that the side will be at full strength victory is confidently expected.\nSTICK IN THE MUD I.C. No force on earth is more likely to produce a cramped\nstyle than a journey between Canvey Island and the Union\nin the back of the Gliding Club Truck; especially w SP eft you have sixteen companions, all with soaking trousers and\nfreezing feet. But every pain has its pleasure, as the\nMarquis de Sade may have said, and I still remember with\na feeling of relief how the truck stopped on open ground\nafter half an hour of organised a gon is ed howling mingled\nwith a tattoo of fists on the driving cab roof. The next\nset of passing headlights silhouetted eight motionless\ncurb side figures.\nOn the Island itself, nothing was more memorable than\nthe morale of the aer vio e men who had been on relief work\nfor a week. The Scots Guards worked side by aide with\ntha R.A.F. in an entente cockle-warming to a ea. As a burly Guardsman said to me \"Look at those\u2014R.A.F. They\nhave a \u2014break for tea every twenty\u2014 minutes.\" A few\nminutes later I was drink in e tea out of a billy-can which\nhad just been washed in a pool of muddy water. The owners\nvoice hummed confidentially in my ear, \"You can see these\n--Guards are no\u2014good. They had to bring the R.A.F. in.\" It seems quite wonderful how those boys are never\nstuck for-a word.\nThen there was the Officer. National Service Commission - you know the type - and he wandered along to\n\u2022where a heavy lorry was axle deep in mud and had almost\nheeled over. \"What's the matter? Arent you mobile?\nHave you tried pushing?\" Five veteran I.C. toughs looked\nwith mingled feelings at his virgin pink chin, and'tried\nagain, just to please him, while the Army growled and the\ndriver grunted.\nBeer and skittles are all very well; but you cant\nhave them all the time, and the isolated patches of\nhumour only served to punctuate long stretches of mono-,\nto nous drudgery. The notorious East Wall (a name which,\nfor me, will always smack of Siberia) is about fifty fee^ wide at the base, and five at the top. We were filling the weak parts with sandbags, which we carried on our backs\nthrough mud and'water, and through all the other obstacles\nwhich prevented supply lorries from driving right up to the\nwall. Some of us were filling sandbags with mud, some\nwith' sand. Whatever we were doing, everything was filthy,\nsquelch y, muddy. Except the food! How they did it, I do\nnot'know; but we had a delicious hot lunch.\nCanveyl The very name te.il s off in mournful melancholy. Deserted houses, floors covered in silt, ruined\ngardens, despair. A barge, two miles inland, straddles\nacross a fence, where it fell when the floods receded.\nWooden bungalows, hopelessly insubstantial things, turned\ncompletely upside down.\n\"The bones of Desolation's nakedness\"\nTHE INFLUENCE OF MOTOR RACING ON CAR DESIGN\nAt a joint meeting of the Guilds Engineering Society\nand i lot or Club to be held on Thursday February 26th at\n5.30 p.m. in Room 15, a lecture will be given entitled \"The Influence of Hotor Racing on Car Design\" by T.G.

    "content": "FU JX s Les Jeux Inter dits: Academy Cinema, Oxford Street. A Joke about death: not a subject for a film you think? Then if you like to hold on to your beliefs and you thrive on false ideas, don't visit the Academy Cinema for a few months, for the \"Sec-ret Game\" is one long joke on death, and such is its success it will surely fill the Academy for along time .\nA little girl, whose parents have been killed, is found by a peasant boy and taken to live in his home. The two children, Michael and Paulette, bury her dead puppy but feel it must not be al on eso the \"Game\" begins. The game of collecting dead companions for the puppy and crosses for the graves. But soon the game grows to more than a search for companions and they become lost in \"the love of the game for the game's sake\". They have a never growing urge to embellish and increase their secret cemetery. The action takes place on a French peasant farm and the family feud between neighbours forms the background to the main story. Not only in the \"Game\" are we involved with Death r.\"t in the farm life itself, Death brings a smile to our*\nlips and often a guffaw from our stomachs. Yet there is no farce, no clowning, only fine acting from the whole cast, dominated by the children,3 rigi tte Fossey and Georges Bou l jou ly. The performances given by these children are outstanding. Child acting of this quality fills me with wonder. How can a girl of five be made to show such feeling, to behave so naturally and to express such meaning with voice and gesture? All possible praise is due to the director, Rene Clement,\nfor these wonderful performances. In the horrifying opening scenes, of the bomb-ing of refugees. Paulette is not shown as a petrified yelling child( how easy that would have\nbeen) but as apathetic, bewildered girl, stunned by the di aster that has overcome her family and clinging longingly to her puppy, even when it is dead. It is in this opening scene that we see for the first time an action that is to be often repeated; Paulette lightly touching a dead face then\" torching her own to feel its warmth.\nThe growth of the friendship between Michael and Paulette Is shown with great tenderness and warm humour. Such scenes as the one showing mej ha el comforting Paulette on her first night in t ne farm an a of the children in cn urc n,w l de eye a counting, the crosses, will long be remembered by the writer. In the children's scenes particularly Rene Clement makes considerable and very effective use of close up. Paulette^ s face has a radiance that is in remarkable contrast to the gloom of the farmhouse. In other scenes also the director shows a mastery of this technique, as in the view of the heavy lips and unshaven Jaw of the priest in the Confession. The children's dialogue has an ingenuous simplicity which is delightful even to an Englishman, and Paulette calling out\" Michael\", is a sound heard often in the film and which still rings in the ears long after leaving the cinema. yet the children alone do not make this a great film; all the performances are faultless. The director using these actors creates a startling picture of the squalid French peasant life. The\nfilth of the farmhouse and the people in it is unbelievable. Can it really be like that? But that is a question that will certainly not bother you while you are enjoying the film. \u201e\nDODD ODD Da no \u2022\nO POP ano 0 0 0\na dddd a nao ooo on an an a capac \u2022 ODD D80 DOO Q0 non onna aad aaaa no DDDD an an a apo THE SPRING CONCERT\nl.C.

EATING AROUND I.C The High Street area is very well served by numerous good restaurants and snack bars. Some of them are deceptive and seem innocent enough till you look at the bill, but many are quite reasonable. It's a good place for lunch too, if you have along lunch hour, or don't want to attend a General Studies meeting. The \" Black& White\" cafe is near the Air Station, on the opposite side. It serves good food( soup6 d and Cd, fish and chips l/8d or so) and very good coffee(6 d). There is the usual nac k baras well as some tables and chairs. A very pleasant place. On the opposite northside of the road, two shops beyond Smiths' is the Majestic Restaurant, which is never empty but rarely crowded. Service is quick. A set3 course lunch can be had for3/6d. Also a la carte. Hear erI.C.., the Slater' s Store and Restaurant is a place to recommend. It is a very large restaurant with waitress service and surprisingly efficient. A3 course lunch\nfor2/9d offers a wide range of main dishes to choose from. The food is of the usual mass production standard, but we've got, used to that anyway.\nTHIS WEEK'S SPECIAL.\nTake a walk to S. Ken. and along Pelham St.( cut through opposite Brompton Oratory); just after the traffic lights is Vi's Cosy Cafe. Here you can\nget hot or cold lunch and mince pie or pudding for2/2d. Do not be put off by the crowded tables of cab men downstairs, but collect your lunch and go\nupstairs where there is plenty of room.\nThe quantity of food at vi's vastly exceeds that\nat the College refectories and it is certainly not\ninferior in quality. Only in the decor may Vi'e be\nsaid to be inferior. Most people who try it find tno y can tolerate this when they see the thick slices of meat on their plate.

Such is an essential\nfeature of a system which expects all candidates to ait\na common examination.\nA rigid syllabus is a serious handicap to a good\nteacher and a constant sour oe of worry to the e onee ien tio u a. Adherence to a strictly prescribed programme\nresults in stereotyped lessons in which personal enthusiasm and \"feeling\" for the subject are often lacking-It accounts for those types of text-books which appear\nto be nothing more than suitably expanded copies of the\nsyllabus and give one the impression that herein lies\nthe sum total of knowledge of the subject. Such books,\nonce memorised, guarantee a fairly good pass in the appropriate London examination. Thus, memory becomes a substitute for understanding, a fact well-known to tha\ncorrespondence colleges.\nThe examiner is similarly hampered by thi a need for\nuniformity, and unimaginative questions result which\nreappear, with alight modifications, from year to year -a boon to desperate candidates but not really in the tine\nspirit of scholarship. Apart from all else, tha syllabus\nis always out of date. ,\nDespite this evil, the external degree is an excellent\ninstitution.

    "content": "2 0 th FEBRUARY1953. IMPERIAL COLLEGE U.L t DEBATE MISCARRIES, Debaters In the U.L. Hut,on 6 th February\ndecided that \"This House Approves of Legalized Abortion\", by 80 votes to 8;\nBart's Hospital Proposed, and they dropped\na bomb among the sensation and scandal seekers\nby declaring that \"approves\" is in the present\ntense, and that they, in common with most doctors,\nthoroughly approved of the current legality ef\nmedically necessary abortion.' There were 700,000\nbirths in England and Wales in1950. As one in five or six pregnancies is not held, this makes\nthe number of abortions between 100,000 and 150,000\na year, about 30% of which were believed to be\ncriminal,90% of these being in married'women.\nThe speakers from Bart's condemned all those\nforms of abortion which are at the moment illegal. Bedford College Opposed. They had arrived prepared for a defence of all kinds of abortion by\nthe doo tors, so naturally enough their guns were\nrather badly spiked Their min points concerned\nthe ln or ease in promiscuity which legal protection of abortion would produce, and also the religious( especially Roman Catholic) harm resulting from\nthe destruction of an uno hr is ten ed Infant. The\nghost of the old\" Child or Mother?\" controversy\nore pt in here, and produced a selection of the\nusual oom ment s. The Bedford opposition, after stressing the dreadful consequences of women making a habit of legalized abortion, shocked the\nHouse by asking for sterilization of mental deficient s. Speakers \"from t ne floor were indignant about\nthe way in which the motion had been twisted. It\nwas pointed out that the current practice of not\nprosecuting a doctor who performs a medically neo-- ,\ness ary abortion rests, not on Law, but only on a precedent. Thus, current Law Is unworkable:\nreason enough for altering it. A more practical speaker quoted some approximate statistics:1 death in every 87 abortions in U.S.A., where it is illegal; one in10,000 in U.S.S.R., where it is State sanctioned.\ncontinued in next \u2122tum i Another speaker asked for legal is ation in eases\nwhe*e the production of the child would be unhealthy\nto society( poverty,disease).but stressed that a line should De a raw n some w ne re. Then, a spiritual descended of Shelley stood\nup. Shelley s are rare enough, even among students,\nin these days of disillusionment, and this one\nbrought a touch of true sense and purpose to a debate which was being conducted on a suffocating moral plane. \" Shelley\" said: promiscuity is high. Very many children are conceived out of\nwedlock. Legalized abortion would be a smaller\nevil than the dreadful convention of enforced marr i age in such oases. Undesired children should\nnot be brought into the world; there is not the\nright atmosphere for them. Also, it is well-known\nthat abortion can be obtained by those who can pay\nwell. Why not make lt democratic? As for the\nreligious, they could act according to their principles without interfering with other people.\nAnother speaker, a woman, suggested that the\nproblem concerned only women. It was unfair that any decision should rest with men. The establish ment of legal abortion would be a further step\ntowards the Emancipation of Women.\nSumming up, the Bedford o a seo ou ld be stated in terms of the well-known Commandment: Thou shalt not kl j.1. Bart's Bald that current legal practice was sufficient as a solution of the problem.\nThough the speaker was all for free love ( cheers), w lt n due precautions, he wanted no cn ange in Law.\nThe Debate was most unsatisfactory. While\nthe Floor had no doubt about the meaning of the\nMotion, the Proposition refused to accept lt in the\nobvious sense The Motion should have read \"This\nHouse would Approve of Legalized Abortion\", thus\nallowing the doctors no loopholes to creep Into a restricted department about which there is little controversy in any case. U.L. ought to frame Its Motions a little more carefully in future. CANVEY ISLAND\nImperial College, in common with other Colleges in\nU.L., sent working parties to Canvey Island throughout the\nperiod preceding the second expected flooding. The Gliding\nClub truck carried the volunteers each day. The work con-c is ted largely of sandbag filling, either at the Wall, wit*\nmud, or at the Red Cow, with sand. Sandbags also were\n.carried to the Wall, as shown in the photograph above. The\nimp r jess ions gained by a FELIX pe porter appear on the sport\npage.\nThe thanks of the Editor are due to J. Rotgaus and\nJ. A. Barlow, who sent\u00bb us photographs of Canvey Island.\nAlso to J.B. Andrews who worked overtime to ensure that\none would be available for printing. R.C.S. CARNIVAL. A criticism of an I.C. Carnival must be professional\nin _\u00bbs acuteness for it to be of any use at all;> for\nCarnivals have reached a peak which is only insulted by\nthe usual type of kind, considerate I.C. comment.\nThe decoration aimed far higher than that us q fi by\nGuilds; but it came off worse. There was an impression\nof discontinuity in the Gym - a set of br ll lf s nt individual pieces, each complete, but leaving so a ie thing to be\ndesired in the gaps between. The Green Lady \"Amanda\" *n the upper Dining Hall, was frankly pornographic, though\nthe writer personally was not shocked by it. An \"Evening\nStandard\" write-up of the occasion described the dancing\nas occur ing in \"sulphur fumes\". While this is not more\naccurate than the usual standard of the popular press, th'\natmosphere, reflected in a variety of hideous costumes, w le rta in ly reminiscent of Hades.\nThe Cabaret, an ambitious affair, was largely ruin e by the efforts of some noisy gentlemen, who had drifted \u2022\nfrom the Bar without tickets, and who so disgusting con duc is dealt with further in the Editorial\nA recent report by the Royal College oi Physicians indicates that London and Oxford are outstanding among British Universities for their poor student health facilities. University College, London is said to have a fine scheme\nwhich could be studied with advantage by other establishment s.I.C. is described, in the Editorial of the Times, as having a \"modest\"\nhealth service. Other colleges area good\ndeal worse. CAMBRIDGE The Council of the Association of University\nTeachers has condemned the practice of students\nspending prolonged periods in v;or k unconnected with\ntheir studies.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE EDTTORiA.R. BHAY CIRCULATION: 1250\nOur General Studies Survey has brought a clear reply\nfr or a the Union. The experiment has, succeeded. It is now\nan in d is pensi ble feature in the education of the College.\nAll power to the elbows of those who run it! A correspondent asks for\" a newspaper worthy of\nImperial College . . . decently printed on good quality\npaper.\"\nIt should be realised that, up to now, FELIX has\npaid his own way, with the aid of an occasional dance.\nThis is, we believe, a record unique among the London\nUniversity newspapers, except for a few small, duplicated\nones with circulations a tenth of ours. If we graduate I to newsprint and type, the bill would have to be paid by\nthe Union funds available for other uses\n.... The abominable conduct of certain well-known gentlemen\nduring the Carnival Cabaret is deplored by FELIX. It is widely realized that a tremendous amount of work goes into\nthe planning and production of a Carnival. But those louts seemed to be unaware of this. They inflicted their coarse\nand sottish habits on a crowd of revellers who were waiting to hear, not the spontaneous senility of these brutes, but\nthe carefully prepared entertain nen i provided by more tasteful artists on the stage. The moral, R.C.S., is to have\nchuck ers out.\nIn direct contrast, the exploits of the Union at\n3an vey Island must have earned us a good name. V.'e heard\nthat, prior to the students going to Cenvey, there had been\ntalk about the \"black l eggers\" who are always ready to help\nout during a strike. This impression of students, common\nenough outside, must surely ho.ve been eradicated n cu The\ntroops also ware glad to have us there, though they put it more bluntly, though obliquely ( i.e. they refrained from\ncalling us \u2014 to our faces Those of I.C. who vent do vai more than once deserve a medal.\nMobody has yet come forward to tell us how it came\nabout that I.C. was libelled in the film \"Lost Hours\". Ha\nour outcry been conveniently ignored by the person responsible? There are still plenty of vacancies for ro porters and writers on the staff of FELIX. Future coverage will involve accounts of the Duke's visit, which we are anxious\nto describe accurately. We also require people to sell FELIX.\nThe Production Department's work falls on\nalternate Sundays. The work is mainly done in the afternoon, and includes typing, checking typed articles and cutting them to size, stencilling headlines, and arranging the material on each page make-up for photographing. No\nexperience is necessary for this though illustrators and skilled ty ois ts are always in demand\nbut a larger staff is heeded so that no person will be overworked. FELIX notice sap Dear on the Phoenix board in the Union, and on this a production rota is placed each fortnight. Those interested are asked either to sign for a particular shift, or to write to th v Editor, or to come along to one\nof the Board meetings, held each Monday at1.15 p.m. in Committee Room 'A' The Education and Training of ah Engineer\nOn Thursday January 20th Brig. A.C. Hughes C.B.E., M.I.C.E., the Chief Surveyor for the County of Hampshire,\nvisited Guilds and gave a lecture entitled \"The Education\nand Training of an Engineer\" to the Engineering Society.\nAs Brig. Hughes is also a member of the Council of\nthe University of Southampton, he was in close touch with\nthe problem and gave a very interesting and provoking\nlecture. He felt that most Universities spent too much time\non subjects which could be left out of the syllabus.\nGiven a sound mathematical education, the engineer could\nlearn about these as he required them. The speaker\nstressed the importance of engineering reports and said\nthat far too few graduates were capable of writing a clear\nand lucid report.\nBrig. Hughes believed that insufficient guidance\nwas given to the student by the staff to help him select\nthe branch of engineering for which he was most fit. Also he deplored the ignorance of most members of a college\nstaff of the requirements of the nr j or engineering Institutions, with the result that the student was ill-equipped\nfor membership.\nHe considered that personality was nore important\nthan anything else when applying for a job, and that in the first few years, the young engineer should hold several\njobs in order that he should obtain a wide experience.\nPMAGEACM\nA very long lane with remarkable few turnings is the\nsubway from South Ken. station to South Ken. Post Office.. It can be the dreariest of trudges at 5.15 on a winter's evening, or like one of those nightmare tunnels you have to\nrun, run, run for ever along in an Alice' s 'Wonderland or\nDr. Caligari' s Fantasie welt at 9.57 on a winter's morning.\nIt is conventional in these semi-documentary features to\ngive masses of Fax and Figures. But you won't want to hear\nhow long it is, or how many of those bleak, brown veined\nrh it e tiles it has; if you have any interest in these, you\nshould try counting sometime. It will relieve the oppressive monotony. But I must say here that it take s3 minutes\n42 seconds to walk from the Post Office to the Gents at South\nKen., and 3 minutes 56 seconds to walk from the Gents to the\nPost Office. The discrepancy is, of course, due to the\nrotation and the elliptic it y, of the earth.\n' Felix1 is at present engaged on research into the past\nhistory of the tunnel, and Security prohibits more than a hint that there was once more to it than now meets the eye.\nHowever, enigmas of the tunnel are legion. I often ponder\non the reason for changing from a circular sectioned roof to\na square tunnel. Which leads us to consider the square\ntunnel - these little bro-.v n printed numbers by each of the\niron arches. Why are they there at all? Is it just evidence of Civil Service minds vd th their inborn tendency for cataloguing? (The mind which will impartially stamp \"plant\nnumber A12739\" on a five shilling box of weights and \"plant\nnumber A1SJ74C\" on an electron microscope.) I think that somewhere in London transport archives there is a table something like this. TYPE DESCRIPTION SERIAL LOCATION INI- DATE\nNO. \"0.

Kensington 5/6/1850\npassenger\nsubway\nHow do the little ferns that grow in t new in dow frames alongside the Natural History museum\nsurvive; where did they come from? I believe they have arisen from fossilised spores which got tired of sitting fossilised in the museum, and\nwere carried away in the breezes of Kensington. I am sure that the little man who lives in the one\nroomed basement flat along the tunnel goes along and waters them all after he has locked up them trances. It is quite apathetic thought really; the little bowed figure, scorned by the world, and\nLiving only for his Tunnel and his Ferns, plods down with his oil lamp and waters each little fern from the cracked Dresden teapot that the V. and A. porter gave him. Incidentally, why do they never open the gates on to the steps that lead to the U at ural History Museum? Never opened gates al ways give me the same sad feeling as do overgrown disused railways and abandoned mine workings. But the craziest thing about our tunnel is that Cromwell Road exit. If you are unprepared,/ ou take ONE STEP off the top of the stairs\" and\nyou' re in the middle of the traffic, if not under a bus. You are precipitated into the street, without even the refuge of two square feet of traffic island for security. Your immediate reaction is to cling to that wonderful lamp post for safety. The shock may not be too bad for tough undergraduates, but we should think of the old Folks and the Children, you know. . . . B.R. s. RADIO SOC.
