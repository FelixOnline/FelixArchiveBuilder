If\nyou\u2019re looking for an easy way to get\npeople to drink, look no further than\nthe old classics: fuck buddies, and one\nnight stands.\n53% of students have had a one\nnight stand, with the males proving\nmore likely to love \u2018em and leave\n\u2018em (or at least claim they had). 55%\nof males said they\u2019d had a one night\nstand, while 50% of females said the\nsame.\nFuck buddies (or \u2018friends with\nbenefits\u2019, for those of you who\nprefer your no strings attached\nsex to come with a dash of the ol\u2019\ncoyness) are almost as popular, with\n44% admitting they\u2019d been in an\narrangement. It\u2019s an exactly equal\ndivide across the genders, with the\nsame percentage of males and females\n\u2018fessing up to getting all of the fun\nwith none of the consequences. You\nsex-loving commitment-phobes, you.\nThere\u2019s also plenty on just how\npeople wanted their sex to play out,\nwith students giving opinions on\na veritable smorgasbord of sexual\nacts. Oral sex ranked at the top of\neveryone\u2019s list of favourite acts,\nwith 70% liking giving it (and 11%\nwanting to try giving), and 77% liking\nreceiving (and another 10% wanting\nto try that). Pretty much all of you\nlike oral sex, it seems, so bear that\none in mind next time you indulge\nin pleasures of the flesh. Felix: giving\nyou sex tips since whenever we started\ndoing this survey.\nNothing else quite matched up:\n55% liked receiving hand jobs (but\nonly 40% liked giving them, so\nsomeone\u2019s going to be disappointed).\n38% liked being fingered, but only\n18% liked doing the fingering (pull\nyour finger out and get over yourself,\nit\u2019s what the lady likes). Anal sex\nproved even less popular: 25% liked\ngiving (and another 21% want to\ntry), but only 12% like receiving it.\nLot of discrepancies in this giving/\nreceiving business. Sex: it\u2019s all about\ncompromise.\nIt\u2019s also about more than the\nusual, for some of you at least. 11%\nof students enjoy a good threesome,\nwhile 5% like going one step further\ninto a full-blown orgy. 44% want to\ntry a threesome, while 23% want to\ntry an orgy. We\u2019d suggest you all just\nhook up, but the survey\u2019s anonymous.\nWe have no idea who you are.\nBeyond that, 28% like using\nrestraints in sex, while 30% like\nusing sex toys. Role play is approved\nof by 18%, while sexting makes an\nappearance with a 46% like-rate.\nSending explicit images is liked by\n32%. Meaning two-thirds of you don\u2019t\nlike dick pics. Stop. Stop the dick pics.\nAs to where that sex, regardless\nof the relationship status of the\nparticipants, might be happening,\nturns out several students have been\ngetting busy on campus (halls not\nincluded). 16% said they\u2019d had sex\nsomewhere on an Imperial campus,\nincluding Silwood Park, with 7% of\nthose who\u2019d done the dirty on campus\ndoing said dirty there.\n15% of campus sexy-times\nhappened in SAF (medics!), and yet\nnone happened in the Reynolds\nBuilding over at Charing Cross\nHospital (try harder, medics). 23%\nof campus sexers threw down in\nBeit Quad, while 28% got it on in\nthe Union Offices. It\u2019s an open-plan\noffice, guys. You\u2019re disgusting. Not as\ndisgusting as the 1% who indulged in\ncarnal embrace in Eastside Bar, but\nstill pretty disgusting.\nRanking at the other end of the\nscale, 1% claimed to have done\nit in the underground tunnels (a\nquestion which has spurred a host of\nwannabes, clamouring to copulate\nbelow the surface). No-one (claimed\nto have) sexed it up in the Ethos\npool (thank God), or in the Bessemer\nbuilding. The prize for biggest\ndisappointment goes to the Bone\nbuilding, which despite having an\nobvious innuendo for a name hosted\nprecisely zero fun-loving couples. To\nall Imperial students: please bone in\nthe Bone building. Then tell Felix. It\u2019s\nimportant. Do it for science.\nOn brand.

This\ntime 6% of you did not wish to say\nwhen you were last tested.\nWe also asked you all where you\u2019re\ngetting sex and masturbation tips\nfrom. The biggest information source\nthis year was the internet, with 61% of\nyou getting tips \u201conline\u201d.\n49% of respondents say they take\nadvice from their partner and 37%\nfrom friends. Porn was the next\nbiggest category, with 29% of you\nadmitting to sourcing your ideas\nfrom the stuff.\nJust 11% of students get sex tips\nfrom books (maybe we should\u2019ve\nasked you about 50 Shades Of Gray\nseparately), 9% from movies and\nmagazines and 2% from \u201cother\nsources\u201d.\n14% of you apparently \u201cstill don\u2019t\nknow anything lol\u201d. Maybe you can\nget some tips from the sex survey?\nWe gave you a chance to tell us\nwhat those \u201cother sources\u201d were\nin a text box. Most of you just said\n\u201cexperimentation\u201d or \u201cmy own\nimagination\u201d, and at least one\nclaimed to have \u201clearnt on the job\u201d.\nTwo of you said you\u2019re getting sex\ntips from \u201cyour mum\u201d \u2013 very original\nguys \u2013 and one claims to get them\nfrom \u201cthe Rector\u201d.\nSo whatever you\u2019re doing and\nwherever you\u2019re getting the idea\nfrom, do us a favour and get tested\nonce in a while, yeah?\nCecily Johnson finds out how much you remember from sex ed\n\n"

Despite its flaws and the\nneed for reform, arguments favouring\nthe economic benefits have come\nfrom major organisations such as the\nConfederation of British Industry .\nThe opposition to \u2018Brexit\u2019 has also\ncome from key figures in British\nscience, who have argued against\ncutting our ties with the research\npowerhouses on the continent.\nWhatever you might think about\nthe EU, it remains undeniable\nthat \u2018Brexit\u2019 would have profound\nconsequences across almost every\naspect of life in our country, and that\nincludes science and technology.\nTo us at Imperial at least, probably\nthe most obvious effect the EU has\nis in encouraging large numbers of\nEuropean students and researchers\nto work and study in other countries\nthrough programmes like Erasmus.\nLast year 25,000 Erasmus students\nstudied in the UK, and more than\n15,000 British students studied in\nother European countries. According\nto HESA, there were 125,000 EU\nstudents in the UK in 2013/14\ncompared to nearly 300,000 from\noutside the EU. It seems the tougher\nimmigration rules for non-EU\nmigrants don\u2019t act as a deterrent.\nMike Galsworthy, a visiting\nresearcher at LSHTM, has started\n\u2018Scientists4EU\u2019, a campaign to\npromote the role the EU plays\nin British science. It has already\nattracted support from key names\nincluding Nobel Laureate Sir Paul\nNurse, and Astronomer Royal Lord\nRees, former President of the Royal\nSociety.\nGalsworthy expects that, in the\nevent of \u2018Brexit\u2019, key benefits from\nmembership could be put at risk by\nchanges to immigration policy.\n\u201cThis is where the Swiss are now,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cThey used to buy into the\nEU science programmes and do\nextremely well from them. But then\nby a slim margin they decided on\ntougher anti-immigration rules.\n\u201cWithout free flow of people, they\ncould not participate in Erasmus\nand major parts of Horizon 2020\nfunding because allowing Swiss free\nmovement anywhere in the EU, but\nEU students and researchers limited\nentry into Switzerland, clashes with\nthe whole ethos of those programmes.\nThis has caused Swiss science huge\nheadaches that they are scrambling to\ndeal with now.\u201d\nScience is one of the few areas in\nwhich the UK gets a disproportionate\nshare of EU funding, amounting to\nover a billion euros between 2007 and\n2014. This is because it is allocated\non excellence, and science is an area\nBritain truly excels at. It remains\nthe case, however, that in total, the\nUK pays more money into the EU\nthan it receives in direct subsidies.\nUKIP argue that this money could be\nredistributed, giving more funding to\nmany areas, including research.\n\u201cThat money would have a lot less\nvalue when UK is not at the centre of\nthe world\u2019s largest scientific engine,\u201d\nsays Galsworthy. \u201cThe EU\u2019s scientific\noutput is 20% higher than the US and\nEurope is becoming a global brand\nin how you do multi-national \u2018big\u2019\nscience. Leaving the EU would reduce\nthe power of our institutions to set\nglobal agendas. UK science reputation\nand power would start to wane.\u201d\nOne of the major arguments in\nfavour of an EU exit made by UKIP\nhas been that it would lift stifling\nregulations imposed on British\nindustry by people in Brussels. UKIP\ndoesn\u2019t have a science spokesperson,\nbut when asked about its science\npolicy by the Campaign for Science\nand Engineering, they argued\nthat \u2018Brexit\u2019 would benefit British\nscience by cutting these unnecessary\nregulations.\n\u201cIn our opinion, [regulations] have\nbeen unnecessarily restrictive when it\ncomes to research and have hampered\nsmaller-scale research projects which\ncannot get off the ground because of\nthe cost of the weight of regulation\nthey will have to comply with. I\ngive by way of example the Clinical\nTrials Directive. This was intended\nto simplify and harmonise clinical\ntrials across the EU, but has in fact\ndecimated the number of clinical\ntrials in Britain.\u201d\nGalsworthy, however, disagrees\nwith the notion that EU bureaucracy\nis stifling progress in science.\n\u201cI can actually think of more UK\ngovernment science policy aspects\nthat need reforming than European\nCommission ones! The relationship\nbetween UK scientists and the\nCommission is very good. When\nJunker booted out the position of the\nChief Scientific Adviser (a Brit, Anne\nGlover) with little warning, there\nwas outcry from our community.\nNegotiations were had and we now\nhave a seven-member scientific\nadvisory panel that actually looks like\na much more sensible structure.\u201d\nThis is an extremely complex\ndebate that requires an informed,\ndetailed understanding of a huge\nrange of issues. The effect of a \u2018Brexit\u2019\nwould extend far beyond people\u2019s\nmost common gripe, immigration,\nthrough to areas including healthcare,\nforeign affairs and education.\nScience will not be the most\nimportant topic in the referendum\ncampaign. But the importance of\nlarge-scale, international research\nis much greater than many people\nrealise, enhancing medicine and\nthe energy industry, on top of the\neconomic benefits that trickle down\nfrom academia.\nCould we still lead the world with\nwell funded and effective research\nfrom outside the EU?\n\"UK science\nreputation\nand power\nwould start\nto wane\"\n\"UK science\nreceived\nover a\nbillion euros\nin funding\nfrom the\nEU between\n2007 and\n2014\"\nNobel laureate Sir Paul Nurse (right) has added his voice to calls for the UK to stay in the EU Photo: flickr\n\n"

The survey was\nfirst launched back in 2011, with\nthe findings released as part of the\ncoverage to coincide with Valentine\u2019s\nday. Nowadays the survey has taken\non a role of its own as part of Felix and\nthis year is no exception.\nWe ran the survey over the course\nof last term, and collected data about\nyour preferences, your kinks, your\nconcerns and, for the adventurous\nfew, wherabouts on campus you\u2019ve\ndone the deed.\nWe had a great response this year\nwith nearly 600 students sharing all\ntheir sex secrets. This year we have\nalso investigated the romantic lives\nof those at Imperial, along with the\nusual questions concerning your bits\nand bobs and everything inbetween.\nIt was most interesting to note, as\nit is every year, that in general most\npeople seem to be pretty happy with\ntheir sex lives, regardless of how\nmuch they may or may not be getting.\nAfter the doom and gloom of the\nMentality survey last week, this data\nwas a lot more pleasant to analyse,\ndiscuss and dissect.\nThe coverage would not have been\npossible without the hours put in by\nCecily Johnson, Jack Steadman, Nick\nFarmer and Ben Howitt poring over\nyour responses and finding out just\nwhat makes you tick (or not as the\ncase may be for certain acts). Thanks\nto Diba Esbati for collecting content\nfrom the LGBT+ community, and\nother members of the team who have\nlent a hand when putting together\nideas for the coverage on the whole.\nThe survey itself would not be\npossible if it not were for Philip Kent\nwho ran the technical side of the\noperation, alongside the rest of the\nFelix team who contributed to the\nbrainstorming session beforehand\ndiscussing what we wanted to find\nout this year. Also thanks to everyone\nwho shared the survey online.\nBut finally this data was only\npossible due to you, the readers,\ntaking the time out to fill our long\nand sometimes scary survey in.

Recently,\nthis idea has become more popular.\nRamy Aziz, a microbiologist from\nthe Faculty of Pharmacy at Cairo\nUniversity explains how the current\nresearch into pharmacogenomics (the\nstudy of how variations in human\ngenes contribute to individual\ndifferences in drug metabolism\nand effectiveness) may change the\nway drugs will be developed in the\nfuture: \u201cYou can give two people the\nsame drug and they will respond\ndifferently. And it\u2019s not because\nof their genes but the genes of the\nmicrobes they carry\u201d.\nThis concept is illustrated\nbeautifully by the gut bacterium E.\nlenta, which can inactivate digoxin,\na drug commonly used for patients\nwith cardiac abnormalities.\nScientists have identified a pair\nof genes, within the bacteria called\nthe cgr operon, that are responsible\nfor metabolising digoxin. People in\nwhom a high proportion of the E.\nlenta in their gut carry the cgr operon\nare able to largely inactivate the\ndrug, whilst digoxin keeps working\nin patients whose E. lenta strains lack\nthe gene.\nPeter Turnbaugh, a microbiologist\nfrom the University of California, and\ncolleagues are currently investigating\nhow to augment to response of cgr-operon positive E. lenta on digoxin.\nIt seems that the operon activity is\nreduced in the presence of the amino\nacid arginine. This was discovered\nby the researchers in mice colonised\nwith E. lenta that were fed a high-protein diet and were found to have\nhigher blood digoxin levels compared\nto those put on a protein-free diet.\nFurther trials involving arginine\nsupplementation alone are awaited.\nIrinotecan is another popular\ndrug, used in chemotherapy for\nUTSAV RADIA\nSCIENCE WRITER\npatients with colon cancer. However,\nit has many serious side effects\nincluding diarrhoea and severe\nimmunosuppression.\nOnce Irinotecan, has been processed\nin the liver, the drug is deactivated\nand excreted via bile. It then follows\nback into the gastrointestinal tract,\nwhere a vast majority of the microbes\nin the gut can re-activate the drug.\nThis is due to an enzyme called\nbeta-glucoronidase produced by the\nmicrobes.\nA team of researchers in the\nUniversity of North Carolina have\nbeen investigating the use of beta-glucoronidase inhibitors in managing\nirinotecan-induced diarrhoea.\nSurprisingly, they have also found\nthat blocking beta-glucoronidase in\nthe microbiome not only helps to\nreduce the inactivation-reactivation\nof irinotecan (in a process known as\nenterohepatic cycling), but this also\napplies to commonly used drugs such\nas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs (commonly used painkillers\nsuch as aspirin and ibuprofen)\nthat can otherwise produce serious\ngastrointestinal tract ulceration.\nTargeting the beta-glucoronidase\npathway seems an exciting new\ncornerstone in drug designing and\ndevelopment as we can now control\nthe effects of drugs by altering how\nout gut flora responds to them.\nHopefully, it won\u2019t be long before\nwe can widely implement the use\nof beta-glucoronidase inhibitors in\nalleviating the side effects of many\ndrugs by reducing their persistence in\nthe body.\nNew research has uncovered how gut bacteria can cause some drugs to become ineffective Photo: Wikimedia\nCommons\nMADDIE WEBB\nSCIENCE WRITER\n\n"

Photo: GENEQ\nThe Felix Sex Survey found\nthat 9 of the respondents do\nnot identify with the gender\nthey were assigned at birth. A third\nof those respondents said they were\nunhappy with their sex life, and a few\ncommented about the issues they face\nas transgender individuals.\nSome cited difficulty in finding\npartners, being in transition between\ngenders and generally struggling with\nbeing assigned a different gender at\nbirth that they don\u2019t identify with.\nOne respondent worryingly said that\nthey were suicidal, and said that they\nhated the life they were living.\nSaid another respondent: \u201cSince\nsplitting with my last partner, I\u2019ve\ncome to think having any sort of sex\nlife is probably unrealistic until I\u2019ve\nhad surgery.\n\u201cI can live with this, but the matter\nof sex being so intertwined with\nthe broader topic of relationships,\nmeans inevitably my situation is an\nimpediment to dating, which I think\nbothers me more.\u201d\nSaid another: \u201cI hate being\ntransgender. My sex drive confuses\nme. All I want is to live as a girl, have\nbreasts and a vagina and fall in love\nwith someone that I\u2019m comfortable\nbeing intimate with. I can\u2019t though.\n\u201cI have to live as a boy and it hurts\nevery day. I try to tune out thoughts\nrelated to falling in love because who\nwants to be with a transgender girl\nwho doesn\u2019t have a vagina or a female\nvoice?\n\u201cI hear stories of people falling in\nlove and being intimate with one\nanother. This just feels like something\nI can never have.\u201d\nWe decided to talk to some of the\nmembers of Imperial\u2019s wider LGBT+\ncommunity. Felix\u2019s own Welfare\neditor, Diba Esbati, spoke to two\nstudents who shared their experiences\nabout being transgender or dating\nthose that identify as transgender too.\nOne student told us about the\ntransgender woman who they are\ncurrently dating: \u201cI am happily in\na relationship with a wonderful\nwoman. She is incredibly clever, has\ngorgeous eyes and is possibly the most\namazing person I have ever met.\u201d\nThey explained that their partner\nmay not decide to come out as\ntransgender or even transition\ncompletely, but they are committed\nto supporting her regardless. They\nalso explained that just like any other\nrelationship, communication is key.\n\u201cWe must discuss and be aware of\neach others\u2019 boundaries, and adjust\nour activities according to the various\nlevels of dysphoria my partner is\nexperiencing.\n\u201cMy partner sometimes has a\ncomplex response to her own arousal\nor her body and while this definitely\nchanges the way our relationship\ndynamic functions, it does not make\nit inherently more difficult.\n\u201cIt simply requires an increased\nlevel of awareness of how comfortable\nmy partner is with any one thing we\nare doing together.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cAnd another, final\nthing that I feel is important; while\nmy partner is not out, she is still very\nmuch a woman to me. She is beautiful\nand kind.\n\u201cWhen she is feeling particularly\nconflicted or experiencing very bad\ndysphoria all I can do is try and love\nher through it and help prevent her\nand myself from breaking because of\nthe pain.\u201d\nSkye, an Imperial student who\nis openly transgender, spoke to\nFelix about how difficult it can be\nto identify as such, but how others\nshould embrace their uniqueness: \u201cNo\ntwo people are identical and people\nbeing different to each other makes\nhumanity as a larger entity all the\nbetter for it.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t hate yourself for being\ntransgender. Be happy that you found\nsomething that helps to define who\nyou are, thus you know yourself\nbetter and are stronger for having\nfound that aspect of yourself.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a life-ender and there are\nways to help you become who you\nview yourself to be, and who you want\nto be.\u201d\nSkye advised that anyone struggling\nshould seek advice as soon as\npossible, either from the Imperial\ncounselling service in the short term,\nand potentially visiting a dedicated\nspecialist at a Gender Identity Clinic\n(GIC) in the long term.\nSkye concluded: \u201cThere is no real\nreason why anyone can\u2019t have love\nand meet the right person at some\npoint in their life, regardless of who\nthey are or what gender they identify\nas.\u201d\nBoth students we spoke to had\ncomments for those who responded\nto the sex survey, and both stressed\nthat those out there are not alone.\nThe anonymous student who\nis dating a transgender woman\nexplained the importance of\nsupporting those who may be\nstruggling to come to terms with\ntheir gender identity: \u201cAcceptance,\ncommunication and reassurance of\ntheir validity cannot be given too\nmuch.\n\u201cYour support \u2013 even in something\nas little as remembering to use their\npreferred pronouns or as large as\nstanding by them as they decide\nto come out \u2013is invaluable and\nappreciated.\u201d\nSaid Skye: \u201cBeing trans is not\nexactly a gift at first glance, but\nmatters are getting better \u2013 trans\nvisibility is so, so much better than it\nhas been even recently and there are\nactual wonderful trans people making\ntheir way into the public eye.\n\u201cLove and sex are hard. Really\nhard. And yup, dysphoria makes\nthe practicality tricky at times. But\nI promise that people exist who will\ncare about that in the right way.\nI promise you that these people\nexist, regardless of your personal\norientation with respect to partners.\n\u201cThe voice and other parts are nice,\nbut you\u2019re a girl, not a number on the\nPrader scale. You can still have the\npotential for love, just like anyone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful human.\u201d\nFor those who want to seek help or\nguidance in relation to any of the above\nissues, there are many support networks\nyou can access.\nFor example, the Beaumont Society\n(01582412220) offers 24h support and\nadvice for transgender people and their\nloved. Also, Mind OUT (lgbtmind.com)\nhas plenty of resources for all LGBT+\ncommunity who may be struggling with\nmental health concerns.\n\n"

In most modern power\nsystems, most electricity actually\ncomes from coal or gas power stations\nso this isn\u2019t a problem. In other\nwords, you combine the storability of\ncoal and gas with the transportability\nof electricity.\nBut what happens when you have to\nstop using these fuels because of CO2\nconstraints and replace them with\nrenewables that generate electricity\nintermittently, depending on whether\nthe sun is shining or the wind is\nblowing? In steps energy storage.\nAt a fundamental level, energy\nstorage absorbs excess electricity\nwhen there\u2019s too much on the grid\nand releases it when demand from\nconsumers outstrips supply. In\nessence, it\u2019s a very useful way to\n\u2018firm up\u2019 renewables and make them\nbehave more like power stations that\ncan produce electricity all the time.\nAs the world begins to wake up to\nthe need to decarbonise their power\nsystems, energy storage is beginning\nto play an ever bigger role.\nCalifornia Dreaming\nOne of the most important regions\nthat has started to recognise this value\nis California. The State has proven\nto be a hub of innovation for the\ntechnology, with companies like Tesla\nrecently moving into the domestic\nenergy storage industry with their\nshiny new Powerwall.\nLargely though, this recognition\nof energy storage is about\naccommodating intermittent\nrenewables onto the grid, driven by a\n\u2018Renewable Portfolio Standard\u2019 that\nrequires 33% of electricity sales to\ncome from renewables by 2020.\nAs a result, in October 2013, the\nState set utilities a target of installing\nenough energy storage to provide\n1.3GW of power by 2020, enough to\npower 1 million homes.\nTarget Acquired\nAs we\u2019ve already mentioned,\nenergy storage is incredibly useful\nat making renewable generation\nmore reliable. At the same time,\nsome storage technologies like\nbattery storage have traditionally\nbeen seen as too expensive. Indeed,\nmany organisations, including the\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA),\nhave acknowledged that costs must\nbe reduced for these technologies to\nbecome commercially attractive.\nIn 2013 however, the California\nPublic Utilities Commission\n(CPUC) challenged this position by\nperforming a series of cost-benefit\nanalyses finding that, \u2018the majority of\ncases returned benefit-to-cost ratios\nof greater than one, and the majority\nof cases returned breakeven capital\ncost of energy storage\u2019.\nThese evaluations were key in\nleading to California\u2019s target, with\nwider implications that \u2018energy\nstorage\u2019 and \u2018cost-effectiveness\u2019\nwere now being mentioned in the\nsame breath beyond discussions in\nacademic circles.\nSo Far so Good?\nHappier still, according to one\nsource from the California Energy\nCommission, the target will almost\ncertainly be met on time. Indeed,\nrecent studies have shown that the\nUS energy storage industry was worth\naround $2 billion last year, with much\nof this coming from California.\nGoing even further, as part of the\n1.3GW target, utility companies have\na series of mini-targets that require\nthem to procure a certain amount\nof storage year. For example, one\nutility, Southern California Edison\n(SCE), was required to procure\n50MW worth of storage for 2014.\nHowever, when SCE began tendering\nfor projects, it received over 500\nproposals and instead decided to\nprocure over 250MWworth of energy\nstorage.\nSuch examples are not uncommon,\nwith California\u2019s Independent System\nOperator (CAISO) reporting last\nyear that the number of proposals\nfor energy storage in fact amounted\nto around 2.1GW, well above the\noriginal target. While these projects\nultimately still have to be built,\nand not all may be approved, the\nindications from the market certainly\nsounds overwhelmingly positive.\nThis is perhaps embodied most\nrecently by the boundless enthusiasm\nand innovation shown by Tesla, who\nrecently revealed their new Lithiumion battery storage for domestic and\ncommercial properties. Combine this\nwith the construction of their new\n\u2018Gigafactory\u2019 \u2013 purpose-built to drive\ndown the cost of battery technology \u2013\nand the prospects for energy storage\nlook very good indeed.\nFortune Favours the Cheap\nThere are of course some small\ncaveats. For one thing, the term\nenergy storage is actually rather\nbroad, encompassing a range of\ndifferent technologies suitable to\ndifferent types of applications beyond\njust accommodating renewables.\nNecessarily, these different\ntechnologies also have a range of\ndifferent costs associated with them.\nWhilst this is not inherently a bad\nthing, there is perhaps a risk that\nthose more innovative technologies\nwhose capital costs are higher (and\ndon\u2019t have companies like Tesla\ndriving them downwards) will get\nedged out of the market by a target\nwhich demands cost-effectiveness.\nAn often cited example is that of\n\u2018metal-air\u2019 batteries that use a solid,\nrather than aqueous, membrane to\noffer a higher energy density. Though\nthe technology is more innovative,\nit is commercially immature. A\ntarget with a deadline for project\ncompletion by 2024 simply may not\nhave the patience required to see if\nsuch a technology could grow up.\nMore than an Experiment\nWith that said, the storage target in\nCalifornia still seems to be a fairly\nunqualified success. So much so in\nfact, that a Texan utility, Oncor, has\nrecently been considering investing\na whopping $5.2 billion into 5GW\nof energy storage. Whilst policy\nenthusiasm in the UK might be more\nsluggish, industry groups like the\nElectricity Storage Network (ESN)\nare now campaigning for a target of\n2GW by 2020, based on California\u2019s\nexperience.\nThe term \u2018emerging\u2019 market is\noften used pejoratively to describe\ninteresting technologies that are\nunlikely to reach any meaningful\nlevel of commercialisation. For many\nyears, energy storage has been given\nsuch a label. In light of California\u2019s\nsustained success, one might now say\nit has well and truly emerged.\nWind turbines in California. Energy storage could be crucial in allowing renewables to replace fossil fuels Photo: Wikimedia\nCommons\n\"The\nstorage\ntarget in\nCalifornia\nstill seems\nto be a\nfairly\nunqualified\nsuccess.\"\n\"California\nset utilities\na target of\ninstalling\n1.3GW of\nenergy\nstorage\nby 2020,\nenough\nto power\n1 million\nhomes.\"\n\n"

The project will add\n706 homes and two tower blocks to\nthe site close to the Thames.\nThe project had recently been put\non hold due to the General Election\nand fears of a property tax promised\nby Labour. However, with the\nConservatives in power, the project is\nnow underway with a completion date\nin 2019 \u2013 although the first homes\nare due to go on sale in the next few\nweeks.\nThe power station itself will\nbe home to a mix of apartments,\nshops and restaurants with its two\nremaining chimneys remaining in\nplace. The towers are 25 and 37 floors\nand the site will also feature a further\nseven buildings with three new\npedestrian bridges, a water garden\nand 600m of Thames-side footpath.\nThe redevelopment was designed\nby Sir Terry Farrell, responsible\nfor designing the iconic MI5\nheadquarters, and he has said that the\nprojection is not just about providing\nproperty to the very rich or for young\npeople who are renting: nearly 40 per\ncent of homes are to be sold below\ntheir current market value of which\nnearly half being four bedroom flats\ngoing for up to \u00a3400 a week.\nThe redevelopment will be making\nuse of the eight acres of land at\nthe Lots Road site including the\npreviously inaccessible Thames\ntowpath.

A\nsurprisingly high 46% of you are\nin an exclusive relationship at the\nmoment, and 8% are seeing someone\nbut \u201cnon-exclusively\u201d.\n4% are seeing multiple people (get\nyou), while 1% did not wish to say.\nSo as a group we seem to like our\nmonogamy, but do we love it?\nWe asked all of you \u201cwould you\nsay you are in love?\u201d and 37% of\nrespondents said yes. Most of you\nhaven\u2019t been hit by cupid\u2019s arrow\nthough, with 46% saying no. 3% did\nnot wish to answer this question.\nThe final 13% of students did not\nwish to say whether they are in love at\nthe moment, which is fair enough \u2013\nthese figures do include both those in\nrelationships and singletons.\nInterestingly, just 69% of those of\nyou in exclusive relationships feel\nthat you are in love. 12% answered\n\u201cno\u201d (ouch), and 14% said \u201cmaybe\u201d.\nThis time 5% did not wish to say.\nMaybe distance is getting in the way\nof things? Of those in relationships,\n30% of you are in long-distance\nrelationships, which we all know can\nbe hard.\nLooking closer to home though,\nwe asked \u201care you currently in\na relationship with an Imperial\nstudent\u201d and 47% of those who\nanswered the question said yes. 50%\nof you said no, and the remaining 3%\ndid not wish to say.\nOut of the total respondents,\nnot just those in relationships, we\nwondered whether you have ever been\nin a relationship with an Imperial\nstudent in the past \u2013 and only 32%\nsaid yes.\n66% of you have not dated within\nImperial (something wrong with us?\nNot good enough for you?) and 2%\ndid not wish to say (come on guys,\nit was a pretty straight question this\ntime!).\nSo where are those of you with an\nImperial boyfriend or girlfriend\nmeeting them? The most common\nplace was \u201cin halls\u201d, with 34% of\nyou picking up a partner on your\ndoorstep.\nWe were glad to see the next most\npopular was \u201cat a club/society/\nproject\u201d \u2013 apparently 22% of you are\nfinding time to reap the benefits of\nthose extracurricular activities.\nYour courses are also providing\nopportunities to meet people, with\n17% of respondents pairing up with\nsomeone from among their degree\ncoursemates.\n12% of you are meeting people\n\u201cvia friends\u201d (kudos to the wingmen/\nladies) and 4% at parties outside the\nUnion. Another 4% met their partner\nat the Union or a Union-hosted event.\nJust 2% of you found your\ngirlfriend or boyfriend on a dating\nor hookup service such as Tinder or\nOKCupid. Maybe they\u2019re just more\nsuited to one night stands?\nWe also asked which of these dating\napps and websites you\u2019re using. 53%\nof you claim to have never tried any\nof these kinds of services, but of those\nwho have given them a shot Tinder\nwas the clear favourite with 43% of\nrespondents having tried out the app.\nDespite only 8% of total\nrespondents identifying as\nhomosexual and 9% as bisexual, a\nwhopping 39% of you claim to have\nhad a play with Grindr.\n10% of students are on OKCupid\nand 6% have given Happn a go.\nAnother 8% of you have tried out\nother apps and sites that we did not\nmanage to list.\nOne thing Felix always likes to\nask you about is your relationships\nwith Hall Seniors. Out of all survey\nrespondents, 4% claim to have had a\nrelationship during first year with a\nSenior in their own hall and 1% dated\na Hall Senior from another hall.\nFinally, we asked you all about\ncheating. 74% of you say you\u2019ve never\ncheated on a partner (yay!) while 23%\nare admitting to it (boo!). As usual the\nlast 3% did not wish to say.\nOn the other side of the coin, 74%\nagain say that to their knowledge they\nhave not been cheated on themselves.\nJust 18% say they\u2019ve definitely been\ncheated on and a further 6% think it\nmay have happened but they aren\u2019t\nsure.\nSo there you have it, folks \u2013 seems\nlike plenty of you are doing pretty\nwell for yourselves. Thanks to all of\nyou for filling out the survey and do\ncome back next year with even more\nstories for our stats!\nDid you meet your partner at Imperial? Photo: University of Minnesota\n\n"

    "content": "12 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n05.06.2015\nWelfare\nfelix.welfare@imperial.ac.uk Welfare Editors Diba Esbati & Chanon Wongsatayanont\nMadeline and Vin present a guide\nto the terminology of sexual and\ngender identity\nConcepts at a glance:\nGender and Sexuality\nWhen discussing gender,\nsexuality, and similar\ntopics, there are a lot of\nterms and concepts that you might\ncome across. This article will provide\na brief introduction to these concepts,\nwhat they mean, and how to use\nthe words correctly. Let\u2019s start with\nconcepts.\nSexuality\nThis is an intrinsic part of who we\nare. Sexuality is very complicated;\ngenerally it is considered to be binary,\nbut it is actually infinitely more\ncomplex. The next-most-simplified\nmodel is a spectrum, but this is also\na simplification, as sexuality is more\nlike the combination of several\nindependent spectra. In this article we\nwill focus on two components.\nThe most obvious component of\nsexuality is the one that expresses\nwhich gender or genders you\nare attracted to; heterosexual\n(traditionally meaning \u201cattracted to\nthe opposite gender [from oneself]\u201d,\nthough as we\u2019ll explore later the\nconcept of \u201cthe opposite gender\u201d\nis not as well-defined as you might\nthink) and homosexual (attracted to\nthe same gender) are not the only two\norientations or identities.\nAs you may know, there are many\nmore, including but not limited to\nbisexual (attracted to both men and\nwomen), pansexual (attracted to all\ngenders), polysexual (attracted to\nlots of different genders) and asexual\n(attracted to no genders; doesn\u2019t\nexperience sexual attraction at all \u2013\nsee below).\nThe other biggest part of sexuality\nis the one that expresses the level of\nattraction, and how you are attracted\nto someone. This can be defined by\nhow frequently you feel sexually\nattracted to someone. It\u2019s not the\nsame thing as your sex drive; this\nis about how frequently there is a\nperson you find attractive, rather\nthan how often you want to engage in\nsexual activity with a given person.\nThis includes people who\nexperience \u2018normal\u2019 or average levels\nof sexual attraction to others, often\ntermed verisexual, allosexual or\njust plain sexual (there\u2019s not yet a\nconsensus on the appropriate term),\ndemisexuals (who only experience\nsexual attraction to people with\nwhom they already have a close bond),\nand asexuals (who do not experience\nsexual attraction at all).\nRomantic attraction\nThese same components can also\napply to romantic attraction. This\nis frequently explained as desire\nfor all the loving, couple-y parts\nof a relationship, just without the\nactual sex. All the elements of sexual\norientation have corresponding, but\nindependent romantic components.\nWhile it is most common for\na person\u2019s romantic and sexual\norientations to align, it is entirely\npossible for them to differ \u2013 one\ncommon manifestation of this is\nto be either asexual or aromantic,\nbut there is no reason one couldn\u2019t\nbe, for example, heterosexual and\nhomoromantic (though it would\nprobably suck).\nGender\nGender is a nebulous concept which\nsociety tends to push as a binary\nof masculine and feminine, and\nassociated with your sex. However,\ngender is, to bastardise a quote from\nthe Doctor, more like a great big ball\nof wibbly-wobbly gendery-bendery...\nstuff. Gender is expressed in many\nways, including hair, clothing and\nmake-up. Gender identity and the\ngender you are assigned at birth\naccording to your body\u2019s sex do not\nnecessarily match up.\nYou may be cisgender (you identify\nwith the gender that your body\nindicates to society), transgender\n(you identify with a gender other\nthan the one you were assigned at\nbirth), agender (where, similarly\nto asexuality or aromanticism,\ngender is a concept to which you\nfeel ambivalence), or any shade\ninbetween (androgyny is one popular\nterm for the exact middle-ground of\nthe male-female gender spectrum).\nThis is entirely separate from being\n\u2018transexual\u2019 or \u2018transgender\u2019 (related\nbut distinct terms; the latter is the\nmore-usually applicable).\n\u2018Transgender\u2019 (always an adjective;\nplease do not use \u2018transgender\u2019 as a\nnoun) refers to the situation where\nthe sex and/or gender a person was\nassigned when they were born doesn\u2019t\nmatch their identity. A related term\nwith rather narrower applicability\nis \u2018transexual\u2019 (and while that word\nhas a history as a noun, that history\nmeans you should probably avoid\nusing it that way too unless you know\nexactly what you\u2019re doing), and both\nare commonly abbreviated to \u2018trans\u2019.\nThese things get more complicated\nwhen you consider that intersex\npeople exist. Being \u201cintersex\u201d means\ntheir body and reproductive systems\ndo not entirely match either the male\nor female systems. Up to 1.7% of\nbabies exhibit some degree of sexual\nambiguity at birth, and as they grow\nup these people may end up having\nany of the above gender identities.\nFluidity\nWhile all these labels are great, if\n\"Generally\nit is\nconsidered\nto be\nbinary, but\n[sexuality]\nis actually\ninfinitely\nmore\ncomplex\"\n\"Gender is\na nebulous\nconcept\nwhich\nsociety\ntends to\npush as a\nbinary of\nmasculine\nand\nfeminine\"\nCaitlyn Jennner, formerly known as Bruce, received much support and media attent\n\n"

This is a key concept to\nmeditate upon and have in mind as\nyou view this exhibition of the works\nof six Japanese artists (three of whom\nare established and London-based,\nwhile the others are recent graduates\nand based in Japan).\nWhat is surprising in Two Truths is\nthat the works of both the established\nJapanese born but London-based\nartists, and the artists still living and\nworking in Japan reflect a similar\nconcept of \u2018truth\u2019. The purpose and\nvision of each artist is unique, and\nis conveyed through a most diverse\narray of media and subject matter.\nHowever, there is a profound link\n\u2013 almost a common energy \u2013 that\nunifies the works as one exhibition.\nAt first glance, the works appear\nsimply modern and contemporary.\nHowever, behind each work is a\nmeaningful message and purpose\nof the artist. Each work reinterprets\nthe world in a modern and\nunconventional way, while a deep\nsense of tradition lends a subtle, but\nnonetheless influential echo of the\npast.\nFor example, for her work Secret\nGarland, ICHASU reinvents two\ntraditional Japanese screens through\nthe process of painting them with\nbright manga-inspired imagery. An\ninitially unnoticed contrast in this\npiece is that the back is left unpainted,\nand bears remnants of old untouched\nwriting. Keisuke Katsuki makes\nhis Pixel Painting pieces through a\nmethodical process which is almost\na modern meditative practice,\nreflecting the patience and rhythm of\ntraditional ceremonies; his works are\npaintings of the pixels which are seen\nwhen zooming into a digital image of\na painting. Yuka Kurita works echo\nthe tradition of sushi \u2013 they show\npacked salmon slices painted in an\nunfamiliar and unrealistic way.\nThe direct and indirect aspects of\nJapanese traditions that also echo\nin the contemporary works of the\nLondon based artists is even more\nsurprising. For example, Miho Sato\nused old photographs of Japanese\nchildren as subject for her paintings\nSchool Ground and School Ground\n2. The works of Yukako Shibata\nare abstract, but philosophical and\nmeditative in their exploration of\na paradox, reflecting neon colors\nagainst white. The Reciprocal trio\nof works by Kazuya Tsuji is also\nhighly meditative in the way the\ncolour tissue sways with any slight\nbreeze of movement through the\ngallery; these works, in addition to\nhis other featured works which are\nreinventions of found pieces, give\nnew forms and a fresh dimension to\nold familiar materials.\nTwo Truths demonstrates the\njuxtapositions of traditional culture\nand contemporary modernism, of\nwhat is present and what is actually\nperceived, as well as exploring the\ninfluence of cultural displacement\non the artist\u2019s \u2018truth\u2019. The exhibition\nitself is a metaphysical projection of\nthat Buddhist concept conveyed in\neach shown artwork \u2013 the idea of two\nomnipresent dualities working not\nin opposition, but in unison, in an\nattempt to discover true meaning and\npurpose.\nTwo Truths is on at the Griffin\nGallery, W11, until 11th\nJuly. Admittance\nfree.\nKazuya Tsuji, Fe I, 2014 Photo: Griffin Gallery\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 29\n05.06.2015\nFELIX\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nKafka, but not as you know him\nThe work of Japanese author\nHaruki Murakami could\nperhaps best be described as\n\u201cdense\u201d. Possibly Japan\u2019s greatest\nliving novelist \u2013 or at least, the best\nknown internationally \u2013 Murakami\u2019s\nfeather-light, delicate prose belies the\ncomplex themes that lie at the core of\nhis novels. Their plots are like riddles,\nwhich, without solutions, are cast\nadrift on a sea of surreality. As such,\nit takes a brave director to tackle his\nwork, especially since he has said he\nwon\u2019t watch adaptations of his work;\nthere are few better qualified to tackle\nthis, therefore, than Japanese director\nYukio Ninagawa who, as he stands\non the cusp of his ninth decade of\nlife, brings his accomplished version\nof Kafka on the Shore to London\u2019s\nBarbican Centre.\nThe plot of Kafka on the Shore is\none of time and memory, of loss\nand longing, of providence and\nserendipity. On the one hand we have\nKafka Tamura, a teen runaway who\nmakes it to a private library managed\nby the mysterious Miss Saeki, only\nfor his literary idyll to be destroyed\nby the news of his father\u2019s murder;\non the other is Satoru Nakata, an eel-loving elderly man, who was knocked\nunconscious in a mysterious accident,\nand awoke without his memory but\nwith the ability to talk to cats. As\ntheir stories begin to weave together,\nthe nature of reality begins to\nunwind, as the audience are left with\nmore questions than answers.\nWith such a convoluted plot, a\nsceptical approach to the play is to\nbe understood. However, Ninagawa\nmanages to tread a course through\nthe text with ease: his version of Kafka\non the Shore retains the mystery and\nintrigue of the original book, but still\nmanages to come in at just under\nthree hours long, a remarkable feat\nconsidering the chunky nature of the\nsource material.\nThe staging of the play retains the\nsensuality of the source material.\nKafka on the Shore is a book of soft\nedges, of glimmering light, and this\neffect is recreated through Tsukasa\nNakagoshi\u2019s set design, which sees the\ncast and props swirl around the stage\nin a number of gigantic cubes. The\neffect is like that of a living museum,\nthe action of the play contained\nwithin a series of beautiful vitrines.\nOf course, this could not be achieved\nwithout the superhuman efforts of\nthe crew, who drag and shove these\ncubes into their respective position;\nat the end of the play they appear,\ndressed all in black, to a rapturous\nround of applause from the audience.\nThe lighting design, courtesy of\nMotoi Hattori, who has worked with\nNinagawa on numerous occasions,\nis also superb, transporting us from\nthe bright lights of a neon-charged\nTokyo, through into the tranquil\nconfines of Takamatsu, and finally\nto a mystical second-world, one of\nundead WWII soldiers, unrequited\nloves, and rain that comes down like\nmist. The overall effect is to transport\nus a million miles away from the\n70s-brown interior of the Barbican\nHall, into a land of dreams and\nbeauty.\nThe cast, which includes a number\nof regular Ninagawa collaborators, is\nmore than prepared for the gauntlet\nthrown down by Murakami. In\nparticular, Katsumi Kiba\u2019s Nakata\nis excellent, with Kiba adding a\ncompletely believable childishness to\nhis character; despite Nakata\u2019s bizarre\noddities and his predilection for his\nless-than-charming habit of referring\nto himself in the third person, Kiba\nmakes sure that he is irresistibly\nlikable, and we have no choice but\nto enjoy his presence. Similarly,\nRie Miyazawa \u2013 who appeared in\nthe 2004 film Tony Takitani, based\non Murakami\u2019s short story \u2013 is\nexceptional as Miss Saeki, a character\nwhose brittleness is only rivalled\nNaohito Fujiki, Nino Furuhata and Rie Miyazawa in the Ninagawa Company\u2019s Kafka on the Shore at Barbican, London Photo: Takahiro Watanabe\nFred Fyles is enchanted by Ninagawa Company\u2019s newest play\n\"The\nstaging of\nthe play\nretains\nall the\nsensuality\nof the\nnovel\"\n\"Ninagawa\nmanages to\nbring the\nprose to\nlife, lifting\nit off the\npage\"\nby her sadness; Miyazawa imbues\nher character with a sense of innate\nmelancholy, reflecting her tragic past.\nIn contrast, Nino Furuhata\u2019s Kafka\nseems to somewhat lack confidence \u2013\nit is no surprise to see that this is his\nfirst acting credit.\nIf Ninagawa had merely attempted\nto bring Murakami\u2019s work to the\nstage, that would have been enough.\nBut instead, he manages to bring\nthe Japanese author\u2019s prose to life,\nseemingly lifting words straight off\nthe page and, breathing energy into\nthem, letting them loose on the stage.\nThe fantastical characters of Kafka on\nthe Shore, thanks to the superb efforts\nof the stage crew, step out onto the\nstage, landing on firm feet \u2013 helped\nof course by the superb staging and\nlighting. With its heavy themes\nof reality and artifice, its knowing\nname-dropping of Yeats and Hegel,\nand its powerful statement about the\nmodern world, Kafka should sink like\na stone. Instead, thanks to Ninagawa\u2019s\nmasterful direction, it soars above the\naudience, as delicate and beautiful as\na soap bubble.\nThe Ninagawa Company\u2019s Kafka on\nthe Shore was on at the Barbican Centre\nfrom 28th\n- 30th\nMay. Performance was in\nJapanese with English subtitles.\n\n"

Even we know\nyou should use protection (we\u2019re\ntying contraception and protection\ntogether here, for reasons).\nConsider that Hangman\u2019s one\nlegitimate tip from this whole\nenterprise. Use protection.\nOnce we\u2019ve scaled the mountain\nof people pointing out that their\nhomosexuality renders contraception\npointless (yes, thank you, we get\nthe point, it was a badly designed\nquestion), there was the odd case\nof people who Hangman is slightly\nconcerned about.\nSo, naturally, Hangman is going to\nreproduce their comments verbatim\nand be sarcastic about them, because\nthat\u2019s just how we roll.\nSomeone\u2019s method of contraception\nis \u201cthinking of Margaret Thatcher\nwhen [they] ejaculate.\u201d Hangman\nhates to break it to you: that\u2019s not\nwhat contraception is. That\u2019s what a\nturn-off is. These are different things.\nHangman congratulates you on\nthe impending birth of your many\nchildren.\nSeveral people claimed abstinence\nas their contraceptive of choice.\nCongrats. This feels like stating the\nobvious.\nSeveral others made the obvious\njoke of \u201cbeing at Imperial\u201d (one was\nmore specific, targeting the Electronic\nEngineering department for some\nvirgin banter).\nLook. Read the damn sex survey.\nNormally, Hangman wouldn\u2019t\ncare about the sex survey.\nMost of Imperial are a bunch\nof virgins, some of Imperial aren\u2019t,\nthe world keeps turning. Hangman\nremains, unfazed, eternal.\nBut this year\u2019s sex survey was so\nfull of utter depravity, wild sexual\nabandon and frankly horrifying\nadmissions that Hangman felt\ncompelled to speak out.\nHangman even felt compelled to\nwrite this article.\nAnd let Hangman just say: you\u2019re\nall disgusting. Hangman loves it.\nQuite a few of you sickening sex\naddicts had comments for Felix.\nSome of you wanted to let us know\nwhat other disturbing things you get\nup to.\nOthers took the chance to tell us\nwhat sort of contraception they use\nwhen getting their freak on. Others\ntried to proposition Felix.\nOthers were just downright\nperverts.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, as Hangman\nputs on our Agony Aunt hat (we\nknitted it ourselves), and introduces\nyou to - for one issue only - \u2018Sex Tips\u2019\n(but just the tips).\nTypes of porn\nYou people watch some horrifying\ncrap. Anyway.\nWhen it came to porn, Felix asked\nyou what sort of thing you enjoyed\nwatching (you sick bastards).\nThen they made the mistake of\ngiving you a free text answer box for\nyou to add in anything they\u2019d missed,\nknowing full well you\u2019d fill the box\nwith all sorts of sick nonsense.\nWhich you promptly did, because\nyou\u2019re nothing if not predictable.\nSaid one commentator: \u201canything is\nporn if you try hard enough.\u201d\nThis is stunning life advice, truth\nbe told.\nIt feels like the sort of thing you\u2019d\nsee on an inspirational cat poster, if\ninspirational cat posters were written\nby filthy porn addicts.\nHangman suggests you all take this\nadvice to heart. Hey, nobody said this\nwas going to be useful sex tips.\nAnother commentator took a\ndifferent approach to life, asking\n\u201chow the fuck could you fap to\nanimated hentai with the fucking\nvoice acting?\u201d\nHangman would like to refer this\nindividual to the comment above.\nAnything is porn if you try hard\nenough.\nThere was also some extremely\nuseful feedback on the survey, with\nsomeone pointing out that \u201cyou\nshould have separated MILF from\nMature.\u201d\nHangman doesn\u2019t even want to\nSex Tips (but just the tips)\nThis is from The Simpsons. It still contains better sex advice than this article. Photo: Fox\nNews in Brief: Hangman filled out the sex survey. We\u2019re\nthe one with 999 sexual partners.\nRemember that Agony Aunt column? This isn\u2019t that.\nIt very clearly shows that people\nat Imperial have sex, so the people\nmaking a general \u201cImperial\u201d joke are\nall wrong.\nIt also clearly shows that Aero, not\nEE, are the biggest virgins, so at least\nget your departmental-percentage-of-virgins-based jokes right. Honestly.\nOne person made a terrible joke\nthat\u2019s so unacceptable even Hangman\nrefuses to print it. You know who you\nare.\nAnd finally on the subject of\ncontraception, Hangman would like\nto give a shout out to whoever wrote\n\u201cI will use a condom in future.\u201d\nHangman feels this belies a\nrudimentary failure of your reading\ncomprehension abilities.\nThis isn\u2019t a survey about the sex\nyou\u2019re hoping to have, it\u2019s about the\nsex you\u2019ve already had.\nOf course, saying that, Hangman\nis pleased to hear you\u2019re making the\nsensible decision with regards to\ncostuming your genitals in protective\nlatex during consensual copulation,\nand wishes you the very best of sex in\nthe future.\nFunky fornication habits\nOh dear. Hangman thought the\nMargaret Thatcher reference in the\nprevious section was bad enough,\nbut no, you had to go and surpass\nyourselves, didn\u2019t you?\nThe additional comments for\n\u2018anything else you like doing [in\nsex, not in general]?\u2019 proved to be a\ntreasure trove of debauchery.\n\u201cSheep,\u201d said one person. No\ncontext, just \u201csheep.\u201d They like doing\nsheep.\nIf you\u2019re suspecting this is going\nto turn out to be a Welsh joke, well\ndone, because that\u2019s exactly what it\nwas. \u201c#welshlad,\u201d went the rest of the\ncomment. Wonderful. Never saw\nthat one coming (and neither did the\nsheep).\nSomeone else felt the overwhelming\nurge to query Felix\u2019s knowledge of sex,\npointing out that they indulge in the\nodd spot of autofellatio, and asking\n\u201chow could you forget!\u201d Quite easily,\nit seems.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t hugely appreciate it\nwhen you ask them if you can sanitise\ntheir ass\u201d might actually qualify as\nlegitimate advice? Hangman\u2019s not\nsure anymore.\nThe line between acceptable and not\nbecomes blurred very, very quickly\nwhen you\u2019re dealing with the level of\nwanton licentiousness we\u2019re talking\nabout here.\nOther helpful tidbits include \u201crusty\npirate is not as fun as it sounds\u201d\n(Hangman\u2019s not convinced it sounded\nfun to start with) and \u201cwanking while\nblazed\u201d being given as a fun activity\nto try.\nHangman would appreciate the\nadvice, were it not plain weird.\nAnd finally: this.\nMany, many, many people expressed\ntheir determination to Get It On\nDown Under\u2122 (sorry not sorry,\nAustralia) following the sex survey\nquerying whether anyone had\nactually managed to enjoy some\ncheeky coitus in the tunnels running\nunderneath the South Kensington\ncampus.\nYou are, it seems, all obsessed with\nthese tunnels. Hangman has a few\nresponses to this, so let\u2019s break it\ndown.\nFirstly, Hangman is delighted to\nbe able to offer the Get It On Down\nUnder\u2122 Experience, for a mere \u00a39000\n(per year), where you too can get it on\n(down under).\nEmail hangman@imperial.ac.uk to\nexpress your interest, with \u201cI\u2019ll let\nyou service my tunnels\u201d as the subject\nline.\nSecondly, sex in the tunnels is a\nterrible idea.\nHalf of them have caved in, and\nmost of the rest have burning hot\npipes running through them that\u2019ll\nmelt your face off if you even go near.\nSex in the tunnels will end badly.\nHangman\u2019s honour.\nThere was plenty of solicitations\nto the Felix staff, with a vast array of\nspelling and grammar abilities.\nThe winner of the\n\u2018straightwhiteboystexting.tumblr.\ncom\u2019 award for Worst Proposition\nEver is whoever sent in \u2018ay bb u wan\nsum fuk\u2019. No, no we don\u2019t. Not with\nspelling like that.\nOne bellend also suggested Felix\nshould hold a \u201crear of the year\ncontest.\u201d We\u2019re not The Tab, mate.\nJog on.\nAs for \u201cthis survey was a lot filthier\nthan anticipated,\u201d you were a lot\nfilthier than anticipated. So now you\nknow how we feel.\nAnd finally: to whoever\u2019s love for\ncircular confecitonary was so great\nthey had to tell Felix: Hangman has\nsome brief advice for you.\nYou \u201clike donuts,\u201d okay. That\u2019s\ngreat. Just don\u2019t stick your dick in\nthem.\n\n"

The mod makers\nwill start making money once their\nmod makes more than $100 and only\nactually make 25% of the profits with\nthe rest going to Valve and Bethesda.\nWhile this amount seems quite\nmeasly, this percentage was set by\nthe publisher of the game, and could\nhave varied with different games. I\nsay, \u201ccould have\u201d here, because the\nmoment this news broke, an uproar\nof gargantuan proportions permeated\nthe gaming community, including\none of the biggest Reddit circle-jerks\nthis writer has ever seen. As a result\nof this backlash, Valve swiftly decided\nto recall the proposed system (among\nstatements by Bethesda who said they\nstill supported the motion) and mods\nwere free once more.\nWithin the space of 3-4 days, all that\nwe knew and hoped about the modding\ncommunity had been tarnished, and\na new apocalyptic world of where you\nwould have to pay for that awesome\nnew quest or community-made nudity\nmode was starting to appear. A month\nlater, and the grass has grown over\nthe matter, but the innocence that the\ngaming community once regarded\nmods with has been blemished.\nBut why are mods so great, you say?\nWell, in our day and age of greedy\ngame studios, who are aiming to suck\nas much money out of you as possible\nby making you pay for parts of the\ngames in the form of DLC or leaving\nawesome parts out just because you\nThe Financial Future of Mods\nAbout a month ago, the news\nbroke that Valve, along with\nBethesda, was going to start\ncharging for mods for the best-seller\nSkyrim. I had originally meant to write\nan article then, but was so engrossed\nin the death throes that were my\nexams, that I was unable to form a\ncoherent thought that was not study\nrelated. However now exams are over,\nand all my fears, hopes and thoughts\nhave surfaced yet again, so I thought\nit might be a good time to put them\ndown on paper.\nQuick heads-up: A mod (or\nmodification) of a game, is a user\nmade/community made modification\nto a game. They range all the way from\nslight updates, like having new skins\nor better graphics all the way to full\nrewrites like new missions, characters\nand areas. They allow for a game to be\nextended beyond the scope of what the\ndevelopers originally intended and are\nthe last good bastion of this horrible\nworld of Downloadable Content\n(DLC), preorder bonuses and console-exclusives. A good rule of thumb is;\nthe better the modding community\nfor your game, the longer shelf-life it\nwill have.\nIf you don\u2019t know what the hell I\nam talking about here is a little recap.\nOn the 26th\nApril, Valve put out an\ndidn\u2019t preorder, it is really refreshing\nto be able to change your game in a\nmeaningful way and get new content\nwithout having to empty your wallet.\nAlso, it allows you to have several\ndifferent gaming experiences, from\nthe weird and wacky to the most\nserious, all in the same game. A great\nexample of this is Skyrim. This is a\ngame that was released in 2011 (yes,\nyou feel very old now, as do I), but is\nstill being played by a huge number\nof people. This is direct result of the\nmyriad of different mods that have\nkept this game alive and thriving.\nSo we have set the scene, now to\nthe actual discussion, what are the\npros and cons of a paid mod system?\nLet\u2019s start with the pro first (please\nhear me out there are some pros!).\nWell basically, all those mod-makers,\nwho currently need a day job to pay\nthe bills, would be able to turn their\nhobbies into their day jobs! This means\nthat if they could make money of\ntheir creations, they could potentially\nfocus their entire time on the making\nof mods, coming out with more\nregularity, quality and creativity.\nOn the other hand the only real\ncon seems to be that it won\u2019t be free\nanymore, and that we gamers now\nhave to pay for stuff that we used to\nget for nothing! I mean, there were\nseveral cons associated with the way\nSteam had set up the system, including\nthings such as copyright issues, quality\ncontrol and the share that the modders\nwould get, among many others. But\nin its purest form and implemented\ncorrectly, the only thing that gamers\ncan find as a negative is that we don\u2019t\n\"I think\npaying for\nmods is\nprobably\nthe way\nthe future\nis going to\nbe...\"\n\"The\nbetter the\nmodding\ncommunity\nfor your\ngame, the\nlonger\nshelf-life it\nwill have.\"\nwant to be forced to pay for something\nif we haven\u2019t done so in the past.\nI currently very much enjoy the\nmodel that we employ, and it has\ndefinitely made the gaming industry\nacknowledge that a good modding\ncommunity is what makes your game\nsell those extra couple million copies.\nHowever, with current copyright laws\nno modder can make money off their\nmods without being sued to death by\nthe studios. Therefore the only way\nthis paid thing is going to work is\neither, the studios become slightly less\ngreedy, or they and the mod-maker\ncome to an agreement that allows\nthem to split the profits (hopefully\nmore fairly next time). If you give it\nmore thought, having paid mods may\nactually allow these features to be\nimplemented fully in a game (and/or\nfuture iterations of the game), because\nthe studio can see directly what is\npopular with the user base and act\nupon that information.\nIn my personal opinion, while I\ndon\u2019t like it but I can see is necessary, I\nthink paying for mods is probably the\nway the future is going to be, as long\nas the prices and quality of the goods\noffered are reasonable. It is the only\nreal sustainable way to keep talent\nand creativity in the gaming industry\nwithout them having to form their\nown indie studios (whose games we\nwould then have to pay for anyway).\nSometimes, we as gamers have to not\ndo what is easy or cheaper, but what is\nright, and in this case I think showing\nappreciation to those guys who have\ngiven us so much joy and fun is the\nright thing to do.\nMAXIMILIAN EGGL\nGAMES EDITOR\nSome examples of the goods...\nPhoto: techcrunch\nIf things had gone according to plan, you would have had to pay to ride this beautiful cock around Skyrim!!!

Photo: Pulse Fitness\nKunal Wagle looks at the fitness centre planned for North Acton\nCancer drugs have potential\nto help spinal injuries\nAleading fitness equipment\ncompany has agreed a deal\nwith Imperial College London\nto design and kit-out a new state of\nthe art gym in the new Woodward\nhalls in Acton. Pulse Fitness, who\nhave also created gyms at 500 further\nand higher education institutions\nin the country, including King\u2019s\nCollege London, London South Bank\nUniversity, and Goldsmiths, aim to\nstart the project in June 2015. The\ngym is estimated to take ten weeks to\ncomplete and is timed to open before\nthe first year of students take up\nresidence in the first week of October.\nThe gym will be run by Pulse\nthemselves for the next ten years as a\nbranch of its Club Pulse division, with\ncontinued support from stakeholders\nat Imperial. The gym will be a two-storey state of the art fitness facility\nwith as many as 85 machines. It will\nalso include a multifunctional studio\nspace. Each piece of cardio equipment\nat the gym will be equipped with a\nCirrus Console, an 18.5 inch android\ntablet with touch screen that will\nallow users to personalise their\nworkouts, while watching digital\ntelevision or browsing the internet.\nIn addition to the Cirrus Console,\nPulse will also be including\nSmartCentre, an interactive\ntechnology that provides motivation\nand stores personalised gym\nworkouts. It also gives user feedback\nand aids retention by connecting\nmembers with equipment, staff, and\nmanagement.\nWarren Ormerod, who is Director\nof Club Operations at Pulse, said of\nthe deal \u201cThis is a landmark contract\nfor Pulse and a testament to our\nfirst rate services, equipment and\nprevious operational work within the\neducation sector. As a UK company\nwe\u2019re excited to be working with\none of the top ranked universities\nin the UK and indeed the world, and\nwill strive to create a facility which\nreflects these high wstandards. With\nextensive experience operating dual\nuse facilities in higher education\ninstitutions, as well as providing\nequipment and delivering design and\nbuild services, we really understand\nwhat works for private members\nand students alike. We are confident\nwe\u2019ll not only meet but exceed the\nobjectives and targets set in terms of\nusage, retention and revenue.\u201d\nThe gym will be open to private\nmembers and staff, and will be\navailable for students to use free of\ncharge.\nResearchers from the Imperial\nCollege Department of\nMedicine have discovered that\na group of drugs used to treat cancer\ncould also have an effect on treating\nspinal cord injuries.\nLed by Professor Simone di\nGiovanni, the team conducted a study\nwhere they treated a group of mice\nwith cancer drugs called nutlins. They\ndiscovered that the mice that received\nsaid treatment recovered far more\nmovement than those left untreated.\nAt present, there are no methods of\ntreatment that are effective on spinal\ncord injuries, which cause various\ndegrees of paralysis in patients\ndepending on the location of the\ninjury, with patients typically ending\nup being confined to wheelchairs. Due\nto the fact that stimulating regrowth\nin damaged spinal cord nerves is\nextremely difficult, these injuries are\npermanent.\nThe study in adult mice utilized\ndrugs that were meant to halt the\ngrowth of cancerous tumours, but\nsaid drugs had the side effect of\npreventing a particular series of\nproteins from interacting to restrict\nnerve growth. In some mice with\npartially severed spinal cords, the\nresearchers were able to stimulate\nnerve regrowth, meaning 75% of\nthe test subjects went from being\nparalyzed to being able to scale a\nladder. Mice not treated with the\ndrugs only made a slight recovery in\ntheir mobility.\nProf di Giovanni however\nemphasised the need for further\ntesting, saying that although the\nresults shown by the mice were\n\u201cvery encouraging\u201d, rats have more\nsimilarities in their spinal cord\nstructures with that of humans,\nso studies with the latter would be\nrequired first. The research team\nbelieves that human clinical trials\ncould take place within ten years.\n\"The gym...\nwill be\navailable for\nstudents free\nof charge\"\n\"75% of test\nsubjects went\nfrom being\nparalyzed to\nbeing able\nto scale a\nladder\"\nCarol Ann Cheah reports as\nencouraging signs are seen in mice\n\n"

I\u2019m reliably\ninformed we have a delightful new coffee\nmachine, and I\u2019d hate to see the new\nfacilities those lovely boys in Finance have\nbought for us go to waste!\nWhat Is: Felix?\nAfter the events of last week, we realised\nthat we\u2019d never run a session detailing just\nwho Felix actually are.\nWe often find ourselves having to deal\nwith those stupid idiots journalists-in-training (their words), and we realised that\nforewarned is forearmed.\nTo that end, we\u2019re running this \u2018What Is\u2019\nsession on Felix, and we\u2019ll be giving you all\nthe chance to ask questions over just who\u2019s\ninvolved, and how we can best deal with\nthem.\nAll staff are invited to the meeting\n(although not the Felix Editor-in-Chief, as\nshe\u2019s not actually staff!), and a register of\nattendance will be taken on the door.\nThose who fail to attend will be sent\ncomplimentary copies of the latest issue\n(their words) of Felix.\nDon\u2019t forget to bring your yoga mat as\nusual, and green tea will (of course) be\nprovided.\nWhat is going on outside the\nBlue Cube this week\nDue to this week\u2019s worrying discovery\nthat students have been engaging in\ndisturbing bouts of copulation in locations\nacross campus, the ban on staff leaving\nthe Faculty Building without written\npermission has been extended.\nDo not make eye contact with students.\nThey\u2019re dirty. All of them.\nAlice Gast: Thought of the Week\n\u201cAfter the publication in Felix this week of\ntheir annual \u2018sex survey\u2019, I\u2019d like to take the\nchance to remind everyone at Imperial of the\nimportance of safe sexual practices. As an\nAmerican in Britain, I know how the British are\noften reluctant to discuss how important it is to\nuse the various forms of protection available, to\nprevent the spread of a wide range of Sexually\nTransmited Diseases - especially children.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue News\nProvost Post\nof the Week\nEvery week, a member of\nour esteemed Provost board\nshares their thoughts with\nour collaborative, cohesive\ncommunity. This week, we\nwelcome back Al Pologies,\nVice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses)!\nSadly, Al was too busy filling\nout surveys to send in his post\nthis week, so we must now\nturn to Clem Entines, the Vice\nProvost (Healthy Living)!\nWe\u2019ve asked Clem to deliver\nthis week\u2019s post in response to\nthe publication in the student\ntoilet paper \u201cnewspaper\u201d (their\nwords) Felix of their annual\n\u201csex survey\u201d, an unintelligent\nattempt to discern how much\ncopulation is going on amongst\nthe student population.\nSo, without further ado: take it\naway, Clem!\nHi everyone!\nI\u2019m delighted to be\ncontributing to this week\u2019s\nBlue News, which as you\u2019re all\naware is a hugely esteemed\norgan within the Faculty\nBuilding (and beyond!). I just\nwish it was under less worrying\ncircumstances.\nWe\u2019ve learned to our horror\nthat many of the students who\nhave given up their time and\ntheir parent\u2019s money to study\nat this world-leading institution\nhave been spending their time\nengaged in less educational\npursuits.\nThat\u2019s right, they\u2019ve been less\nfocused on educating and more\nfocused on procreating.\nThe Felix \u201csex survey\u201d has\nexposed the unacceptable\nlevels of sexual congress\ngoing on amongst the student\npopulation.\nWe here in the Faculty\nBuilding firmly believe that such\nwanton promiscuity cannot\nbe allowed to continue while\nstudents are attending this\nglobally-recognised font of\nacademia.\nTo this end, we will be\ninstituting a new policy of\nenforced abstinence. Students\nwill be separated in classes\nbased on gender, and any\nhints of physical contact will be\npunished with hefty fines.\nI look forward to all your\nsupport on this matter.\nHello all,\nWelcome back once more to Blue News, the hard-hitting, investigative\nbroadsheet bringing you all the latest in big, earth-shattering news!\nJust kidding - welcome back to Blue News, the weekly newsletter that\nkeeps you all informed of the goings-on in the Faculty Building. We don\u2019t\nhave to do any investigative journalism here! Working in such an open,\ncollaborative environment means the stories just come to us!\nThis week\u2019s issue is dedicated to the recent survey sent round by the\nwonderful boys in Comms, our annual Collaboration Survey!\nThat\u2019s right, the results are already in (with thanks to the wonderful girls\nin Accounting for \u2018a-counting\u2019 the responses so quickly!), and it turns\nout that this year has seen the highest amount of collaboration ever at\nImperial!\nWe\u2019ve also found some interesting data, which will be published in\nfull very shortly - I can tell you now that the highest percentage of\ncollaboration took place in the Board Room, so no surprises there!\nIn other news, I\u2019m told that some jobless losers protestors spent some\ntime outside the Royal School of Mines this week, complaining about\n\u2018something to do with oil\u2019. Thanks must go to the Vice Provost (Kettling)\nfor dispersing the protestors before their message could spread too far.\nThe lovely boys in the Finance department\u2019s Investment team have\nasked me all to remind you that oil is a perfectly safe investment to\nmake.\nI do encourage you all to buy up stocks in the big oil and gas companies\n- in this day and age, it\u2019s essential to make sure you\u2019re financially secure,\nand there\u2019s nothing better than a healthy dividend from some ethically-sourced shares in an oil company for helping to keep you safe above the\nbread line.\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

Only 21%\nreported that they were \u2018unhappy\u2019\nor \u2018very unhappy\u2019 (sorry folks), while\n15% didn\u2019t feel one way or the other.\nThe remaining 2% did not wish to\nsay how they felt \u2013 so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s\nguess why they\u2019re filling out a student\nsex survey.\nBreaking the figures down by the\nsexuality of respondents revealed\nsome interesting trends in our levels\nof sexual satisfaction.\n72% of those identifying as asexual\nsaid they were \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018very happy\u2019\nwith their sex lives, with only 14%\n\u2018unhappy\u2019 or \u2018very unhappy\u2019.\nBisexuals were the second happiest,\nwith 71% reportedly \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018very\nhappy\u2019 and only 21% \u2018unhappy\u2019 or\n\u2018very unhappy\u2019.\nNext most satisfied were the\nheterosexuals, 64% of whom were on\nthe happy end of the spectrum, while\n21% again were \u2018unhappy\u2019 or \u2018very\nunhappy\u2019.\nMeanwhile, only 54% of Imperial\u2019s\nhomosexuals were \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018very\nhappy\u2019 with their sex lives, and this\ntime 23% not happy \u2013 perhaps due to\nthe relatively low number of gay and\nlesbian students at Imperial (only 8%\nof us according to this year\u2019s survey).\nLooking at gender, 73% of Imperial\nwomen were \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018very happy\u2019\nwith their sex life at the moment,\ncompared to just 58% of the men.\nSimilarly the \u2018unhappy\u2019 and \u2018very\nunhappy\u2019 students accounted for 17%\nof the girls and 24% of guys. So nearly\n1 in 4 blokes aren\u2019t being satisfied at\nImperial \u2013 sorry lads.\nComparing the happiness figures\nby department with the total\nnumber of respondents from that\ndepartment, it looks like Medicine\nare overrepresented in the \u2018very\nunhappy\u2019 category with a whopping\n23% of them identifying as such when\njust 15% of total respondents were\nMedics.\nLife Sciences were also less than\nsatisfied, making up 23% of the\n\u2018unhappy\u2019 category yet only 17% of\ntotal respondents.\nMeanwhile Physics were\nunderrepresented here, with only\n10% \u2018very unhappy\u2019, and the rest\nslightly more likely than average to\nbe in the happy categories.

It is a league\nconsisting of three athletics meets\nstaged at venues across the capital,\nwith all 23 London universities\ninvited to take part. The competition\nis in its inaugural year which made it\ncrucially important that the Imperial\nteam made its mark.\nA full team of Imperial athletes has\nbeen present at all three meets and\ncoming into the final on Saturday\n30th\nMay we were sitting in second\nplace, just behind King\u2019s College\nLondon. Everything was riding on the\nfinal at Battersea Park and the team\ndid not disappoint. A day of fantastic\nperformances confirmed our position\nas runners-up in the first ever LCAS!\nGold medals came thick and fast\nthroughout the day starting with the\n400m Hurdles, where star fresher\nLiana Spyropoulou took the women\u2019s\ntitle and Athletics Captain Gareth\nHolden the men\u2019s. Chris Thomas\nand Gil Machado were the next stars\nto shine with victories in the Men\u2019s\n400m, 800m and 1500m between\nthem. Adding those to Golds from\nGareth Holden in the 100m and\n200m and Erik Tropp in the 110m\nHurdles gave the Imperial Men\u2019s\nteam a clean sweep in every race up\nto 3000m which is an incredible\nachievement. Not to be outdone,\nhowever, some of the best moments\nof the whole day came from our\nresident Irish lad Rob O\u2019Keeffe.\nCongratulations must go to him for\ntaking on nine (difficult!) events\nand bringing in over 30 points for\nthe team. I\u2019m sure he will wear his\nridiculous sunburn and the battle\nscars from his aborted steeple chase\nwater jump with pride! Hat\u2019s off to\nLawrence Tse also who picked up two\nsilver medals in the hurdles.\nIn the field events we saw similar\nsuccess. For the women Jenny Carus\nwas unbeatable, walking away with\ntwo Golds, winning both the Shot\nPut and the Javelin. Emma Watkins\nfollowed up her victories in the first\ntwo meets with second place in the\nfinal securing her the overall Gold\nmedal. The undisputed king of the\nfield Erik Tropp managed to add\nmedals in the High Jump and Javelin\nto his 110m Hurdles gold. Erik racked\nup an impressive 82 points for the\nteam over the course of the series!\nCraig Wheadon and Harry Allen also\nentered an obscene number of events\nand picked up points left, right and\ncentre. Congrats to Craig in particular\nfor winning the 400m overall title.\nThe climax of the day was definitely\nthe relays which were truly epic.\nFirst, the Imperial men took on\nthe field in the 4x400m relay. Even\nthough an un-named male athlete\nsuffered defeat on the first leg to\nthe ladies\u2019 team from King\u2019s, we\nmanaged claw our way back into 1st\nplace. I guess I should mention that\nhis female opponent was in fact GB\nInternational Laviai Neilson. In the\n4x100m relay both the Imperial men\nand women only managed silver\nbut thrashed out a dominant win\nin the final event of the series, the\nMedley relay! This last sprint may\nhave reduced captain Gareth Holden\nto a heap on the floor but it was\ncompletely worth it to have the last\nlaugh over King\u2019s and UCL!\nA mention must also go to Shivam,\nEdrea, Sidney, Marta, Sarah, Laura,\nAmarpal and of course our club\ncaptain Matt Douthwaite for coming\nalong and scoring some much needed\npoints for the team!\nThe LCAS final will go down as\none of my favourite competitions\nin two years as Athletics captain for\nImperial.\nOn the day I could not believe\nthe level of enthusiasm; it was just\nfantastic to see everyone giving their\nall for the team in what, normally, is\nsuch an individual sport.\nIf Athletics and Cross Country is\nsomething you think you\u2019d like to be a\npart of it\u2019s not too late to join us for the\nlast few sessions of the year. Of course,\nwe will be back at Fresher\u2019s Fair next\nyear (complete with mascot) to welcome\nin the new season!\nGareth Holden reports as Imperial secure second place in the inaugural competition\nImperial came second at the meet. Photo: ICXC\nSepp Blatter resigned as Fifa\nPresident this Tuesday, amid one\nof the most serious corruption\nscandals to ever hit the sporting\nworld. This comes after a week of\nrevelations and arrests as part of an\ninvestigation by US authorities into\ncorruption at the highest levels of\nworld football.\nBlatter has led the governing body\nof world football since 1998, and\nunder his leadership, Fifa, ostensibly\na non-profit organization, has\namassed billions in cash reserves, with\ntop executives enjoying the kinds of\nopulent lifestyle one would normally\nassociate with heads of state.\nLast week Swiss police, acting\non the request of US authorities,\narrested seven top Fifa executives\nin a dawn raid on a five-star Zurich\nhotel. Seven more men implicated\nin the scandal were also indicted\nby a federal court in New York on\ncharges of racketeering, bribery,\nmoney laundering and fraud. The\narrests shocked (but certainly did not\nsurprise) the footballing world.\nTwo days after the raid, Blatter won\nhis fifth consecutive election despite\nwidespread speculation that he was\nalso under investigation. Due to Fifa\u2019s\nelectoral structure, in which every\nmember association\u2019s vote has equal\nweight regardless of the population\nthey represent or their success in\ninternational football, Blatter has\nbeen able to effectively ignore his\nEuropean and North American\ncritics by courting numerous small\nfootball associations such as those of\nthe Cayman Islands, Montserrat and\nBurkina Faso.\nBlatter has often been referred to\nas a man without shame, brazenly\nriding out scandal after scandal, but\nby Tuesday allegations from the US\nJustice Department that Fifa officals\nhad accepted bribes and kickbacks\nin excess of $150m since the 1990s\nproved too much for even him to\nhandle. He told a press conference\nthat he would \u201clay down his mandate\u201d\nand call an extraordinary election\nto find a replacement, claiming that\nhe would then be able to \u201cfocus on\ndriving far-reaching, fundamental\nreforms that transcend [our] previous\nefforts.\u201d\nBlatter strenuously denies\nknowledge of or participation in any\ncorruption. If this is true then he is\nan idiot, and if it is not he is corrupt.\nEither way, the end of Joseph S.\nBlatter as a force in world football is\nnews that should be welcome to fans\nacross the world. Corruption has long\nblighted the beautiful game, and the\nresults of this are far from abstract\nand materially harm real people.\nFifa\u2019s corruption legitimises the\nregimes of torturers and murderers;\nFifa\u2019s corruption sweeps the deaths\nof hundreds of exploited migrant\nlabourers under the carpet; Fifa\u2019s\ncorruption pays for third homes,\nyachts and private jets with the\nmoney that should be enabling\nyoung people from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds and developing\ncountries to access the opportunities\nthat sport can bring.\nFootball might just be a game,\nbut the politics and the people that\nsurround it are not. Now that many of\nthe key players in the Fifa circus are\nbehind bars and the ringmaster has\nleft in disgrace, world football has a\nchance to really be a force for good.\nSepp Blatter gets the red card\nIs it too late to save his reputation? Was there really a reputation left for\nhim to save? Will he fall over again? Photo: AFP/Getty Images\nNICK FARMER\nSPORTS WRITER\n\n"

Photo: Henry\nHesten\nBen Howitt reports on IC Cheerleading\u2019s best competition season yet\nImperial College Cheerleading\nreturned triumphant from\nTelford on Sunday 5th\nApril,\nwith one first and two third places\nat the British Cheer Association\u2019s\nUniversity National Competition.\nSpartans, the team\u2019s all-girl small\ngroup stunt, come third in the Level\n3 division. They\u2019ve been training\ntogether since November of last year,\nchoreographing the routine among\nthemselves. Tempest, the co-ed group\nstunt, competed a few weeks ago at\nCrystal Palace, taking second place\ndespite two injuries.\nThis time around, they were\ncrowned National Champions in\nLevel 3 Co-ed, beating off challenges\nfrom 14 other squads. They also\nsettled the score with Winchester\nSpirits, who pipped them to the post\nlast time, winning the category by a\nmargin of 14 points (out of 150).\nOn University day Titans, the main\nteam, placed 12th\nout of 18 teams, with\na few falls and bobbles knocking a\nmassive difficulty score away from\nits rightful place. Given that the\nroutine was the first competition\nperformance for many members of\nthe team, it was decided to put at least\nsome of it down to nerves. The squad\nhad the highest stunt and pyramid\nscore of the day, with the points loss\nall being down to a few mistakes.\nThat evening and the following\nmorning, Jasmine Deemester (Head\nCoach), gave the team last minute\ninstructions to help us obtain the best\nresult possible. The aim was to hit a\nclean routine and leave the mat proud\nand able to say \u201cwe did the best we\ncould\u201d.\nWith the stress and anxiety of\nthe first performance done, the\nteam was able to enjoy their second\nouting much more. The Saturday\ncompetition was also open to non-university teams (what\u2019s called\nthe \u2018All Star\u2019 division), making the\ncompetition that much harder.\nOn the second day (and, for some\nmembers of the team, their last\never cheer performance) Titans hit\na nearly perfect routine and landed\n3rd\nplace in Nationals. Considering\nno one expected to place at this\ncompetition, the result came as a huge\nsurprise to all the squad. This is the\nbest result the club has obtained in its\nentire history. Every single member\nof the team gave their personal best\nand the team managed to bring\nhome a trophy as well as a paid bid\nto compete on the European Cheer\nSummit this July.\nAfter last year\u2019s less impressive\ncompetition outing (on which, in\naddition to less clean routines, the\nteam suffered from a bout of food\npoisoning), Imperial\u2019s cheerleading\nprogram was little known and less\nrespected. But the committee this\nyear, assisted hugely by Jasmine as\nthe new head coach and the sheer\nenergy and grit of the new members,\nhave turned a gaggle of newbies into\nmotivated and committed athletes.\nSanja, this year\u2019s Vice Chair, said\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about hitting a clean\nroutine, we\u2019ve all become really good\nfriends. Cheer\u2019s as much about really\nclose friends you wouldn\u2019t have even\nmet otherwise as it is about tricks and\nflips.\u201d\nThe trophies from the second\ncompetition day and the group stunt\ntrophies will be displayed by Sport\nImperial. The result has set a new\nbar for the squad, and next year\u2019s\ncommittee are aiming to attend more\nthan one competition over the year\nto get the squad more comfortable on\na competition mat before the main\nouting in Spring Term.\nIC Titans train on Monday nights\nas a squad, with a number of athletes\nalso training with London Allstar\nsquads. They won\u2019t compete again\nthis year as some of the squad are\nheading home at the end of term, but\ntraining is continuing through the\nSummer Term.\nWith this being the last year for many of the team, and the first for many others, expectations were high at competition this year.

There were protests outside the Department\nof Energy and Climate Change, as well as at the headquarters of Npower. Photo: No Dash for Gas\nBen Howitt writes as \u2018Reclaim the Power\u2019 occupy front entrance\nThe Royal School of Mines\n(RSM) entrance was occupied\non Monday 1st\nJune by a group\nof students and members of the\npublic representing the activist group\n\u2018Reclaim the Power\u2019.\nThe protest consisted of the\npresentation of a degree in Petroleum\nGeophysics to \u201cbrainwashed student\n#5102\u201d, which claimed to enable\n\u201cstudents to contribute to global\nwarming and social injustice\u201d,\nfollowed by a sit in by the group of 10\nprotesters. Some Imperial students\njoined the protesters.\nSecurity officers restricted access\nto the entrance lobby, and appeared\nto phone the police. The protest\nvacated the lobby peacefully before\nany police officers arrived, and the\ncall was retracted. One protester we\ntalked to said \u201cone of the security\nofficers showed solidarity with us. It\u2019s\nclearly an issue that\u2019s on the mind at\nImperial\u201d. Reclaim the Power did not\ncontact the security office prior to the\nprotest taking place.\nThe RSM sit-in was protesting\nthe level of investment from the\nfossil fuel industry received by\nuniversities, and Imperial College in\nparticular. The complaint runs that\nsince university departments are so\ndependent on this investment, the\ndirection of research (and therefore\npublic money) is directed by the fossil\nfuel industry.\nA press release by Reclaim the\nPower states that \u201cthey [Imperial\nCollege] invite oil executives onto\nuniversity committees and present\nthemselves publicly as \u201ca fossil fuel\nuniversity\u201d\u201d. The College\u2019s President,\nAlice Gast, also sits on the board\nof directors at Chevron, which in\n2010 sold 3.1 million barrels per\nday of refined oil products such\nas gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The\ncompany received the 2015 Lifetime\nAward of the Public Eye, a platform\nfor substantial criticism of \u201cpurely\nprofit-oriented globalisation\u201d.\nThis action reflects recent\ncampaigns by Fossil Free campaigns\nat UK universities. Oxford University\nrecently agreed not to take coal\nand tar sands investments, while\nEdinburgh University more\ncontroversially refused to divest,\nfollowing a three year campaign by\nthe students. Within the past year,\nGalhow University, the University of\nBedfordshire, and SOAS, University\nof London have agreed to divest from\nfossil fuels entirely.\nReclaim The Power ran a total of\n18 actions during the day, and 11\nprotesters were arrested across the\ncountry. Other actions have included\na blockade on the steps outside the\nDepartment of Energy and Climate\nChange, office occupations of PR\nfirms Mediazoo and Camargue, and a\nrooftop occupation of RWE Npower\u2019s\nSwindon headquarters. The last of\nthese resulted in the arrest of the two\nprotesters involved.\nReclaim the Power also ran a \u201cMass\nAction Camp\u201d at Didcot power\nstation from 29th\nMay to 2nd\nJune,\nwhich aimed to offer \u201cactions with\nmore of an arrest risk\u201d in conjunction\nwith \u201cactions that are suitable for\nfamilies with children (and face\npaint!)\u201d.\nFossil Free Imperial said of the\nprotest \u201cReclaim the Power\u2019s action\nshows that the pressure on fossil fuel\ncompanies and their associates is\ngrowing and has wide ranging vocal\nsupport. Their campaign highlights\nthe inconvenient truth about the\nstrong ties between Imperial and the\nfossil fuel industry that go far beyond\nits endowment fund. It is clear that\nImperial needs to take a strong stance\non its position in a low carbon future,\nand not allow this to become its\nKodak moment.\u201d\nImperial signs research deal in Qatar\nOn Tuesday 2nd\nJune, Imperial\nCollege London signed\nan agreement with Qatar\nUniversity (QU) and the Qatar Shell\nResearch and Technology Centre\n(QSTRC) that covered corrosion\nprevention in wet sour gas pipelines.\nThe signing took place at Qatar\nUniversity. The deal was signed by\nrepresentatives from QU and QSTRC,\nas well as Mary Ryan, Professor of\nMaterials Science and Technology at\nImperial College London.\nImperial\u2019s research on the subject\nwill hope to increase the lifetime\nof pipelines in Qatar. Qatar has\nrecently faced the technical challenge\nof dealing with the corrosion of\npipelines that transport sour oil and\ngas. The research will make use of\nstate of the art analytical techniques.\nAs part of the agreement, Qatar\nUniversity will use its Centre for\nAdvanced Materials to develop the\ncapability to study pipeline corrosion.\nThe university already provides\nassistance to the local industries in\noil, gas and processing.\nSpeaking about the signing, Dr\nHassan Al-Derham, who is the\nVice President for Research at\nQU, said \u201cAt Qatar University,\napart from providing education,\nwe enhance social change and\ncontinuous economic development\nof the country and the world at large\nthrough research and partnership\nwith industrial operators.\n\u201cThis agreement with Qatar Shell\nwhich is focused on understanding\nscaling and corrosion in sour gas\npipelines, aligns with QU\u2019s research\npriorities and is integral to Qatar\u2019s\nvision of becoming a knowledge-based society where research plays\na vital role in resolving emerging\nissues, especially concerning the oil\nand gas industry, the country\u2019s main\nsource of revenue for development.\u201d\nYoussif Saleh, the General Manager\nof QSRTC, said, \u201cIn line with the\nQatar National Vision 2030, Qatar\nShell is committed to identifying\nresearch collaborations that\naddress real challenges impacting\nour business, that bring together\ncoalitions involving key local\nresearch institutions, and which\noffer the opportunity for direct\napplicability for the benefit of the\nState of Qatar.\n\u201cShell is proud of the investments\nthat we make in innovation and\nresearch, but we\u2019re also delighted\nthat we can support Qatar\u2019s ambition\nto develop research capacity in the\ncountry.\u201d\nProf Ryan said \u201cWe are excited\nabout this new research program to\ndevelop fundamental understanding\nof complex multi-scale systems in\norder to address real world technical\nchallenges. We look forward to\nworking with QU and QSRTC to\ndevelop a new approach towards\ndelivering robust, innovative\nsolutions to pipeline integrity issues\nfacing the oil and gas industry in\nQatar.\u201d\nKUNAL WAGLE\nSECTION EDITOR\nCorrosion of pipelines has been a technical challenge for Qatari industries.

UK cinemas, anyway.\nThe Americans don\u2019t get it until 5th\nMay.\nOh, and yes, the Awesome Mix\n#2 songs are already picked. Gunn\nconfirmed he\u2019s written them into the\nscreenplay.\nYes, this is a news story. Stop\njudging. Go away.\nSony is weirdly indifferent to\nlosing Bond\nThe rights to the James Bond\nfranchise are up in the air after the\nnext film, SPECTRE, and that means\none thing: a bidding war for one of\nthe most profitable (and longest\nrunning) film series in existence.\nSony are currently responsible for\ndistributing the franchise, which\nis controlled by MGM (and Eon\nProductions), but that\u2019s not always\nbeen the case. Paramount have\npreviously held talks with MGM over\ntaking control of the franchise, while\nthere are now rumours of Warner\nBros making moves on Mr Bond.\nWith that whole profitable/famous/\nlong-running thing in contention,\nyou\u2019d expect current rights holders\nSony to care a little more about losing\ntheir biggest horse in the stable (not\nleast with their Spider-Man franchise\nnow being shared with Marvel).\nNot so, if chief Sony man Tom\nRothman (who replaced former boss\nAmy Pascal following that Sony\nhacking scandal) is to be believed.\nSpeaking to Variety, Rothman\nsaid: \u201cThe reality is that Sony\u2019s\nhad a fantastic run with the Bonds.\nSure, we\u2019re going to compete for\n[the rights], but let\u2019s be honest, so is\neverybody in the business.\u201d\nWell, he\u2019s not wrong.\nTangled gets its own TV\nseries in 2017\nThat\u2019s right, the 2010 re-telling of the\nstory of Rapunzel is heading on over\nto TV.\nThe 50th\nfeature-length film to come\nout of Disney\u2019s studios, bringing\nwith it the original leads, Mandy\nMoore and Zachary Levi, as well as\nthe real stars of the film: Pascal the\nchameleon and Maximus the horse.\nThe show is set to take place\nbetween events of the film and its\nfollow-up short (Tangled Ever After).\nIt\u2019ll also feature music from Alan\nMenken and lyrics from Glenn Slater,\nthe pair that handled musical duties\nfirst time around.\nTangled: The TV Series (or whatever\nDisney elect to call it) will be\ndropping onto the Disney Channel\nsometime in 2017.\nDisney greenlights Fantasia,\nbut cans Tron 3\nDisney\u2019s had a pretty decent run\nwith its live-action adaptations of its\nclassic properties. Maleficent, while\nbeing a fairly mediocre film, managed\na fairly hefty box office draw, while\nthis year\u2019s Cinderella managed a\ndouble victory of receiving rave\nreviews and making decent money.\nDisney have plenty more\nadaptations on their slate, including\nDumbo (oh God) and The Jungle Book\n(one of two films essentially based on\nthat book in the works).\nThey\u2019ve now added another one, in\nthe form of Fantasia.\nSpecifically, one sequence from\nFantasia, a film well-known for\nits lack of overarching story, plot,\nrecurring characters, or in fact any\nnoticeable features beyond some\ndelightful animated sequences set to\nvarious classical music.\nThe sequence in question is Night\non Bald Mountain, the part with the\nwinged demon and the dancing\ndead things and such like. It\u2019s also 11\nminutes long.\nFantasia is in the hands of Matt\nSazama and Burk Sharpless, the guys\nbehind Dracula Untold. Answers as\nto how on earth they\u2019re going to a)\nmanage this and b) not do it terribly\non a postcard, if you please.\n\n"
