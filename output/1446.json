Tom Culley has and ended up travelling through one of the poorest\nand most corrupt countries on the planet and was shocked and amazed by what he found\nI\nt might be a bit of a clich\u00e9 but\nit has to be said that Cambodia is a land of contrasts. It\nis relatively new to the tourist trail owing to a very chequered history of violence and grinding poverty, but the stories of wild,\nremote, overgrown ruins and beautiful beaches and a thriving city life are\nslowly making their way back to the\nWestern world. On the one hand it is\nthe home to the world\u2019s most awe-in-spiring temples, was once the seat of\nthe Khmer empire and is an emerging\neconomy which is slowly catching up\nwith Thailand and Vietnam after the\nSE Asian financial crisis. On the other hand, it is littered with landmines\nand Unexploded Ordinance (UXOs)\nmaking much of the country uninhabitable and it was almost destroyed\nas a result of one of the biggest social\nexperiments in modern times.\nNow, for those of you as ignorant of\nCambodian history as I was, we shall\nneed a short history lesson before I\ncontinue.\nIn the sixties and early seventies\nCambodia was heavily bombed by\nthe Americans who were fighting\nin Vietnam, which was followed by\na civil war until 1975. That year the\nKhmer Rouge took control of Phnom\nPenh, and hence the country, and\nforced everyone into the countryside.\nAll the cities, industries and money\nwere abandoned leaving the entire\npopulation to live in small communes\ngrowing rice. There was no choice in\nthe matter, regardless of the fact that\nmost people did not know how to\nfarm because they had grown up in\nthe cities. The new government was\nattempting social engineering on a\nmassive scale which involved reverting back to a subsistence lifestyle, one\nin which class distinctions did not\nexist. This was bad news for anyone\nwho had an education or access to fi-nances, and people wearing glasses or\nwho could speak a foreign language\nwere executed as parasites. And all\nthis happened only thirty years ago,\nso at least half of the current population were directly affected by it.\nMy journey started by flying from\nKuala Lumpur to Phnom Penh with\nAir Asia, Malaysia\u2019s answer to Ryanair\nbut with cheap and efficient service.\nMy first port of call was the Lakeside,\nwhere all the best guesthouses were\nsituated with awesome views across\nthe lake. However, for some reason\nthe lake is being filled in with sand in\norder to build hotels and casinos for\nthe nouveau riche of Cambodia, so if\nyou want to see it you\u2019d better do it\nsoon because by next summer it will\nprobably be all gone.\nThe most famous attractions in\nPhnom Penh, if you can call them\nsuch, are situated some way from the\nlake, so the only way to get around is\nby putting your life in the hands of a\ntuk-tuk driver and praying that you\ndon\u2019t hit another vehicle travelling\nthe wrong way. The pilgrimage to the\nKilling Fields and the notorious S21\ndetention centre are an essential part\nof visiting the country and is almost\nan initiation to help you appreciate it\nso much more. I was letting myself in\nfor one of the best, if most horrific,\ndays of my travels.\nThe Killing Fields was not much to\nlook at other than the Memorial Pagoda containing 9,000 skulls of the\nvictims that died there. Signs signifying the mass graves were dotted\naround, although I think the Killing\nTree distressed me the most. The\nTree was where the children and\nbabies were tortured and executed,\nmostly by having their heads bashed\nin against the trunk. It seemed a bit\nsurreal, especially considering the\nschool next door where the children\nplay in the river as though nothing\nspecial had ever happened there.\nI am in fact more surprised by the\nlack of respect shown by many west-erners. Several girls were posing for\nphotographs next to the grinning\nskulls, while one guy I met in Thailand\ntold me how he had found a tooth on\nthe ground and kept it as a souvenir,\nwhich is pretty much grave robbing as\nfar as I\u2019m concerned. But then again,\nfar worse crimes have been committed than stealing a tooth.\nThe next stop was at S21, formerly\nthe Tuol Sleng School, which was\nconverted into a torture camp early\non in the regime. Inmates were tortured for information or even just for\nfun at the whim of the camp warden,\nDuch, and those that were unlucky\nenough to survive the torture were\nmostly shipped off to the various killing fields around the country where\nthey were dispatched with a pickaxe\nor shovel to the head, to save on bul-lets. Coincidentally, Duch is currently\nhaving his own \u2018Nuremberg Trial\u2019 and\nis likely to be jailed for life. I only\nfound out it was happening a few days\nlater so I missed an opportunity to\nwatch a war crimes trial for myself.\nThe building is preserved mostly as\nit was left by the withdrawing Khmer\nRouge, with many rooms containing\na simple wrought-iron bed and photographs of people lying on the beds\nwith their blood covering the floor.\nIn one room was an exhibition with\nthe photos of every person that had\npassed through the Centre, including\nsmall children, and it was odd looking\nthem all in the eye and knowing they\nall died horrible deaths at the hands\nof their peers.\nI had spent two hours in the school\nbefore I had even noticed the time,\nand having had enough of death for\nthe day, I headed back to the lake.\nMoving onto the rest of the country seemed a good idea after that, so I\ntook the first bus to Sihanoukville on\nthe coast. For those of you that have\nnot been to Asia, the roads are an experience in themselves. Road laws do\nnot exist and so to get around, drivers\nThe view of Lakeside in Phnom Penh from the Happy Guesthouse\nThe daily commute in Cambodia back to town at sunset along the estuary in Kampot.\nOne of the more horrific uses of a tree, just to save on bullets\n\n"

Why is this?\nBroadly speaking, society has been\npushing forward for a \u2018green\u2019 change in\nhabits and technology; however, many\nstill question the need to go green.\nAlso, narrowingly speaking, the issue\nof what\u2019s \u2018green\u2019 or not is controverse.\nSuch is the case of bioplastics and biodegradable plastics.\nBiopolymers have been around way\nbefore humanity, appearing, disap-pearing, mixing, dispersing, forming\norganisms, forming more complex or-ganisms; even more complex than the\nplots of Mexican or Venezuelan soap\noperas. In the same way that these\nsoap operas are full of beautiful people,\nbiopolymers are full of beautiful mol-ecules. Look at DNA; how impressive\nis that with its long double helix shape?\nAnd multifunctional proteins with\ntheir sensor-actuator characteristics?!\nA biopolymer is a polymer (a long\nmolecule comprised by repeated small\nmolecules, the monomers) derived\nfrom renewable sources (e.g. vegetable\noil or starch). A bioplastic is a biopoly-mer with something mixed, such as\npigment to give colour to the mixture.\nBiodegradable is a characteristic of\na material being broken down into\nsmaller molecules or elements by living organisms.\nNot all bioplastics are biodegradable,\nas is the case of Polyamide 11, used in\nautomotive applications. We can then\ndivide bioplastics into two main fields:\nthose that are biodegradable, with the\npackaging industry being the main\nconsumer and those that are not bio-degradable, mainly found in the automotive and electronics industries.\nAs with everything in life, everyone\nhas a different definition of what is a\nbiodegradable plastic. To address this\nissue, the International Organisation\nfor Standardisation (ISO) released\nthe standard EN13432, establishing\nhow fast and in which conditions a\nplastic must degrade.\nThe other issue that generates great\ndiscussion (mostly due to commercial and not scientific or engineering\naspects) is whether bioplastics have\na lower environmental impact than\n\u201cpetroplastics\u201d. Both sides should\nnot be dismissed, however, the opponents of bioplastics generally do not\ntake into account (many times, con-sciously) that the technology is new\nand that the economies of scale are\nstill not as developed as in petroplas-tics, in spite of continuing to show a\npromising increase. Statistics vary,\nbut bioplastics consumption has\nbeen growing at about 17 % per year\nand is forecasted to reach 900 kilo-metric tons in 2013. Now, it\u2019s important to have in mind that this is less\nthan 1 % of the total yearly consumption of plastic.\nLeaving Mexican soap operas and\nchemistry aside, let\u2019s talk about the\nengineering of bioplastics.\nPresently, they have 3 main drawbacks that reduce their utilisation\ncompared to petroplastics: manufacturing difficulty, lower performance,\nand higher cost. So, the obvious markets are those where products have a\nshort life and/or are reasonably protected from certain environmental\nconditions, and mass-produced. For\nthese reasons and together with environmental concerns and marketing\n(the \u2018look-good-to-others\u2019 factor),\nNunoHelder Science Reporter\nAre revolutionary bioplastics environmentally sound?\nShupaula Dass Science Reporter\nWhen perusing a footballer\u2019s shopping\nlist, one would expect to find not much\nout of the ordinary. Vitamins, protein\nshakes, lean beef steaks, thongs, and\nhorse placenta. Okay, perhaps shopping for Black Beauty\u2019s placenta is a bit\nextreme. But players can receive treatment for their injuries using equine\nplacental fluid. Just when we thought\nthese pillars of male finesse could not\ntranscend any higher levels of bizarre-ness, they do. Arsenal\u2019s Van Persie is\nthe latest player to surrender the bread\nand butter that is his ankle to Dr Kovacevic for treatment. But this is not\nthe first time the placenta has been\nused, and indeed, is not its only use.\nThe placenta, from the Latin word\nfor \u2018cake\u2019, is unique to mammals. Connecting a fetus to the uterine wall it\ndelivers oxygen and food, taking away\nany fetal waste. As culture has evolved,\nso has perception of it. In Nigeria, the\nNibo people view the placenta as the\ndeceased twin of the baby and conduct a funeral for it. Then there are\npeople spread throughout the world\nwho eat it. The act of eating the pla-centa, for anyone who wants to use this\nas a dinner date discussion is placen-tophagy. Humans who tantalise their\ntaste buds in this activity come from\nAmerica, Europe, and Mexico to name\na few places in the world. Animals, including herbivores also eat placentas.\nApart from placentophagy being believed to alleviate postpartum depres-sion, it is also used as an ingredient in\nsome Chinese medicines. Medicallyspeaking, the placenta contains a lipid\ncompound named prostaglandin. The\npresence of the compound stimulates\nthe return to normal size of the uterus.\nOxytocin is present in small quantities,\neasing stress of the birth process.\nSo what\u2019s with the recent placenta\ncraze? Robin Van Persie is the answer\nto this. Through the sporting grapevine Van Persie heard of Dr Kovacevic\u2019s\nmiracle cures for injuries. Before he\nleft he commented that the doctor is\n\u2018vague about her methods but I know\nshe massages you using fluid from a\nplacenta.\u2019\nAnother treated native Serbian player was able to offer a more detailed\nexplanation. \u201cShe uses a combination\nof electricity and the miracle gel that\nis her exclusive product. The electric\ncurrent goes through a stick holding\nthe gel, which is applied to the injured\nspot.\u201d\nThere must have been something\nin that gel. Physiotherapists predicted\nLiverpool striker Yossi Benayoun to\nbe out for up to 5 weeks, healing from\na hamstring injury. After receiving\nthe placental treatment, he was back\nwithin a week. On the pitch. Not only\nwas he able to play, but he scored the\nequalising goal.\nThe treatment however does not\nseem to work for all players and there\nare people who remain skeptical of it\neven within the sporting profession.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger is\namong them claiming that sometimes\nit \u201ccan be psychological for the players\nto feel they can be helped. I'm not a fan,\nbut I'm not a doctor either. I respect\nthe freedom of everybody to be treated\nin the way they want to be treated.\u201d\nNumbers of players considering this\ntreatment have risen. Almost as high as\nthe result from the recent Spurs/Wigan\ngame. Yet the treatment has not been\nscientifically supported, thus causing\nmuch uproar. Dr Mariana Kovacevic\nhas not registered her business under\nSerbian law which could cause problems for her patients. Her clinic will be\nshut down until she files the necessary\npaperwork to legalise her business,\nthat is, if officials can find her. Van Persie left for treatment but has not been\nreported to have turned up at the \u201cofficial\u201d Kovakcevic clinic. She is shady as\nshe is notorious. Rumours of her miracle secret formula have spread to other\nEuropean teams, such as Real Madrid,\nwho have asked the Serbian doctor to\ndivulge her recipe.\nMadness. Pure madness is the only\nway to describe this placental con-troversy. Sure it\u2019s a useful organ, full\nof goodness, eaten for hundreds of\nyears. I don\u2019t doubt that. What I question is the mental state of ball-kicking,\nthong-wearing players that represent\nthis wonderfully-conservative island.\nVictoria Beckham\u2026forget your knick-er drawer, worry about what\u2019s behind\nDavid\u2019s motivation for you popping out\nanother one.\nArsenal striker Robin Van Persie after a horrific challenge from a dirty Italian\nA massage using fluid from horse placentas? It\u2019s all the rage for the treatment of sport-related injuries\nthe packaging (e.g. trays, containers,\nand bags) and automotive (interior\ntrim and under-the-bonnet applica-tions) industries, followed by the electronics (e.g. laptop and mobile casings)\nindustry are investing more and more\nin these materials.\nNot all bioplastics are biodegradable;\nthey tend to be harder to manufacture\nand have lower performance. Due to\nthis, they are found in particular ap-plications, mostly in packaging, automotive and electronics. While their\nconsumption has been growing about\n17 % per year, they still amount for\nless than 1 % of the yearly plastic con-sumption. As they are relatively \u201cnew\u201d,\nthe science and technology involved\nis recent, leading to a higher cost and\nsome controversy regarding sustain-ability. There is another advantage to\nbioplastics...some of them are edible\nand yummy.\nWho\u2019s up for some starch?\nThe Honda FC Sport Concept is a hydrogen fuel cell sports car with body panels made from bioplastics\n\n"

Almost two thirds of the new infections occurred there as well. The second\nmost affected region is South and South-East Asia (3.8 million), followed by\nLatin America (2.0 million).\nSome improvements have been made however, as the death toll from AIDS\nhas fallen by 10 percent over the past five years, largely due to greater access\nto anti-retroviral drugs.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of infection has fallen to 400,000 people in\n2008, down 15 percent from 2001. In the same time frame, new infections\ndecreased by 25 percent in East Asia, and 10 percent in South and South-East\nAsia.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nT\nhe European Union elected Belgian Prime Minister Herman\nvan Rompuy as\nthe first President of the\nEuropean Union Council,\nand Lady Catherine Ashton\nof the UK as its new High\nRepresentative for Foreign\nAffairs and Security Policy.\nThe nominations come after\nthe ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which establishes mandates for the two\nroles, but the exact distribution of power will depend significantly on how\nthe roles are managed by Mr. Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton. Both politicians\nwere relatively unknown, unlike other candidates who had been touted for\nthe job. The decision should ensure that individual nations will retain their\nvoice on the world stage, instead of becoming subject to the European Union\u2019s will.\nFollowing his selection, Mr. Van Rompuy stressed his credentials as a consensus politician, and indeed his 10 months as Prime Minister in Belgium\nhave been successful in bridging the gaps between the country\u2019s linguistically divided communities. He made it clear that he would fulfill the role of a\nchairman rather than a \u2018globe-trotting statesman\u2019. Lady Ashton\u2019s nomination,\nwhich is seen as a concession to the UK, has come under attack from critics \u2013\nshe has never held a directly elected position and has served in her previous\nrole as European Trade Commissioner for just over a year.\nEuropean Union\nM\nexico has seen its credit rating downgraded to BBB by Fitch\nRatings, following a fall in output from the oil sector as its\nreserves in the Gulf of Mexico are drying up.\nFitch, a rating agency, said that decreasing oil incomes,\nwhich make up a third of Mexico\u2019s public sector revenues, have weakened\nthe country\u2019s ability to weather financial problems. The rating was reduced\nfrom BBB+ to BBB, which means that the government will now face increased\ncosts of borrowing.\nWhile this rating remains of \u2018investment grade\u2019, a statement from Mexico\u2019s\nTreasury Department said President Felipe Calderon has made important advances to address the structural weaknesses pointed out by Fitch and implement reforms that can increase competitiveness and growth.\nMexico\nWorld\nThe Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer paid a visit to Sir Roy Anderson and Imperial College London on\nTuesday 24th November, with an aim\nto highlight the Conservatives\u2019 green\nideas for the UK economy.\nGeorge Osborne began the evening\nby meeting with Sir Roy to discuss the\npotential that science and technology research holds for the UK. Sir Roy spoke of\nthe event: \u201cIt\u2019s highly appropriate that the\nShadow Chancellor should take an interest in green technologies\u2026 Products\nand solutions developed at places like\nImperial will ensure the UK\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness on the global stage.\u201d After their discussion, Mr. Osborne gave a\nspeech to academics, environmentalists\nand media in the Business School. This\nwas followed by a question and answer\nsession about the proposals made during\nhis speech.\nIt is not the first time that Mr. Osborne has visited Imperial: in February\n2008, Mr. Osborne held a speech in the\nSAF Building which addressed the UK\u2019s\nenvironmental technology and in par-ticular, praised Imperial College for its\ninvestment in environmentally green\ntechnology.\nHe called for more universities to follow Imperial\u2019s lead and create their own\nincubator model, which gives green\ntechnology entrepreneurs the financial\nsupport and business expertise they\nrequire.\nThe proposals made during Mr. Osborne\u2019s speech on Tuesday evening came\nas no surprise, as he had personally written in The Independant that morning to\nannounce his plans for the economy. His\nspeech therefore reiterated what he had\nalready published, as well as what other\npress had promptly reported on, which\nincludes:\n\u2022 Paying the public to recycle\n\u2022 Giving government Departments\nConservatives keen to go green\nless money if they fail to reduce\nenergy consumption\n\u2022 Creating a green trading market\n\u2022 Cutting government CO2 emissions by 10% in 12 months\nMr. Osborne said: \u201cI think we can go\neven further in catalysing green finance\nin the UK. In my speech here at Imperial last year, I proposed the creation of a\nnew green trading market...\u201d This trading\nmarket, called the Environmental Opportunities Index, currently has almost a\nhundred companies signed up.\nThe notion of the Conservatives going green was exhausted in Mr. Osborne\u2019s article in The Independant, in\nwhich he used the word \u2018green\u2019 no less\nthan 18 times. His speech presented the\nidea of Green Investment Banks, which\nhe claims \u201cwill help us\u2026to decarbonise\nour economy\u201d. He also spoke about the\ncompany RecycleBank which has been\nable to increase recycling in America\n\u201cby paying the public to recycle - without the need for any extra government\nspending.\u201d\nAll of the proposals set by Mr. Osborne, and his five other colleagues\nwithin the same week, are clearly in\npreparation for the global negotiations\nin Copenhagen next month. Given the\nConservatives\u2019 anti-EU agenda, it is difficult to see how they will successfully act\non climate change alone.\nJoanna Cai News Reporter\nNews Editor\n\u2018Mad\u2019him\u2019 Shubber\nMedic News Editor\nDina Ismail\nAssistant Editor\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nLayout Editor\nCarlos Karingal\nComment Editor\nRavi Pall\nPolitics Editors:\nJames Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nJames Lees\nPhillip Murray\nBusiness Editor\nSina Ataherian\nInternational Editor\nRaphael Houdmont\nFilm Editors\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nEd \u2018Flatcap\u2019 Knock\nTechnology Editor\nSamuel Gibbs\nFashion Editor\nKawai Wong\nMusic Editors\nKadhim Shubber\nAlex Ashford\nLuke Turner\nTravel Editor\nDyldo Lowe\nOlivia Davies\nScience Editors\nBrigette Atkins\nNathan Ley\nNightlife Editor\nCharlotte Morris\nWhat\u2019s On Editors\nRachel D\u2019oliviero\nLily Topham\nCoffee Break Editor\nCharles Murdoch\nClubs and Socs Editor\nAlex Kendall\nPuzzles Commodores\nSean Farris\nMilli Begum\nSports Editors\nMustapher Botchway\nDavid Wilson\nIndy Leclercq\nArts Editors\nCaz Knight\nRosie Milton\nLucy Harrold\nPhotography\nBen Smith\nAlex Karapetian\nCatnip Editor\nRhys Davies\nGames Editors\nMike Cook\nFeature Editor\nAfonso Campos\nCopy Editors\nRhys Davies\nAlex Karapetian\nMatt Colvin\nLizzy Griffiths\nAyyub Kamaludin\nJoanna Cai\nJamie Beal\nRichard Howard\nStefan Zeeman\nRox Middleton\nfelix was brought to you by:\nEditor-in-Chief\nDan Wan\nDeputy Editor\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nGilead Amit\nCopy Chief\nSasha Nicoletti\nGeorge Osborne spoke about his vision for a green agenda at Imperial\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nPolitics Editors James Goldsack, Katya-yani Vyas, James Lees and Phil Murray\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nNobody\u2019s in\npower\nIt has been a tumultuous week in\npolitics. Firstly the President of Europe has been elected, the little known\nBelgian Prime minister, Herman van\nRompuy, is now set to ascend to the\nworld stage and represent Europe to\nthe world; and this appointment has\nbeen causing quite some controversy.\nHe certainly doesn\u2019t seem to have the\n\u201ctraffic stopping power\u201d of other world\nleaders. Frankly it will look a bit ridiculous at a press conference where he is\nrepresenting Europe with other world\nleaders such as: Hu Jintao, President of\nChina and as a result, in charge of the\nlargest military in the world; Barack\nObama, the man running the country with the largest economy in the\nworld; and Herman van Rompuy, the\nman who was PM for 11 months of the\ncountry which... has the world\u2019s only\nfully lit road network?\nStill, on the other side of the argu-ment, the new position is not the leader of a country like Jintao\u2019s or Obama\u2019s,\nhis role is mainly to chair meetings of\nthe European Council. The European\nCouncil is made up of the leaders of\nthe member states and it is they who\nhave elected van Rompuy into his new\nposition. The decision was made behind closed doors at a dinner/meeting\nof the Council, where they also divvied up the other top jobs created by\nthe newly ratified Lisbon treaty. One of\nthese was the new high representative\nfor foreign affairs and security which\nhas gone to Baroness Ashton- a British\nLabour peer.\nThis decision seems to be generating\nmuch more controversy, in Britain at\nleast, than the election of van Rompuy.\nWhile neither has much political clout,\nat least not as of yet, van Rompuy has\nbeen widely hailed as a success in Belgium. Van Rompuy has been praised\nfor the way he has held the Belgian\ngovernment together despite difficulties arising partially from separatist\nmovements.\nBaroness Ashton though, is much\nless commendable. After failing to get\nelected to the House of Commons she\nwas made a life peer by Labour and\neventually became leader of the House\nof Lords. Then, last year, after Peter\nMandelson returned, she took on his\njob as commissioner for trade for Europe. So essentially she has never been\nelected by the public and has no experience with foreign affairs.\nOf course it\u2019s no great surprise that\ntwo \u2018nobodies\u2019 have been elected into\nthe new roles. If they were to take on\nany real power then it would take away\ncontrol from Paris and Berlin, something unwanted by France or Germany.\nThe status quo remains- Europe won\u2019t\nproject the views of Europe but of\nFrance and Germany.\nAll said and done, I am in favour of\nthe appointment of a relative unknown\nfor the top job. If the role had been\nfilled by a political power-house then\nthe job would have evolved from being a chairman of the council to being\na chief, in much the same way as the\nPresident of the US is nothing like the\njob laid out in the constitution origi-nally. This would mean a \u2018real\u2019 President of Europe and that needs a \u2018real\u2019\ncountry, which has to result in even\nless sovereignty in each member state\nand as such, a lesser degree of control\nby the people as we traipse along the\nroad to a big centralised government.\nAlso in the news this week was the\nstate opening of Parliament which\npeaks with the Queen\u2019s speech. Of\ncourse the Queen\u2019s speech is in fact\nthe government\u2019s speech: all of the bills\nthat the government plans to bring\ninto law over the course of the year are\nannounced normally preceded by \u201cMy\ngovernment will\u201d. Effectively, at least in\nthese situations, our monarch is a puppet so frankly, I wish someone would\npull her strings to do something more\nentertaining like the dicks, pussies and\nassholes speech in Team America.\nUnfortunately it would seem that the\ngovernment has a much more twisted\nsense of humour. Instead they made\nher read out a list of things that are\nsimply never going to happen, which\nmight also be called the Labour mani-festo. With the Tories luckily still in\nthe lead for the next general election\nand the Lib Dems saying they won\u2019t\nsupport Labour if the election ends in\na hung parliament, it is extremely unlikely that any bill proposed by Labour\nnow will ever make it into law.\nThis brings to mind having the\nQueen do something much more\nsensible- dissolving parliament. This\nis what King Abduallah of Jordan has\ndone this week, forcing an ineffectual\ngovernment to break up and go to early\nelections. Of course nothing is ever as\nblack and white as that, with the opposition saying it has been done to force\nthrough proposals that couldn\u2019t be\npassed otherwise. In Britain though,\nI can\u2019t see a single good reason to let\nLabour carry on running the country\nwith the unelected Gordon Brown at\nits head.\nA personal highlight of the proposals from the Queen\u2019s speech for me\nwas the idea of writing into law that the\ngovernment must cut the deficit in the\nnext 4 years. Who exactly is going to go\nto jail for that?\nMore sensible ideas are being pushed\nby the Tories however, David Cameron\nhas announced that if they are elected\nin then they will hold an emergency\nbudget within 50 days. The Conservatives are actually slipping in polls at the\nmoment, with their lead now at the\nlowest point since December last year.\nSome police are also threatening\nto quit over the Conservative plans\nto have elected local commissioners.\nWhich is understandable, you can\u2019t\nhave a Police state if it\u2019s democratic,\nand of course the Police aren\u2019t legally\nallowed to go on strike so they would\nhave to quit.\nJames Lees Politics Editor\nNorth Korea has had a troubled history for such a young nation\nNorth Korea vs Human Rights\nFive North Korean refugees were recently arrested in China after fleeing\ntheir country. They are likely to be forcibly repatriated to face ill treatment.\nNorth Korea was officially established as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in 1948 and has been\ncommunist ever since. The guiding\nprinciple of its dictatorship is the idea\nof Juche (self reliance). This has resulted in the brutal oppression of the\ncountry\u2019s 24 million strong population.\nDemocratic only in name, its people\nsuffer terribly.\nUp to a million people are kept imprisoned in North Korea. There is no\njudicial mechanism whereby North\nKoreans can be heard by an impartial\njudge, and where allegations of wrongdoing by authorities can be answered.\nPolitical dissidents (such as Christians\nand democrats) are sent to a prison\ncalled a Guryujang which is divided\ninto two facilities: one for \u2018preliminary\nexamination\u2019 and the other inside the\ncamp. According to the Citizen Alliance for North Korean Human Rights,\nmost of those sent to this latter camp\ndo not survive. The Government also\npractices the principle of guilt by as-sociation. Without a legal basis, up to\nthree generations \u2013 grandparents, parents and children \u2013 related to the accused can also be incarcerated.\nAccording to Amnesty International,\nprisoners are forced to undertake physically demanding work for ten or more\nhours each day, 7 days every week. Prisoners are punished if suspected of \u201clying, not working fast enough or forgetting the words of patriotic songs\u201d\n.\nDue to the combination of forced\nhard labour, inadequate food, beatings,\nlack of medical care and unhygienic\nliving conditions, many prisoners fall\nill, with some having died in custody\nor soon after release. Torture is regularly used in interrogation facilities,\n\u201csometimes to the point of disabil-ity, paralysis or death\u201d. Prisoners have\nalso reportedly been used for medical,\nchemical and biological experiments.\nA recent report by the organisation Christian Solidarity Worldwide\n(CSW) has found that pregnancy is\nnot allowed in prison and testimonies\nshow that, \u201cshould efforts by authorities to induce abortion not be success-ful, babies alive at birth are killed...\nsome accounts even describe prisoners being forced to kill their newly\nborn child\u201d. Women detained for having crossed the border have suffered\nsimilar treatment.\nAccording to CSW, North Korean\ndefectors give testimonies of executions both inside and outside the detention and prison system. Inside, the\npenalty has reportedly been carried\nout for acts such as \u201cforaging for or\nstealing food, attempting to escape,\nrioting, assaulting guards, refusing to\nabandon religious beliefs and criticizing the country\u201d.\nIt has also been used as a punishment for those North Koreans, repatriated from a neighbouring country,\nwho have had contact with South Koreans or Christians. Outside the prison\nsystem, the acts subject to execution\nare often simple efforts such as those\nto secure food.\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) reported that North Korean children\nface discrimination and punishment\non the basis of the status, activities,\nopinions or beliefs of their parents, or\nother family members, and that collective punishment of a whole family\nis common for political offenses. The\nAsia Centre for Human Rights (ACHR)\nhas found authorities evade reporting\non torture or abuse against children in\nprisons or by national agencies.\nThey have also found that \u201ccustody\nfacilities serving the purpose of protecting children without parents, or\nthose forcibly separated from their\nparents, resemble rather a detention\nfacility more than a protection facility\u201d.\nChildren in these centres are \u201cdeprived\nof education and exploited for labour\u201d.\nThe ACHR has also found that, despite the fact that the minimum working age defined by law is 16 years old, it\nis commonly accepted that children are\nmobilised for agricultural work from\ntheir middle-school years (12 years\nold). In the poverty-stricken Northern provinces, children are mobilized\nas early as 8-9 years old. Children also\nhave other \u201cassignments\u201d such as raising rabbits, but also are mobilised for\nheavy labour, such as flood damage re-covery, railway maintenance and road\npaving.\nAccording to the ACHR, there were\nreports of \u201cchildren being sentenced to\ndeath\u201d and that authorities make the\nwatching of public executions compul-sory, in the hope of preventing juvenile\ncrime. The ACHR also found reports\nof \u201c11 year-old children sent to forced\nlabour camps for stealing electric\nwires.\u201d\nWith the world\u2019s focus on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, it is essential\nthat we remember the immense suffering of the North Koreans themselves.\nThey have no one to speak for them;\nno natural resources or strategic position that could be of real interest to\nus in London. But we must speak for\nthem. Suffering on this scale cannot\nand must not be ignored.\nOrganisations such as Amnesty International are doing great work in\napplying political pressure on the\ncountry via the UN, lobbying our own\nambassadors to intervene and getting\ninto the country to compile evidence\nagainst the Orwellian regime.\nRory Fenton\n\n"

Gopnik has typical middle American problems: his wife is leaving him\nfor another man, his daughter steals\nhis money and his son lives in fear of\nhis marijuana dealer. His misfortune\nis unrelenting, and in his desperation\nhe follows the advice of those around\nhim and turns to his religion. But\nwhen the Rabbis can\u2019t offer him more\nthan meaningless parables and empty\nwords he becomes truly lost. It\u2019s a prudent critique on a modern society in\nwhich people increasingly find religion\nincompatible with their problems.\nYou really feel for Gopnik as he tries\nto reach out to the people around him,\nonly to have them fob him off and say\nthings like \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you\u201d.\nGopnik often tries to do the right\nthing, only to have it blow up in his face.\nAt one point a student leaves a bribe in\nhis office expecting it to improve his\ngrades. However, he hasn\u2019t reckoned\nby Gopnik\u2019s excellent moral character,\nand finds himself being reported. The\nComparisons to Gran Torino aside, an\nOAP vigilante set on revenge-fuelled\nkilling spree is an interesting idea to\nsay the least. Harry Brown is Director Daniel Barber\u2019s first feature length\nproduction, and a memorable one as\nwell.\nThe film starts extremely poign-antly, following Harry Brown (Michael\nCaine) through his gloomy and bleak\nlife. Brown is an ex-marines pensioner\nwho has lost it all. The passing of his\nwife and his daughter has left him\nalone in his shabby council estate flat.\nHe\u2019s a frequent witness to drugs and\nviolence on his estate, although the\npolice apparently do nothing about it.\nAfter the murder of his one remaining\nfriend, Leonard (David Bradley), he is\nleft a broken man with nothing left to\nlose.\nQuicker than you can say ASBO, the\nex-marine within Brown is released-with inevitable bloody consequences.\nMichael Caine is brilliant, and gathers\nthe best bits of Rambo and Columbo\nto form the ruthless Harry Brown.\nBrown\u2019s first stop is to acquire a gun\nfrom some ridiculous junky drug deal-ers, and from then, the heart-of-gold\npensioner\u2019s only concern is the life\nof Leonard\u2019s murderer. The film becomes more and more over-the-top\nas Brown\u2019s journey continues, yet still\nmanages to keep momentum with several heart-stopping moments.\nThe estate is (somewhat unrealisti-cally) portrayed as a venomous, hateful place where you can be potentially\nstabbed at every corner. At the same\ntime, it appears to be completely impenetrable by any police investigation.\nAn earnest police detective (Emily\nMortimer) is given the case. She follows Brown through the film, and is\nthe only person in the police force who\nbelieves an OAP is capable of killing\nstudent\u2019s dad later visits Gopnik to tell\nhim he\u2019s going to sue him for defama-tion. Our instinct, programmed by\nyears of happy Disney endings, tells us\nthat Gopnik will be rewarded for his\nbehaviour, but it just causes him more\nproblems. It\u2019s a refreshingly honest depiction of reality. After all, bad things\nhappen to good people.\nThe film\u2019s execution can\u2019t be faulted,\nand it feels like a labour of love that a\nlot of thought has gone into. It\u2019s a film\nthat perhaps might slip under your\nradar, but still has a lot to offer. The\nCoen\u2019s sharp script, and their lack of\nconcession in portraying a relentlessly\nhonest life, means this film has a resonance that will leave you thinking for\nlonger than most films will.\nA\ns many people were this\nsummer, I wasn\u2019t so excited by the impending\nTransformers sequel but\nmore so by Inglourious\nBasterds, the return-to-form film by\nQuentin Tarrantino we had all been\npromised. However it wasn\u2019t the masterpiece we had been anticipating,\nwith Christoph Waltz\u2019s exquisite performance being diluted by a too ambitious script and \u2018ahem\u2019 Eli Roth (which\nshould distract any director from casting their friends again). But the most\ninteresting aspect of the film was the\nalternative history plot which became\napparent towards the end of the film.\nAlong with bad science, Hollywood\nis notorious for its rather imaginative\nversions of history and it\u2019s inaccurate\nportrayals of eras by-gone (especially\nbiblical and medieval). What makes Inglourious Basterds different is that Tarrantino decided to take this clich\u00e9 and\nrun with it setting up an all-American,\nguns blazing, Dirty Dozen style climax\noozing with delicious self-depreciating\nirony. Unfortunately this was lost on\nsome people and they left the cinema\nscratching their heads; \u201cBut I thought\nHitler shot himself!\u201d I, on the other\nhand, thought it was brilliant and it got\nme thinking how it had taken so long\nfor someone to ridicule this tradition\nof historical butchery which is nearly as\nlong as the history of Hollywood itself.\nU-571 is the most notorious offender.\nThe story of a brave American submarine crew capturing the German\nenigma machine during WWII was\nsure to be a big crowd pleaser but there\nwas one major error - the submarine\nwas British. There was such an uproar\nabout this insult to our veterans that\nthe president Bill Clinton actually offered an apology.\nThe Americans love to screw with\nour history, probably because they\nhave little of it themselves and there is\none man who can\u2019t resist mixing melodrama into antiquity. Let me introduce\npublic enemy No.1 - Mel Gibson. Mel\nhas directed a long list of abominations including The Passion (based on\nmedieval plays performed to incite\nanti-Semitism) and Apocalypto, which\nconfuses the Mayans with the Aztecs\nand completely fabricates their whole\nculture. But when it comes to British\nhistory, Mel is at his destructive best. I\nimagine him crouched over the Bayeux\nTapestry, spray paint in hand and giddy\nwith excitement over the prospect of\ndefacing King Harold and drawing penises all over William the Conqueror.\nI\u2019ll let Mel off the hook for The Patriot,\nas he only starred in it but he must\natone for Braveheart. This trial will be\ncontroversial for I am going against\nthe judgment of the most \u2018enlightened\u2019\nAcademy who thought he deserved an\nOscar. Charged with irreversible damage to British history, will the defendant Mel Gibson please take to the dock:\nProsecutor: Mr. Gibson, do you not\nbelieve your character, William Wallace, would have been insulted as his\nportrayal as a peasant?\nDefendant: Well, more people can\nidentifywithhimifhewasacommoner.\nProsecutor: But that\u2019s twisting the\ntruth, he was a knight and therefore a\nnoble. And why did you decide to reduce Scottish society from a sophisticated network of Medieval towns and\nvillages to mud huts and drab colours\nmore atune to the Dark Ages?\nDefendant: Well, that\u2019s what people\nwant to see!\nProsecutor: But it\u2019s detrimental to the\nScottish people as well. Primae Noctis? Most historians agree that never\nexisted.\nDefendant: But I needed the audience\nto hate the English.\nProsecutor: I gathered that from the\nfilm. You never made it clear Edward\nLongshanks was trying to end centuries of Scottish invasions of Northern\nEngland and secure his borders by occupying Scotland.\nDefendant: I did show Wallace sacking York.\nProsecutor: But that never happened\ntoo. You also managed to confuse the\nBattle of Stirling Bridge with the Battle of Bannokburn, most noticeably by\nleaving out the bridge.\nDedendant: I wanted a big battle\nscene!\nProsecutor: Why didn\u2019t you do a film\non Bannokburn then?\nDefendant: Because Wallace wasn\u2019t at\nthat battle.\nProsecutor: Of course, he was your\ncharacter. Do you not feel guilty turning him into a paedophile? You have\nhim impregnating Queen Isabelle of\nFrance in the film, a girl who would\nhave been three years old.\nDefendant: Hello? Sophie Marceau?\nProsecutor: Oh Catherine McCormack wasn\u2019t good enough for you? Her\ncharacter didn\u2019t exist either. Your \u2018convincing\u2019 Scottish accent, what part of\nScotland does it come from?\nDefendant: Erm, Edinburgh?\nProsecutor: But Wallace was born\ncloser to Glasgow, not in the Highlands\nwhich you decided he was.\nDefendant: But Highlanders get to\nwear kilts and woad paint!\nProsecutors: The Celts stopped wearing woad a thousand years before and\nthe tartan kilt wasn\u2019t invented until\nthe 19th century and probably by an\nEnglishman!\nDefendant: Err well, it looked good...\nand blue matches my eyes.\nProsecutor: I rest my case.\nI hope now you might understand\nmy wrath for every time I hear some\nsay Braveheart was a \u201cwell good film\u201d.\nIt started a dangerous surge of anti-English feeling in Scotland with sensationalist crap whilst most Scots didn\u2019t\nrealise they were being mocked. The\nJury\u2019s verdict? Guilty.\nthe hoodlums \u2013 ridiculous no?\nAt the intense climax of the film, the\npolice raid the estate, and cause a riot\nwhich they cannot stop. Despite the\nobvious obstructions, Brown manages to shuffle through in an attempt\nto claim his final piece of revenge cake.\nCaine\u2019s performance is powerful\nenough to receive sufficient sympathy\nwhile he tops a load of hoodies and\npretty much anyone else who gets in\nhis way. The gritty film is captured\nwell, with some great cinematography.\nOverall, the film lacks finesse and real-ism, but is still a brutally brilliant. Just\nthink of Kill Bill, with less leggy blond\nand more granddad.\nMichael Caine plays Dirty (old man) Harry\nJacobs went to the headmaster\u2019s office for a good old fashioned whipping. He came out with a creaming too.\n\n"

DFA records\nwere the cool looking people with\ntheir designer drugs, whilst DFA\n1979 represented the kids with bleeding noses who start mosh pits in the\ntrendy clubs. They even declared a\n\u201cJihad\u201d on James Murphy, elaborat-ing; \u201cif I had the resources I would fly\na plane into his skull.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of\nunfathomable bad taste that typifies\nthis album.\nDFA \u201979\u2019s sound is simple, comprising of just a heavily distorted bass\nguitar, drums and voice. Described by\nJosh Homme of Queens of the Stone\nAge as akin to the sound of dinosaurs\nfighting. The album is relentless in\npace and by all accounts should come\noff as a straight punk album, but the\nvocals sound as if they\u2019ve been harvested from pop songs and given\na course of steroids. Every song is\nstripped down to its raw parts, with\nno excess fat, making it accessible to\nfresh ears.\nLyrically, as the title of the album\nsuggests, it is full of chauvinistic one\nliners like \u201cYou\u2019re a woman and I know\nIt\u2019s true / from the things that I have\ndone to you\u201d and angry break up rant-ing: \u201cNow that this is over this weight is\noff my shoulder/ now that this is over, I\nlove you more and more.\u201d In any other\ncontext these lyrics wouldn\u2019t work, but\nthe driving force of the music grounds\nand empowers their meaning.\nThe ferocity of their music translated to the band\u2019s working lives, cre-Albums that you should know\nating a rift that would end them after\njust one album and a handful of eps.\nIncluding a remix ep that drew talent\nlike Justice and Erol Alkan.

That appears to be the\ncruel fate of singers-songwriters, however famous they might get at some\npoint in their life. Maybe there\u2019s too\nmany of them? Maybe they\u2019re too mellow to turn the beat around? I personally blame it on the fact that too many\nsinger-songwriters fall indubitably into\nthe slow romantic ballads that make\nme want to...\nHowever, with tenacity and an adventurous mind, you can find good\nones. For example the London-born\nBilly Franks who sings his thoughts\nwith a sometimes soft, sometimes gut-voice. But he thereafter provided a\nwide array of pieces, from his new album American Sunshine to his first\nhit Down Under (assisted by his lovely\nwife at the back vocals and imaginary\nflute), passing by his 1990s singles and\nsome of the Scrubs\u2019 fans\u2019 requests. Remarkable voice range, perfectly and\ncreatively produced, with striking\nguitar skills; the almost-duo was extremely amusing and entertaining to\nwatch, connecting with the audience\nfor a short but impeccable perform-ance. Colin Hay will probably remain\na famous but still low-key singer-songwriter that would easily become\nlegend in a couple of decades. As for\nBilly Franks, it is worth trying to find\nhis next performance to see him in his\nelement.\nOn the search for singer-songwriters...\nEmilie Beauchamp seeks out Colin Hays and Billy Franks @ Bush Hall\ntural voice to give us an insight on various facts of life. How it is to grow up\nin a Fulham Court council tax estate,\nhow you most often sleep better when\nit rains, or how an idyllic summer in\nNew York can turn sour. Said to have\nbeen praised by Bono, Peter Gabriel\nand Oasis, Franks was part of the 80s\nband The Faith Brothers before starting a solo career trooping around London pubs. His lyrics are genuine and\namusing, his voice is definitely charming and his scene presence flattering.\nHowever, the guitar rhythms are often quite simple, especially in comparison with the icon following his warmly\nreceived performance.\nSecond on stage and awaited by a\nfairly good audience was half-Scottish\nhalf-Australian Colin Hay, who has\ntranscended decades with a few, but\nwidely known hits. Remember Men at\nWork\u2019s \u201cDown Under\u201d?\nWell, Colin Hay was the lead singer\nof Men at Work...

    "content": "23\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk TRAVEL\nCaption\nsimply make a lot of noise and expect\nothers to get out of their way. This particular bus driver insisted on honking\nhis very loud horn at least once every\n6 seconds for the entire 5 hour ordeal\nand once I arrived at my destination I was tired and pissed off. This\nwas compounded by the fact that my\nbackpack had been left in the luggage\ncompartment next to a giant block of\nice transporting fish, which then became a smaller block of ice with the\nexcess meltwater and fishjuice soaked\ninto my bag. I have washed it several\ntimes but even today it still stinks, as\nmany of my friends will testify.\nOff to a good start then. However,\nI thoroughly enjoyed Sihanoukville\nonce I had settled in. My guesthouse\nwas on the beach next to half a mile of\nbars on the sand.\nThe strange thing about this part\nof the country is that the chief of police actually owns the local marijuana\nplantation and hence very little law is\nenforced in the area. In fact most bars\nsell joints openly for $1 each. This\nlack of law enforcement unfortunately also attracts the bad parts of soci-ety. After dark it is not recommended\nto leave the beach to walk into town\nas the road is a magnet for muggers\nand carjackers and walking along it as\na westerner is tantamount to suicide.\nSo of course on the first night, I\nended up in a karaoke bar halfway between the town and the beach on the\ndark road. I spent most of the evening\nwondering whether we were about to\nbe robbed by the group of Cambodians that had dragged us there, but apparently they were genuine, or at least\ngenuinely drinking all the dirt-cheap\nbeer we were buying. At the end of\nthe night we needed to get home, but\nnone of the moto drivers wanted to go\nback so we had to walk, or rather run\nvery fast and hide from oncoming vehicles while thinking we were about\nto be murdered at any moment.\nHaving made friends with two hot\nSwedish guys, I finally managed to re-lax, helped by a banana shake of the\nhappy variety, so much so that I lay on\na sofa on the beach for four hours before I could be bothered to go to bed.\nHowever, even amongst this laid-back touristy atmosphere you can forget the true world that is Cambodia.\nKids wander up and down the beach\ntrying to sell you trinkets for a few\ndollars; and amputees beg for food\nand money while hobbling along on\ntheir arms. There is no social security or benefits system and education\nis only provided for free up to age\neleven, and even then only 20% of the\npopulation can afford to take advantage of it.\nHaving stuffed my face with food\nand knocking back the drinks with\nmy friends, an amputee crawled past\nand asked for some food. He was quite\npersistent even though we didn\u2019t have\nanything on us, and I couldn\u2019t help\nwishing that he would just move on\nand leave us alone to have fun. As\nsoon thought went through my head I\nrealised I had become the stereotypical western tourist that I so despised.\nAfter this startling realisation, I felt\nthat some good deeds were in order.\nTo see more of the real country\nrather than following the tourist trail\nI took a minibus to the town of Kampot, formerly the most lawless area in\nSE Asia as it was the last stronghold\nof the almost defeated Khmer Rouge.\nOnly a few years earlier, three tourists were kidnapped from a train by\nthe KR and then executed when the\nransom wasn\u2019t paid. Even in light of\nthis recent history, it is one of the\nmore laid back areas, allowing several\ndays of simply wandering around and\nsoaking up the local vibes.\nAnother essential trip I had to make\nwas to Bokor Mountain. The journey\nconsists of a very bumpy 4WD vehicle trekking slowly up the mountain\nalong 40km of muddy, windy roads\ntowards the ghost town of Bokor. Old\nhouses and hotels were left to rot after the civil war, and even the town\nchurch was used as the KR stronghold where they planned their next\ninvasion. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was\nin fact the casino, built on the edge\nof a cliff where the rich and famous\nwould come to gamble away their\nfortunes in better times. The losers\nof these fortunes would then throw\nthemselves over the cliff.\nThe casino itself is still structurally sound, although years of mould\ngrowth and being open to the elements makes it all the more disturbing when the storm clouds suddenly\nsmother the entire landscape and fill\nthe rooms with fog.\nHowever, due to the ever-resource-ful Cambodian government, the\nentire mountain has been sold to a\nSouth Korean conglomerate who are\ngoing to build a mega-casino and\n2000-room hotel, amongst other fa-cilities, on the site of the old build-ings, and then build a cable-car from\nthe summit to sea level to bypass\nthe road. So again, if you want to see\nBokor, you\u2019d better go soon because it\nwon\u2019t be there in a year\u2019s time.\nI didn\u2019t think it was possible, but\nthe journey back to Phnom Penh may\nactually have been the worst ever.\nThe bus took a completely different\nroute to the one I was expecting, travelling along small dirt roads via tiny\nlittle villages, and I spent most of the\njourney worried that I was being taken to Vietnam. Most of the road was\nunsealed and the dust that was kicked\nup by the vehicles in front was sucked\ninto the ventilation and filled the bus\nwith a thick orange cloud. However\nwe had it nowhere near as bad as the\npeople in the many minibuses designed for 15 but seating 50, mostly\non the roof .\nThose people clearly had a far worse\njourney than me, but then again you\nget what you pay for; I paid $6 for the\nwhole journey, whereas they probably\nonly paid 50 cents.\nI was glad to be back in Phnom Penh\nand began preparing myself for the\ntemples of Angkor Wat\u2026\nTo be continued in next week\u2019s felix\nThe Memorial Pagoda contains over 9,000 skulls that have been excavated so far, but there are still an estimated 10,000\nburied just in Phnom Penh. Across the country there are many more killing fields containing even more bodies.\nThe beach at Sihanoukville, many, many bars to choose from\n\n"

No, literally.\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nOn a recent binge trip to Milan I\ndecided to get my nipple pierced. It\nwas going relatively ok until I felt a\nstrange oozing sensation from the\ntip of the nipple and a white milky-rice-pudding like substance started\nrunning down my chest. I hoped it\nwould stop after a couple of days but\nit hasn\u2019t.\nI am now lactating and have to\nwear several layers to hide it. What\ndo I do?\nJoseph Sparrow\nDear Joseph\nWoah.\nMust have a been a right corker! Although males don\u2019t lactate under normal circumstances, when stimulated\nexcessively (or in your case pierced) lactation can be initiated. Have you been\nplaying with it too much? Or perhaps\nrunning current through it. It may just\nbe a lot of pus which needs to be let out\nbut either way you should defs get this\nlooked at.\nIn the meantime, however, you could\nconsider investing in a pair of nipple\npads. Oh, and avoid strong magnets,\nas well as running shirtless into electric\nfences.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty Mc Pickle,\nI have started having trouble getting\naroused by my girlfriend in the normal bed setting.\nA nagging desire for something\nmore exciting has perpetuated itself:\nthe physics showers. Do you think I\ncan get away with it?\nStevie Hasselhoff\nDear Stevie,\nI\u2019m pretty sure this has been done be-fore; at least there are rumours of it. I\nthink you should maybe consider why\nyour girlfriend in particular is not\narousing you anymore. Maybe it has\nless to do with the place but more to do\nwith her face? In that case, you should\nconsider getting her a boob job and a\npaper bag for Christmas. If you don\u2019t\nthink this is a problem then experimenting is totally healthy.\nHowever, getting caught out might\nearn you a rather peculiar rep. You\ncould both try wearing the paper bags,\nbut if they happen to come off when\nyou\u2019re discovered, you\u2019ll earn an even\nweirder reputation.\nThen again, it\u2019s not as if everyone\nthat does physics is exactly \u201cnormal\u201d,\neven for Imperial standards.\nYours,\nAuntyMcPickle xxx\nYou\u2019d better let some out to relieve the pressure, Joe, otherwise you\u2019ll look like this\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI recently had my boyfriend over for\nthe weekend and we decided to have\na steamy moment in the sauna. My\nmum had been asleep but apparently woke up and decided to walk into\nthe bathroom fully starkers to take a\nshower!\nWe hid behind the wall but had to\nface the shower to avoid being seen.\nMy boyfriend couldn\u2019t take his eyes\noff of her naked body and he seemed\nto have a much larger erection than\nhe has with me. It was four whole\ninches!\nShould I feel jealous?\nMichelle Bigrod\nDear Michelle,\nThis sounds a bit embarrassing. At\nleast your mum didn\u2019t see you two. I\nwould probably try to forget about the\nwhole episode. It must have been a very\nconfusing situation for your boyfriend\nbut maybe watch out for him checking\nher out or attempting footsy in the fu-ture. That would not be cool.\nIf you do happen to catch him flirting,\ncut his tiny cock off, either literally or\nfiguratively - I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\nDon\u2019t feel too upset, though. He\u2019ll know\nthat you\u2019ll look like her in twenty years\nanyway.\nHope you get through this,\nAunty McPickle xxx\nY\nou may have heard about\nour upcoming carol-singing\nevents, but if you haven\u2019t,\nwe\u2019re having two upcoming\ncarol-singing events.\nOur first is this Friday, the 4th of December at Green Park Station with Imperial College Chamber Choir. We\u2019ll be\nneeding 5-7 collectors, and if you like,\nyou can join in the singing!\nOur main event on Monday, the 14th\nof December, however, will take place\non the main stage at Trafalgar Square,\nright under the massive Christmas\nTree, with the Main Choir, and we\u2019ll be\nneeding about 15 to 20 collectors.\nThese lovely yuletide occasions are\nfor the benefit of The Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital for Children. Opened\nin 1852 in Bloomsbury, this hospital\nnot only has the widest range of children\u2019s specialists out of any hospital in\nthe country, but also conducts leading\nresearch in children\u2019s medicine.\nIt is notable for its high-profile sup-porters, which have included Queens\nVictoria and Elizabeth, Tony Blair and\nVictoria Beckham. In 1929, author JM\nRAG Charities Pt. 2: Great Ormond Street Hospital\nBarrie even donated the rights to his\nplay and novel Peter Pan to the hos-pital, so that it recieves royalties from\nproductions of the play and sales of the\nnovel.\nNevertheless, the hospital continually\nneeds to pay for accommodation, not\nonly for the patients, but their parents, as\nwell as new equipment and their extensive research into children\u2019s medicine.\nSo if you\u2019re interested in helping out\nsuch a worthy cause, don\u2019t hesitate to\ncontact us at rag@imperial.ac.uk to\njoin in with the Christmasness!

    "content": "6\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor Ravi Pall\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nT\nhe undersized room is\npacked out with complex,\nesoteric instruments. Jars\nof powders, preserves and\npreparations, both exotic and eldritch, line the shelves. Essays and treatises by greater men and\nwomen, heavy with inky annotations,\nlay strewn about, covering all surfaces.\nThe air is filled with smoke, fire and\nheat. All is silent as the room\u2019s sole occupant rises from a stupor. He finds\nthe result of his investigations, the\nfruit of countless years\u2019 toil. Euphoric\ntears stain his cheeks, blackened by his\nendeavours.\nYou may think this is a description of\nthe quarters of some mediaeval master\nof alchemy, finally realising his search\nfor the fabled philosopher\u2019s stone, but\nyou\u2019d be wrong. It was my kitchen\nlast week, and I had just perfected the\nboiled egg.\nMany people think that modern\nchemistry arose from the mystical\nhalf-science of alchemy. But they\u2019d be\nwrong. What we think of as alchemy\nwas nothing more than tricks and cons\nto fool the rich and the stupid. Alchemists were certainly interested in making gold but they didn\u2019t need a fancy\nstone for that. No, science takes its\ncues from a much purer discipline.\nJust consider the similarities between the kitchen and the laboratory.\nIn both, you have to carefully measure out your reactants and set up the\nnecessary apparatus. Safety measures\nmust be taken, usually involving a blast\nscreen of some kind, especially when\ndangerous compounds/baked potatoes\nare involved. Hypotheses are formulat-ed, tested and refined for the next ex-periment/meal, bringing us ever closer\nto understanding the divine mysteries\nof the universe/cookbook. We can read\nabout the investigations others have\nundertaken, either in Nature or Reader\u2019s Digest, and try them for ourselves,\nassessing their validity and delicious-ness. And there are those pioneers who\ngive their lives (sometimes literally) in\nthe never-ending pursuit of knowledge\nand flavour.\nAs an aside, I was once almost counted among those brave souls, following\na catastrophe of a pasta bake. That\nnight I stared Death in face, with my\narms tightly wrapped around the toilet bowl. I thought my time had come.\nThe timely application of sliced bread\nand a great deal of ketchup was the\nonly thing that kept me in this plane.\nAlso, fire. Fire is important. Heat, en-ergy, we need these things to drive our\ntesting forward. Since the dawn (and\nfull English breakfast, presumably) of\nman, fire has been vital to man\u2019s survival and learning. Fire refines, fire re-juvenates, fire changes! Without fire,\nof some kind or another, you are barely\nexperimenting and you are certainly\nnot cooking. What does the science lab\nrevolve around? The bunsen burner.\nThe kitchen? The stove. Without fire,\nyou\u2019d have to eat salad all day long.\nAnd salad isn\u2019t cooking \u2013 rabbits eat\nsalad and they don\u2019t even have opposable thumbs!\nWith the advent of fire, cookery and\nscience really took off. Our primordial ancestors were the first to realise\nthe potential of this strange dancing\nlight. \u201cAh, this heat-light I found out\nby the dead trees is superb! Hmm,\nbut that mammoth carcass I left near\nit has changed colour. Oh, it\u2019s hot like\nthe heat-light! Mmm, that\u2019s new...it\nfeels different to how Wife does it...\nand even though it\u2019s been a few days,\nthis still tastes quite good. Maybe if I\nput more meat near the heat-light, I\ncan make it taste better too?\u201d Thus,\nobservation and hypothesis were laid\ndown as the foundation, the very cor-nerstone, of both cookery and science,\nby some rather well-spoken hunter-gatherers. And naturally, fire was a\nbrilliant way of keeping warm through\nthe long winter nights, before gas bills\nwere invented.\nWhile it\u2019s great to talk about science\nand cookery in these logical, rationalistic terms, there are also times when\nyou just have to throw the scientific\nmethod to the wind and see where\nan open mind and dumb luck can get\nyou. In science, you have to put more\neffort in pretending you\u2019re a mature\nadult but this is more acceptable in\ncookery; I remember last term using\nraspberry jam as a substitute for pasta\nsauce. The results were sticky but extremely tasty \u2013 the resulting diabetic\ncoma was a minor side-effect. Some\nof our greatest discoveries lie in these\nunexplored frontiers, these brave new\nworlds. Kekul\u00e9 worked out the structure of benzene while high off his tits\non opium and Emperor Shennong discovered tea when drinking hot water\nunder a tree with an arboreal alopecia.\nAh, the maillard reaction has finished now; I can have toast. Mm, but-ter-topped science!\nRhys Davies reinvents kitchen science\n\u201cThat mammoth\ncarcass I left near\nit has changed\ncolour. Oh, it\u2019s\nhot like the heat-light! Mmm,\nthat\u2019s new...\u201d\nI\nLIKE ROUGH SEX TOO. Apologies for being crude, but I want\nto attract the same audience as\nMariash Notelling, the people\nwho were made to feel like shallow sluts throughout that comment\npiece. What first struck me is the anger\nand venom the writer felt against other\npeople \u2013 I really did wonder why they\nwere getting so worked up by other\npeople\u2019s business! Rather than attacking bits of last week\u2019s column though,\nI\u2019d like to use my couple of hundred\nwords to approach the points raised\nusing a different view.\nfelix and the student population are\nonly as obsessed with sex as say \u2013 most\nof the 18 \u2013 21 yr olds around the world!\nIt\u2019ll always crop up, as a scientist you\nwill be familiar with the evolutionary concept that humans function to\nthe four basic F\u2019s: fight, flight, feeding\nand... reproduction. Of course we can\nall rise above it and discourse on other\nmatters, but it would be futile to say\nthat a sophisticated society should be\nexempt of the desire to fuck.\nFirst years are usually fresh out of\nschool. For many of them, it is the\nfirst time that they will have been let\nloose, out of the advisory guard of parents and the school system. Some may\nchoose to crash head first into a yard\nof ale, but it\u2019s a phase that is normally\nshed as time passes. That first year\naway, especially the first term, is when\nthey will grow-up and hone their in-stincts. This worldly knowledge cannot\nbe gained however, without launching\nyourself out there and accumulating as\nmuch experience as you can. \u201cLa con-naissance, c\u2019est la transformation d\u2019un\nsavoir en une exp\u00e9rience de vie\u201d. This\nisn\u2019t a call to sleep around as much as\npossible. What I\u2019m trying to convey is\nthat, as first years, and throughout the\nrest of your life, you will be learning\nand doing new things, and sometimes\n\u2013 whoops! \u2013 you\u2019ll make a mistake.\nDon\u2019t take shame in it. That experience\nis a small part of a book that makes\nyou. You\u2019re not a generic \u201cslutty female\nfresher\u201d, and no-one, including anonymous comment writers, has a right to\njudge what you choose to do.\nOnto the most irksome point in\nMariash\u2019s column. Why do you mention your virginity? Does it really mat-ter? I thought it detracted from the\npower of your piece. Already bordering the line between being facetious or\nnot, that really sent it to the nutcase\npit. The concept of having not \u201cgiven\nin\u201d is particularly worrying. It suggests that all non-virgins, including\nthose that are in loving relationships,\nare weak of mind. Clutching to your\nvirginity has neither any say in your\ncharacter nor any bearing on the validity of your opinions. Holding the status\nof a virgin does not elevate you above\nothers. Your sexual interests and status\nare completely irrelevant outside of\nintimate personal relationships. Sure\nthere may be some Mariash out there\njudging you or conversely a patronising wanna-be cool kid looking down\non you for your lack of experience.\nIgnore them: they are not worth your\ntime.\nI\u2019d like Mariash to apologise to all\nthe girls she has offended. Not only the\npromiscuous ones, but all the other females she has disgusted by her narrow-minded views.\nMilli Begum with a retort to Mariash\n\u201cI\u2019d like Mariash\nto apologise to\nall other females\nshe has disgusted\nwith her views\u201d\n\n"

To combat this, Amnesty International are currently running a campaign to convince Shell to\nclean up its act.\nShell Oil, a multi-million pound UKbased company, is the region\u2019s biggest\noil producer, in association with the\nNigerian Government. However, they\nhave left the area in a catastrophic\nstate, and Amnesty International has\nexposed various ways in which Shell\nhas violated the human rights of local\npeople.\nNine million barrels\u2019-worth of crude\noil have poured out of pipelines in the\nNiger delta region, killing fish (a major\nsource of food and income), polluting rivers and destroying land so that\ngrowing crops is impossible, and leaving seventy five percent of the rural\npopulation with no access to clean wa-ter. Shell and the Nigerian government\nhave also refused to provide local people with basic information and consult\ncommunities about the work going on.\n\u201cIf you want to go fishing, you have\nto paddle for about four hours through\nseveral rivers before you can get to\nwhere you can catch fish and the spill\nis lesser... some of the fish we catch,\nwhen you open the stomach, it smells\nof crude oil.\u201d \u2013 A Bodo fisherman, victim of oil spills in 2008 and 2009 which\nhave still not been cleaned up.\nAmnesty wrote a report on their\nfindings documented over the last ten\nyears, entitled \u201cPetroleum, Pollution\nand Poverty in the Niger Delta\u201d. They\nintended to put pressure on the new\nCEO of Shell, Peter Voser, and shortly\nafterwards, Shell took part in an online dialogue about the report. Over\n445 people took part in this dialogue,\nincluding representatives of Amnesty\nand Friends of the Earth (some of\nwhom were based in Nigeria).\nAmnesty is now challenging Shell\u2019s\nnew CEO Peter Voser to change the\nsituation and right some of the wrongs\ncaused by the company. They want\nShell and the Nigerian government to\nclean up the Niger Delta, be transparent in their actions and remedy the human rights abuses they have contributed to by providing compensation,\nrehabilitation, information and access\nto justice.\nOne way in which Amnesty does\nthis is through raising public aware-ness; this includes campaigning, petitioning and reporting events. One of\ntheir new campaigns includes turning\na Shell station into a \u201cHell station\u201d.\nThis is what Imperial Amnesty did\nwhen they kicked off their campaign\nto highlight the abuses of Shell in the\nNiger Delta. The local Shell garage\nwas used and the photos of their exploits were put on Google Maps. Activists all over the world have been\ndoing the same, and people are encouraged to post negative comments\nabout Shell on the photos.\nTo raise awareness around campus\nImperial Amnesty ran a stall in the\nJCR on Wednesday 28th October. Interested students were given the opportunity to write messages to Shell\nand leave fingerprints on an idyllic\nphotograph of unspoilt land in Nigeria \u2013 a slightly more visual way to\nregister protest over pollution of such\nareas. Despite fears of feedback to\nShell, a well-known employer, a petition asking Shell to take responsibility\nfor the damage they are doing in the\nDelta garnered an extremely positive\nresponse around campus.\nAfter gathering 124 signatures over\nlunch for the petition, several members of Imperial Amnesty then made\ntheir way down to the careers fair to\nconfront the Shell recruiters with the\nsituation in Nigeria. With the petition\nand the fingerprint photo in hand they\napproached Shell\u2019s stall, fully expecting to be instantly brushed off with the\noh-so familiar \u201cno comment\u201d. Much\nto their surprise, one of the employ-ees, who asked to remain anonymous,\nagreed to answer their questions.\nSince Shell say they \u201care totally committed to a business strategy that always balances profits and principles.\u201d\nthe first question, naturally, was to\nsee whether employees outside public\nrelations saw their company in a similar light. For a person drilled into recruiting graduates and thus trying to\npresent his company in the best light\npossible, it was not surprising that\nafter a short delay he confirmed that\nShell was in fact an ethical company.\nSurely in an ethical company criticism is met openly and problems or\nfailures are addressed with the attention they deserve. Whilst the source\nclaimed that internal communications\ndealing with this exist, the detail of\nthem and whether they are accessible\nto anyone or on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis remains unknown.\nNext, the negative impacts of Shell\u2019s\noperation in Nigeria were questioned.\nHaving been to Nigeria as part of his\nwork for Shell, the source was the ideal\ncandidate to give a close-up perspec-tive. He claimed that the numerous oil\nspills were mostly caused by sabotage\nand that leakages in general were no\nmore severe than in any other region\nor at any other company. However\nAmnesty insists Shell has the responsibility to prevent leaks from occurring\n(whatever the source may be), and, failing to do so, to at the very least clean\nup the resulting spills.\nWhen asked about the dangers of\nworking in Nigeria, the source told the\nAmnesty members that Shell tries to\navoid areas of political unrest.\nThis led to the question whether\nShell had actually sown the seeds for its\ncurrent distress, which was answered\nwith \u201cIt depends how you assess the\nsituation.\u201d The way that Amnesty assesses the situation is that the often\nblamed political turmoil, the violent\nattacks on Shell\u2019s property and kidnappings of Shell\u2019s employees were not in-evitable. When Shell moved to Nigeria\nfifty years ago, the local populace was\nanything but militant, expecting an\neconomic boom in the area. Yet little\nof the enormous revenues made with\nNigerian oil seemed to reach the peo-ple; the average income, at $2 a day, is\namongst the very lowest in the world.\nThe interview concluded on a friendly note, as both the Amnesty members\nand their interviewee are hoping that\n\u201cin time, everything will change for the\nbetter.\u201d Whether this is true remains to\nbe seen. Meanwhile Amnesty is upping\nthe pressure on Mr. Voser to put things\nright in the Niger Delta.\n\u2018a petition asking Shell\nto take responsibility for\nthe damage they are doing in the Delta garnered\nan extremely positive response around campus.\u2019\nThe Amnesty stall in the JCR, before the assult on the careers fair\nOsborne and Marissa Lewis of the Imperial Amnesty club confront Shell at the Imperial graduate careers fair.\nYour Club or Society Here.\nDescription of your awesome trip or event here.\nWant your club to be in felix?

It\u2019s\nnot for the impatient, and it\u2019s not for\nthe gamer with an attention span the\nlength of Marcus Fenix\u2019s vocabulary.\nThe thing with Dragon Age, however\n\u2013 and the difference between it and an\nexercise in sadomasochism like Ikaruga \u2013 is that dying is never unfair. When\nyou die in Dragon Age, it\u2019s your fault.\nNot the game\u2019s, it\u2019s yours. So, get up,\ndust yourself off and try again, dam-mit. And you will if you have any ounce\nof resilience within you.\nYou can be walking through a dungeon admiring the gloriously designed\narchitecture that\nputs Oblivion and\nFallout 3\u2019s copy-and-paste environments to shame, and\nout of nowhere eight\nWalking Corpses will ambush you, outnumbering your\nband two to one. With a group of\nparty members whose health probably totals less than your enemies\u2019, every\nfight is a battle. Combat happens in\nreal-time, though you\u2019ll need to make\nliberal use of the space bar - your pause\nkey - to assign orders. Think small scale\nCommand & Conquer, with knights\nfor infantry and a stop time button.\nBack to Backerons, where I\u2019ve already\nhad to reload three or four times. By\nnow I\u2019ve found a few cohorts including camp\ncompadre\nAlistair and a rather handy, unnamed\nmage, who we\u2019ll call Jasper. Simply\ncharging at the undead has proved\nfruitless. Outnumbered and out-gunned by some archers lurching in\nthe background, the brute force approach hasn\u2019t worked. New play re-quired. Pause. Jasper paralyses the\narchers from afar. Backerons engages\nthe undead scrappers, keeping them\noccupied while Alistair brings up\nthe rear, for maximum backstabbing\ndamage. Unpause. Fight, scrap, bosh.\nPause. With the archers incapacitated,\nJasper can go about shooting bolts of\nlightning at the Corpses now. Unpause.\nSoon enough the Walking Corpses are\nback where they belong, lying twisted\nand mauled on the cold, hard concrete.\nPause. Backerons, Alistair, Jaspar: destroy archers. Unpause. Throwing caution to the wind, the remaining undead\nare scythed down in an instant. If every\nfight is a battle, every boss is a war. The\nfirst encounter with an ogre is a frightening prospect; its name highlighted in\nblood red to signify how in a few seconds your party is going to be reduced\nto dust.\nBut you\u2019ll try again and you will\nlearn, which is why Dragon Age is so\nendearing and such a resounding suc-cess. Combat is an RPG\u2019s most basic\ngame mechanic. Whether it\u2019s first per-son, turn-based or real-time you\u2019ll be\nspending tens of hours wading through\nhordes of monsters in an RPG, so it\nhad better get the basics right. Dragon\nAge\u2019s combat is compelling, varied,\nchallenging, requires nous, and most\nof all, is deeply satisfying. When you\ndie for the tenth time in a row, you\npositively want to go back and try another approach. How many times have\nyou had that feeling in the past decade\nof gaming?\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a\nsave game to reload.\nThe Hero of Ferelden. The esteemed, noble, courageous and womanising, O surely-Lord-to-be.... Backerons\nTom Roberts ventures to Ferelden to battle demons and dragons but gets served by bandits and skellies\nMustard with your plate of sphincter?\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScandal at top climate research centre\nL\nast week I wrote an article\nfor felix that briefly outlined\nwhy I am a \u2018Climate Change\u2019\nsceptic. In that article, I\ntried to answer the frequent\nquestion: Do you think it is a conspir-acy? I said that yes, I do think it is a\nconspiracy, because I do believe a few\nkey individuals are being consciously\ndeceptive, and that is what defines a\nconspiracy.\nLess than a day after that article was\npublished, my suspicions were stunningly confirmed. Someone hacked\ninto the email database of the climate\nscientists at the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (CRU),\narguably the most important climate\nscience research center in the world,\nand published 1,073 emails on the Internet. Schadenfreude aside, I do not\ncondone this transgression against\nprivacy. That being said, the work and\ncorrespondence of these scientists is\nvery much in the public interest, and\nI wish to discuss the content of those\nemails here.\nThe first observation is that there are\nnumerous instances of discussions on\nhow to utilise various statistical tricks\nand omissions of data to exaggerate\nwarming trends in their results. Many\ncommentators have pointed out that\nthis shows that these scientists are\nmore focused on reaching a preconceived conclusion in their research\nthan being objective in their judgment.\nThere are many clear demonstrations\nof this lack of objectivity in the emails,\nsuch as \u201cThe fact is that we can\u2019t account for the lack of warming at the\nmoment and it is a travesty that we\ncan\u2019t.\u201d (Kevin Trenberth, Oct 2008),\nHowever, I do not believe this is\nthe big news here. We already know\nEdward Townes reviews an email leak story that supports his speculations in last week\u2019s edition\nAl Gore has warned against this leak distracting attention from the urgent and\nongoing efforts to find Manbearpig, the biggest immidiet threat to our planet.\nof transparency is legally, scientifically,\nand morally unjustifiable.\nAnother aspect of the perversion we\nfind in these emails is efforts to bully\nand eliminate people who may be critical of their work from the peer-review\nprocess. Examples include efforts to\nfire journal editors who approved publication of papers that they disagreed\nwith, \u201cI will be emailing the journal to\ntell them I\u2019m having nothing more to\ndo with it until they rid themselves of\nthis troublesome editor.\u201d (Philip Jones,\nNov 2003). Efforts to undermine entire journals that do not conform to\ntheir manipulation of the peer-review\nprocess, \u201cPerhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal.\u201d\n(Michael Mann, Nov 2003), and \u201cIf the\nRMS [Royal Meteorological Society] is\ngoing to require authors to make ALL\ndata available - raw data PLUS results\nfrom all intermediate calculations - I\nwill not submit any further papers to\nRMS journals.\u201d (Ben Santer, March\n2009). Even going so far as to make\nstatements such as, \u201cI can\u2019t see either\nof these papers being in the next IPCC\nreport. Kevin and I will keep them out\nsomehow -- even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!\u201d\n(Philip Jones, July 2004).\nYou may have noticed that many of\nthe more damning quotes came from\nPhilip Jones. Just who is this man ex-actly? Why, he\u2019s only the head of the\nCRU! I\u2019ll leave you with the worst\nexample of this man\u2019s hubris, \u201cIf any-thing, I would like to see the climate\nchange happen, so the science could be\nproved right, regardless of the conse-quences. This isn\u2019t being political, it is\nbeing selfish.\u201d (July 2005).\nthat these scientists are zealots with\nan agenda, and it is no surprise that\ntheir research practices mirror this.\nThe far more shocking and disturbing evidence in these emails is that of\na concerted campaign to pervert and\nundermine the peer-review process,\nthus rendering the scientific method\nvirtually impotent.\nThere are many emails, for example,\nwhere these scientists discuss how to\navoid transparency in their work and\nraw data. One email says \u201cIf they ever\nhear there is a Freedom of Information\nAct now in the UK, I think I\u2019ll delete\nthe file rather than send to anyone.\u201d\n(Philip Jones, Feb 2005) \u2013 showing us\na willful effort to prevent other people\nfrom being able to review their work.\nThey seem particularly concerned\nwith hiding their data from people who\nmay be critical, thus implying they only\nwant those who will agree with them\nto check their work and demonstrating\nlaughable insecurity in their research.\nThis evidence also shines new light on\ninstances like in August 2009 when\nthey claimed to have \u201clost\u201d all the original data from which they constructed\ntheir global temperature record, in response to a Freedom of Information\nrequest.\nYou might ask why exactly transparency on the data is so important. The\nreason is simple: the data is not repeat-able. Collecting data on things such as\nglobal temperature is very expensive,\nand only institutions like the CRU have\naccess to resources, given to them by\nthe collective people through govern-ment, to do this. Therefore, it is impossible for other scientists to produce\nwork in this field because they selfishly\nand nefariously refuse to allow anyone\nelse to interpret their data. Their lack\nRon Paul\u2019s Audit the Fed bill, which\nwould remove restrictions on the ability of the Government Accountability\nOffice (GAO) to audited some of the\nmost secretive activities of the Federal\nReserve has passed committee. The\nFed has spent months arguing that this\ncould hinder its job of protecting the\nvalue of the dollar, which has fallen by\n97% during the Feds reign. It enjoyed\nbroad stability in the century and a half\nbefore the central bank was chartered\nin its present form.\nCongressmen who rely heavily on\ncampaign donations from special interests have been trying to thwart Dr\nPaul\u2019s efforts over the last few weeks.\nThey were joined by \u201ceconomists\u201d who\nwrote open letters in support of the\nFed. Most of these people have since\nbeen found to have strong undisclosed\nlinks with that same institution.\nThe latest measure against monetary policy transparency had been\nDemocratic Congressman Mel Watt\u2019s\nattempts to water down the bill with\nhis own amendment. But this week\nthe text of HR1207 was attached in the\nform of the Paul-Grayson amendment\nto the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s upcoming financial regulatory\nreform bill. The amendment received\nbipartisan support, being passed by 43\nvotes to 26.\nIf HR 3996 now passes, blanket restrictions on GAO audits of the Fed\nthat have existed since 1978 will be re-moved. All items on the Fed\u2019s balance\nsheet will be auditable, including all\ncredit facilities, all securities purchase\nprograms, and all agreements with foreign central banks. The wording of the\nbill removes any remaining challenge\nthat it could allow the legislature to put\nundue pressure on monetary policy\nas it leaves a 180 day period between\ndecisions being made, and those decisions then being audited. With 313\nco-sponsors of HR1207, who will presumably now support HR 3396, the bill\ncan even pass under suspension in the\nlikely event of an Obama veto. Ironically, in characteristic fashion, Dr Paul\nhimself will not be voting for HR 3396\nbecause of the unconstitutionality of\nsome of the its other parts.\nThe congressman makes a good\npoint, as the bill will empower the Fed\nto distort the financial sector even\nfurther in the name of its mandate to\nenforce price stability, of course based\non its own, ever-changing, definition.\nHowever, many of those in support of\nHR1207, including 75% of the American people, viewed it simply as an opportunity to get more ammunition in\nthe fight to end the Fed, as details of\nits unacceptable dirty dealings become\nclearer.\nThe demise of central planning for\nthe money markets, will also send a\nclear signal to the Bank of England.\nOne of its strongest lines has always\nbeen that central banks are necessary as long as all other countries have\nthem.\nIt will be interesting to watch this\nspace and see what will happen with\nthis legislation, and its effects on the\ncontinuation of central banking in\nAmerica and across the pond.\nCampaign to audit the Fed passes first of many major hurdles\nCongressman Paul has spent 26 years advocating for a Fed audit, but the issue\nhas only gained mainstream traction after the recent recession.\nSinaAtaherian\nSinaAtaherian Business Editor\n\n"

Imperial arrived well\nbefore kick-off allowing for the usual\nlong-winded pre-match team talk from\nDamian Phelan and a solid warm-up\nwhich included some banter between\nMamzi and our Colombian referee.\nThe 2nds lined up in their now textbook 4-2-3-1 formation and as the\nmatch got underway immediately set\nabout imposing their passing game;\nMark Smith and Max Moesta controlling the tempo from their deep lying\nmidfield positions. Marc Hinken and\nMax Kindred were majestic at centre back, dominating in the air and\nstroking the ball about with aplomb\nwhile Phil Meier and Justin Whitehous\nproved formidable opponents for the\nSouth Bank wingers. They became\nfrustrated at their lack of possession,\nand Imperial began to look threatening on the attack.\nSome neat interplay between Mamzi Roshid and Damian Phelan sliced\nopen the South Bank defence creating an opportunity for our graceful new fresher, Caspar Paxton, who\njust pulled his shot wide of the post.\nQuickly another chance fell to Caspar\nfrom the same source, only for him to\nagonisingly strike his shot past the post\nagain. The South Bank goal was living\na charmed life as Sim Anandajeyarajah\nand Smithy stung the keeper\u2019s gloves\nand the pressure finally became too\nmuch as Moesta made a scything break\ndown the right hand side before sliding\na cracking ball into Sim who finished\ncoolly, striking the ball cleanly across\nthe face of the goal and into the bottom corner. The half time whistle blew\nsoon after and the 2nds were pleased\nto have provided themselves with a\nplatform from which to go on and kill\nthe game.\nHowever, 10 minutes into the 2nd\nhalf a key moment turned the game\non its head. The South Bank captain\nattempted to make a substitution but\nthe player leaving the field decided that\nhe was too good to go off. He was not\nhaving it.\nThe captain responded with obscenities and Imperial were beginning losing their focus. Finally this bizarre episode ended as the substituted player\nfinally trudged his way to the changing\nroom. Moments later a long ball over\nthe top outfoxed the 2nds centre backs\nand bang, a crisp half volley nestled\ninto the corner of the goal, 1-1. A blot\non an otherwise quality performance\nfor the Imperial back five. The game\nturned scrappy, favouring South Bank,\nwho threw men forward in search of\na winner. Imperial 2nds though are\nmade of strong stuff this season, they\nregrouped and once again began to\ndominate possession, the introduction\nof fresher and debutant Jack Lowe providing some extra energy on the wing.\nThe 2nds resolve paid off as, with 15\nminutes remaining, Damian played\na silky one-two with Sim on the edge\nof the box, glided past the centre half\nand slammed a powerful shot into the\nbottom corner. With the lead restored,\nconfidence high and South Bank going\nabsolutely gung-ho for an equaliser,\nImperial felt there were more goals to\nbe scored. Even from right back there\nwas a threat, as Justin surged out of defence and picked out Damian steaming\nthrough the gaping hole in the South\nBank back four who took one touch to\nset it away from the closing defender\nand struck it beautifully to once again\nfind the bottom corner of the net and\nfinish the game as a contest. There\ncould have been even more if not for\nDamian\u2019s shameless pursuit of a hattrick but otherwise the 2nds finished\nthe game strongly to kill off the game\n3-1. A fine win to guarantee progression to the 3rd round where LSE 3rds\nare waiting. A special mention for Justin who was awarded the man of the\nmatch awarded for his typically strong\ndefensive display which was coupled\non this occasion with some dazzling\nattacking play.\nKick Racism Out\nI\nmperial College Football 2nd XI\nused their BUCS cup tie against\nLondon South Bank 3s to promote a cause which is important\nto the football club as a whole,\nthe Kick Racism Out of Football cam-paign. The team can be seen in the\naccompanying photograph sporting\nt-shirts in support of the the project.\nThese t-shirts were worn throughout\nthe day and into the night and will\ncontinue to be worn by football club\nmembers to aid in spreading the Kick\nRacism Out message. The campaign\naims to use football as a means of challenging discrimination and working\nfor positive change in sport and in society as a whole. It is in its 16th year\nnow and continues to be commended\ninternationally by institutions such as\nthe European Commission and the\nBritish Council as a great example of\nhow to use sport to promote equality.\nImperial College Football Club\nboasts an internationally flavoured\nmembership representing all races and\na variety of nations and we think it is\nimportant to stress that this blend has\nhelped us to become a better club on\nand off the pitch. This is why we have\ndecided to support the Kick Racism\nOut campaign and are proud to promote the message wherever we travel.\neventually Imperial made the most of\na two-minute suspension and went\nahead. Some unforced errors and hasty\nattempts to break through UCL\u2019s defence led to avoidable turnovers and\nsparked hope in our opponents, but\nthe Eagles could rely on their solid defending to secure them a 1 goal advantage at half-time.\nThe second half demonstrated a definite lack of creativity, routine and luck\nin attack and with only 9 goals scored\nby Imperial in the entire match (Hand-ball scores usually exceed 20 goals for\neach team); the thought of potentially\nlosing this fixture did cross my mind.\nFortunately, our defending abilities\nexceed our attacking skills and with\nthe goalkeeper on form, saving 4 penalties and earning himself the title of\nEHA man of the match, we were able\nto double our advantage just before\nthe final whistle and take the 2 league\npoints home.\nAll in all it was a mildly encouraging,\nenthusiastic display by the Imperial\nEagles, which puts them in the top 3\nof the league.\nIt is safe to say, however, that a team,\nwhich orders more rounds in a pub\nthan they score goals in a game of\nHandball, has several issues to work\non.\nIC victorious in\nLondon Derby\nContinued From Back Page\nImperial College Football Club\u2019s 2nd XI sporting their t-shirts in support of the Kick Racism out of Football Campaign\nFencing\nsuccess in\nCambridge\nImperial Fencing Women\u2019s 1st team\npulled off an impressive display of\nfencing last weekend to settle into the\ntop spot of the Southern Premiership.\nThe girls travelled up to Cambridge\nto take part in a tournament-style af-fair, which saw them fence their first\nfour matches of the season over two\nintense days.\nCompeting against Cambridge, Oxfrod, Bristol and UCL, the team was\nonly composed of five people: Captain Clare Harding; ACC sportsperson of the year Hannah Bryars; ICFC\npresident Emily Bottle and strong new\narrivals Alice Mitchell and Outi Supponen. Lack of numbers notwithstand-ing, some very strong fencing coupled\nwith a deft bit of multitasking led the\n1sts to victory in all four matches.\nFollowing last year\u2019s silverware, the\nFencing girls once again show they are\na major force to be reckoned with (and\nhave put the pressure on the men\u2019s 1sts\nto perform in a couple of weeks\u2019 time\nin Oxford!).\nOn another note, a record number of\nfencing novices are going up to Warwick this weekend for a chance to cut\ntheir teeth at a big competition. Good\nluck guys!\nIndy Leclercq Sports Editor\n\n"

Unfortunately, Ronnie was captured two\nmonths later when Goebbel\u2019s Dachshund pissed on his leg.\nAfter the war, the sport took off in East\nGermany, spearheaded by Beckstein\u2019s\nson Raymond. Raymond founded the\nStandard Tree Imitating Code (STIC),\nwhich are the basic guidelines used\nby the International Treeming Association today.

She had to replace \u2018treeming\u2019 with \u2018locomotion\u2019 for\nlegal purposes.\nRULE 3: No Shrubbery imitation\nIn 1998, Christians protested against\nthe sport, saying that it was actually\ninvented by Jesus when he wore the\ncrown of thorns and attempted to imitate a Gorse bush.\nThe ITA retorted with a statement\nsaying \u2018Eye witness accounts from the\nbible say that the crown of thorns was\nplaced upon Jesus\u2019 head by soliders\nand not himself.\nIf, however, it was the case that Jesus did in fact use the thorny foliage\nas a tactical guise to escape, he did so\nin a wreckless manner and thus failed\nmiserably.\nJesus did not just die for our sins, he\nshowed us the real danger of the extreme sport that is treeming\u2019\nThe ITA conseqently banned the im-iation of shrubbery and thorny bushes\nin the sport.\nHangman jokes about many things,\nbut says this to you with all serious-ness: TREEM CAREFULLY!\nRonnie\n\n"

    "content": "24\nFOOD\nFood Editors Chris Sim & Holly Cumbers\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nIn search of good food in Amsterdam\nChris Sim embarked in a bewildering mission through Amsterdam in hope of satisfying his desire for quality grub.\nH\naving worked and lived\nin Amsterdam for two\nmonths, you would\u2019ve\nthought I\u2019d have this\ncity all figured out. But\nno. In fact, the more I think about it,\nthe more it mystifies me. Or to use a\ncricketing phrase, it bamboozles me.\nThe city has so many contrasts it is\nreally hard to see how it all manages\nto function so well. The serenity of\nthe beautiful canals and their arched\nbridges lie in harmony with the symbolic red lights of one of the world\u2019s\nmost famous areas for legalised pros-titution. Cultural marvels such as the\nvan Gogh museum are just a stones\nthrow away from parks where scores of\npeople enjoy the intoxicating effects of\ntolerated soft drugs. With all this going on, the relaxed nature of the city\nremains uncompromised by the seemingly dangerous cocktail of tram routes\nand cycle lanes.\nEqually baffling to me was the food\nscene in Amsterdam. It was neither\nhere nor there, sometimes sublimely\nbrilliant, sometimes absolutely atro-cious. Let\u2019s start with Dutch food.\nSimple and hearty, their cuisine can\nreally hit the spot if you can find\nthe right restaurant. Bear in mind,\nhowever, your wallet will really feel\nthe pinch no matter where you go.\nMoeder\u2019s restaurant (Mother\u2019s) is a\ncharmingly relaxed little eatery where\nevery inch of the walls and ceiling is\ncovered with pictures of, you guessed\nit, people\u2019s mothers \u2013 don\u2019t worry,\nthe pictures contain friendly smiles\nand it adds to the atmosphere, rather\nthan making you feel like your every\nmouthful is under close scrutiny.\nThey specialise in home-style Dutch\nfood, and, whilst I\u2019m no expert, it\ndidn\u2019t really excite me. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, the central theme of stews\nand mash was OK, but for 20 euros?\nQuestionable. One thing that is out of\nthe question is trying a Hema sausage.\nOily, bland and a host of nasty adjectives come to mind when I think of\nthat horrifying component from their\nsausage selection dish. On the bright\nside however, New Dorrius is one\nDutch restaurant well worth a visit.\nTheir slogan, \u2018Inspiring Fresh Dutch\nFood\u2019, summarises the core ideals behind its modern approach to cookery.\nDishes like their pan-fried sea bream,\naccompanied by an unctuously rich\nrisotto packed so full of sweet lobster\nflavour that I could write a thesis on\nit, are worth every euro cent. Also,\ntheir lively combination of red cabbage and apple puree with a moreish\nbeef hotpot add a twist to what would\notherwise be a rather forgettable dish.\nIf the native the food of the Netherlands doesn\u2019t get you going, then\ncuisine emanating from the country\u2019s glorious colonial past provides\na satisfying alternative. Indonesian\nrestaurants, whilst ubiquitous in Amsterdam, can vary greatly in quality\nand price and thus discretion is well\nadvised when making your choice.\nPopular with tourists and locals is the\nrenowned Kantjil en de Tijger, whose\nbusyness has probably made its owners forget that we\u2019ve barely survived a\ndeep recession. A recommended and\nfar cheaper alternative to actually eating at the restaurant itself is to order\nfrom their takeaway menu and to enjoy your meal beside the beauty of the\ncanals, (it can be hard to find bench-es, but sitting with your legs dangling\nover the water is equally pleasurable).\nThe only question mark that hangs\nover this restaurant is its authentic-ity, which is made even more obvious when you try a rijstaffel at Tempo\nDoeloe. A rijstaffel (ricetable) is a traditional Indonesian banquet comprising up to 25 different dishes. This\nmeal will entertain you with a multitude of flavours, from hints of aniseed\nto peanutty tones, with various curry\nembodiments present throughout. It\nis also a cleverly constructed meal, for\nyou are instructed to eat the dishes in\norder of increasing chilli heat. Reservations are essential for this res-taurant, but before you pick up the\nphone, please bear in mind that I had\nto spend nearly 40 euros for this in-dulgence. If you are wondering where\nthe cuisine of Suriname fits into the\npicture, then I guess it fits in here.\nHeavily influenced by Indonesian\ncuisine, Surinamese food is equally\ndiverse, though finding a good restaurant was, disappointingly, one gastronomic mission too far.\nUnfortunately for Amsterdam, the\nhigh prices of its restaurants are not\nbalanced by a cheap selection of street\nvendors. The omnipresent hot dog\nstands and frites (fries with mayon-naise) outlets may fill your belly, but\neven they are overpriced. Just for novelty\u2019s sake it is worth trying food from\nFebo, a chain of fast food stores where\nyou can obtain your food in a vending\nmachine-esque manner. In my opin-ion, the city\u2019s fast food scene is rescued by its large Turkish and Middle\nEastern communities, whose falafel\nand showarma eateries offer some\nsatisfying nibbles.\nTo summarise, I\u2019m not advising you\nto leave your tastebuds behind when\nyou pack your suitcase for Amsterdam,\njust to warn them that on this vacation,\nonly a hefty spend will keep them truly\nhappy.\nFebo. Food from a machine. Surprisingly edible stuff at reasonable prices. And even faster than McDonald\u2019s.\n\u201cLondon restaurants are far too expensive for students\u201d\nChris Sim has a few handy recommendations that go at least some way to dispelling the aforementioned myth\nNestled just off the main street of\nChinatown, this popular fast food\nJapanese joint is instantly recognisable\nwith its long queues of students huddling outside, awaiting their turn for\nsome great value grub. I don\u2019t need to\nmention that unless standing in a long\nline of people is your thing, I\u2019d recommend you turn up early.\nTo squeeze every morsel of value\nout of each and every penny, going\nfor a main meal highly recommended.\nTempura, teriyaki chicken, katsu don\n(breaded pork cutlet with egg and\nrice) are just a number of flavoursome,\nhearty treats which are well worth a try.\nPersonally, I am a fan of their chicken\nkatsu curry dish, which comprises succulent pieces of chicken deep fried in\ncrispily light breadcrumbs, laden with a\nslightly sweet and spicy Japanese curry\nsauce, accompanied by salad and a bit\nof pickled radish. These main dishes\non their own are considerably sizeable,\nand that\u2019s without mentioning that a Mt\nEverest-sized scoop of rice accompanies\nthem. I have previously tried to think\nabout trying a starter or side dish, but\nmy bulging belly warned me that further additions could lead to a disaster of\nsorts. So at \u00a36-8, this restaurant\u2019s value\nhardly ever comes into question. I guess\nmy only complaint is that the service is\nsometimes a tad slow, or maybe it was\nme being sluggish, after all, a meal this\nformidable makes for a lethargic, yet\npleasantly satisfied diner.\nThe flagship restaurant of this Belgianinspired chain doesn\u2019t strike you as the\nmost obvious place of gastronomic\npilgrimage for students, with its standard prices easily setting you back \u00a320\nfor a good dinner. But do not despair,\nfor delicious and wholesome Belgian\nfood can be available at a price which\ncorresponds to, well, the time on your\nwatch.\nLet me explain further. From Monday to Friday, from 5pm until 6:30pm,\nyou pay the price which corresponds\nto the time at which you ordered your\nmeal. For example, order at 5:42pm\nand your meal will cost you exactly\nfive pounds and forty two pennies.\nSo what do you get for this interestingly low price? There are five choices\non the menu, with the two best being\nBelgian classics. A pretty safe bet is a\nbowl of perfectly steamed, juicy mussels dressed in a light white wine, garlic\nand parsley sauce matched with a sizeable portion of robust frites. Great for\nthis time of year, now that the cold is\nreally starting to get cosy in London. If\nsea-dwelling creatures aren\u2019t for you,\ngo for their half spit-roast chicken with\nguessed it, a bowl of fries. Moist chicken flesh, which oozes rich juices upon\nincision, is enveloped by sticky, slightly\ncaramelised skin laden with a not-overpowering mustard and slightly\nsweet leek sauce. Quality, hearty stuff.\nGone are the days when for the same\nprice, a glass of beer or wine accompanied the meal. Thanks, Mr Recession.\nBut still, either of these quality alcoholic accompaniments should keep your\nbill per head at just around the ten\npound mark, and with a huge selection\nof quality beers on offer, well, in my\nopinion, that\u2019s not too bad. And with\na unique Narnia-like interior, equally\noddly dressed waiters whose service\nis more than adequate, an early dinner\nat Belgo Centraal is well worth rushing\noff to after braving the challenges of\nanother day at uni.\nFood: 7.0\nValue:9.5\nService: 6\nAmbience: 6.5\nOverall: 7.5/10\nFood: 7.5\nValue: 8.5\nService: 8\nAmbience: 8\nOverall: 8/10\nMisato, 11 Wardour Street, W1D 6PG Belgo Centraal (Beat The Clock Deal), 29 Shelton Street, WC2H 9JL\n\n"

Album opener Joy Fantastic is\na catchy glam-electro number armed\nwith wispy falsetto vocals and I\u2019m pretty sure Elmo gets involved too at the\nend. Most tracks create a chilled-out\nlounge atmosphere with the inclusion\nof heavy bass that makes you think\nyour head is being slowly torn apart,\nfast but light erratic drum loops and\na variety of hand claps, bongos and\nother such percussions. As with many\nDJ mixes it is not so much a collection\nof good and bad songs as it is a hazy\njourney through a fantastic musical\njungle.- Tom Jennings\nNonsense in the dark, a track taken\nfrom the Filthy Dukes album that bears\nthe same name plods down a dreamy\nsynth pop road for six and a half min-utes. I assume (and hope) there\u2019s going\nto be a reasonable length radio edit\nbecause only one idea seems to prevail throughout, stagnating well before\nhalfway.\nIt is a case of purely unoffensive electro with a large dose of sugary pop,\nleaving it devoid of any notion of substance or passion.\nThe vocals are just running through\nthe motions, apathetic warbling a mere\nsubstitute for anything interesting to\nsay. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised find its way\nto soundtracking a teen TV drama of\nsimilar calibre.\n- Christopher Walmsley\nFILTHY DUKES\nNONENSE IN THE\nDARK\nFICTION\nSINGLE\n\u2018The Man\u2019s Machine\u2019 is the kind of song\nthat puts some swagger in your step.\nIt\u2019s bass-heavy with crashing cymbals\nand rising electronic nuggets putting\nthe icing on the cake. Lyrically he\u2019s on\ntop form telling tales of travelling with\nhis usual dexterity \u201cMet a matador, he\nsaid a wild woman is more, terrifying\nthan any red bull he saw\u201d. The other\ntracks on the EP will appeal to Jamie T\nfans but \u2018Man Not A Monster\u2019 is a great\nclassic ska feet mover that few will be\nable to resist. - Kadhim Shubber\nJAMIE T\nTHE MAN\u2019S\nMACHINE\nVIRGIN\nEP\nFABRIC 50\nMARTYN\nFABRICLIVE\nALBUM\nLL Cool J trapped in\nan oven by a shark...\nAlex Ashford Music Editor\nPRODIGY\nINVADERS MUST\nDIE/THUNDER\nREMIXES\nTAKE ME TO THE\nHOSPITAL\nEP\nTODD\nBIG RIPPER\nROUGH TRADE\nALBUM\nBOYZ II MEN\nLOVE\nDECCA\nALBUM\nThis song is basically just syncopated\nsynth beats combined with repetitive\nhip-hop vocals. It\u2019s meant to be fresh\nbut it\u2019s bloody awful. It lacks any feel\ngood factor but would probably go\ndown well at Tiger Tiger. - Ed Knock\nKID SISTER\nRIGHT HAND HI\nXTRA MILE\nSINGLE\nT\nhe pop world is a harsh place,\njustmakingmusicisn\u2019tenough,\nyou have to be a character and\nspread your image into different facets of the media\u2019s money-making\nmachine according to your demograph-ic. Once upon a time this meant making dolls that look nothing like you and\nstationary sets for kids to nag their parents to buy for them from Woolworths.\nNowadays, if you\u2019re a pop band like Girls\nAloud, you make a line of false eyelashes\nfor Boots, presumably for girls who will\nend up looking like Jodie Marsh in ten\nyears time.\nBut that\u2019s just for the throw-a-way fla-vour-of-the-months. Anyone who\u2019s anyone in the music world is also... *dramatic\npause* ...an actor! The latest actor to take\na turn on the silver screen is Jarvis Cocker\nwho plays himself with a Banjo (a.k.a. Petey) in Wes Anderson\u2019s latest film, Fantastic Mr. Fox. It wouldn\u2019t be a Wes Anderson film without characters in brown\nsuitsandcravats,suitablyretroanimation\nand a cameo from a suitably cool indie\npersonality. This isn\u2019t the first time Jarvis\nhas graced our screens in a kid\u2019s film, he\nplayed in the band the Weird Sisters in\none of the Harry Potter films, doing \u201cthe\nhippogriff\u201d for those wizard kids to get\ndown to at Harry\u2019s winter ball.\nMariah Carey and Britney Spears\nsomehow persuaded enough people that\nit would be a good idea for them to star in\ntheir own films, 2001\u2019s Glitter and 2002\u2019s\nCrossroads, respectively. Needless to say,\nas they are both such vacuums of talent\nanyway these films crashed and burned\nat the box office.\nSome artists have managed to dabble on both sides throughout their careers (and no I don\u2019t mean Miley Cyrus).\nWhere many rappers have tried, only one\nhas truly managed to bridge the gap between film and music. Mos Def started\nhis rap career in the 90s and had already\nhad a role as Bill Cosby\u2019s sidekick in a detective show called The Cosby Mysteries\n(I\u2019m not making this up!) before his rap\ncareer took off. Now he\u2019s been in everything from Dave Chappelle\u2019s Block Party,\nto quirky comedy Be Kind Rewind, to\nan episode of House. Others, like Will\nSmith, Eminem and Queen Latifah, have\nonly found huge success on one side of\nthe bridge (although Will Smith did give\nus \u201cMiami\u201d and \u201cSummertime\u201d).\nBut my personal favourite has to be LL\nCool J (that stands for Ladies Love Cool\nJames, don\u2019t you know), who stars in one\nof the best films ever made: Deep Blue\nSea. I don\u2019t want to say too much about\nthis film, because I encourage you all to\nwatch it, but LL Cool J stars as a chef with\na pet parrot (which, yes, sits on his shoul-der) and a super-intellegent shark manages to trap him in an oven, and turn it\non. If that isn\u2019t top quality high brow entertainment for you I don\u2019t know what is.\n100 will always be\ngreater than 1000\nCatchy electro house is the music of the\nday, as it always has been for the Prodigy, and this is certainly a higher quality\nremix collection than I am accustomed\nto from musicians (bar Fabric). Personally I prefer the original tracks from\nInvaders Must Die to the remixes and\nwould rather listen to them properly\nin my own intoxicated rave-orgy, but\neither way you still receive that rush\nof euphoria and the feeling that Keith\nFlint could kick down your door any\nmoment and set fire to your lab re-ports. - Tom Jennings\nThis album takes you back to when\nguys with slicked back hair and sharp\nsuits were called crooners not bank-ers. The vocals are stylish and charming while the melodies make you want\nto get your friends together, dance\naround and take sepia-tinted photos.\nIt\u2019s basically been on repeat on my iPod\nfor about a month. - Kadhim Shubber\nKING KHAN AND\nTHE BBQ SHOW\nINVISIBLE GIRL\nIN THE RED\nRECORDS\nALBUM\nI\u2019ll explain. Frequenting small music\nvenues and undergoing the micro-gigging experience are infinitely more\nrewarding than seeing chart-topping\nbands in high capacity venues for the\nfollowing reasons:\nCrowd/band interaction is fundamental for small bands as they all need\na distinguishing feature to earn them a\nreputation. If your band name is Pink\nFloyd or Kings of Leon, playing a tight\nset of perfectly honed album material that everyone recognizes won\u2019t\nenlighten anyone\u2019s lives; they might\nas well stay at home and listen to the\ngoddamn album. Gig experiences are\nmade more unique if you happen to\nbe asked to play an instrument along\nwith a band, if you bring along your\nown instruments, if you are asked to\ncome up with a new song title, if they\naccept your inebriated bellows for song\nrequests or just give you dance moves\nto groove away to. If the headline act\nwalks off stage and sits at the nearest\ntable you can have a chat to find out\nwho their influences are, who they\u2019re\nshagging and even where the best places to buy instruments are.\nRandom memorable moments are\nthe crux of all good nights out, and\nthere are very few bands that can pull\noff an electro theme tune of The Antiques Roadshow for their opening\nTom Jennings\nnumber. If you notice a band\u2019s bass\nguitarist voraciously rubbing his cock\ninto the back of his guitar you can be\nreassured by the fact that other bands\nare willing to throw sweets and party\npoppers at their devoted audience in-stead. Lyrics can be fairly abstract and\nobscure, like the tales of love based\naround the uselessness of Jar Jar Binks,\nand my favourite lyrics of the past week\nhave been \u201cYou gotta pull your dick out\nat the restaurant in front of their aunt,\nand jerk off with your balls smackin\nthe windows of the Mitsubishi Galant!\u201d\n(f.y.i. this wasn\u2019t Coldplay). A woman\nresembling Edith Piaf slashed a knife\nthrough the air towards my face at the\nprevious gig as part of a French mock-cabaret act, whilst a close acquaintance of mine was being ordered to turn\nthe pages of a flick book with obscene\nwords on it. This is not the kind of experience you forget in a hurry.\nTight budgets and creative minds\nmake for an interesting array of instruments being \u2018played\u2019, some of which I\nhave seen recently include ukuleles,\na melodica (mouth-organ keyboard),\nbanjos, a handsaw, flutes, spoons,\nshoes, guitars made with planks of\nwood, a cello with no body, a ukulele\nmade with an ice cream box, saxo-phones, a big \u2018ole jar with a hole, reel to\nreel tape, cowbells, flutes, a hang (type\nof Swiss steel pans) and a lesser-known\ninstrument that I like to call the guitar.\nCheapness is of vital importance to\nstudents, and \u00a33 on the door or free entry beats a \u00a350 ticket planned 5 months\nin advance every time. Not only is entry cheaper, but booze is cheaper and\nmore varied too. Small venues often\nhave a bar or two on site and serve a\nwide variety of liquid meals, putting\nmany large venues to shame with their\nextortionate prices and lack of choice\n(Wembley Arena only sells two types\nof beer!!!!!)\nIn every way, small venues beat large\nvenues into the ground. Now if we can\nonly split the O2 Arena into 50 different smaller venues...\nThey look nothing like the silhouettes\nThis is the third consecutive album of\ncovers they\u2019ve done and it\u2019s so, so good.\nYou have to listen to it, it\u2019s on spotify,\ngo... Seriously they cover Time After\nTime, go now. - Kadhim Shubber\nThis album is how modern rock should\nsound. Heavy guitar, distortion and vocals matching Nirvana\u2019s, this is a sound\nof growling rock. Some songs sound\nsluggish and painful but this is their\nsound. It lacks some dynamic as songs\nsometimes blur together. This debut\nalbum gives a window to this bands po-tential, they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re giving all that they\u2019ve got. - Luke Turner\n\n"

I had a few complaints last week and I don\u2019t\nknow what to do about it.\nI have been informed that\nmy personal contribution to the paper\nlast week was very much below stand-ard, i.e. shit. I was confused as to why\nthis could be the case, so after glassing\nthe complainers I got them to confess.\nThey informed that they were extremely disappointed to find that last week I\nchoose not to have an angry rant directed at 5000 largely unknown persons. I\ncan only offer my most sincere apolo-gies; I just wasn\u2019t that angry last week.\nActually that\u2019s a lie; I did spend most of\nlast week throwing phones about, but\nthat\u2019s not my fault. If the twats on the\nother end are going to continue to ask\nme inane questions that have no bearing on my problem then they are going\nto have a phone launched at them. Fortunately, the closest wall if often much\nmore appealing to me and my phone is\nunusually strong- it\u2019s a Sony Ericsson\nfor those who are interested.\nRight. What would you say if I mentioned a Union vomit pit? Run with me\non this. I was supposed to be \u2018green\u2019\nthis week, but I had a little think about\nit decided \u2018fuck that\u2019. However, down\nthe bar this week Jov (the ex-editor)\nand I came up with an idea so great that\nwe are going to Dragons\u2019 Den with it- I\nshit you not. Listen in boys and girls:\nthe Union needs to dig a well on the\nright hand lawn in the quad. This well\ncan then be ceremoniously named the\n\u2018Vomit Pit\u2019 and I think you can guess\nwhat it should be used for. If you\u2019ve had\nthe dreaded one too many, the vomit pit\nis there for you and it\u2019s not just laddish\nbehaviour that can benefit. The bulimic\nand anorexic crew out there will benefit hugely too, they can now vomit and\nbe just like everyone else! \u2018Ohh look at\nme I\u2019m sooo drunk!\u2019. No love, you just\nrammed two fingers down your throat\nand it\u2019s 10am. But the best part is that\nthis pit acts as an anaerobic respirator,\nas enzymes break the vomit down energy is harnessed and the only wasted\nproduct is compost to be used by ESoc.\nHumm, now I\u2019ve re-read what I\u2019ve\njust written it sounded considerably\nmore plausible (and normal) in the bar,\nnow it just sounds silly. Finally imagine\nyou are on a packed train but in the\nmorning, everyone is silent except a\ncouple downstairs having a domestic.\nThe whole bus can hear quite clearly\nand halfway through the journey, the\nmale participant pipes up with the\nquote below. H-fucking-larious.\nStuff Imperial students like:\n8. Science Fiction:\nAs much as it pains me to say this,\napparently here at Imperial we love\na good bit of Sci-Fi. We do have Europe\u2019s biggest Sci-Fi library. Unfortunately. But apparently we fucking\nlove a good science fiction read.\nI personally don\u2019t see why we\nneed a whole big library for what\nis essentially literature and can be\nfound in any other library in the\nland, but each to their own. However over my years at Imperial I have\nnoticed a similar tradition running\nthrough the whole of the Sci-Fi cli-entele, the longness of hair and often lack of shower.\nNow this could be due to the never ending bench-pressing of huge\nnovels, or because they are so keen\nto read that a shower comes pretty\nmuch necessary. Whatever the rea-son, there is no excuse to shag in the\nwest wing basement toilets is there\nNHS specs boy? Yes we all heard\nyou last year. Twat.\nSci-Fi, take note. Water = women\nThis week\u2019s best of lol catz\n\n"

The religions\nrepresented were Baha\u2019i, Buddhism,\nChristianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism,\nJudaism and Sikhism. Yousef Salmasi, a\nco-ordinator of the event and member of\nthe InterFaith group which were behind\nit, explained that \u2018\u2019it\u2019s the astonishing diversity in faiths and beliefs at Imperial\nwhich adds that extra element to living\nout your faith\u2019\u2019\n.\nYousef, upon asked about the purpose\nof the event, added: \u2018\u2019By having an interfaith forum at imperial, and a launch\nevent of this nature, we can ensure that\nthere is more interaction, and of an appropriate and respectful nature, between\ndifferent faith groups on campus. People\nmay ask why this is important but the\nanswer is simple: so that we can finish our journey in university as learned\nand open-minded ambassadors of the\nworld, whilst maintaining our respective\nidentities.\u2019\u2019\nThe event was marked a success, receiving praise from many who attended.\nObadah Ghannam, a Medicine undergraduate remarked that witnessing these\nreligions \u2018\u2019come together in such a visible\nform of unity was absolutely amazing.\u2019\u2019\nInterFaith was noted by Harsita Patel,\nanother undergraduate studying Medicine as being a \u2018\u2019fantastic opportunity to\npromote and spread the fantastic teachings and morals of various religions.\u2019\u2019 He\nplans to \u2018\u2019educate others about Hinduism and gain a better understanding of\nother faiths, whilst getting to know and\nbefriend a new group of people.\u2019\u2019\nInterFaith holds many dialogue events\nin an effort to apply a variety of perspec-tivestoreligionsandallowtheaudienceto\ndiscussandexploreculturalandotherdif-ferencesindepth.Formerpresidentofthe\nJewish Society, Yoni Weiner, is currently\na representative of InterFaith, explaining\nthat \u2018\u2019InterFaith is very important for dis-pellingmythsandmisconceptionsandin-creasing understanding and co-operation\nbetween different faith groups.\u2019\u2019\nAlexKarapetian News Reporter\nMedia Awards fail\nAfter a year of being the best at something other than research, Imperial College is no longer home to the \u2018Student\nNewspaper of the Year\u2019. Despite being\nnominated for several awards, neither fe-lix, nor Live! won anything at the Guardian Student Media Awards on Wednesday. felix was in the running again for\nStudent Newspaper of the Year but was\nunfortunately beaten by Leeds Student\nfromtheUniversityofLeeds.DylanLowe\ndidn\u2019t win Best Travel Writer either. Imperial\u2019s website Live! was also nominated\nfor Student Website of the Year but the\nUniversity of York\u2019s website www.nouse.\nco.uk was apparently better.\nIC Radio left empty-handed too at\nthe Student Radio Awards even though\nRoushan Alam had been nominated for\nthree awards: Best Male Presenter, Best\nEntertainment Programme, and Best\nInterview (with Derren Brown), which\nwere awarded to Fergus Dufton (URN),\nThe Big Chewsie (RaW), and Joshua\nChambers (URY), respectively.\nThis outcome was a big disappointment\nfor Imperial College, which will just have to\nrecoveritscredibilityatnextyear\u2019sawards.\nLizzy Griffiths\nA\ns we roll into the latter\nstages of November, there\nis plenty to be looking forward to in the near future.\nOne date almost everyone will have\nearmarked as one to look forward to\nis Christmas, and I am not the excep-tion. The Christmas break will provide\nme, like most, with the chance to catch\nup with some sleep and termly quota\nof distinct idleness that I have become\naccustomed to in the past two years at\nuniversity.\nHowever, before I\u2019m content to truly\nappreciate the fuzzy sentiment of Coca\nCola\u2019s \u201cThe holidays are coming\u201d adver-tisements, there have been, and still will\nbe, some important happenings regarding felix as a newspaper, institution and\ncommunity.\nThe first issue has been a pressing matter for over a year now; the server that\nessentially runs the office and is vital for\nthe production of every issue was dying on its feet. Last week, I\u2019d say it was\ntaken to within a few days of its complete\nfailure, and in that event we would have\nbeen royally screwed. Luckily for me and\nmy distinct lack of knowledge about local networks and Apple products, none\nother than Comment Editor Ravi Pall\norganised a swift and wonderfully effective server change this week. A personal apology would go a lot further, but\nI think I\u2019ve been incredibly short with\nso many people these past few weeks,\na public one will have to do. So, if I\u2019ve\nseemed a little ratty recently, please do\naccept my almost sincere regrets.\nThis week also saw the felix team go\nto the Guardian Student Media Awards\n2009 in Camden. As Student Newspaper of the Year last year, a collection of\neditors led by last year\u2019s Editor-in-Chief\nJovan Nedic went with a huge amount\nof pressure and expectation on their\nshoulders. Nominated once again for the\nnight\u2019s main category, alongside Dylan\nLowe\u2019s nomination as Travel Writer of\nthe Year, we left North London empty-handed. Despite losing our title we\ncoveted so dearly, I am still immensely\nproud of the work done last year. The\nGuardian judges may not have thought\nit was worthy of an award to Jovan\u2019s dis-appointment, but his characteristically\nbullish editorial style has commanded\ngreat respect amongst College and his\npeers. Truthfully, I personally value the\nopinion of the editors and readers of felix\nfar more than the Guardian judges, and\nI hope Jovan does too. To see someone\nintently reading or casually enjoying\nthe paper on a Friday morning is a great\nhonour that an award ceremony once\na year will probably never emulate. A\nnomination still means we are a top 5\nstudent newspaper in the entire country,\nand that is enough to be proud of.\nWe\u2019ve been barking about this for a\nfair while now, but felix reaches 60 years\nold on the 9th of December, and it\u2019s an\nopportunity for celebration. We\u2019ve got a\nspecial anniversary issue coming up, so\nlook out for a special issue. Pints in the\nUnion are on us that day. When I say \u2018us\u2019\n,\nI definitely \u2018yourself with your own money.\u2019 Felix is already free of charge every\nweek, it would have cost you 9 pence in\n1949. What more do you want? Drink up\nand sod off. Oh, there\u2019s me being ratty\nagain.\nmay ask why this is importan\nEditor-in-Chief\nDan Wan\nNews Reporter\nThe sweet smell of success for Nottingham Trent University...\n\n"

With the minibus\npacked and ready to go at the slightly\nlater time of 5:30, the club trip to Afan\nforest, in the far flung corner of the UK\nthat is South Wales, set off.\nAfter exhausting all normal conversation a few hours in our thoughts\nturned to the weather or more to the\npoint how bad it was. The radio might\nhave mentioned something about the\nworst storm in the UK this year readying itself to hit south Wales on the\nSaturday. Luckily the storms hadn\u2019t\nworked up enough force to close the\nseven bridge and we arrived at our\ndestination, Bryn Bettws lodge, in relatively good time (six hours after setting\noff in the rush hour traffic).\nSaturday arrived in a mildly wet\nand windy manner, but nothing of the\nstorms that the news had been threatening the day before. After making the\nmost of the included breakfast at the\nshockingly early time of 8:30 we set\nabout preparing the bikes and commenting on (Toby\u2019s) kit choice before\nembarking on Afan\u2019s longest trail, w2.\nAfter warming up with a descent followed by a short climb, the general\nconsensus seemed to be that riding\nall day in the slight drizzle wouldn\u2019t\nbe a problem. However, only a short\nwhile later the rain gradually built up\ninto a fully fledged storm, turning the\ntrails into muddy rivers and making us\nquestion who had coined the laughable term \u201cwaterproof\u201d, as no item of\nclothing described as such seemed to\nfulfil its promise. Dave provided the\nmornings\u2019 entertainment by mysteriously leaping off his bike into a bush\nto inspect the local fauna. I personally\nfound the rest of that downhill section\nchallenging, it seems the side effects\nof viewing Dave launch into said bush\nimpair the bikes\u2019 handling somewhat.\nWe had planned to stop halfway\nround w2 at the skyline centre in which\nCycling weather it out\nin South Wales\nthere is an excellent cafe. On this occa-sion, it was packed full of wet, muddy\nbikers desperately trying to find an\nexcuse not to go back out into the\nhowling gale and torrential rain. After\nfuelling up we continued on the trail;\nmercifully the weather was starting\nto improve, and just as we were about\nto finish the ride several hours later,\nit could even have been described as\nquite nice! The afternoon was filled\nwith a challenging climb, littered with\nexhausted riders who hadn\u2019t quite\nmanaged to make it too the top (or for\nsome people, had barely left the start!)\nAll the hard effort spent in the ascension was rewarded by the final descent\nback to the lodge\nAfter fully exploring Port Talbot\u2019s\nnight life (well, the one pub to be found\nthere) Sunday dawned to the sound of\nyet more rain and very strange noises\nescaping from everyone\u2019s bikes. Shortly after driving to the skyline centre,\nso that James and I could be robbed\nby the bike shop in exchange for a few\nsets of brake pads, we headed to the\nPenhydd centre to ride the trail of the\nsame name.\nLuckily it had stopped raining, and\nwe were able to enjoy the shorter Penhydd trail even fitting in a spot of light\nreading at the top. After arriving back\nat the trail centre car park we packed\nup the minibus and headed back to\nLondon at the rapid pace of about\n62mph.\nIain Gillam Cycling\nCycling Club partaking in a some light reading in South Wales\n\n"

    "content": "CULTURE &\nTHE ARTS\nArts Editors Caz Knight, Rosie Milton & Lucy Harrold\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDeath by\nArt\nCazKnight Arts Editor\nA\npologies for the significantly smaller arts section this week. The half\nway mark of the term\nhas been reached which\nmeans lowered energy levels and impending deadlines, leaving little time\nfor writing about life\u2019s more pleasurable distractions such as museums, art\ngalleries, books...\nI have had a ten day grace period between handing in one load of course-works and being given the next load.\nI have made use of this time not by\nbrushing up on the lectures covered so\nfar this term, but by devouring as much\nof my new book as possible: Cancer\nWard by Aleksandr Solzhenistyn (yes,\nthe arts section covers books too). This\noutstanding novel not only explores in\ngreat detail the unavoidable notion of\ndeath, but gives thorough insights into\nthe corrupt workings of 1950s Soviet\nRussia.\nDeath: a subject which has made itself apparent in many forms to me this\nweek. Besides reading, I have had to\ntime to nip round the British Museum,\nthe National Gallery and the bite-sized\nWhite Cube, all of them teeming with\nthe idea of mortality. A ten metre long\nhorizontal cabinet filled with a lifetime\u2019s worth of pills, photographs and\nmedical records track the birth, life\nand death of one man; one is reminded\nagain of death by the impressive mummy collection in the Egyptian wing.\nThe presence of and relevance of\ndeath to religion is obvious in bloody\nrealism in the Sacred Made Real at the\nNational gallery (reviewed here last\nweek by Bernard Pereira). The sculptures of dead and putrefying Jesuses\nbring home death\u2019s inevitability and\nalso death\u2019s necessity, for it is through\ndeath that life is what it is.\nDamien Hirst is a fine example of an\nartist who is fascinated by death and\none who finds beauty in it, hence the\nmultitude of skulls and animal corpses\nsuspended in formaldehyde. His latest\nexhibition at the White Cube showcases his oil paintings, hauntingly similar\nto the nihilistic and macabre work of\nFrancis Bacon and also bringing to\nmind the barren landscapes created in\nthe plays of Samuel Beckett.\nHirst\u2019s blue paintings are messy and\nunsightly and lack the beauty of his\nprevious, more famous works. Watch\nthis space for the full review of the appropriately named \u2018Nothing Matters\u2019\nexhibition which is spread between\nboth the Mayfair and Hoxton galleries.\nBut for this week the content is\ncheerfully devoid of death. Arts editor\nLucy Harrold tells us why she likes musical theatre genius Stephen Sondheim\nin a new feature:_ \u2018Why I Like\u2019.\nGot someone creative you love and\nwant to rave about? Email us at\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy I like: Sondheim\nLucy Harrold spearheads a new weekly feature: Why I Like... This\nweek she tells us why Stephen Sondheim is so great\nS\ntephen Sondheim is possibly\none of the most prolific and\ninnovative musical theatre\nwriters ever. His works span\nfrom the ridiculous (A Funny\nThing Happened on The Way to the\nForum) to the melancholic (A Little\nNight Music). I think this is why he can\nbe classed as one of the greats; unlike\nhis contemporaries such as Andrew\nLloyd Webber or Frank Wildhorn, he\nis able to turn his hand to anything.\nSondheim has written for film, theatre\nand even TV, originally starting as a\nscript writer for Topper (an American\nseries I\u2019ve never heard of), and going\non to make a made-for-TV musical\nabout the night time goings on in a department store.\nThe thing I admire most about Stevie-baby is his determination to strive\nfor something new and different- a rare\nfeat nowadays.\nHis influences are wide and varied and input directly into his own\nwork- who else would write a Japanese\nKabuki musical or a horror operetta\nabout killer barbers and human meat\npies or even an entire show written\nbackwards!? Fair enough, not all of his\nshows have been financially successful\nbut that has never stopped the greats\nin other art forms- most painters are\nnot financially viable until after their\ndeaths.\nI guess part of Sondheim\u2019s visionary success is due to his collaborations\nwith Hal Prince. Most of his artistic\nand financial achievements were produced and directed by Prince. Without\nsomeone to turn his ideas into reality,\nSondheim would just be another penniless writer with untapped potential.\nSondheim\u2019s Best Work:\nCompany- My favourite of Sondheim\u2019s shows, Company is based on a\nseries of short one-act plays set in the\n1970s by George Furth. These scenarios were combined to form a character study of New Yorkers. Bobby, the\ncentral character, is reaching his 35th\nbirthday to discover he is still very\nmuch alone in his life despite his many\nfriends we encounter. The play explores Bobby\u2019s alienation and the truth\nbehind the rose-tinted relationships of\nhis (almost all married) friends. Sondheim\u2019s musicals never try to be happy\nfor the sake of being happy and Company is a prime example of this. Bobby\nstarts the show feeling a bit grumpy\nabout all his friends being married,\njourneys through cocktails, weddings,\nweed-smoking and various parties\ndo discover that, actually, maybe it\ndoesn\u2019t matter as much as he thinks.\nCompany\u2019s songs take their influences\nfrom various forms of music but are\nall strong melodically, lyrically and in\ntheir place in the musical.\nBest Songs:\nCompany- Sondheim cleverly took\nthe \u201cbeep\u201d tone of an answering machine as a starting place for this song,\ngradually adding in more and more\nof Bobby\u2019s friends to culminate in an\nepic wall of sound finale. It has to be\nlistened to in full stereo!\nBeing Alive- Possibly Sondheim\u2019s\nbest ballad. Bobby has reached a moment of realisation right at the end of\nthe show and expresses this in a heart-wrenching song about how no one can\nbe truly alive without having someone\nto look after them.\nSunday In The Park With Georgesanother of Sondheim\u2019s arty-farty type\nshows but probably his best. Remember doing pointillism in Art class? (Of\ncourse it\u2019s been a long time for most of\nyou) \u2018That\u2019 dude Georges Seurat who\nspent forever painting people by a river\nin a park? Yep, that\u2019s him...well sort of.\nThe first act follows Georges as he\nendeavours to finish his painting without losing his girlfriend, and muse,\nDot. Sondheim cleverly echoes the\nprocess of pointillism in the rhythms\nof his songs and the characters echo\nthe people in the painting. The second\nact portrays another George; this time\nSeurat\u2019s great-grandson who is also an\nartist but of a more abstract vein.\nThe actress who portrays Dot now\nbecomes George\u2019s grandmother (and\nSeurat and Dot\u2019s daughter), thus exploring a completely different relationship but still of a man who just can\u2019t\nfinish his work.\nBest Songs:\nPutting It Together- an ode to lengthy\nand stressful process of completing any\nform of art. This song explores why we\nmake art and how the process can be\njust as much a part of it as the final\nproduct.\nMove On- Dot returns to question\nGeorge\u2019s motives and push him along\nhis creative pathway. A beautifully melodic piece with repeating refrains to\nmove on and keep creating art.\nAssassins- Yes... Assassins... I like it\nwhen Sondheim tries to be edgy. Assassins is a musical about every person\nwho has tried to kill an American pres-ident. The show is set in a fairground\nwith The Proprietor inviting the characters to \u201ccome shoot a president\u201d as\neach of them recounts their story of\nfame, triumph or failure. What Sondheim does with this less than cheery\npremise is present the audience with\nan extraordinarily eclectic bunch of\npeople with one trait that binds them\ntogether. These range from the almost\ncomedic Samuel Byck, dressed in a\nsloppy santa outfit, who failed to kill\nRichard Nixon to John Wilkes Booth,\nwho famously assassinated Abraham\nLincoln at a theatre. The show culminates in the previous assassins persuading Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot\nJohn F Kennedy. Not a high-kick or\njazz hand in sight.\nBest Songs:\nEverybody\u2019s Got The Right- aah, an a\nrousing anthem for killing people; well\nnot quite. This song sets the tone for\nthe rest of the show- combining comedy and tragedy as Sondheim does so\nwell.\nUnworthy of Your Love- So why do all\nthe best love ballads have to be about\nsomething unsavoury? Like vowing\nto Charlie Manson and Jodie Foster\nthat you\u2019ll kill Nixon for them? This\nis a beautiful duet which just happens\nto include phrases like \u201cI would crawl\nbelly deep through hell\u201d and \u201cYou are\nwind and devil and God Charlie, take\nmy blood and my body\u201d. There is a rewritten version without these references but that would be like watching Pulp\nFiction without any of the swearing.\nArtist, Georges, and his girlfriend/muse, Dot, in \u2018Sunday with Georges\u2019\nThe man himself: New York-born Stephen Sondheim\n13\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\n\n"

Phesto explains that he\nmet him on tour and approached\nhim. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius, everything that\nhe touches is gold, an instant classic\u201d.\nWe ask him what it\u2019s like to work with\nsuch an influential producer, \u201cIt\u2019s a big\ndeal obviously, he upped our game.\nHe\u2019s got a vision for the record that he\nwants you to follow, he\u2019s not just a beat\nmaker like some other producers, he\nshapes the whole song\u201d.\nAlthough the group are predictably\nfull of praise for the producer (even\ncalling the knobs on his mixer, Prince\nPaul\u2019s \u2018weapons\u2019), they\u2019re obviously reiterating the same stuff they\u2019ve been\nsaying all day. However when the conversation turns to the music industry,\nTajai becomes more animated.\nI ask them if they think the changes\nin the music industry over the last\ntwenty years affected how they approached their album and Tajai is\nquick to point out a flaw in my logic.\n\u201cThe industry hasn\u2019t changed, sure the\nmethod of distribution is different but\nmaking a record is the same as it\u2019s ever\nbeen: it\u2019s hard work\u201d. He continues\nsaying that the major record labels are\nstill the same: \u201cThere\u2019s always been\na few artists who are innovators and\nabout 30 others that labels sign just\nbecause they sound the same as the\ninnovators\u201d.\nWhen you remember that for the last\n20 years Souls of Mischief have been\nignoring musical trends and hype and\nmaking the kind of music that they\nlike making, it\u2019s less surprising that\nTajai has little time for doomsday predictions of the music industry.\nLater in the interview, he pours cold\nwater on the supposed death of the al-bum. \u201cPeople don\u2019t remember singles,\nwhen you look at the history of mu-sic, who talks about singles? It\u2019s short\nstories vs novels, they both have their\nplace but ultimately it\u2019s novels that\nmake an impact\u201d.\nHe similarly has little time for the\n\u2018controversy\u2019 over the use of Autotune, hailing T-Pain as a genius and\nsaying that like most things, \u201cIt\u2019s good\nwhen used well and bad when used\nbadly. It\u2019s nothing new, it\u2019s been used\nin dancehalls for ages.\u201d\nPhesto however does call out people\nwho use it to disguise a lack of tal-ent. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get someone\nelse to sing it, it\u2019s narcissistic, people\nwill say \u201cbut you weren\u2019t in the video\u201d\nbut they\u2019re not proud enough to just\nsay \u201cyeah but I wrote it\u201d, people don\u2019t\nthink like that anymore\u201d. He hammers\nhome his point with a guitar analogy\nfor our benefit, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a distortion pedal but you can\u2019t play guitar, it\u2019s\nnot going to help is it?\u201d\nI pick up on Tajai\u2019s comment about\nalbums making an impact and ask\nhim why after their classic debut 93\ntil Infinity in 1993, Souls Of Mischief\nhaven\u2019t made as big of an impact on\nthe rap scene. He takes a moment,\nconsidering the question before an-swering. \u201cTiming, it\u2019s all timing and\nnewness. When we released the first\nHieroglyphics album, people talked\nabout that as a classic\u201d. It\u2019s clear that\nhe doesn\u2019t waste his thoughts on how\nmuch hype their music creates but\nPhesto adds, \u201cA lot of the success of\nthat album came from the video for\n93 til Infinity\u201d; \u201cBack then\u201d Tajai in-terjects, \u201cMusic channels were varied\nbut today they\u2019re all owned by the\nsame company and you get the same\nmusic on almost every channel\u201d which\nties in with his belief that the industry\nhasn\u2019t changed, just the methods of\ndistribution.\nJamie turns the conversation to\nthe guys themselves and what\u2019s kept\nthem together over 20 years. Tajai\nresponds tiredly; the day\u2019s wearing\non and they\u2019ve been doing non-stop\ninterviews for almost 6 hours, \u201cWe\u2019re\nall friends, we\u2019ve known each other\nfor decades\u201d before giving us another\nanalogy for our benefit: \u201cFriends meet\nthrough soccer and even if they don\u2019t\nalways play, they\u2019re still going to hang\nout\u201d. It\u2019s nearing the end of the interview when Opio returns. His dark\nshades combined with his afro all but\ndisguise his face but he\u2019s keen to pick\nup the thread of the conversation,\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have the \u2018job\u2019 that we\nhave, you can\u2019t complain when your\njob is rapping with your homeboys\u201d,\nhe thinks for a moment before adding \u201cAlthough people sometimes forget that it\u2019s a lot of hard work, it\u2019s not\njust 1 hour on stage, it\u2019s the other 23\nhours of the day as well, it\u2019s not just\nsex, drugs and rock n roll\u201d.\nQuestions for\nTy Vaughn\nPortland\u2019s musical heritage: \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t fit with typical Portland bands,\nThe Decemberists, The Thermals,\nthose guys. But Oregon means a lot to\nus.\u201d\nConverting from hardcore punk to\npop punk: \u201cThe hardcore scene really welcomed us with open arms. I\nthink the kids enjoyed having a break,\nsomething they could sing along to.\u201d\nEB: I know hardcore scenes can be\nclosed-minded. \u201cIf anyone was closed-minded, it was me\u2026 I didn\u2019t want\nto play hardcore shows, but all our\nfriends were in hardcore bands and we\ncouldn\u2019t get any others. I\u2019m glad we did\nit now, though.\u201d\nInfluences: \u201cGreen Day were a huge\ninfluence on us\u2026 well, everything they\ndid more than a decade ago. They\u2019re\nstill one of my favourite bands though.\u201d\nBillie Joe Armstrong\u2019s part on signing the band to his label, Adeline\nRecords: \u201cHe didn\u2019t. I think right before American Idiot he realised he\ncouldn\u2019t juggle playing in a band, touring and running a record label while\nstill having time for his family.\u201d\nBasement gigs vs festival shows: \u201cIt\u2019s\ncompletely different. We like both. At\nReading I saw Gallows, and that was\namazing\u2026 for most of the gig most\nof the band were playing out in the\ncrowd. They\u2019re a great band.\u201d\nThe Smiths and hardcore punk: \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t get it for a long time. You\u2019d go\nto shows and there\u2019d be hardcore kids\nwith \u201cThe Smiths\u201d tattooed on their\narms.

Imperial\nis no longer a desert to\nhandsome men (or man).\nAt precisely 11:15am on Tuesday,\nI almost died. This beautiful man - a\nGreek version of Gerard Butler - was\nqueuing behind me in the SCR. You\nknow when you look at someone and\nyour jaw drops, your heart stops and\nyour body melts? He has the curliest of\nall hair, brown in the shape of a barrister\u2019s wig. I had to pretend that I was\nlooking back to check my friend just\nto catch another excessive glimpse of\nhim. As I requested my baguette to be\ntoasted, he smiled at me (oh my god,\noh my god) and said \u2018maybe your sandwich will be soggy with the salad in it\u2019.\nTo which I replied, totally sensibly and\nappropriately - \u2018Can I touch your hair?\u2019.\nHe grinned (oh my god oh my god,\noh my god) and lowered his head.\nI touched it (oh my god) and he said\n\u2018I like people touching my hair in the\nmorning\u2019 in the cutest, kindest possible way without any sarcasm.\n\u2018So what course do you do?\u2019 I might\nhave been playing with my hair at this\npoint. \u2018Biomedical Engineering, used\nto based in Mech Eng you know. And\nI tell people I come to London, and\nof all the exciting places\u2026 I work in a\nbasement.\u2019 \u2018Yes, the corridor looks like\na tunnel to the death, ha-ha.\u2019 I think I\nlaughed harder than he did. I commented on his hair again (another terrific joke about not having to wear a\nwig to a courtroom) and we went our\nseparate ways. He said, \u2018nice to meet\nyou\u2019. Oh my god oh my god oh my god.\nMy friends say \u2018point him out to us\nwhen you run into him next time\u2019. My\nfriends, I can assure you, there will be\nno \u2018pointing\u2019 when I run into him. It\nis likely that I will be in my heels, my\nheight the exact level as his. And I will\nY\nou may have seen from our\nlast issue that we do photo-shoots here. The trouble is,\nwe always need new blood\nto help out on the operational and\nthe creative front. First and foremost,\nwe need models! Male and female\nalike! If you\u2019re not afraid to wear cat-suits, clown outfits and cool designer\nclothes... Send your headshot, full\nbody shot, your dress size and shoe\nsize to fashion.felix\nThere is so much preparation work\nErdem will follow the footsteps of Stella\nMcCartney, Gareth Pugh and Giles\nDeacon to show a small collection at the\nV&A on the 11th December.\nThe V&A\u2019s Fashion in Motion series is a\nchance for those outside of the fashion\nindustry to see some top catwalk shows.\nEntry is free but booking is essential,\nphone 020 7942 2820. Booking starts\nMonday 30th November 9am.\nParisian boutique Colette is to open a pop-up\nshop in the East End. This week The Cube\nStore unveils Colette\u2019s first UK pop-up shop\nat the Old Truman Brewery. To gain entry\nyou must apply online or look out for Nissan\nCube cars around the city and ask the driver\nfor a membership card to admit you into the\nstore.\nGerard Butler\n@ Imperial\nKawai Wong Fashion Editor\naccidentally run into his face.\nWhile I am on the matter of heels,\nmay I congratulate Giuseppe Zanotti,\nthe greatest shoe sculptor that ever\nexisted in human history, whose un-prounceable name has not done him a\ngreat deal of favour so far (ju-\u2019sep-pee\nzan-\u2019not\u2019ti). He has been awarded shoe\ndesigner of the year by Footwear News,\na title previously held by Manolo Blahnik. Giuseppe\u2019s work does not need a\nred under sole or a cute name to divert\nattention. His shoes are to buildings a\nNorman Foster\u2019s design; to fast cars a\nBugatti\u2019s masterpiece and to chairs a\nRon Arad\u2019s creation.\nGiuseppe\u2019s shoes are mad creations\nof orderly details. The shoes look\nstreamlined, the seams look perfect,\nthe embellishments are just right.\nWhen the shoe paints a picture of\nlightning, it paints it, and finishes with\n10 times more edginess. When the\nshoe stands as a sculpture, it stands\nwith confidence and conveys a sense\nof frivolous fluidity. A bit like Banksy\u2018s\nsculptures - it\u2018s fun and serious.\nIncidently, Giuseppe Zanotti also has\none of the best shoe ads out there. Anja\nRubik has been the brand\u2019s spokeswoman for two seasons. The ads are\ncolourful, youthful, playful and are always very aesthetically pleasing.\nFor Carrie Bradshaw, the woman\nwho keeps choosing the wrong man;\nmay I advice that this Man-olo may not\nhave been the best shoe choice after all.\nAnyway, if you are going to splash\nout on Boxing Day, head down to\nSouth Kensington and knock yourself\nout at Giuseppe Zanotti\u2019s boutique at\n206 Walton Street. If you\u2019re the handsome man I talked about earlier and\nif you have any questions at all about\nwhat I\u2019ve written, please phone the felix office. I will be happy to attend to\nyour queries personally. And no... I am\nnot crazy! So folks, until next time.\nGiuseppe Zanotti\u2019s SS09 and AW09 ad campaign featuring Anja Rubik.\nCharity jewellery sale at Imperial\nThe jewellery is handmade with an oriental\ntwist and priced between \u00a33 to \u00a38. All proceeds from this sale will go to Shining Your\nLife, a charity to help single mothers setting\nup their own businesses. Visit G/F of Sherfield\nbetween 1-2pm on the 30th\nNov. Visit their facebook\ngroup at Shining Your Life\nfor details.\nClassic Hepburn memorabilia goes\nunder the Hammer\nSome of Audrey Hepburn\u2019s most\nfamous dresses, designed by the likes of\nGivenchy and Valentino, will be going\non auction in London this week.

This time next week my editorial may just be a series of growls and\nmoans. And as every gamer knows,\nnothing soothes an ailing mind like\nrunning through a whole game in one\nbleary-eyed Lemsipped weekend. So\nlast week, I played Modern Warfare 2.\nIn retrospect, playing such a game\nthrough in a few long bursts is not a great\nplan. It\u2019s such a draining experience that\nby the end you\u2019re completely desensitised\nto the murderously intense segments that\nthe game is composed of, and there\u2019s simply no adrenaline left in you to eke out.\nAfter a few hours, I found myself putting\ndown hostage situations with the sort of\nnonchalance I\u2019d normally afford to making toast, and I suppose that\u2019s not entirely\nthe fault of the game.\nWhatIdidfindlacking,though,wasthe\nconsistencythatCallofDuty2had.There\nwas a nice sense of peaks and troughs; a\ncampaign evolved over time and landscapes slowly changed. Of course, CoD2\nhad the benefit of a basis in history, and\nmany stories of World War 2 would be\nunmarketablydullhadtheynothappened\nfor real. Perhaps Infinity Ward simply felt\nthat bigger was better when it came to fictional settings, and I think that looking at\nthe way they\u2019ve marketed MW2 they\u2019re\nprobably right. For me, this doesn\u2019t make\nitasfuntoplay,becausethere\u2019snobreathing space between each blistering engage-ment. We\u2019ve got an article to come that\ngives a great reason why it\u2019s still fun - we\u2019ll\ntry to fit that in this term.\nStill, this week - the Dragon Age review\nwhich never made it into last week\u2019s issue,\nalong with a chance to win one of four\ncopies of the game for the Xbox 360. I\nmay never manage to take a look at DA,\nas I just can\u2019t get the hang of those sprawlingRPGs,butourhandsomeMr.Roberts\u2019\ntales of his playthrough really do make it\nsound like Game of the Year material.\nFinally, we\u2019ve got a nice and inflammatory comment piece that we\u2019ve been waiting to run for some time now. Rasheed\nhas a bone or two to pick with Nintendo,\nand feels quite strongly about it indeed.\nReckon he\u2019s wrong? Write and tell us why\n- games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nNintendo - Rise or Fall?\nRasheed Islamhassomethingtotellyou-butyoumaywellnotlikeit\nN\nintendo. A name once\nsynonymous with qual-ity, loyalty and perseverance amongst gamers\nall over the world. They\nwere a games developer who showed\nthe competition that when it comes to\ngames, quality and hard work is what\npays off. Ever since they came into the\nhome console market in 1983, they\nhave built a repertoire of well known, if\nnot legendary characters such as Link,\nSamus, Fox McCloud and officially the\nmost recognised video game character\nin the world, Mario.\nof Time\u2019, was released on the N64.\nNintendo may have been the underdogs in the past two generations of the\nconsoles, but one thing they always\nhad was a loyal fan base. These were\nnot the typical \u2018fanboys\u2019 that we see\nthese days, arguing that Microsoft is\nbetter than Sony and changing sides\nas they please. They were true gamers\nwho valued and appreciated the hard\nwork and artistic talent that the developers invested in the games. I myself\nam one of these fans and it saddens me\nto say that we are a dying species.\nIn the apocalyptic year of 2006, Ninhad attracted, the so-called \u2018casual gamers,\u2019 are in fact, casual gamers. They\ntake no notice of the artistic and technical talent in video games. Games are a\nminor part of their lives; it is something\nthey do as a pastime. Whereas, true\ngamers see video games as a lifestyle,\nand amidst all the furore of catering for\nthese casual gamers, Nintendo have lost\ntheir true essence. Quality is nowhere\nto be seen in their games. Of course, at\nlaunch the Wii had some quality games\nsuch as \u2018The Legend of Zelda: Twilight\nPrincess\u2019\n, followed up with 2007\u2019s \u2018Super Mario Galaxy\u2019\n, but soon after that a\ndrought followed. \u2018Things\u2019 such as \u2018Wii\nFit\u2019 and \u2018Wii Sports Resort\u2019 were released that were equivalent to digitised\nfaeces. Whatever games were released\non the Wii were not games, they were\ngimmicks. Things that are entertaining\nfor a few months, then get boring. The\n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 motion controls have\nturned out to be simple \u2018stick waggling\u2019\nand any half decent game that has been\nreleased can be played better with a con-troller. It has been months since a quality\ngame has come out on the console. All\nNintendo see now is money, and they are\nmilking that market until it goes dry.\nSadly, the market is going dry. This\nmonth Nintendo lowered their profit\nforecasts by $3bn and even their president Satoru Iwata has admitted: \u2018The\nWii has stalled.\u2019 The casual gamers have\nabandoned the Wii as it is no longer\ntheir \u2018new toy\u2019 and the true fans are\nshocked at the sight of what their beloved developers have become. Worst of\nall, Nintendo cannot generate enough\ninterest for top games developers to\nproduce quality games because the Wii\nis widely perceived as a gimmick. They\nknow that their games will not sell on\nthe console because the owners of\nsaid console cannot even differentiate\nfrom a first person shooter to an action\nadventurer.\nFortunately, there is still hope for\nNintendo. The names and legends of\nthe characters that once made them the\ngreat developers they were have been\nkept intact. As long as Nintendo can\nreturn to their roots and start producing quality works of art as they once did,\nthey can, and will once again, win our\nhearts over. I just pray that someone\nknocks some sense back into them.\nWin Dragon Age!\nT\nhis week, the divine and\nmanly felix writer Tomo\nRoberts gives us his hard-earnt verdict on Dragon\nAge: Origins, a 2009 latecomer that many are billing to be the\nhighlight of the year.\nThanks to the delightful, shiny and\ngenerally attractive people at EA Europe, we\u2019ve got four copies of Dragon\nAge: Origins for the XBox 360 to give\naway to felix readers.\nWe know how much you like being\nasked to sing for your supper here at fe-lix, so we\u2019re going to make it as blister-ingly simple as possible.

(Clue - the answer\u2019s B)\nNot to worry, becuase our Christmas\nissue will be featuring a mass giveaway,\nincluding a fifth copy of Dragon Age\nfor the 360 among other goodies including some of our favourite games of\n2009, so there\u2019s another chance to bag\na copy then, too.\nMake sure you pick up a copy in the\nlast week of term!\nWhen the Famicom was first released in Japan in 1983, Nintendo\ninstantly became a household name.\nWithin two years they broke the global market and their games were instant hits. Gamers loved \u2018Super Mario\nBros.\u2019 for its challenge, \u2018The Legend of\nZelda\u2019 for its depth and sense of adventure and many other games which now\nhave become classics. Needless to say,\nNintendo crushed the competition.\nThrough the years to come, Nintendo released console after console, from\nthe \u2018Super Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem\u2019 (SNES) to the \u2018Nintendo 64\u2019,\nand even though the competition was\ngetting fiercer with Sega and Sony becoming major players in the industry,\nNintendo persevered by churning out\nthe same high quality games that their\nfans loved. The highest rated game of\nall time, \u2018The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina\ntendo introduced their newest member\nof the family, the \u2018Nintendo Wii.\u2019 Hyped\nas the most revolutionary console in\ngaming, with motion sensing technol-ogy, they promised that the Wii would\nbring gaming to a whole new audience.\nIndeed it brought a new audience, 56\nmillion buyers to be precise.

Even though the Wii had the least\nhorsepower under the bonnet, rivals\nMicrosoft and Sony were blasted away\nby its popularity. Wiis were flying off\nthe shelves in every continent. It was as\nif the credit crunch did not even exist\nfor Nintendo and they even increased\ntheir forecasts for the 2008-2009 fiscal\nyear.\nHowever, what Nintendo failed to\nrealise was that the new audience they\nIs this what we endured the Gamecube for?

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nElevating the elite\nwithin the\nGolden Triangle\nA report released this week by the Higher\nEducation Policy Institute examines the extent to\nwhich Imperial still trail Oxford and Cambridge\nas their main British rivals.\nEditor-in-Chief Dan Wan investigates how far\nin front they are actually are\nI\nmperial cannot claim to be\nkeeping up with Oxford and\nCambridge as academic insti-tution, says a new report published by the Higher Education\nPolicy Institute (HEPI).\nThe report, Oxford and Cambridge:\nHow Different Are They? released on\n19 November, investigates a number\nof aspects of the higher education\nsector that conclude the Universities\nof Oxford and Cambridge are greatly\n\u201cdistinctive\u201d from their nearest Russell\nGroup rivals, namely Imperial.\n*\nCatching the brightest\nImperial, alongside the LSE and UCL\nare considered to be the London corner\nin an elite \u2018Golden Triangle\u2019 with the\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe latter two are suggested by\nHEPI\u2019s latest report to be in a league\nabove in terms of their ability to attract\nthe highest academically-achieving applicants and also in their undergraduate teaching environment.\nHEPI is an independent think-tank\ndedicated to exclusively policing and\nanalysing higher education in the UK.\nAdmissions data collected for this\nreport show that in 2008, the 58% of\nundergraduates at Oxford achieved\neight A*s at GCSE was four times the\n14.4% proportion of undergraduates at\nImperial that achieved the same. This\nin light of 72% of Imperial students felt\nthat their GCSEs had very little or no\nbearing on their A Level achievement.\nOxbridge however are known to still\nuse GCSE grades to distinguish between candidates and hence still hold\nGCSEs in some level of importance,\nand probably moreso than other Russell Group universities.\nOver the past decade, Imperial College has frequently been ranked 3rd or\n4th behind Oxford and Cambridge at\nan interchanging 1st and 2nd place in\nthe Times Good University guide. The\nTimes Higher Education Supplement\nWorld Rankings 2009 ranks Imperial,\nat 5th, one place higher than Oxford.\nSubsequently, HEPI\u2019s latest report focuses in on Imperial as a conclusively\nunfavourable comparison to the Oxbridge universities.\nIn a survey conducted by felix, it\nwas found that 51% of current undergraduates claimed their GCSE courses\nhad very little or negligible bearing on\ntheir ability to perform at their chosen A Level courses, whilst 21% felt\ntheir GCSE courses had absolutely no\nbearing on A Level performance and\nhence requirement to enter Imperial.\nSeemingly, despite the stark contrast\nin GCSE achievement between Oxford and Imperial, Imperial students\nunaware of it (as not to influence their\nsurvey answer) put little importance\non their GCSE grades, and prefer to be\njudged by their A Level grades.\nHowever, Oxford and Cambridge\nare shown to be attracting brighter\nstudents as judged by their prior academic achievements, i.e. A Levels or\nequivalent. The study showed that the\nvast majority (57.2%) of Cambridge\u2019s\napplicants had 540 UCAS tariff points\nor more. This is in contrast to Imperial where the proportion of applicants with 540 tariff points or more\nwas about equal to the proportion of\nstudents starting courses with less\nthan 480 points. Tariff points work as\na system to standardise and compare\nall applicants as they apply to higher\neducation with a range of qualifica-tions. A Levels, BTEC Nationals and\nInternational Baccalaureates are just\nsome of the extensive range of qualifications which UCAS tariffs cover. A\ntypical student coming through the\nconventional British education system\ncan expect to receive 120 tariff points\nfor a top grade at GCE A Level. For ex-ample, 540 points of more can be obtained by achieving As in four A Levels\nand a B in a fifth. A typical student is\ngenerally expected to take three A Level\ncourses and hence most degree streams\nat both Oxbridge and Imperial have a\nrequirement for three A Levels. Oxford\nand Cambridge are notorious for issuing offers higher than the a standard\nthree A Level requirement. felix\u2019s survey came across some current Imperial undergraduates who had previously\nbeen offered AAAA (480 UCAS tariff\npoints), but for one reason or another\ndidn\u2019t not take up on the offer.\nImperial\u2019s proportion of applicants\nstarting courses with 480 or below tariff points is 35.1% compared to Cambridge\u2019s 19.1% and Oxford\u2019s 21.7%.\nDegree streams such as Biology, Biochemistry and Material Sciences typically have lower-than AAA require-ments. For the incoming 2010 intake\nBiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology have minimum entry requirements\nof AAB (340 points). Oxford require a\nminimum AAA (360 points) across the\nboard for Bioscience courses. Hence\nthe students achieving over 540 points\ntherefore are \u201cexceptionally talented\u201d\nstudents who have undertaken and\nachieved top grades in extra courses at\nA Level or equivalent level of study.\nThe study also concludes that the\nuniversity\u2019s applicant\u2019s average UCAS\ntariff points correlates to the proportion of independently-schooled ap-plicants. Institutions with a \u201clarger\nnumber of independent school entrants are more likely to have a higher\nproportion with greater accumulation\nof [UCAS] tariff points.\u201d However,\nOxbridge only has an average of inde-pendently-schooled applicants which\nis 7% greater than the number of current Imperial undergraduate students\nthat have entered directly from a pri-vately-funded institution. These findings do little to dampen the myth that\nOxbridge are still \u2018socially engineering\u2019\ntheir student intake towards independently school students.\nHEPI also highlights a gulf between\nImperial and Oxford\u2019s offer-to-ac-ceptance conversion rate. Over 90% of\nstudents that receive an offer from Oxford take up their place once they have\nachieved the required grades. In stark\ncontrast, less than half of Imperial\u2019s\noffers are taken up, leading to fluctuations to the number of students admitted onto courses each year. The report\nsuggests that this pattern of offer-acceptance shows that an application\nholding both an Imperial and Oxford\noffer, they are far more likely to turn\ndown Imperial\u2019s offer than Oxford\u2019s.\nThis theory is backed up by the survey\nconducted by felix. It found that 61%\nof current Imperial students applied to\nOxford or Cambridge as their original\nfirst choice university.\n*\nLonger hours\nHEPI\u2019s extensive report goes on to detail the differences in teaching standards and student expectations that they\nclaim the Oxbridge universities are\nhead and shoulders above others.\nAverage hours of study are tabled in\nthe report to point out differences of\nworking hours (both contact teaching\ntime and private study) between the\nOxbridge universities and specifically\nImperial.\nOxbridge Medics students study 42.1\nhours a week, which is claimed to be\n14.4% more than at Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine. The biosciences\nare renowned at Imperial for being\ncourses with the least evident teaching\ntime compared to the rest of College,\nand the study indicates Cambridge bio-scientists study nearly 17 more hours a\nweek.\nHowever, the most dramatic comparison comes with students studying physical science courses. At Cambridge, they are said to study over 50%\nlonger than their equivalent course-mates at Imperial.\nAcross the board, Cambridge students study an average of 40%, and\nOxford students an average 30% more\nthan Imperial students. These figures\nare likely to come as surprise to some\nImperial students as they put in the\nlong hours at the Library.\n*\nTeaching quality not assured\nIt is a well-known fact that Imperial\nhas performed extremely poorly in the\n58%\nPercentage of undergraduates\natOxfordwith8+A*satGCSE\nNational Student Survey (NSS) during\nrecent years. The NSS forms part of a\nquality assurance framework (QAF)\nsupported by the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England (HE-FCE). The survey collates feedback on\nthe satisfaction rates of students and\nhence quality of their courses.\nDuring an interview with felix last\nyear, outgoing Rector Sir Roy Anderson claimed that one of his aims during\nhis tenure would be to dramatically increase Imperial\u2019s poor ranking of 100th\nout of 113th in the NSS. It has largely\nbeen to blame for Imperial\u2019s inability to\nchallenge Oxbridge for the top spots in\nleague tables which factor in the NSS,\nsuch as the Guardian Education University Guide, where Imperial regularly\nflirt around 8th place.\nOxford is currently 6th place and\nCambridge 2nd in the latest NSS.\nHEPI\u2019s report breaks down this ranking\ninto the 22 separate questions as part of\nthe survey. The Oxbridge universities\noccupy 1st place in 7 of the 22 questions\nalone, whilst Imperial tops none.\nDespite a lesser workload, Imperial\nstudents are still far unhappier than\ntheir peers of Oxbridge. This can point\nto the teaching methods and standards\nat Imperial being a problem, the massively greater ability of students at Oxbridge universities to deal with heavy\nworkloads, or the apathy of Imperial\nstudents not only in their studies, but\nfilling out the entirely optional National Student Survey. It is suggested that\nonly the students with grievances will\nfill out the online survey, whilst students that are content with academic\nlife at Imperial regularly ignore both\nCollege and the Union\u2019s promotion.\nWhile the report does not implicitly\nstate that Imperial is inherently inferi-or, it does assume the stance of Oxford\nand Cambridge superiority by stating\nthat the universities are indeed \u201creally\ndifferent\u201d from \u201cthe small number of\ninstitutions with which they are sometimes compared\u201d. There is little doubt\nthat Imperial, LSE and UCL make up\nthis \u201csmall number\u201d of universities.\nWhichever way it is looked at, HEPI\u2019s\nreport this week has greatly distanced\nthe two corners of the UK\u2019s elite Golden Triangle that protrude outside the\nM25.\n\u201c61% of current\nImperial students\napplied to Oxford or\nCambridge as their\noriginal first choice\u201d\n14.4%\nPercentage of undergraduates\natImperialwith8+A*satGCSE\n40.4\nNumber of hours per week the\naverage Cambridge student studies\n29.1\nNumber of hours per week the\naverage Imperial student studies\n37.5\nNumber of hours per week the\naverage Oxford student studies\nAll statistics are quoted and calculated from the original report by HEPI Additional reporting: Afonso Campos\n\n"

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFEATURED COMMENT\nI\nraq is as divided as an apple pie.\nArabs and Kurds make up its two\nmain ethnic groups. A further\nreligious division puts the Arabs\ninto the two main camps of Sunnis and Shiites. Not too long ago critics spoke of a \u2018civil war\u2019 going on in the\ncountry. Laws are vetoed, deadlines fail\nto be met on parliamentary level, infiltration into the national police and army\nby insurgents still remains. What is to\nbe the future of such a country? As inhabitants of Britain, the country which\nfirst ruled Iraq and had a big role in the\ncreation of the \u2018new\u2019 Iraq, we ought to\nfamiliarize ourselves with its future\nprospects.\nNearly two weeks ago the controversial election law was passed, paving the\nway for national elections in coming\nJanuary. The source of the controversy\naround the law was the Kirkuk governorate in the north. Under Saddam and\nmany preceding governments ethnic\nKurds making up the majority within the\ncity and its surroundings were deported,\nin the hope of putting claim to the oil-rich governorate as one being of \u2018Arabic\nidentity\u2019.\nIn 2003, after the fall of the dictator-ship, many Kurds returned back to the\ncity with the hope of restoring their\nlives. Nevertheless, the city\u2019s relatively\ndangerous security situation combined\nwith the neglect of the city\u2019s essential infrastructure and facilities such as water\nsupply and electricity put many original\nKurds from Kirkuk off from returning.\nMany thousands more have permanently settled abroad, with no intentions\nof going back. Now, with the tyranny\ngone and a new democratic government\nsystem, the Kurds want to incorporate\nKirkuk into their federal region, based\non a referendum in which the city\u2019s inhabitants can decide their own future.\nUnlike general elections here in Britain, those in Iraq are still very reflective\nof people\u2019s strong expression and association with their identity. Sunni Arabs\nvoting for their Shiite counterparts or\nthe Kurds voting on either are simply\nunthinkable phenomena. It is the result of many decennia of oppression by\nthe subsequent Iraqi regimes targeting\ncommunities just because of who they\nare or are not.\nAs a result of people\u2019s votes being\nmainly based on identity rather than\nideology, Iraqi politics has indeed been\ndominated by the former. There is no\nsuch thing as an \u2018Iraqi people\u2019s party\u2019. To\nme, this phenomenon underlines that\nIraq is already a much divided country\nand in fact has always been so ever since\nit was established as a British mandate\nin the early twentieth century. The British were quick enough to recognize this\nand as a result handed over power to\nIraq\u2019s Sunni Arab minority upon leav-ing, thus depending on an iron fist rule\nto keep the country together. George\nW. Bush failed the follow the British in\nhis understanding of the country\u2019s divisions in 2003.\nWhy would the international community not take the responsibility to call a\nstop to daily inter-ethnic and sectarian\ndisputes, claims of oppression and feelings of insecurity by giving in to the demands of a great proportion of the Iraqi\npeople, namely far-going federalism or\neven independence? The fact is that the\nreality on the ground is a much more\ncomplicated issue than it sounds.\nInter-related marriages between\nShiite and Sunni couples will lead to\na new generation that will find it hard\nto express a preference for one side or\nthe other. I know such people and I\nam aware of their \u2018identity crises\u2019; they\nsimply term themselves as \u2018Iraqi\u2019. In an\nethnically mixed city such as Baghdad\npeople of various backgrounds have\nlived there for generations, often in the\nsame street or even as neighbours. How\ndo you divide such a place? Not only is\nit not an easy task, but it actually approaches the extent of being impossible.\nThe expression of support from\nabroad for a continuation of a united\nIraq is immense. Saudi-Arabia is fearful of having an independent oil-rich\nShiite state to its north. Iran, Syria and\nTurkey \u2013 each with their own Kurdish\nminorities seeking self-rule \u2013 strongly\noppose the creation of an independent Kurdish state as neighbour. The\nU.S., already highly criticized for having gone into Iraq and widely associated with failure of its intelligence\nand military apparatus, would be even\nmore humiliated if its initial promise\nfor a \u2018free, united and democratic Iraq\u2019\nwould turn into an Iraq broken up into\ndifferent pieces as a result of the failure\nin the practical implementation of the\nenvisaged democratic system it sought\nto bring.\nIn case a break-up does go ahead, how\nwill the Kurds and Sunnis cope with\nsuddenly becoming landlocked and depending upon neighbouring states for\nessential supplies or the allowance of\nthe operation of supply routes? All in\nall, it is a very difficult matter indeed.\nWould I, born an Iraqi myself, prefer\nto have the old regime back instead of\nfacing all these everyday problems? No,\ndefinitely not. I strongly believe the\nIraqi people are far better off without\nthe cruel dictator who did not hesitate\nto mass murder thousands of his own\npeople or order the killing of his closest relatives. The Iraqi oil sector is up\nand running, but this time instead of\nits revenues going to arms and palaces for the dictator, they go to ordinary Iraqi citizens struggling on a\nday-to-day basis to build up a normal\nlife free of violence.\nUnfortunately, facts cannot determine Iraq\u2019s future, but instead it is\nseen and approached differently by\neach and every person. A divided\nIraq, the tendency as a consequence\nof the failure of the country ever\nsince its creation to serve its people\nequally and rightfully, is a justified\nmeasure through many eyes.\nHowever, as mentioned before, this\nwould be a rather difficult and time-consuming task and will therefore\nnot be realised anytime in the near\nfuture. After decennia of fatal decisions from outside Iraq that have\ncome to affect and cause suffering\nfor the people within it, it is fairest to\nconclude that any Iraqi way forward\nindeed should be completely in the\nhands of the Iraqis themselves.\nFree from foreign interference and\nmanipulation, free from economic\nembargos and above all, free from\nviolence.\nRaz Jabary\nThe future of Iraq\n\n"

But what if you\u2019ve got\nsomething busted, some prick of\na Telco is over charging you, or\nyou\u2019ve got to make a complaint? Traditionally you\u2019d have to sit there on the\nphone for god-knows how many hours\ncalling a premium rate number just to\nget through to some poor bastard in a\ncall centre that can neither help you\nor help himself get out of that hellish\nexcuse for a job. Well, I\u2019m here to tell\nyou that no more do you have to suffer\nthrough the rubbish to get the decent\ncustomer service that you deserve.\nTwitter is the way forward.\nOK, you think I\u2019m off my rocker, what\nhas Twatter got to do with customer\nservice? Well, if you didn\u2019t know al-ready, everything you say on Twitter is\npublic. Everyone can see it, it\u2019s searchable and it stays there for quite some\ntime. Companies have gotten wind that\npeople like to complain on Twitter and\nthat their reputation often takes a beating in a very public and motivated en-vironment. So their plan to combat all\nthis bitching is to put customer service\nrepresentatives on the microblogging\nservice that respond to complaints\nand try and smooth over any disagreements you might have with them.\nThe thing is that the Twitter customer\nservice people have to get it right first\ntime because if they don\u2019t, the company\u2019s public image gets a bashing as\nyou berate them on Twitter. Therefore,\nthey\u2019ve normally got a lot more power\nthan the poor sod you find on the end\nof the phone on the front line of the\ncall centre. They bend over backwards\nto sort out your complaint and placate\nyou as quickly as possible and in a personal manner.\nIn a recent experience with a Telco\nthat will, for reasons of journalistic in-tegrity, remain nameless, I found out\nthat they were trying to overcharge\nme by almost 25% for no apparent rea-son. I thought it would have just been\na clerical error and so contacted customer services, only to be told that the\ncost of service had gone up without\nnotice. When I pointed out that their\nwebsite stated the price I expected to\nbe charged, like every previous month\nfor the last two years, I was told this\nwas a \u2018new customers only\u2019 deal. After\nscreaming down the phone at them\n,they told me there was nothing they\ncould do.\nOf course, the budding journalist\nin me decided I wasn\u2019t going to stand\nfor this crap and I was going to complain in the most effective way I knew,\nonline. First port of call was Twitter,\nwhich would be promptly followed by\nmy personal blog and every tech blog I\nwrite for. I was going to drag their name\nthrough the mud for this outrage.\nMoments after bitching about\nthem on Twitter I was contacted by\nthe customer services \u2018Twitter team\u2019\nwho asked for a few details so they\ncould check it out. OK, I thought, fair\nenough, I\u2019ll hold fire on everything else\nand see what they can do for me. I send\nthem my customer details and thirty\nminutes later I get a phone call. Long\nstory short, they were very apologetic\nand sorted it out right there and then.\nGone was the price increase and an offer of compensation should I feel out of\npocket at the end of the day.\nNow I don\u2019t have beef with any\ncustomer service representatives, I\ncouldn\u2019t do their jobs, but I feel the\npersonal level of service you used to\nget has gone. You shouldn\u2019t have to\ngo to Twitter and publicly complain\njust to get decent service, but this kind\nof personal, fast and efficient service\ndoesn\u2019t seem to exist in modern company strategy, it\u2019s too costly.\nMoral of the story, got a complaint?\nHead to Twitter and get it sorted.\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week in Tech has come and\ngone but what have we got to show for\nit? Well, we\u2019ve got the launch of the\nworld\u2019s first driverless taxis at Heathrow. We\u2019ve talked about the tiny little\nautomated pods that transport you\nfrom the business car park into Terminal 5 in only five minutes before,\nbut now you too can go have a play in\nthem. Pity they\u2019re not in central London; maybe they would be a cheaper,\nsafer alternative to the dodgy mini-cabs on the way home from the Union.\nWe\u2019ve heard that console gaming\nmakes you a natural-born UAV pilot,\nbut now the US Air Force is taking\ntheir love of the PS3 to the next level\nand by ordering another 2,200 PS3s to\njoing the 300 or so they are using al-ready. Instead of practising their skills\nin Modern Warfare 2, they\u2019ve been using them for HD video processing and\nwant to boost the power of their PS3\ncluster.\nIBM is set to discontinue its current\nline of PowerPC-based Cell proces-sors, the power house behind the\nPS3, amongst other things. What this\nmeans for the next generation PlayStation is unclear. Would Sony take the\nCell chip in house? Never fear though,\nthe current gen PS3 won\u2019t be affected.\nRetail giant, Tesco, announced this\nweek that it\u2019ll start selling Apple\u2019s golden child, the iPhone, on its MVNO\nTesco Mobile. It\u2019s the fourth carrier to\nconfirm that the iPhone will be gracing its network, although Tesco Mobile\nuses O2\u2019s network so don\u2019t think you\u2019ll\nget better 3G coverage. Tesco already\nhas several relatively cheap unlimited\neverything plans with texts, calls and\ndata all included. If their current price\nplans are mimicked on their iPhone\nofferings, Tesco Mobile might be the\nway to go for the best value iPhone tar-iffs. Besides, now you can pick one up\nwhilst you\u2019re getting your soap, toilet\nduck and bog roll. How glamorous.\nIn the 21st century, there are few more\nvaluable things than information. It\u2019s\nwhat drives the technology revolution,\nthe ability to transfer and process large\namounts of information.\nOf course, if there\u2019s one company\nuniquely poised to make the most of\nthis, it\u2019s Google. With roughly 24 server farms containing an estimated half a\nmillion servers dotted across the globe,\nGoogle handles 6% of all internet traf-fic. That\u2019s six times more than any\nother one company, with their main\nwebsite being the most visited page on\nthe internet. Google has invested large\namounts of money into maintaining\nthe current status quo, from their wide\nvariety of desktop applications to undersea optical fibre cables that maintain blazing fast response times.\nBut how does Google handle the responsibility of being the world\u2019s largest\nrepository of private information? The\nunofficial company slogan \u201cDon\u2019t Be\nEvil\u201d only serves as a reminder of just\nhow much evil Google could do if it\nwished. Thankfully, Google to this date\nhas not betrayed its user\u2019s faith. It has\nbeen fearless in going up against gov-ernments, when requested to disclose\nuser information and hasn\u2019t had minimal embarrassing data leaks that some\nof its competitors have suffered from.\nAll in all, Google has proved itself relatively responsible in dealing with sensitive user information. But how much\nare you really willing to let Google\nstore information about your life?\nI decided to write down a list of\nGoogle products that I use. The list\ncame up to roughly 20 of their prod-ucts, ranging from mapping services\nto webmaster tools. All of which are\nfree and many of which are the best\nproducts offered in their markets. The\nbeauty of Google\u2019s business model\nis that they can offer free, quality\nproducts to users because they make\nmoney from the information gleaned\nfrom that usage. Companies pay large\namounts of money to show up in Google\u2019s subtly targeted ads and in exchange\nall Google has to do is make sure that\na large enough number of users are\nseeing those ads. It would appear that\nthis is a win-win situation for everyone\ninvolved. Yet as Google grows and attempts to expand into untapped mar-kets, it\u2019s going to want more and more\nof your information in order to target\nthose ads even better and continue to\ngenerate large advertising profits. The\nneed for more and more info brings me\nback to the focal point of this piece \u2013\nhow much is too much?\nLike 90% of the connected world,\nI use Google for searching the inter-net. I also use Google to handle all my\nemail accounts, compile and analyse\nwebsite statistics, help me get around\ntown, chat with friends, share photos\nand watch videos. Google knows exactly which shows I enjoy watching,\nwhich political issues I find important\nand my views on them and the contents of letters back home. They even\nknow where I am right now, thanks to\nGoogle Latitude, and where I want to\nbe, thanks to Google Maps for mobile.\nIf Google were a stalker, it would be\nabout time for me to file for a restraining order.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting that Google seems to be gearing up to offer telephony services. Last week, they purchased a small start-up that specialised\nin services similar to the venerable\nSkype, Gizmo5. Along with Google\nVoice, a service that allows users in\nthe US to (among other things) manage their phone calls and make cheap\ninternational calls, many suspect that\nthis could be part of a wider strategy to\noffer free telephone calls to participating users very soon. The system allows\nGoogle to make use of the extensive\noptical fibre networks it has invested\nin while users get free telephone calls.\nYet this will probably involve letting\nGoogle into yet another part of your\nlife: your private phone calls.\nAlthough in reality what Google\nknows is distributed across servers\nin multiple locations, probably protected by complex encryption, it is\nstill owned by a single entity that can\nlegally be forced into handing all information about you to governments.\nThe issue isn\u2019t really about how much\nGoogle can be trusted, it\u2019s about how\nmuch Google can be forced to reveal.\nI\u2019m not going to judge you for googling\nNAMBLA (don\u2019t) after watching that\nSouth Park episode, but can the same\nthing be said about a law enforcement\nofficial? Google is at the forefront of\nthe \u201ccloud computing\u201d wave. Their\nChrome OS (scheduled for release in\nat the end of 2010) is designed to blur\nthe lines between desktop and online\napplications, with ever more information being stored in the cloud. The\nquestion remains whether the flexibility afforded by keeping private information on someone else\u2019s servers can\never replace the privacy of one\u2019s own\nhard drive.\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor emerged, one that steals your ING Direct banking details and one that turns\nyour pocket pal into a botnet zombie.\nBrilliant! Apple\u2019s responce? We told\nyou it could happen, tough luck, don\u2019t\njailbreak your iPhone. The worms\nspread via WiFi or cellular networks\nbetween jailbroken iPhones with SSH\ninstalled and default root passwords. A\nrookie mistake not changing your root\npassword, but if you\u2019re not so au fait\nwith the whole jailbreak process, you\nmight not even know that every iPhone\nhas a default root password that basically allows someone nefarious to do\nanything they like with your precious\niPhone without your knowledge. So\nif you\u2019re rocking a jailbroken iPhone\nthen download mobile Terminal and\nchange your root password pronto!\nTalking about the PS3, I don\u2019t know\nwhether anyone\u2019s told the USAF but,\nTalking of iPhones, the humble rickrolling iPhone worm evolved.

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2009\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nS\nome of you may remember\nlast week. It was long, green,\nand to be honest with you\na little dull. I can\u2019t claim all\nthe credit for the dullness\nmyself, you understand, but I like to\nthink that I added to it in some small\nway. My contribution took the form\nof a piece in last week\u2019s issue \u2013 a piece\nwhich rather naughtily bit its own\nnails and hung itself over a cliff before\nreaching a conclusion. Though I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019d wish a similar fate to befall\nme, the dramatic finale to last week\u2019s\nepisode is here at last.\nThose of you who actually gave a\ndamn last saw me rushing across Euston\nstation, desperately trying to be the first\nperson to set foot on the platform...\nBecause being first on the platform\nmeans you have the crucial strategic\nadvantage. Most importantly, you can\nbe the first to race all the way across to\ncarriage A, which is traditionally the\nemptiest and least popular. Ergo, you\nthink, the best place to find a free seat.\nYou board carriage A a good kilometre and a half ahead of the puffing investment banker running behind you.\nYou scan the electric signs above the\nseats, looking for one that says \u2018available\u2019. Aha! You find one \u2013 and it\u2019s a window table seat facing in the right direction at that \u2013 what luck! You throw your\ncase in the overhead rack, arrange yourself in the plaid cliff-face of seating, rip\nthe Saturday Guardian out of its plastic\nwrapper, and begin perusing the first of\nits 12 special supplements in perfect inner peace.\nA short while later you hear, through\nyour shimmering golden bubble of hap-piness, the bustle of several thousand\npeople boarding a carriage which has\nexactly forty-seven seats. You raise the\nBusiness section a little higher and hum\n\u2018The Battle-Hymn of the Republic\u2019 quietly to yourself.\n\u201cExcuse me...\u201d\nDah-dum-Dah-dum-Dah-trumpet.\n\u201cExcuse me...\u201d\nDah-dum-Dah-dum-defeat.\nDah-dum-Dah-dum-Dah-hearts-ofmen-Dah-dum.\nThe paper is unceremoniously ripped\nfrom your hands, and you find yourself\nstaring into the disgruntled face of a\nheavily pregnant woman with babies in\neither arm and a Hamleys bag draped\nover her shoulder. Her face is flushed\nwith an otherworldly glow and her eyes\nare like tungsten filaments on the point\nof incandescence.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in our seats\u201d\n, she\ngrowls.\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t be,\u201d you calmly point out,\n\u201cLook at the...\u201d\nYour breath catches in your throat as\nyou see that the word \u2018available\u2019, which\npreviously hung over your head in the\nmanner of a protective charm, has van-ished. It has now been replaced by that\nmost cruel and dispiriting of words:\n\u2018reserved.\u2019 The writing is quite literally\non the wall. An unreasonably friendly\nvoice on the PA chooses this moment\nto announce:\n\u201cThe seat reservation data has only\nnow been uploaded to our on-board\nsoftware. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.\u201d\nYou flush an unbelievably deep shade\nof crimson, and attempt to gather together all the sections of the Guardian.\nYou soon dismiss this task as being humanly impossible, and concentrate on\nextricating yourself from the situation\nas quickly as the limited maneouvring\nspace will allow. Some agonisingly slow\nminutes later, you find yourself standing\nin the doorway of Carriage G, trying to\nstop the door from giving you a complementary circumcision whenever it arbitrarily sees fit to close. Often, I should\npoint out, with a large and hairy dog\nusing various parts of your anatomy for\ntarget practice.\nIt is experiences such as these that\nlead me to wonder what is so appealing about Heaven if it involves having a\ntrain of seventy-two virgins for the tak-ing. God knows I\u2019ve taken seventy-two\nVirgin trains and I feel as though I\u2019ve\nbeen through Hell.\nPossibly the only thing that makes the\nEnglish railway system halfway bearable is the knowledge that things are\nso much worse abroad. In Italy, for in-stance, where once the trains used to\narrive bang on time and leave, and the\nleaders used to fall apart with alarming\nfrequency, now it is the trains which\nregularly fall apart, and the leaders who\narrive, bang on time, and never seem to\nleave. Not much of a joke, granted, but\nat least the timing was right. Which is\nmore than can be said for the damned\ntrains.\nIn the end, of course, you get to\nyour final destination. This is assuming that the train is able to navigate its\nway through the minefield of obstacles\nwhich include leaves lying on the line,\nrogue children stealing lengths of ca-ble, and the force field around the M25\nwhich attempts to keep the good people\nof London safe from the depredations\nof the North.\nAh, trains. You can\u2019t live if you miss\nthem, you can live if they miss you.\nGilead Amit reaches his final destination\n\u201cYou find yourself\nstaring into\nthe disgruntled\nface of a heavily\npregnant woman\u201d\nS\nonitus (n. masc. fourth de-clension): a sound; pl. soni-tus (pronounced \u2018sonitoos\u2019).\nEjaculare (v.); to throw\nout, to hurl, to ejaculate;\nejaculandorum (gerund, gen. plural):\nof (the) throwing, of (the) ejaculating.\nHence, sonitus ejaculandorum: the\nsounds of ejaculating. Or, more collo-quially, \u2018cum noises\u2019.\nAfter much agitation, I was torn as to\nwhether or not to write this article, not\nleast because of the ribald and licentious nature of such a sticky subject.\nBut it\u2019s clearly an important issue, so\ngermane to human existence, that it\nseemed callous not to have a crack at\nit. Still, we are civilised enough that we\ncan at least substitute \u2018cum noises\u2019 with\nits proper medical name \u2018sonitus ejaculandorum\u2019, henceforth \u2018S.E.\u2019.\nThere\u2019s a school of thought that says\nthat you don\u2019t choose your S.E., that\nit is thrust upon you by the vagaries\nof nature. I would like to raise a bone\nof contention with this view; it suggests that the people who whinny like\nhorses when they pop the weasel are\nin no control of themselves. It implies\nthat some people are genetically programmed to squeal like worried guinea\npigs at a church f\u00eate while they spend a\ncreamy penny. To say that their predicament is incurable is to condemn such\npeople to a life of seeing their sexual\npartners cringe mid-coitus every time\nthey start rehearsing a symphony in\nthe key of mad cow disease.\nCall me a snivelling leftie, but I believe such people can and should be\nrehabilitated.\nI hope this article makes inroads into\nachieving that aim. Even so, it\u2019s worth\nmentioning that prevention is better\nthan cure. Many of you are in a postion\nto cultivate your S.E. from its infancy.\nYou can act now, before your housemates have to buy earplugs to block\nout the din of you and a special friend\nrecreating a radio play of Abu Graib\nprison. Ultimately, someone is going\nto hear your S.E. and it is best that\nthey don\u2019t need serious counselling af-terwards. And if you think it\u2019s bad for\nyour mate with a wall between you and\nyour tortuous moaning, imagine what\nit\u2019s like for the girl or boy you\u2019re evacu-ating: your emetic gurgling could be\ndoing him or her some serious mental\ndamage.\nThe first thing to do is to get stuck in\nand start thinking about the sort of S.E.\nthat you would like to hear yourself.\nWatch documentaries (porn) and see if\nthere are any S.E.s that you think you\ncould pull off. Record some practice\nruns on your laptop. Play back your ef-forts. Does it sound like a rhinoceros\nwith a giraffe stuck up its bum? Then\nit\u2019s got to go. Experiment a bit: try\nchanging the pitch or the vowels (\u2018ee\u2019\nrather than \u2018oo\u2019 for instance). Once\nyou think you have a winner on your\nhands, why not swap mp3s with your\nfriends on Facebook and ask for their\nadvice? If they have to listen to you\ngrunt-bonanza at one in the A.M., the\nleast you could do is to give them right\nof veto over the noise that sounds like a\nchimpanzees\u2019 circumcision party.\nOne mess we must mop up is vo-cabulary. Of course you may take the\ntraditional approach, viz. \u2018I\u2019m about\nto come, I\u2019m going to come! I\u2019m com-ing! I\u2019m coming! Oh, my God, I\u2019ve\njust come!\u2019 While dependable, this is\nnot exactly love poetry. To spice up\nthe butter, you could try it in French:\n\u2018Je vais arriver. Je suis sur le point\nd\u2019arriver. J\u2019arrive! J\u2019arrive! Sacr\u00e9 bleu,\nje suis arriv\u00e9!\u2019 (N.B. Grammar: Don\u2019t\nsay \u2018j\u2019ai arriv\u00e9\u2019 or you will be a laughing\nstock.) Alternatively the German can\ncarry a more punchy tone: \u2018Ich werde\nkommen! Ich komme! Ich komme! Ich\nbin gekommen!\u2019\nLet\u2019s go in a bit deeper: once you\u2019ve\nmastered the basics in your chosen\nlanguage you can be more adventur-ous. Instead of: \u2018I\u2019m going to come.\u2019 try\n\u2018Here comes the choo-choo.\u2019 Instead of\n\u2018J\u2019arrive\u2019 try \u2018J\u2019habite \u00e0 Croydon et j\u2019ai\nun fr\u00e8re et deux soeurs\u2019. There\u2019s not\nmuch time during the victory wail for\nmuch more than an extended vowel,\nbut for a challenge, try pus-howling\n\u2018Harriet Harman!\u2019 during the Big Bang.\nTo finish off you could announce: \u2018I\u2019ve\njust curdled your receptacle.\u2019 With\nenough practice you could even build\nup to something like this:\n\u2018Ooo, ooo, eee, I\u2019m on the 4:17 from\nPortsmouth. ooo, eee, I\u2019ve really got\nthe wind up me now, aah, eee. I CAN\nSEE THE SEA! Ooo, mmm. That\u2019s it.\nMmm, oh. that was good value, urgh,\nyeah, I feel like I\u2019ve just had the best\npiss ever.\u2019\nI.et\u2019s get the creative juices flowing.\nDavid Stewart\u2019s sounds of ejaculation\n\u201cI\u2019m about to\ncome, I\u2019m going\nto come! I\u2019m\ncoming! Oh, my\nGod, I\u2019ve just\ncome!\u201d\n\n"
