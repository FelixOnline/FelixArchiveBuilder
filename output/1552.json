Following this, I set up a meeting with\nPaul Beaumont (Union President), and\nseveral other people who are involved\nin College life from undergrads, post\ndocs and through to senior academics involved in designing courses. he\nfollowing spread hopes to expand on\nwhere I think College and the Union\nis going astray, what they are trying to\ndo about it, and if this is enough.\nI don\u2019t know all the solutions; if I did\nI would have run for Union President\n(there\u2019s always next year folks!), but\nhopefully this can be a starting point\n\u2013 something to kick a conversation o\ufb00\nat least.\nAll of the numbers presented here\nare easily obtainable by a (not that\nquick) trawl through publicly accessible documents on the internet. All the\n\ufb01gures are there. I have edited the online comments so they didn\u2019t consume\nBut is the Union any better?\nan opportunity.\nImagine what we could do if College\naimed to only make 4% pro\ufb01t next\nyear; we\u2019d have an extra \u00a330 million\nto pump back into teaching, research\nand that other key buzzword, the \u2018Student Experience.\u2019\nWhat is the \u2018Student Experience\u2019? I\ncan\u2019t de\ufb01ne it exactly and I\u2019d challenge\nanyone else to. However, with the increasing commercialisation of higher\neducation in the UK, universities\nacross the board are trying to improve\nit, trying to draw the best students to\ntheir institutions. he people making\nthe decisions, the College Management Board and the vast majority of\nCollege Council generally have limited contact with students, which\nhinders their approach to improving\nit. Some large strides are being made\ntrying to make this right; the idea of\ntalking to us to \ufb01nd out what we want\nand need is starting to take hold, but it\nis far from across the board.\nOur one link is the Sabbs; the Union\nPresident sits on the highest board in\nCollege, the College Council. his is\nquite a rare privilege, and one that has\nbeen revoked previously, but we do\nhave a voice here. A voice that could\nbe used by everyone; those who want\na moan or to make things better. But\nhow can the average student get his\nview across? Supposedly the Union\nCouncil; anybody can go to one of\ntheir meetings and have their say. You\nSo who are the bureaucrats?\nChaired by the former Director General\nof MI5, Baroness Manningham-Buller, it\nis the governing and executive body of\nImperial College London.\nCollege Council\nWhat they do\nWhat you think\nthey do\nWhy you\nshould care\nVery little. Very few people had any idea\nwhat College Council is, what they did or\nwho they were. \u201cRubber Stamp College\npolicy\u201d was probably the most insightful\ncomment.\nThey have the final say on everything.\nThey decided on Acton and Life Sciences\ncuts; every major decision goes through\nthem. The Union President is the students\u2019 lone voice here.\nProduce papers, ranging from recommendations to College through to the\nstate of the Union pizzas. These papers are not binding to anyone else.\nUnion Council\nFrom\u201cUnionthings\u201dthroughto\u201cSweet\nfuckall.\u201dMostpeoplehadheardofthis\nat least; no one said it achieved anything notable, and no-one who wasn\u2019t\non it had ever been to a meeting.\nThey claim to represent you. They\nvote on your official voice to be represented to everyone else. They are\nyour voice to College and your only\nopportunity to make a difference.\nCash reserves\n(\u00a396million)\nSurplus\n(\u00a360million)\nSubvention\nto the Union\n(\u00a31.3million)\nPredicated Life\nSciences deficit\n(\u00a31.5million)\nCollege income\n*Each mm in diameter is proportional to\n\u00a31 million. Figures from 2011/12 Annual\nReports from College and the Union. Life\nScience deficit reported in Felix.\nSurplus in 2011/12 as a percentage of income\nthan they are, what are we doing with\nthis extra cash? It\u2019s certainly not going\nto the Union, which received a lowly\n\u00a31.4 million last year, nor is it used to\ngive extra time to ailing Departments\nwhile they sort their \ufb01nancials out.\n(See Life Sciences who reportedly had\na de\ufb01cit of 1.5 million.) So where is\nthis money going?\nMaybe we\u2019re short of money and\ndon\u2019t hold enough reserves? If we\npaid o\ufb00 all of our outstanding debt to-morrow, College would still be sitting\non a cool \u00a396 million.\nFlexibility is an issue with all large\ncorporations. Imperial is no di\ufb00erent; red tape regularly obstructs novel\nprojects or ideas. Imagine if \u00a350,000\nwas set aside to pay for \ufb02ights for 50\nstudents to do an IROP in the US,\nand another \u00a350,000 to let 200 keen\nstudents go to conferences; to show\nthem o\ufb00 to the rest of the world and\nto actually further their learning. So\nfar we\u2019ve spent \u00a3100k, 0.16% of the\nsurplus last year, made a huge di\ufb00erence to 250 people (3% of undergrads)\nand shown our best and brightest o\ufb00\nto academics around the world. But\nthere are massively limited resources\ncurrently available for opportunities\nlike this; we as a university are missing\nNumber Crunching\n\u00a3364,770\n\u00a3364,000\nTotal subvention to all the clubs, societies and\nprojects from the Union\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions\u2019 (President & Rector of\nImperial College London) salary\nthe whole two pages, and have drawn\nseveral conclusions from a non double\nblind straw poll of about 30 students\nin the Union on a hursday night.\nhere are big changes on the horizon in higher education. Degrees have\nevolved from being direct precursors\nto employment to being a tool to go\ninto an unrelated, high paying job\nwhere the academic skills you spent\nfour years of your life slaving away\non mean nothing. I\u2019m looking at you,\nMr Management Consultant. To try\nand keep up with what students need\nfrom their time at university, College\nis going to have to start listening to\nus more seriously and more often; no\nlonger can they a\ufb00ord to use consulting students as a box ticking exercise.\nWe as students, adults and members of this university do actually have\na voice. Most people don\u2019t realise this,\nbut at the highest levels there are people who are willing to listen and people that do care. he problem comes\nin bridging the gap between what the\naverage student wants and needs and\nwhat these people hear. Communication, that overused buzzword, is again\nthe key.\nWe, the student body, were not consulted on Acton. I\u2019m not suggesting, as\none academic did, that commercially\nsensitive information be leaked, just\nthat the consultation with the student\nbody (and the oft overlooked academic body) should have occurred well\nbefore money reared its ugly head.\n#AgainstActon was too little too late\nand there was nothing we could do to\nstop it. he campaign did, however,\nmanage to get a response out of the\nCollege Management Board. No idea\nwho they are? No I didn\u2019t have any ei-ther; they are the people that make the\nday to day decisions and ultimately\nrun Imperial. Why does nobody know\nwho this extremely powerful group of\npeople are?\nhis response was more than all\nthose vociferous campaigns against\nthe Life Sciences cuts got. An actual\nresponse from senior management\nseems to have acknowledged that this\nwas a mistake. Although they will\nnever admit this in those words, they\nare at least trying to put it as right as\nthey can at this late stage by conducting a review. I love reviews. A detailed\nreview of Evelyn Gardens and Garden\nHall to actually see what condition\nthey are in? Perfect. But why were\ndecisions made before this detailed\ninformation was known?\nhe Union website also states that\nnegotiations over Evelyn Gardens\u2019\nlease are also \u2018too commercially sensitive\u2019 to be widely consulted on \u2013 surely\nthis is the perfect time to listen to our\nrepresentatives, and avoid a repeat of\nthe Acton \ufb01asco.\nCommercial priorities seem to\ntake precedence over many aspects\nof College life. hey are obviously an\nimportant part of any business; especially one as large as Imperial. he\nCollege had an income of \u00a3765 million\nlast year, with a surplus (read: pro\ufb01t)\nof \u00a363 million; a surplus to turnover ratio of 8.3% (the percentage of\nthe money made that is pro\ufb01t). his\nnumber is high compared to other\ninstitutions \u2013 though not as high as\nthe year before when it was 13%. A\nbrief search of other similar organisations yielded some interesting results\n(shown in the bar chart over the page);\nthe going rate seems to be about 2-4%\nwith no-one else coming close to our\nmargin. So if we\u2019re outperforming our\ncompetitors by making more money\nwon\u2019t get a vote, and you won\u2019t know\nwhat they are discussing until you go\nalong. he \ufb01les are online and available but this is not the same as advertising the agendas. Only one paper this\nyear was submitted by a non Council\nmember while 93% were submitted by\nthe Sabbs. Is this representation?\nSo what happens during a meeting?\nhe Union Council vote on papers\ncovering a wide range of topics including recommendations to College.\nhese papers then allow the Sabbs to\ntake the \u201cO\ufb03cial View\u201d of the students\nto their other meetings throughout\nCollege and lobby the people with real\npower to make changes. College can\nand do ignore our recommendations;\nparticularly on some of the more\ncontentious issues, as is their right.\nGenerally however they do listen and\nwant to make changes as they want us\nto be happy. It\u2019s in their best interests\nboth \ufb01nancially and academically. he\n\u201cYou Said We Did\u201d campaign ran by\nthe Union this year is trying to highlight the steps that we are making and\ntrying to make Union Council seem\nmore than just a lobbying group.\nIt is slightly more than this. We do\nhave the power to make changes to\nthings that directly a\ufb00ect the Union.\nConsider this example: I present a paper to Council resolving to never have\nanother Summer Ball. If this passed\nthen the Union would never have\nanother Summer Ball. (It would have\nto pass the Imperial College Union\nTrustee Board \ufb01rst but assume they\nrubber stamp it.) To reiterate: anyone\ncan present a paper and everyone on\nCouncil gets a vote. his suddenly\ngives more weight to every position\nthat comes with a seat on the Council.\nHarvard\n-1%\nImperial\n-8%\nKCL\n-6%\nCambridge\n4%\nOxford\n-3%\nUCL\n-3%\nBristol\n2%\nExeter\n-2%\nReading\n2%\n\u00a3765m\nCollege Income 2011/12\nKey Numbers\n\u00a363m\nSurplus 2011/12\n...\nBut not listen to students and take\nadvantage of their \u2018conservative apathy.\u2019\n...\nThe union has changed things in\nthe past...and it can do it again.\n...\nDon\u2019t kid yourself that the margins made on property deals etc. will\nin any way go towards subsidising\nteaching.\n...\nTheir recent decisions to save/\nmake money at the expense of student welfare sickens me.\n...\nWho exactly is keeping tabs on the\nsabbs?\n...\nYou\u2019re spot on. The staff have noticed this too.\n...\nThe sabbs are kids playing at politics \u2013 nothing more.\nYour comments\n45% of students don\u2019t\nthink ICU is the voice\nfor students\nOr does it? Are we all that apathetic?\nI can\u2019t believe this. We do care; highest election turnouts in the country\ndo not scream apathy. I think we just\nneed to feel that we can actually make\na di\ufb00erence. I think that it is that people feel powerless against \u2018he Union\u2019\nor \u2018he College.\u2019 We don\u2019t get a lot of\npower but we could use what we have\na lot more e\ufb00ectively.\nWithout trying to sound too hacky\nor desperate, I implore you to get in-volved. Stop moaning and make some\nchanges. If only by writing a moany\narticle in Felix, make the administrators sit up and listen. hey control\nyour time at College but they need us\nto be on side. Call their blu\ufb00 occasion-ally, make them think \u2013 this is the only\nway to improve the \u2018Student Experience\u2019 here \u2013 they\u2019ve shown they can\u2019t\ndo it by themselves.\n40% of students\nbelieve ICU is run\nfor profit\nPapers submitted to Union Council\nPresident\nOther\nSabbs\nCouncil\nMembers\nNon Council\nMembers\nOli Benton investigates the inner workings of the College and the\nUnion, and what people do and don\u2019t know about how they are run\nI\n*Figures are from relevant 2011/12 Annual Reports which\nare available online.

Dedication: This issue, like the first of this year, is dedicated to Leonard Richard Marshall (2 October 1922 \u2013 29 September 2010).\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief (2012-2013)\nGoodbye from me\nell here we are.\nNearly 30 issues\nlater and we have\ncome to the end.\nIt\u2019s pretty emotional really. I\u2019ve invested an entire year\nof my life into this newspaper and I\u2019m\nnot sure what I can say that will do\njustice to how strange this feels. I will\nsay that I hope you have enjoyed this\nyear of Felix. I hope you have laughed,\nlearnt, been shocked, been happy,\nand all feelings in between, while you\ncasually flick through these pages on\na Friday. I would first of all like to thank\neveryone involved in the production of\nthe paper, especially the editorial team.\nThanks for putting up with me for a\nyear! Now, most importantly, I would\nlike to thank you, the reader. You see,\nyou are the lifeblood of this newspaper.\nYou are what makes it great, not me.\nThis paper would be nothing without\nyou; it would be words whispered into\nthe wind.\nThis year has had its highs and lows.\nThen there are the odd lows that are\nalso highs as they are useful: the nev-er-ending deadline is one. To borrow a\nphrase from a past Felix Editor: nothing\nfocuses the mind like a hanging in the\nmorning. I am pleased to confirm that\nthe highs outweigh the lows by a considerable degree. It\u2019s like Mike Tyson in\nhis prime fighting Amir Khan when he\nwas an amateur. I can happily tell you\nthat I would leap at the chance to rewind the clock and do it all again. Considering this is being written at 4am on\na Thursday morning, I think that shows\nyou how much I\u2019ve enjoyed it. Felix is\nthe reason that I have ultimately not\nhated my time here, and it showcases\nwhat students can do when left to\ntheir own devices.\nMy advice for you would be to work\nhard and play hard. Remember that at\nthe end of it all, you\u2019re not here to make\na twat out of yourself in Fabric (or even\nbrave it and go to Piccadilly Institute,\nor whatever it\u2019s called now), you are\nultimately at this university to get a\ndegree and learn about science, en-gineering, maths, or medicine. At the\nsame time make sure you let off some\nsteam in some way. Getting wasted,\nhaving a quiet cup of tea and contemplating your existence, doing backflips,\nwhatever floats your boat \u2013 as long as\nit makes you happy. Don\u2019t have any\nregrets when you finish. You only get\none go at this, so make it a good one.\nThat goes for your early years of life\nin general. The Roman poet Horace\nsaid that you should enjoy your youth\nwhile it lasts in his Ode to Youth. I\nagree with him on that. Some of the\nfilthier stuff he wrote, well, you\u2019re on\nyour own H man. Ready for pretentious quote number two. You better be,\nbecause it\u2019s like Cleopatra, it\u2019s coming atcha. Omar Khayyam put it more\ndelicately than I ever could. Although\nthat\u2019s not saying much really is it? He\nsaid: \u201cmake the most of what we yet\nmay spend, before we too into the dust\ndescend\u201d. What I\u2019m saying is that you\nare only young once and only a student once. Never again will you have\nsuch relatively small responsibility and\nsuch a (sort of) flexible timetable. Go\nout on weeknights, see all the sights of\nLondon, laugh in the back of lectures\nat the penis someone has drawn on\nyour notes. Very importantly, though,\ndon\u2019t take yourself too seriously and be\npompous. When you\u2019re old and have\nwhite hair, you probably won\u2019t be looking back thinking you wish you were\nmore serious about everything. You\u2019ll\nprobably be too busy laughing at the\ngreat memories you have. Remember\nthat the great joke that life plays on us\nis that it\u2019s so short.\nWhen it comes to your course and\nyour education at Imperial there is a\nsimple bit of advice from me: do everything you can to make a difference\nto this place. You can change things\nfor the better. Are you a first year going\ninto your second year? Well, you can\nshape the course and make the third\nyear better than it was going to be. Remember, the lecturers and markers on\nthe course have an immense amount\nof power. They set exams and the\nsyllabus. They are the ones who can\nW\neasily change things for the next year,\nincluding the courses that you take. If\nyou\u2019re into not being completely self-ish, which, hopefully some of you are,\nthen you can help just to make things\nbetter for the next generation. That\u2019s\nthe idea of the betterment of human-ity. It should be like the song by The\nBeatles, getting better all the time.\nImperial is a funny old university re-ally. I think it is a great institution, but\nhas the potential to be so much more.\nWhat I think makes Imperial great is\nthe people here. The students are in-credible, well, perhaps barring this one\nguy who was the Editor of the newspaper for a year. Honestly they are. It\u2019s\na privilege to get to meet some of the\npeople here: you know what sort of\npeople I mean \u2013 the ones that make\nyou think \u201ccrap, I\u2019m really not that good\nat anything\u201d.\nImperial needs to stop the rampant\ncommercialisation and start realising it\u2019s not a crime to be nice, and it\u2019s\nnot illegal to spend some money on\nstudents. I understand things need to\nmake an overall profit, but investing\nthat money \u2013 as it is an investment\nin all meanings of the word \u2013 into the\nstudents is worth it in the end. There\nneeds to be a greater community spirit\nat Imperial and better interaction between staff and students. There needs\nto be more honesty and plain talking,\nespecially from the upper manage-ment. There\u2019s not enough space here\nto really go into it, and it\u2019s the end of\nterm so I\u2019ll spare you the essay on higher education and so forth. I will say this:\nthe on-the-ground effects of changes\nare what really count. Broad strategies\nare needed and great, but sometimes\nyou just need to shake things up a bit.\nHere\u2019s an example of something that\nI think would be a good start and create a fast change that students would\nsee and feel. Have a university-wide\nbenchmark on lectures and lecture\nnote quality, enforced with \u201ceditorial\nboards\u201d that allow freedom of expression for the lecturers as well as making\nsure they adhere to a high standard.\nPlus having random students plucked\nout of a computerised hat to consult\non College policy and decisions could\nhelp getting a diverse range of opin-ions. I\u2019ll stop now before I delete every\npage to talk about this stuff.\nThe Union: well, that has so much\npotential too. They need to loosen\nup a bit and not worry about their image as much. This is a problem that\nCollege also shares. Remember the\nadvice that your mother gave you as\na child: it\u2019s what you think of yourself\nthat counts. Again I\u2019ll spare an essay\non all the things that could be changed\n(e.g. the food) and say one interesting\nidea: how about having staff roles being sabbatical students instead. That\nis the whole point of a students\u2019 union\nafter all. Of course the staff are there\nfor stability but students here are a\nclever bunch, I\u2019m sure they could make\nit work. That said, the staff deserve a\nquick clap for supporting and helping\nstudents, and the Union has had quite\na good year I think.\nAnyway, that\u2019s enough from me.\nHave a great summer and good luck\nfor the future.\n\u201d\n\u201c\nI can happily tell you that I would leap at the\nchance to rewind the clock and do it all again\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\n21\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTaste Imperial Maple Pecan Slices...\n...and how to duplicate them, thanks to Elizabeth Crow\nho doesn\u2019t love the\nmaple and pecan slice\nthat you can buy at\nfood outlets around\ncampus? he syrupy biscuit base,\ngooey but crunchy \u2013 topped with\ndecadent dark chocolate. I am de\ufb01nitely a fan and wanted to have a go\nat making them. I tried looking for a\nrecipe online but had no luck. Lots of\nrecipes for pecan pie, peanut butter\ntraybakes and caramel squares, but\nnone for maple and pecan slices. So I\ndecided to come up with a recipe for\nthem \u2013 and in doing so, checked out\nthe cost to compare them to the price\nwe pay on campus...\nW\nIngredients:\n160g butter\n4 tbsp of maple (or golden) syrup\n40g granulated sugar\n130g digestive biscuits, crushed into\n\ufb01ngernail sized pieces\n120g plain \ufb02our\n60g porridge oats\n60g pecans, chopped into \ufb01ngernail\nsized pieces\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n100g dark chocolate\nMethod\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/Gas Mark\n4 and butter an 8 inch/20cm diameter cake tin. Line with baking paper\nif you wish (optional.)\nMelt the butter, syrup and sugar in\na saucepan over a low heat. Add the\ncrushed biscuits, flour, oats, pecans\nand vanilla essence to the pan and\nmix together.\nPour the mixture into the tin and\npress down with a fork. Bake in the\noven for 15 minutes until lightly\ngolden, be careful not to overbake.\nWhile the base cools, melt the\nchocolate slowly in a pan over a low\nheat. Pour the melted chocolate over\nthe cooled biscuit base and leave in\nthe fridge until the chocolate has\nset.\nCut into 12 slices and enjoy!\nCost breakdown and tips\nI used golden syrup in my version as it\u2019s a lot cheaper than maple syrup - you\nget 98% of the taste for about a tenth of the cost. Obviously you probably\ncan\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t call it a \u2018maple\u2019 and pecan slice, but I think \u201csyrupy pecan slice\u201d\nsounds just as good!\nYou\u2019re probably likely to have most of the ingredients in the cupboard/fridge\nalready - i.e. butter, sugar and flour. Otherwise, replacing them isn\u2019t a big deal\n- but I priced all the ingredients on April 1:\nSainsbury\u2019s Basics butter (250g @ \u00a31.20), 77p\nTate and Lyle Golden Syrup (454g @ 98p), 25p\nSainsbury\u2019s Fairtrade granulated sugar (1kg @ 89p), 13p\nSainsbury\u2019s Basics digestive biscuits (400g @ 45p), 15p\nSainsbury\u2019s Basics plain flour (1.5kg @ 65p), 5p\nSainsbury\u2019s Scottish Porridge Oats (500g @ 65p), 8p\nSainsbury\u2019s Pecan Nuts (200g @ \u00a33), 90p\nDr Oetker Vanilla Essence (38ml @ \u00a31.08), 17p\n100g bar Sainsbury\u2019s basics dark chocolate, 33p\nThat\u2019s a total cost of \u00a32.83, which is 24p a slice (a saving of 77p per slice, or\na huge \u00a39.24 for every 12 slices based on current Taste Imperial prices).\nThe most expensive ingredient is the pecan nuts - if you have no other future\nuse for the leftovers nuts and don\u2019t want to buy them, you could add another\n60g of digestive biscuits to get the crunch (obviously forgoing the pecan part\nof the \u2018maple and pecan slice\u2019, now it should be called a crunchy syrupy slice.)\nAlternatively, my favourite variation on this involves using 90g of crunchy\npeanut butter substituted for 80g of the butter (hey presto, now the bake has\nevolved to a syrupy peanut slice).\nI encourage you to experiment with this recipe and get in touch with Felix Food\nif you come up with any other yummy variations, or if you have other Taste\nImperial favourites that you\u2019ve recreated at home.\nFood Editorial disclaimer:\nOur instant ramen piece was obviously a parody. We at Food condone everything in moderation \u2013 that means consumption of all types of\nfood (and alcohol, obviously.) If you really *are* skint, fair enough; now you know how to bump up the nutritional value of cheap grub. But\nfor the love of *SQUAWK*, please don\u2019t eat this regularly. Pasta\u2019s a better carb \u2013 just takes a few minutes extra, you can whip up a quick\nsauce while you wait, and it\u2019s MSG free.\nAs the outgoing Food Editors we\u2019d like to thank all our contributors for their hard work, the establishments who were great enough to let\nus review and feature them \u2013 and to you, the reader, for sticking around. See ya next year for more fun in and out of the domestic kitchen,\nand if you\u2019re thinking about contributing next year \u2013 do! Or suggest stuff you\u2019d like to see for next year. We\u2019d love to hear from you.\nLove,\nSophia, Yiango and Carol\nWe check our mail in the summer.\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\u2019m sure the Supreme\nEditor himself is feeling bit-tersweet; it\u2019s the end of a very tiring\nyear, but also the end of a year of fun\nand boundless creativity.\nAs next year\u2019s editor I\u2019m already\nfeeling nervous, after all, only next\nyear\u2019s incoming students will be free\nof expectations, while the rest of you\nwill judge me by the standard of my\nforebears, a worrying thought. I\u2019ve already had a few ideas for next year\u2019s\nFelix, so watch out, this cat\u2019s on \ufb01re!\nI\u2019ll endeavour to uphold the high level\nof Union scrutiny and clubs & society\ninvolvement that Tim has propagated\nover the last year, as well as debate on\nkey student issues such as the new\nhalls in Acton, the closure of the Holland Club, the closure of Garden Hall\nand the changes to the Union\u2019s consti-tution.\nNext year I plan to bring in new sections to showcase local events (on and\no\ufb00 campuses) and provide careers in-formation. I\u2019ll hopefully be welcoming\nsome fresh blood on the editorial team\nand pushing for more people to con-tribute. Felix will be looking for copy\neditors, section editors, online editors,\nmusic reviewers, regular comment\nwriters and more. It could be you\u2026!\nFelix is also happy to start new sec-tions, so if you think there\u2019s a certain\nmissing element to the paper, email\nme or drop down to the Felix O\ufb03ce in\nthe Beit Quad West Basement.\nAnother part of Felix I aim to improve is the paper\u2019s online presence.\nFelix\u2019s new online team will be providing news and entertaining information\nduring the week and over the holidays\nso you don\u2019t need to bother with the\nTab anymore. hrough Felix Online\nyou\u2019ll also be able to read news, listen\nto IC Radio and watch content produced by Imperial\u2019s own STOIC TV\nas well as take part in debates in the\ncomments section.\nFelix could not be put together without contributions and support from a\nfantastic team of students. I\u2019d like to\nthank the team this year for the outstanding content they\u2019ve produced for\nus to read and I only hope that I can\nkeep the legacy of Felix intact for another year.\nYou Say Goodbye, I say Hello\nS\n\u201c\nI\u2019ve already\nhad a few\nideas for next\nyear\u2019s Felix,\nso watch out,\nthis cat\u2019s on\nfire!\nJoe Letts\n\u201d\n,\ncat\u2019s on\ncat\u2019s on\nFelix will be back, bigger and better.\nKinda like the Terminator...\nI believe stu-dents... feel\nundervalued,\nmerely ushered through\nthe system\nEoghan J Totten\n2012 University Complaints (England & Wales) in 2012\nkid you not. he title highlights a rise of 25% in complaints lodged to the O\ufb03ce of\nthe Independent Adjudicator\nfrom academic institutions in\nEngland and Wales.\nNumerous academics, journalists and opinionated individuals ally\nthis increase with the inaugural year\nof the \u00a39,000 fee tari\ufb00. One has to\nconsider the possibility that this is\na cop-out. You might even choose\nto lament the fact that some people\nare insistent on interlinking money\nand cost with education. Some postulate that rising student antagonism\nhas spawned from the myopia of the\ncoalition Government, who choose\nto view third level education as a hindrance rather than a help.\n69% of complaints, as cited by he\nHu\ufb03ngton Post, related to academic\nstatus, originating principally from\nBusiness students and those aligned\nwith medical faculties More than half\nof these (59%) were deemed \u2018unjusti\ufb01ed\u2019 by the OIA. he seventh successive annual increase was attributed to\nchallenges related to the professionalism of students and sta\ufb00 regarding\nmisconduct and plagiarism.\nhe subtleties of the statistics prove\nmost intriguing. In my opinion fees\nare only one component of the mat-ter. Granted, the media coverage of\nfee hikes awarded legitimacy and\neven acted as a vehicle for student\nantagonism and (as seen on London\nstreets a couple of years ago) acted\nas tinder for the \ufb01re. It signi\ufb01ed the\nGovernment\u2019s o\ufb00-loading of responsibility (of their own volition) for providing a technically and intellectually\nadept proletariat in the trivial pursuit\nof a doomed policy of \ufb01scal austerity.\nTO WHAT END? All they have\nproduced is an unhealthy competition between prospective students,\nwhereby a \ufb02awless set of A-Level (or\nequivalent) grades may not guarantee\ntheir place at university. Furthermore\na more anxious, apprehensive student\nbody has evolved from the wreck-age, preoccupied with examinations\nas the end-product of their studies\nrather than the value of the education\nthey received. his has set the tempo\nfor the exponentially morphing grade\nin\ufb02ation whereby a 2-1 just doesn\u2019t\ncut it. Arguably we are already there.\nLondon South Bank University\nwas, forgive me, named and shamed\nby the OIA for failing to comply with\nrecommendations regarding the handling of complaints and the associated mechanisms of compensation. To\nquote a Mr. Behrens of the OIA, \u201cWe\ngo through quite a rigorous process\nof alerting Universities to what they\nhave to do to avoid being named for\nnon-compliance\u201d.\nAvoid? AVOID? Here is a prime example of the crux of current student\nantagonism. All the rhetoric coming from both the Government and\nits associated bodies is negative and\ndebasing, conveying that the student\nbody is a nuisance that must be managed rather than engaged.\nI believe students as a whole (across\nEngland and Wales) feel underval-ued, merely ushered through the sys-tem, like cattle to the abattoir. If the\nGovernment were to wholeheartedly\nproclaim academia as a cornerstone\nof economic recovery (with convic-tion), a national bastion of con\ufb01dence\nin its bright young minds, those complaints might just recede in future\nyears. It may just pass down from\nthe level of governance into the grass\nroots.\nI\n\n"

    "content": "Science and the students\nPhilippa Skett takes a look at the scientific landmarks of this academic year\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\n16\nOCTOBER\nBiologists took the lead in October\nby constructing a Tree of Life constructed for all 9,993 living bird spe-cies, discovering spitting fish that\ncatch insects from the air and teaching three bears to count.\nIt is less likely biologists at Imperial\nwere as active, however with the first\nyears undertaking their first practical\nof feeding the ducks in Hyde park.\nhat\u2019s not to say biologists have\nbeen perfect in the past \u2013 \u201cpenis\nworms,\u201d or priapulids, as they are\nBlue whales seemed to be the stars of\nNovember with a study showing that\nthey actually pirouette underwater\nbefore lunging at patches of krill from\nbelow. Such moves displayed more\ngrace than those o\ufb00ered by freshers\nwhen they ventured across London to\ngo to Fabric for the first and last time\nthis month, with many finding they are\nstill not prepared for the wider world\nIt was found out how life emerges\nat hydrothermal vents in December\nwith a hypothesis formulated about\nhow the vents could form rudimentary proton gradients. Such a gradient is thought to form as the oceanic\nwater meets the alkaline water from\nvents within mineral walls in the\n2013 seems to be the year for neuro-science; January kicked o\ufb00 with the\nidentification of the loss of cells within\nthe cortex being responsible for decreasing sleep quality and a poorer\nlong-term memory. his was actively\ndisplayed in those sitting January ex-ams, although was o\ufb00set by certain\nstudents thinking it was appropriate\nto nap in the Library between study\nsessions.\nTo further torment the minds of\nmore commonly referred\nto in the lab to avoid break-outs of sniggering, may\nhave thrown previous evolutionary work into disre-pute.\nAnalysis of the gene expression of\nthe penis worm in October showed\nit developed di\ufb00erently than once\nthought, meaning it may have to\nbe renamed (upsettingly) and also\nmoved about in the phylogenetic tree.\nMeanwhile, a model predicted that\nthe Moon was probably created from\na collision between the Moon and\nanother orbiting body; this was also\nsupported by the fact that the Moon\nand the Earth have a very similar\nchemical composition.\nA more accurate carbon-14 clock\nsample was extracted from the Lake\nSuigestu in Japan, whilst Archaeologists demonstrated that the stone\nstatues on Easter Island may have\n\u201cwalked\u201d across the hills as opposed\nto being built on site. Structural features of the statue indicated they\nwere rocked back and forth across\nthe island before settling them down\nin their final location.\nAnd finally, here in Britain, the\nbadger cull was delayed by the gov-ernment, despite badgers causing issues via their transmission of bovine\ntuberculosis, which was harming\ncattle. Not only that, but a survey revealed that only 63% of people support animal experimentation in the\nUK, and this is on the decline.\nSurprisingly, the survey was not\nran by Imperial\u2019s friends the British\nNOVEMBER\noutside of\nMetric.\nA newly\nd i s c o v -ered black\nhole was\nfound to be the equivalent mass of 17\nbillion Suns, although it has seemingly\nsqueezed its way into a galaxy only a\nquarter of the size of the Milky Way.\nSuch a ratio of mass to size was also\nquoted within a chat up line by a rather desperate, zealous third year in 568,\nalthough results remained inconclusive in its e\ufb00ectiveness.\nIn Chemistry, nanoparticles that can\nabsorb sunlight then\nreemit it as heat were\nfound to convert water\nto steam when sub-merged. Not only that,\nthinner endoscopes\nwere developed using\nsingle optical fibres,\nwith researchers at\nKorea University demonstrating their use by\nmaking a map of a rat\nintestine.\nDECEMBER\nrocks of the sea-bed, allowing for\nthe conversion of\ncarbon dioxide\nand hydrogen into\nthe basic building\nblocks for life like nucleotides.\nChristmas cheer came early this\nmonth for virologists as it was announced that H5N1 research was to\nbe resumed, after lifting the moratorium placed back in January 2012.\nMeanwhile, even ecologists seemed\nto be making headway in their scientific endeavours with the identification of the benefits for \ufb02ocks of\nbirds that are composed of di\ufb00erent\nspecies.\nBiologists in general seemed to be\nhaving a productive month, with second years at Imperial in particular\nshowing advanced\ncourtship skills at\nthe Christmas dinner and the RCSU\nBall afterwards.\nJANUARY\nthose studying hard, severe outbreaks of the fungus that usually plaques\nco\ufb00ee plants ranged\nacross Central America.\nAlthough the fungus Hemilia vastatrix doesn\u2019t generally kill\nco\ufb00ee plants, it can halve the harvest,\nand the Costa Rican government this\nmonth enacted emergency legislation\nto increase funding towards research\nto combat the fungus.\nFurther government action in science was seen in January, with Obama\nrenewing his commitment to climate\nchange in his second inaugural speech\nand hoping to decrease greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nStill across the\npond, the US National Institute of\nHealth (NIH) was\nadvised to retire\nits 360 chimpanzees and shut down\nhalf of its ongoing\nanimal experiments\ndue to suggestions\nthat only 50 should\nsu\ufb03ce. Imperial remained oblivious\nto this, and heartily\ncontinued its own\nanimal experiments,\nwhilst BUAV prepared its assault.\nUnion Abolition Vivisection (BUAV),\nbut by the more creditable Ipsos\nMori, although this should have provided warning signs for the animal\ntesting facilities here on campus.\nhttp://0.tqn.com/d/architecture/1/0/F/l/EasterIsland02.jpg\nAgain however, results remained inconclusive as to how in\ufb02uential such\nskills were on the final copulation\nprobability.\nIn physics, a potential source of local comets was identified on the edge\nof the Solar System, known as the\nKuiper Belt, whilst the US meteorite\nthat crashed in California in April\nwas identified as the fastest on re-cord. Physics did also take a sad turn\nwith CERN stopping the proton-pro-ton collisions within the Large Hadron Collider, and the twin spacecraft\nmapping the gravity field of the moon\ncoming to a halt in a controlled crash.\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/\nThe Easter Island statues drag themselves\nacross the hill to queue in the Library Cafe\nThe Blue Whale: an eight on\nthe Imperial Scale\nThe only love students felt in Januaryone indued by chemical stimulants\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n47\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Writer\nNitin Nihalani\nAgainst the picturesque backdrop of\nWindsor Castle and loyally donning\nthe club\u2019s apparel, Imperial 1st XI\nput out one of its strongest line-ups\nto play against Windsor Cricket Club.\nCaptain Jayanth Ganapathy, a former\nplayer for the opposition, elected to\nbat \ufb01rst on a good batting wicket with\na fast out\ufb01eld.\nhere were high expectations for\nex-Windsor veteran Vishal Nair, having scored a century on this ground\njust last year, but was sent back to the\ndressing room for just 10. Lomas Persad, deprived of the strike and eager\nto get o\ufb00 the mark, was sent back in\nthe very next over nicking an away-swinger through to the keeper. Two\novers later, current Windsor 2nd XI\nplayer Mohit Kulkarni provided an\naction-replay of Lomas\u2019 dismissal to\ncontinue the poor start for Imperial.\nWith his side in trouble at 18 for\n3, Jayanth joined Iain Stobbs for a\nmomentum-shifting partnership of\n54. Iain smacked ten fours in his authoritative 47 o\ufb00 45 balls before being removed by one that darted back\ninto his middle stump. he scoring\nrate stunted, Jayanth played a captain\u2019s knock to rebuild and anchor\nthe innings, well supported by Joe\nO\u2019Gorman who contributed with\n31. Both played smart cricket, rotating strike constantly while at the\nsame time putting away the bad balls\nwhen they came. However, disaster\nstruck when he was on 81 and given\nout to a very dubious LBW decision\n\u2013 just as he was looking to accelerate towards his century. With wickets\ntumbling at the other end, Vignesh\nVenkateswaran, the last of the ex-Windsor players, struck some lusty\nblows including a couple of \ufb02icks for\nsix in his quick-\ufb01re 32 o\ufb00 20 before\nholding out at long-on on the penultimate ball \u2013 Imperial 209 all out.\nAction resumed immediately in the\nsecond innings with club president\nSid Kohli opening the bowling with\nhis o\ufb00-breaks. Leggie Arvind Rajagopalan shared the not-so-new ball,\na move that seemed to surprise the\nopposing team. It turned out to be\na good call in the fourth over when\nArvind got a \ufb02ighted delivery to dip\ndrastically, clean bowling the wild-swinging batsman. However, runs\ncontinued to \ufb02ow from both ends\neven after Vignesh was introduced\ninto the attack, his \ufb01rst two overs going for 16 runs. Nitin Nihalani had a\nmixed start to his spell giving away\n11 runs in his \ufb01rst three deliveries\nbefore \ufb01nally producing the breakthrough on the fourth.\nMaking up for his poor start, Vignesh produced a wicket-maiden in\nthe very next over to put the pressure\nback on Windsor. An entertaining\nperiod of play ensued with Vignesh\ngiving nothing away at one end but\nWindsor CC too easy for IC\nNitin giving away a boundary an\nover but also producing a chance for\na wicket every over, most of which\nwere dropped. Nevertheless, Windsor collapsed, losing three wickets\nincluding two to Vignesh in consecutive balls in the \ufb01nal over of his spell.\nJoe and Lomas were brought in to\ncomplete the all-spin attack and \ufb01nish o\ufb00 the innings. Windsor struggling at 6 wickets down for a little\nover 100 countered with a few boundaries before Joe got the breakthrough\nin his second over and Lomas rattled\nthrough the tail to give Imperial a\nsolid 50-run win.\nCrossword\n\u0003\u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0001 \u0001 \u0006\u0001 \u0001 \u0007\u0001 \u0001 \b\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0003\u0003\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0004\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0005\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0006\u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0007\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003\b\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0003 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0004\u0003\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0004\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0005\u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0006\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004\u0007\u0001 \u0001 \u0004\b\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0004 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0004 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0003\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0004\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0005\u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0005\u0006\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0005\u0007\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0005\b\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\nAcross\n1.

We are grateful\nto our sponsors and hosts; Schlumberger, Petrotrin, Tucker Energy Services, University of Trinidad and Tobago, Total S.A., BP, Challenge Energy,\niPoint LLC, Royal Dutch Shell, Hess\nCorporation, OPC and SPE for their\ngenerosity in making this trip a huge\nsuccess. Also, we are thankful to Imperial College London Earth Science and\nEngineering Department and Imperial\nCollege London Mechanical Engineering Department for helping us procuring PPE.\nHaving just completed the highly intense MSc taught course and \ufb01nished\nour \ufb01nal exams (with only the thesis to\nfollow), we departed on our transatlantic journey from London Gatwick Airport on Sunday morning. We crossed\nthe pond and arrived in the beautiful\ncity of Port Of Spain later the same\nevening.\nEarly the next morning, we met a\nPetrotrin representative who led the\nway to the Petrotrin Learning Centre. Here we were given an overview\nof Petrotrin\u2019s complex organisational\npast and the history of petroleum in\nTrinidad and Tobago, which links back\nto the Pitch Lake discovery. his was\nfollowed by a drive-through tour of the\nPointe-\u00e0-Pierre Re\ufb01nery and a visit to\nthe Pointe-\u00e0-Pierre Wild Fowl Trust.\nhe Wild Fowl Trust is a not for pro\ufb01t,\nenvironmental, non-government organisation dedicated to environmental education and the conservation\nof wetlands and waterfowl. We were\nfortunate to be welcomed there by\nPetrotrin\u2019s President (also the son of\nthe former President of the Republic of\nTrinidad and Tobago) who described\nhis journey from the university classroom to his post at Petrotrin. We were\ngiven a fascinating and enlightening\nguided tour of the grounds, which\nincorporated a number of nature-in-spired life lessons, including one based\nupon the existence of the simple lily\npad. his wetlands plant begins life\ngrowing underwater and then eventually emerges to the surface, where it\ncan \ufb02ourish. his represents the sentiment that: to really succeed you must\nkeep trying, never give up and eventually you will \ufb01nd success in your en-deavours.\nhe next day we visited the Trinmar\nbase, to visit two live o\ufb00shore production platforms. After attending the\nsafety brie\ufb01ng at the base, we boarded\nthe boat with full PPE and headed to\nthe o\ufb00shore. his was a great experience as we could see live production\nof hydrocarbons and witness the separation processing facilities \ufb01rst hand;\nsomething that we had been studying only a few short days before! One\nof the key take-away learnings from\nthis experience was the importance\nof safety in the oil industry, which is\nmaintained not only at the \ufb01eld but in\nthe o\ufb03ce as well.\nUpon arriving back on dry land, we\nimmediately went to he University\nof Trinidad and Tobago campus in\nSan Fernando; where we met with the\nuniversity SPE representatives. he\nevening allowed all of us from Imperial College to meet our future industry colleagues from Trinidad in an\ninformal setting and to learn of UTT\u2019s\nPetroleum/Reservoir Engineering programmes and the current SPE activities in Trinidad.\nOur third and last day with Petrotrin\nwas spent at the Beach Camp, where\nwe were treated to a drive-by tour of\nsome Petrotrin onshore facilities \u2013 including steam \ufb02ooding and water in-jection.\nWe were then ready to visit our next\nhost, Schlumberger. he day began\nwith an arrival and safety introduction,\nand a presentation about the company\nby the region\u2019s General Manager. his\nwas followed by other presentation\nabout few of the service lines in the\ncompany by their respective repre-sentatives, including D and M (Drilling\nand Measurements), SIS (Schlumberg-er Information Solutions), DCS (Data\nand Consulting Services), WG (West-ernGeco) and WL (Wireline). During\nthe tour of the base we were able to\nsee and learn about the various equipment run downhole, thousands of feet\nsubsurface. Seeing the equipment up-close excellently complimented the\nclassroom theory.\nNext stop: Pitch Lake, the largest\nnatural bitumen / asphalt seep deposit\nin the world. he Pitch Lake is located\nin southwest Trinidad in the village of\nLa Brea, consisting of black and viscous liquid asphalt with a semisolid\nsurface, which we could walk on. he\nguide described that it was possible\nfor an individual to slowly sink if they\nstood on the surface too long, crediting how soft the asphalt is! I, person-ally, had the opportunity to put a stick\nthrough the asphalt and remove the\nliquid tar. However, only a few days\nlater, I noticed that my show was damaged permanently, as the tar had dried\nup.\nOur \ufb01nal day in Trinidad was spent\nwith Tucker Energy Services. he\ngroup was split into two; with half of\nus going to the Wireline facility in Otaheite and the other half to the Cementing facility in Chaguaramas. his was\na real-life experience with no veneer,\nwhich included a tour of the cementing laboratory, the chance to climb inside a cased-hole wireline truck and to\nhandle the equipment used during the\nperforation process.\nHaving thoroughly enjoyed our week\nin (highly industrial) Trinidad, we\nthen hopped on the ferry and sailed to\nbeautiful Tobago. Here we were able to\nspend a couple of days relaxing, exploring the picturesque island and meeting\nsome lovely local people. In this short\ntime many of us were able to go snor-kelling, enjoy the water sports, scuba\ndive, go deep-sea \ufb01shing, kayaking and\neven jump (safely!) from a waterfall.\nhe trip was an overwhelming success and on behalf of the entire SPE\nImperial College student body can say\nthat the experience really did succeed\nin strengthening our classroom knowledge through \ufb01rst-hand experience of\nhow the petroleum industry works.\nI would like to unreservedly thank\nour hosts and primary sponsors for\nmaking the trip possible!\nLast, but not the least, I would like\nto thank the two bus drivers, Bas and\nFrankie, who were full of joy and made\nour journeys entertaining!\nHelp Soup Run feed London\u2019s homeless\nHomelessness is probably London\u2019s\nmost visible social problem. We all\nsee it daily, in the men and women\nwho spend their days with a paper\ncup, begging for spare change in the\ncapital\u2019s allleyways. Some of us ignore\nthem \u2013 after all, we can\u2019t possibly\nhelp them all. Some of us give them\na smile, which always meets with kind\nwords, yet somehow this always leaves\nus feeling unful\ufb01lled.\nhe Soup Run, however, have decided to do more. A small group of\ncommitted students, I discovered,\nspend every Sunday evening gathering and distributing food to the homeless on the streets. No one is quite sure\nhow many homeless people there are\nin London \u2013 estimates vary but generally fall in the range of 250 to 700.\nNot all of them sleep rough, but many\ndo; exposed to the elements and the\nabuse and the poverty that seems far\ntoo common on the streets. On a given evening, the soup run might feed\nsomewhere between \ufb01fty and eighty\npeople, representing a sizeable fraction of those sleeping rough.\nhe homeless in London have a reputation for being rude, obnoxious and\nuneducated. None of those stereotypes could be further from the truth.\nHaving been on many soup runs this\nyear, and having spoken to people who\nhave been doing the runs for many\nyears, it\u2019s safe to conclude that many\nof them are amongst the kindest and\nmost genuine people that you could\nmeet.\nIf you handed a surplus, slightly\nsquashed sandwich as dinner to most\npeople, they\u2019d probably be insulted\nand give you a funny look. But to\nsomeone who can\u2019t even a\ufb00ord the\nbread to make that same sandwich,\nthe smile on their face is often enough\nto make the entire evening\u2019s e\ufb00ort\nworthwhile (the sandwich would be\neven better with soup \u2013 but giving\nthat out is not allowed for safety rea-sons. Talk about H&S gone mad!)\nIt\u2019s not all that rosy though.\nUnderstandably, the\npeople who use\nthe runs become upset\nwhen we run\nout of food,\nwhich is an\nall too common occurrence.\nFor many of them,\na small sliver of cake\nfrom PAUL\u2019s South\nKensington bakery would\nprobably be the nicest thing they\u2019d get\nto eat all week.\nSadly PAUL, for some undisclosed\nand confusing reason, stopped supplying the run with food, leaving it strug-gling. PAUL\u2019s surplus food went a long\nway to making sure that everyone got\nat least some carbohydrates to make\nit through the freezing winter nights\non the streets of Holborn. Without\nthis essential supplier, Soup Run must\nsimply hope that they see how important their contribution is\nand once again begin\ndonating their unsold food whilst\na t t e m p t i n g\nother desperate\nmeans of pro-curement.\nhis, coupled\nwith the recent (de-feated) proposal by\nsome management group\nrepresentatives at the last meeting of the Clubs and Societies Board\nto cut the Soup Run funding to zero\nwas deeply worrying. he committee\nremain concerned about how they will\nbe able to fund the project, and procure the necessary amount of food.\nhe hope is that in the \ufb01nal week of\nterm, students will be able to donate\ntheir unused food to the project and\nperhaps be encouraged to volunteer\nover the summer if they are around, or\nover the course of the next year; giving\nthe club the support that it needs.\nIt does seem a shame that the future\nof a club that contributes so much to\nthe local community should have to\nworry about its most basic funding\nand supplies, given that it helps those\nin society who are amongst the most\nvulnerable and open to exploitation.\nMy only hope is that by raising awareness of the work that the Soup Run\ndoes, we will be able to secure a comfortable future for the society and the\npeople we help.\nIf you would like to get involved with\nthe Soup Run, or have any materials\n(sugar, plastic cups, chocolate powder\netc.) that you\u2019d be interested in donat-ing, please email icsouprun@gmail.\ncom\nBen Fernando Writer\nHamza Shaikh Writer\n\n"

Forte has moments as\nthe Hispanic maid, but not enough.\nMuch like the \ufb01lms it wants to\nmake fun of, there\u2019s too much time\nlingering over nothing, and often you\nwant the \ufb01lm to just get on with it\nand make us laugh.\nSadly the laughs never do come,\nand thankfully when it\u2019s all over in\n86 minutes, you\u2019ll want to avert your\neyes and attention to something of\nmore quality. Let\u2019s just say, it\u2019s worse\nthan the Scary Movie \ufb01lms \u2013 now\nthat\u2019s a pretty new low.\nhis year\u2019s Bridesmaids? Not quite,\nbut it\u2019s a wedding comedy that can\nproudly stand on its own two feet. It\u2019s\nfunny, \ufb01lthy, and bold, with quirky,\nunlikable but redeemable characters played by actors who can handle\ncomedy.\nHigh school best friends Regan\n(Dunst), Gena (Caplan) and Katie\n(Fisher) are shocked to hear their\nplus-sized \u201cfriend\u201d Becky (Wilson) is\ngetting married, before any of them.\nhey all come together, not having grown up one bit since their high\nschool days, wanting to get drunk and\nhigh living up to their glory years.\nWhat\u2019s di\ufb03cult is that the world\nhas moved on and they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s\ndi\ufb03cult to see just how these three\nnavigated their way through life after\ntheir teenage years, but when such\ndynamic characters come together,\nyou know you\u2019ll get trouble.\nA stupid, drunken evening leads\nto a ripped wedding dress, which is\nevery bride\u2019s worst nightmare. he\ngood news is, Becky has no idea, and\nthey have until the next morning to\nget this \ufb01xed.\nhey \ufb01nd new love and renewed\nfriendships along the way, and perhaps \ufb01nally, the three will snap out of\ntheir fantasy lives and grow up. And\nthere\u2019s fun to be had getting there.\nReleased from prison after almost\nspending three decades locked up,\nVal (Pacino) is looking for some good\ntime (i.e. sex, drugs, guns) with his\nbuddies Doc (Walken) and Hirsch\n(Arkin). What complicates his night-out is that Doc has been tasked with\nkilling Val and delivering his body to\na crime boss.\nWith a cast this good, it\u2019s a shame\nthey don\u2019t have anything better to do\nthan visit a brothel three times, take\na few too many viagra pills, go to a\nbar, and a diner. We\u2019re asked to believe this may be Val\u2019s last ever day\non Earth and yet there\u2019s nothing remotely interesting about what these\nthree old timers get up to. here is\nthe predictable running gag that hint\nat the fact that these guys are \u201ctoo old\nfor this shit\u201d and the script doesn\u2019t go\nany further to equip these fantastic\nactors with anything better to say.\nAwkwardly stirring up false sentimentally to bring about closure for\nthe characters doesn\u2019t really work,\nas proper links are never established.\nAnd so both a sudden death and introduction of family members feel\nincredibly forced.\nBut despite the mind-numbingly\ndull script, it\u2019s always worth sticking\naround for some banter between Pacino, Walken and Arkin.\nJapanese director Kitamura\u2019s second\nEnglish-language feature is as bloody\nand shocking as his previous \ufb01lm he\nMidnight Meat Train, but also just as\nshallow. here will be blood, tons of\nit, with all the gore very stylishly han-dled, although when it comes to explaining the characters themselves,\nthe \ufb01lm falls massively short.\nA gang of violent thugs meet their\nmatch when a man they kidnap for\nmoney is far from a helpless city\nworker they \ufb01rst thought he was. In\nfact Driver (Luke Evans) has secrets\nof his own (i.e having a woman locked\nup in the trunk of his car) and possesses skills that make it instantly\nobvious that they messed with the\nwrong man.\nEvans is a convincing anti-hero of\nvery few words, and his sharp charisma is enough to dominate the screen.\nhere\u2019s also a certain amount of satisfaction to be gained seeing so many\nvile individuals meet their deserving\ngruesome ends.\nBrie\ufb02y glossing over the psychology of the Driver and his relationship\nwith his captives makes the audience\nwonder, but our curiosity is never\nproperly addressed after its hasty\nwrap-up of all things violent.\nEverything is very slickly put together but the content is barely there.\nHalle Berry is a 911 operator having undergone a traumatic event six\nmonths beforehand of listening to\na young girl get murdered, Abigail\nBreslin is a girl who\u2019s kidnapped and\ncalling her now from the boot of the\ncar, and the two communicate trying\nto \ufb01gure out the best solution to this\nlittle problem.\nHere\u2019s an expertly made thriller,\none that cleverly makes use of its\ntight, claustrophobia-inducing space,\nand a highly probable scenario.\nBerry is very convincing at portraying the concerned helper, whereas\nBreslin, making a successful transition from a child star to a potentially\nsuccessful adult actress, is an excellent victim, crying and screaming at\nall the right moments and selling the\nsheer terror. Eklund is the suitably\ncreepy villain who has his own reasons for what he\u2019s doing.\nhings only get problematic in the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s third act, when there is an attempt to turn Berry\u2019s character into\na lone female detective and an eventual action heroine. She does her own\ninvestigation piecing things together,\ncoming to conclusions based on the\nmost ridiculous and absurd clues.\nhe \ufb01nal scene does open things up\nfor a potential sequel: and to this, we\nsay hell yes, go for it.\nNope, that wasn\u2019t a fart\nI\u2019m as mad as hell and I\u2019m not\ngoing to take this anymore!!!!\nYeap, I swallowed...\nWhat was I thinking,\naccepting Catwoman..?\nWe like to drink with Al...!!\n\n"

At the mo-ment, extensive work is still going on,\nand there is much left to do. It is de\ufb01nitely, for all intents and purposes, a\nbuilding site; you have to sign in and\nout and wear a high vis jacket and a\nhard hat.\nFirst of all, the entire inside has been\nstripped down to the bare bones. he\ninternal walls have been knocked\ndown, the toilets removed, and the bar\ntaken out. When you \ufb01rst walk in it is\nhard to get your head around where\neverything used to be. Once you\u2019ve\ngot your bearings you notice that the\nspace looks quite large now. However, the area where the Holland Club\nused to be looks a lot smaller than you\nwould expect.\nhe Project Manager explains where\neverything used to be and what the\ncurrent plan is. He has given up his\ntime and ensured the space is safe for\nus to look around, and for that I am\ngrateful. he entire layout will be \ufb02exible allowing it to be multifunctional.\nhe layout that patrons of the Holland Club remember will not remain\nthe same. he bar counter will be\nmoved to the side that is straight in\nfront of you as you walk in. Perhaps\nthe largest change is that there will\nbe a divider, which will allow for the\naforementioned multifunctionality,\nabout half way across the room. he\nroom will be primarily an open space,\nhowever there will be the ability for\nthe room to be divided when needed.\nWhat could be worrying about this is\nit being always left in just one position\nand so being obsolete \u2013 it would be\nquite an e\ufb00ort to always be opening\nand closing it. he main access point\nwill be moved to inside the Sher\ufb01eld\nbuilding, and the current entrance will\nserve as a \ufb01re exit.\nhere are also extensive renovation works being done on the space in\ngeneral. he windows will be double-glazed for a start; there will also be\nthe addition of new windows for more\nlight. he ventilation, which used to be\nmechanical, is going to be upgraded.\nhis isn\u2019t all that is going on. here\nwill be new activity spaces in the base-ment, which can be booked by post-graduates. At the moment I couldn\u2019t\nbe taken down to see them as they are\nstill being worked on extensively. he\nredevelopment of the Holland Club is\npart of a bigger project to redevelop\nSher\ufb01eld Level 0. Perhaps this hints\nthat the decision was already made\nwell before the campaign to save the\nClub. his could be supported by the\nfact that members of Properties Management and Campus (formerly Commercial) Services were found looking\naround at 7am before the space had\nbeen put out to tender; they said it was\nto update records, which is normally\ndone at 7am without asking anyone\u2019s\npermission I assume...\nI do get the sense that there are people who are working hard to make\nsure this is a going to be a\ngreat space that postgraduates can enjoy. hey do seem\nto be thinking about what\nwill be a good facility, and\nso it doesn\u2019t look like it will\nbe all doom and gloom. hey\nstress to me that the priority\nis to make an attractive facility for sta\ufb00 and postgradu-ates.\nIt is just a shame that the\nHolland Club couldn\u2019t have\nallowed to keep running the\nbar, and generally a bit more\ninvolved in the process. Saying that, the mood boards re\ufb02ect that a pub feel is wanted\nand there has been involvement from the GSA and the\nUnion.\nHolland Club Closure\nhe Holland Club was, in practice, a\npub on campus that postgraduates\nand lecturers would frequent. It had\nbeen inside Sher\ufb01eld for many years.\nAlthough the only way for people who\ndidn\u2019t know of its existence to tell\nwhere it is was the discrete \u201cYoungs\u201d\nsign outside, which has now been re-moved.\nLast academic year, the space that\nthe Holland Club occupied was put\nout to tender after a feasibility study\ninto the use of the space. his e\ufb00ectively closed the Holland Club. his\ncaused widespread dismay and anger\nin the postgraduate and sta\ufb00 commu-nity. here was a petition started to\nsave the Club. After bids from Imperial companies (of which the only real\nheavyweight is Taste Imperial, which\nis the catering arm of Imperial College\nLondon and run by Campus (formerly\nCommercial) Services) the space went\nto Campus Services. he Holland\nClub started bidding but pulled out\nat the second stage, hinting that the\nmain crux of that phase was catering\nand not running a pub. College said\nthat their reason was the need for extra space to meet demands as the food\nservices could not cope with demand\nand that postgraduates wanted extra\nsocial space.\nHolland Club now\nhe Holland Club was essentially a bar\nand not a club or society. his means\nthat taking away its only facility could\nhave made it no longer exist. It was self\ngoverned and run on a not-for-pro\ufb01t\nmodel. he Club has moved locations\nbefore, but College refused to \ufb01nd it\nspace, saying it could book space like\nany other club. Of course they would\nneed something that is completely\ndi\ufb00erent from other clubs\u2019 booking\nneeds (a dedicated bar area etc) as\nthey were a club whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nwas a friendly pub for sta\ufb00 and postgraduates to relax in. Kevin Young,\nthe bar manager who is a\ufb00ectionately\nknown as Kev, has since started a pub\nin Spain. he Holland Club has also\nbeen on tour, taking over various pubs\nin the South Kensington area.\nPhoto credit: Tim Arbabzadah\nFEATURE\nPhoto credit: Save The Holland Club Facebook Page\nTop: A floor plan\nof the layout of\nthe space.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE 29\nLife drawing is an activity that a lot\nof people would like to do, but sometimes don\u2019t dare to. For some, the nudity and sterility of classical art classes\nand the applied attention of overly\nzealous pseudo-artists in the room\ncan be very intimidating, or maybe\nsimply boring. But rejoice, as a new,\nalternative drawing movement has\nbrought Dr. Sketchy to life \u2013 and to\nLondon! Anti-art school promoting\nart for the sake of art and fun, Dr.\nSketchy started in New-York in 2005\nas the brainchild of Molly Crabapple.\nDr. Sketchy events, which have included illegal \ufb02ashmobs to the Museum of\nModern Art, take the snobbism out of\nart to make it available and entertain-ing, to really ignite the creativity in\neveryone. It allows you to release the\nartist in you, whether you\u2019re picking\nup a pen for the \ufb01rst time or you\u2019ve\njust graduated from the Royal Academy. It mixes life drawing with burlesque and cabaret performances, in\na familiar and relaxed setting \u2013 where\ndrinks and cocktails can abound. It is\nsimply the coolest art class you\u2019ll ever\ngo to.\nIn London since 2007, Dr. Sketchy\nhas now nested at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, an institution hailed best\ncabaret venue in 2012 by the London\nCabaret Awards (yes there is such a\nthing!). It is an intimate and well-de-signed space for performances, allowing the audience to grab a drink and\nget comfortable before the entertainment starts.\nLast Wednesday June 19th, we \ufb01rst\nhad the chance to hear Frankie Von\nFlirter\u2019s melodious voice enchant us,\nas she glamorously stripped from her\nevening gown. It was quite hard to decide whether to just look and listen, or\nto try to draw the scene\u2026 Millie Dollar then stepped in for a go-go dance\nand some spectacular nipple tassels\nspinning. Last, Frankie von Flirter\ncame back with a humorous version\nof Top Gun\u2019s best tracks, which turned\ninto a cheeky duet \ufb01nale with the two\nperformers. After each act, the artists\nalso pose and allow us to liberate our\ndrawing spirits, which have been loosened by a few drinks. To my surprise,\nthe performers are not only talented,\nbut also professional when modelling\nfor the crowd. Soon the suaveness of\nthe acts resides, the attraction of nakedness subsides and the audience is\nfully absorbed in furiously scribbling\nto capture the forms on stage.\nCom-pair Ebenezer Valentine\nsmoothens the tone of the evening\nand gives amusing challenges to the\nspectators \u2013 add a monkey in your\ndrawing now! \u2013 as well as little prizes\n(mostly lollies) for the most original\npieces and interesting behaviours. No\nneed to get your proportions right,\nwith completely di\ufb00erent roles. he\nHayward Gallery\u2019s summer exhibition,\nentitled An Alternative Guide to the\nUniverse, aims to bring together \u2018artists and architects, fringe physicists\nand visionary inventors\u2019, who can o\ufb00er\n\u201cbracingly unorthodox perspectives\non the world we live in\u201d. these ideals\nare lofty, but the exhibition falls short,\nespecially when compared to the sublime collection at the Wellcome, and\nthe previously impressive shows the\nHayward has put on.\nLike some of the Japanese artists,\nseveral of the works at the Hayward\nexplore ideas of self-representation;\nLee Goldie, a homeless woman who\ntook photos of herself in various guises (Katherine Hepburn one day, a dirty\ntramp the next) at photobooths, and\nEugene Von Bruenchenhein, whose\nmeticulously arranged portraits of\nhis wife Marie have a surrealist \ufb02air,\nboth put forward the idea that outward appearance directly re\ufb02ects our\npersonality. Cindy Sherman eat your\nheart out. However, while these o\ufb00er\na direct look into a personal universe\ncreated by the artist, the majority of\nthe viewpoints of the artists are simply too convoluted or ridiculous to be\nproperly engaging.\nAliens, \u2018universal energy\u2019, and cosmic\npowers play a large part in the work of\nPaul La\ufb00oley, who I imagine should\nof the Earth doubling in size every 19\nminutes. In the latter is work by Emery Blagdon, whose \u2018electromagnetic\nsculptures\u2019 he believed to be able to\ncure arthritis. While such theories\ncan initially seem amusing, when presented en masse they begin to wear\nextremely thin.\nMuch of the best work of the exhibition is architectural in scope; since the\ncore of the exhibition is the idea of an\nalternate universe, alternative architecture provides an immediate visual\ninvitation while also making good on\nthe Hayward\u2019s promise of creating a\nbetter world.

Other works are completely impressive in scale, such as A.G. Rizzoli\u2019s\ndraftsman-like drawings of buildings\nrepresenting people in his life, but still\nfail to enchant; while Rizzoli\u2019s work is\nengaging, the sheer amount of detail\nmeans that it is impossible to comprehend the information contained in his\npictures (of which the Hayward displays a large number), and leaves the\nviewer feeling like they haven\u2019t fully\nappreciated it.\nScience takes a prominent role in the\nexhibition, and generally falls into one\nof two categories: \u2018believable pseudoscience\u2019, and \u2018complete bull\u2019.

I strongly urge readers to\ngo to at least one of these exhibitions;\nget inside a gallery, and get outside the\nart world.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nMichael Llewellyn-Williams\nMichael Llewellyn-Williams was Editor of Felix 1974-75. He has had a fantastic life since being Felix Editor. He\nhas travelled the world, \u201cmade a tonne\nof money\u201d on the dot com wave, helped\ncreate Archie the Scotch Skeleton,\nworked with everyone from Carling\nBlack Label to NatWest to Visa and\nBMW, written a book, and has had his\nown company since 1998. He currently\nlives in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I\nhad a conversation on Skype with him.\nTA: How did you get involved in Felix?\nMLW: I was Chemistry Dep Rep, so\nI got involved in the Union that way.\nIn my third year I was a \ufb02oor rep on\nCouncil. I made a fuss about internal\ncommunication or lack of it. hat led\nme to stand for position of Editor. One\nguy called Charlie Wrigley who was a\nGuildsman opposed me; and interestingly he withdrew the night before the\nelections. So I got elected with no one\nstanding against\nme.\nTA: Why did\nyou run for\nEditor?\nMLW: Well\nthere was something about it. I\nwas interested\nin writing, I\nwas interested\nin working with\ncreativity and\ndeadlines. hat\nfound expression later in my\ncareer when\nafter my PhD\nI went straight\ninto advertis-ing. Which was\nagain working\nwith creative\npeople and working against deadlines.\nTA: As the Editor of Felix were you\nthen interested in the design aspect\nas well as the writing?\nMLW: I was always interested in the design aspect. I was just never very good\nat it. I was more interested in writing. I\nhad kind of a feel for how I wanted the\npages laid out and the di\ufb00erent permu-tations, but in terms of actually creating art from a blank sheet of paper it\nwas one of those things I would love to\ndo but I just wasn\u2019t very good at it.\nTA: Looking through it I think it\nlooks quite nice!\nMLW: hanks. Understand that in my\nyear it was a big change. Previously\nthe Editor got all his copy together,\ndid a rough layout, then sent it all to a\nprinter in Dursley in Gloucestershire.\nhey \ufb01tted the copy to the space that\nwas there. hen the stu\ufb00 got delivered.\nIt really was just writing and editing in\nthose days, not production.\nhen in 1974 suddenly the Editor had\nto not only do the writing and the editing and put it all together, but he had\nto physically lay out, print, fold, collate\nand distribute the whole a\ufb00air as well.\nhat was a huge change. I don\u2019t know\nif you saw the year before mine. It was\na much bigger format and it was professionally printed. Mine was the \ufb01rst\nyear where we were printing it our-selves. We had a professional printer\nguy called Kyrle Gillespie. He ran the\nmachine and we had a lady called Gill\nwho did the typesetting. But even the\ntypesetting was mechanical, so she had\nto type everything twice: once to get\nthe measure of the column width; and\nthen type it again so it became justi\ufb01ed\n\u2013 \ufb01tting evenly to the column width.\nSo it was very time consuming and the\nproblems we had with just the printer\nwere a nightmare. We had to just get\non and make\nthe best of it.\nTA: Yeah\nI saw you\nsaid how it\nwas the \ufb01rst\ntime you\nchanged to\ni n - h o u s e\nproduction.\nNow we\u2019ve\ns w i t c h e d\nback. We do\nthe design\nand send it\no\ufb00 to printers up in\nCambridge.\nMLW: Well\nI can say I\u2019m\nvery envious.\nTA: Yeah, we\nhave a luxury. We do it on a screen\nand the next day it\u2019s delivered.\nMLW: hat\u2019s fantastic. It was all glue\nand scissors for us.\nTA: Any standout moments and\nachievements from your year that\nyou\u2019re really proud of?\nMLW: I guess several things. When I\n\ufb01rst came into the o\ufb03ce there was this\ncupboard with lots of old issues of Felix\nlying around. I thought who the heck is\ntaking care of all these? And there was\nno rhyme or reason as to why they were\nthere. So I decided to create a library\nof all the past issues and it was then I\ndecided we needed to get these things\npreserved. I even had to go to the College Archivist. And \ufb01nally put together\na complete thing, and I had it bound in\nthe black buckram with the gold letter-ing. So that actually started in my year.\nIt also started a tradition where people\nworking on the newspaper collected\ntheir own issues for that year and had\nthem bound in black buckram as well.\nI\u2019ve still got my own copy and three or\nfour copies for the years after that as I\nwas still there until 1978.\nAlso during my year it was the 25th\nanniversary of the newspaper. So we\nhad a big 25th anniversary dinner. I\nremember Hargreaves who was the\nsecond Editor came over from Holland. He spoke at the dinner but he\ndidn\u2019t really know what he was doing\n- I think he\u2019d had too much sherry. He\nwas \ufb02oundering a bit. I had to help him\nout and that was kind of fun.\nIt was also during that time that one\nof the past Editors wrote back that he\ncouldn\u2019t attend the anniversary dinner \u2013 I think he was in South Africa. In\nhis letter he talked about keeping Felix\nfree, as it used to have a cover price of\nsix (old) pence. hey had fought for it to\nbe free to students so it got subsidised\nby the Union. Anyway, this past Editor\nsigned o\ufb00 his letter with \u201cKeep the cat\nfree\u201d. It was something that stuck with\nus. At that point it was about the cover\nprice. And that\u2019s where the motto came\nfrom.\nhe other things were instead of just\nreporting the news, we tried to create\nsome news. I don\u2019t know if the Felix\nMotor Rally is something you still have\nbut we started that. hat was enormous fun.\nWe also had a Felix photo competi-tion, which was fun too. he other\nthing we decided to do was to create a\nclub. So we created the Felix Club. And\nsomehow mixed in with that was creation of the Felix coat of arms.\nTA: One that is now relevant. Don\u2019t\nknow how it was then. With the internet now, Twitter etc. Every year\nthere is something that explodes a\nlot. How about complaints, did you\nget many?\nMLW: Oh God yes. One of the guys\nwho was working for me; he actually\nbecame Editor a few years later. He was\na bit of an opportunist. An assistant\neditor but wanted to do his own thing\ninstead of being part of a team. A pain\nin the neck really. here was some reason I had to let him go. Hoped he did\nwell as he was helping setting up IC Radio, but he just went o\ufb00 the deep end,\nbig time. He wasn\u2019t a happy bunny. He\nwrote these vitriolic letters every week,\nwhich we all sat around and laughed at\nin the Union Bar. He was a one-man\nhate mail machine. It got very silly\n(laughs). Just went on and on and on.\nhe other thing was we were getting\ncriticised for not having enough news\ncontent in the newspaper. his was\nparticularly in the \ufb01rst term. As the\nprinting production was such a night-mare. here were several times when\nwe didn\u2019t think we could get the newspaper out.\nhe big production night was hurs-day. One of those hursday nights I remember it being 2am and the printing\nmachine had broken down. he printer\nwas saying \u201cit\u2019s the spring, it\u2019s broken,\nand we can\u2019t \ufb01nd another spring at\nthis time of night.\u201d I was despondent\nand looking at my desk, and it had an\nangle-poise lamp on it. hey operate\nwith springs. So I said, \u201cHold on a min-ute, what about this spring here?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look\u201d and then we\n\ufb01tted this spring from the angle-poise\nlamp into the printing machine and it\nworked. So \ufb01nally we were able to \ufb01nish printing and at 5am we were delivering newspapers at the di\ufb00erent drop\no\ufb00 points around the college.\nTA: Same hours now, just in a slightly di\ufb00erent way. In front of a computer not a printing press! Did your\nyear as Editor prepare you for your\nfuture career at all?\nMLW: I think it did have an impact on\nwhat I subsequently did. I recall at the\nend of my 3rd year in chemistry, I had\nthree choices: either doing Felix as the\nEditor; accepting one of the jobs I\u2019d\nbeen o\ufb00ered in marketing departments\nin various companies; or doing a PhD\nin polymer physical chemistry. I remember thinking \u201cWhich one should\nI do?\u201d In the end I said why not do all\nthree? So that\u2019s how it worked out.\nAfter Felix and the PhD, I then\nlooked at advertising as a career as I\nthought it might be fun and I might be\nable to hook up with nice looking girls,\nwhich, er, I did \u2013 a lot. One ad agency\nwas called BMP. hey were trying to\nbring some science to advertising. So I\nremember contacting them and I guess\nI was lucky. hey had something like\n3500 applicants and only hired 3 peo-ple. I was fortunate enough to be one of\nEx-Editor interviews\nthose. he rest they say is history.\nI do freelance work for various clients now.

Basically I help companies,\nbig and small, to de\ufb01ne how they want\nto be perceived in the future, and then\nturning that into reality.\nI\u2019ve found over the years that I\u2019ve developed a good balance between left-and right-brain thinking, between analytical and creative thought processes.\nAnd you know I think my time at Imperial was very helpful in both those\nareas: the science itself and the creative\ncraziness of editing Felix!\nTA: hank you so much for giving up\nso much of your time!\nMLW: Check out my website when you\nget a moment: www.brandmechanics.\ncom\n+ G \u0001 \u0012\u0018\u0012\u0001 # / & ! \u001e 6 \u0001 \u0010 \u0012 1 %\u0001 ' 2 + \" \u0001 \u0010\u0018\u0016\u0014\u0001\n\u001c'\u0004&\u0001\u0015\u0018\u0018!\u0001\u0014\u0001\n\u0015\u001c'\u0016\u001b\u0001\"\u0019\u0001 \u0014\u0001,\u0018\u0014%\u0001\u0002\u0001\n'\u001b\u0018\u0001 \u0014\u0016\u0014\u0017\u0018 \u001c\u0016\u0001 >2>>6;:\u0001 \u0011\u0010\u000e\b\u0010\u000f\u0001 B688\u0001 >@=28D\u0001 4;\u0001 1;B:\u0001\n6:\u0001 ?52\u0001 .::.8>\u0001 ;3\u0001 \u001c\u0016\u0001 (:6;:\u0004>\u0001 56>?;=D\u0001 .>\u0001 ;:2\u0001 =2:;B:21\u0001 3;=\u0001 6?>\u0001\n><.>9;160\u0001 ;@?/=2.7>\u0001 ;3\u0001 \u0003/6?056:4\u0003\u0001 62\u0001 0=6?606>9\u0001 A2=46:4\u0001 \u0005;:\u0001\n;00.>6;:\u0006\u0001 ?;B.=1>\u0001 5;>?686?D \u0001\n1 @ A K\u0001 <G=K\u0001 FGL\u0001 E=9F\u0001 LG\u0001\nKM??=KL\u0001 L@9L\u0001 9 D D\u0001L@=\u0001@GKLAD=\u0001\n; J A L A ; A K E K\u0001 O@A;@\u0001 @9N=\u0001 9HH=9J=<\u0001\n@9N=\u0001 :==F\u0001 ADD >GMF<=< \u0001 &F<==<\u0001\n@A<<=F\u0001 9EGF?KL\u0001 EM;@\u0001 G>\u0001L@=\u0001\nJ @ = L G J A ;\u0001 ; 9 F\u0001 :=\u0001 > G M F <\u0001\n>MF<9E=FL9D\u0001 <=:9LAF?\u0001 HGAFLK\u0001\nO@A;@\u0001 J=>D=;L\u0001 9\u0001 ?=FMAF=\u0001;GF;=JF\u0001\nOAL@\u0001 J=?9J<\u0001 LG\u0001 9\u0001 H9JLA;MD9J\u0001\nLGHA;\u0001 \u0001\n1@=\u0001 AKKM=\u0001 LG\u0001:=\u0001 J9AK=<\u0001 A K\u0001\nL@AK\u0019\u0001 (42>6=8B8=6\u0001 58ABC;H\u0001 C74\u0001\n103\u0001 544;8=6\u0001 F7827\u0001 \u000318C278=6\u0003\u0001\nF8;;\u0001 8=4E8C01;H\u0001 2A40C4\u0001 0=3\u0001\nB42>=3;H\u0001 C74\u0001 502C\u0001 C70C\u0001 8=\u0001C74\u0001\n<09>A8CH\u0001 >5\u0001 8=BC0=24B\b\u0001 8=\u0001C74\u0001\n?0BC\u0001 H40A\u0001 C74\u0001 2>=CA>E4ABH\u0001 F0B\u0001\nB4CC;43\u0001 0<8201;H\b\u0001 C74=\u0001 8B\u0001 8C\u0001\n0;F0HB\u0001 =424BB0AH\u0001 C>\u0001 A08B4\u0001 C74\u0001\n38B?DC4\u0001 8=\u0001 ?D1;82\u0017\u0001\n1@=J=\u0001 AK\u0001=NA<=F;=\u0001 LG\u0001KMHHGJL\u0001\nL@=\u0001 NA=O\u0001 L@9L\u0001AL\u0001A K\u0001L@=\u0001 \u0003 H M : D A ; \u0003\u0001\n9KH=;L\u0001 G>\u0001 L@=\u0001 <AKHML=\u0001 ;GMHD=<\u0001\nOAL@\u0001 L@=\u0001 @GKLAD=\u0001 L=JEK\u0001 A F\u0001\nO@A;@\u0001 9 F\u0001 GL@=JOAK=\u0001 \u0003 > 9 A J \u0003\u0001\n;GEE=FL\u0001 A K\u0001KGE=LAE=K\u0001;GM;@=<\u0001\nO@A;@\u0001 A K\u0001;9H9:D=\u0001 G>\u0001 <GAF?\u0001 L@=\u0001\nEGKL\u0001 <9E9?= \u0001\n!MJAF?\u0001 L@=\u0001 H9K\u0001L\u0001 Q=9J\u0001L@=\u0001\n# \" 2 5\u0001 #4CC4AB\u0001 \u001a>;D<=\u0001 @ 9 K\u0001\n:==F\u0001 L@=\u0001K;=F=\u0001 G>\u0001 ; J A L A ; A K E K\u0001\n:GL@\u0001 ; G F K L J M ; L A N =\u0001 9 F <\u0001\n<=KLJM;LAN= \u0001 EAD<\u0001 9F<\u0001N=@=E=FL \u0001\n4@ADKL\u0001 MF<GM:L=<DQ\u0001L@=\u0001 GDMEF\u0001\n@9K\u0001 :==F\u0001 D A N = D Q\u0001 9 F <\u0001=FL=J\nL9AFAF?

You\nfind a willing recipient and\nsuck enthusiastically. Your\ngag reflex takes over and you\nvomit all over his penis. Practice makes perfect\u2026\nThis week you develop a cutlery fetish. You visit your grandparents so you can get randy\nwith their best silverware, but\nbecome jealous when you see\nyour granny licking jelly off a\ndessert spoon. So you turn\nto your trusty spork. It may be\nflimsy, but at least you have\na choice between probing\nprongs and smooth scraping.\nThis week you perfect the art of\nlucid dreaming.

One\nproblem: when you nap in lectures everyone hears you sleep-moaning about \u2018Keith\u2019.\nThis week you visit your\nchildhood rabbit\u2019s grave.\nYou tenderly dig him up and\ngently slide your thumb into\nhis anus; it\u2019s cold and mag-goty but still strangely com-forting. You reminisce about\nthe good times you had with\nbunny in the raspberry patch\nwhen you could fit 3 fingers\nin\u2026 He taught you so much.\nThis week you are curious to\nknow what your clitoris tastes\nlike. You can\u2019t reach it as it\nis, so hack a bit off and fry it\nup with some lady juices. It\u2019s\ncuriously salty and you wish\nyou\u2019d showered off the sweat\nbeforehand. Nevertheless,\nit\u2019s not unpalatable and there\nare plenty more folds left to\ntry\u2026\nThis week it\u2019s the end of\nterm. Why don\u2019t you get embarrassingly drunk, take as\nmany drugs as you can get\nyour hands on and sleep with\nall your friends? Everyone will\nhave forgotten how badly you\ngurn by week 3 of their mind-numbing internship and a\nfew more notches to your\nbedpost. Nothing to lose!\nThis week you are celebrating the end of exams at the\nUnion when you see the girl\nyou are in love with. You\ndown a few more pints to\ngive you the courage to ask\nher out, but forget what a\nlightweight you are and pass\nout at her feet. She ignores\nyou, but that\u2019s better than re-jection, right?\nThis week you are desperate\nfor drugs but are not \u2018street\u2019\nenough know any dealers.\nSo you buy a tracksuit and\n\u2018swagger\u2019 over to your nearest\nestate. You approach the first\nperson you see and politely\nask if \u2018they\u2019ve seen Mandy anywhere?\u2019 Turns out their daughter is called Mandy and they\nthink you\u2019re a paedo. Nice one.\nThis week you\u2019re so hungover\nyou can\u2019t get out of bed, so\nyou puke over your teddy bear\nand cuddle their sticky fur in re-morse. It turns out you\u2019re semi-blind from alcohol poisoning\nand you just vomited all over\nthehairygirlyoubroughthome.\nShe wakes up and voms over\nyou too, and you spoon in your\nmingled stomach contents.\nThis week you become allergic\nto your own penis, and it becomes red and itchy as the autoimmune disease develops.\nOn the plus side, the inflammation has added considerable girth. Soon starts to slough\noff and eventually all you are\nleft with is a few pubey scraps\nof dangling dead skin flapping\nredundantly by your balls.\nThis week you hide in a cupboard in your course examiner\u2019s office, waiting for an opportune moment to correct the\nexam you fucked up, but you\u2019re\ndesperate for the loo.

Indeed, although\nthe venerable imprints of the likes of\nIncus, Emanem, and Psi continue to\npublish new editions, it\u2019s now largely\narchive material, apparently corroborating Bailey\u2019s pessimistic outlook on\nthe state of the art.\nHaving largely grown out of jazz\nmusic, free improvisation has always\nstruggled to completely break free of\ntradition. Bailey wrote that \u201cDiversity\nis [free improvisation\u2019s] most consistent characteristic \u2026 [its] characteristics are established only by the sonic\nmusical identity of the person(s) playing it\u201d. In theory then, this allows for\nlimitless new possibilities and gives\nno indication of what the listener\nshould expect from when listening to\nfree improvisation. In practice this is\nnot the case. he failure (consciously\nor not) of many improvisers to completely break ties with jazz has lead to\na certain tacit codi\ufb01cation of how free\nimprovisation should sound, directly\ncontradicting the idiom-free nature of\nthe art that Bailey and his contemporaries were working towards. Even the\ninstruments used are a contributing\nfactor, \u201cYou cannot play a saxophone\nand not make it sound like jazz [ex-cept maybe Steve Lacy and Anthony\nBraxton]\u201d, quipped Bailey.\nIn 2013 it\u2019s a little easier to be more\noptimistic about the state of the art,\nparticularly with the success of venues like Cafe OTO in Dalston, which\nsince its inception in 2008 has been\n\u201c\nI\na cornerstone of London\u2019s apparently\nstill burgeoning free improvisation\nscene. More evidence that free improvisation isn\u2019t dead yet came last\nyear when the London-based label\nFataka launched, dedicated to issuing\nbrand new recordings of improvised\nmusic.\nAmongst Fataka\u2019s most recent editions is Prediction and Warning, a\ndocument of a 2011 meeting between\nveteran improvisers Ikue Mori and\nSteve Noble, both at various times\nmembers of Bailey\u2019s \u201cCompany\u201d, an\nin\ufb02uential collective of improvisers in\nthe 70s and 80s, but who only played\nas a duo for the \ufb01rst time in 2010 at\nCafe OTO.\nMori\u2019s musical life started in the early 80s as a drummer for the in\ufb02uential\nNo Wave band, DNA. After the group\nsplit she kept her ties with the New\nYork downtown scene and under the\nin\ufb02uence of John Zorn started developing her individual voice as a computer music improviser, initially with\ndrum machines and later purely using software such as Pure Data. Since\nthen her collaborators have included\nChristian Marclay, Elliott Sharp,\nZeena Parkins, Catherine Jauniaux\nand Bill Laswell. Her sound as a laptop improviser is typically percussive,\ngranular, glitchy, and fractured but in\nits more placid moments draws in\ufb02uence from drone and ambient music.\nNoble has been a mainstay drummer on the London improvisation\nscene for the last thirty years and has\nreleased several dozen recordings,\nlargely with fellow London based im-provisers such as Lol Coxhill, John\nEdwards, Alex Ward, and of course\nDerek Bailey. His highly idiosyncratic approach to drums involves heavy\nuse of preparations such as small\nchinas or other objects placed on the\ndrum heads to produce a massive\nvariety of unexpected sounds from a\nrelatively small kit. He resists keeping\ntime but is not unwilling to make occasional brief hints at a groove.\nTogether their voices synthesise\ninto one intense crystalline form, apparently with a life of their own, never\npredictable, and constantly evolving.\n\u2018Seismic Waves\u2019 lives up to its name,\nopening the album with a euphoric\ntumult of percussion which continues\nto boil and seeth over its six minute\nduration only barely settling down\ntowards its end. From here, the \ufb02ow\nof ideas is absolutely unrelenting\nand largely resistant to description\nin words or comparison with existing improvisers. his is precisely the\nhallmark of a piece of excellent and\nrefreshing free improvisation.\nSome of the busier pieces could be\ncriticised for having little to di\ufb00erentiate them, although with repeated\nlistenings their abstract nature does\nstart to become more decipherable,\nand one can recognise sheer amount\nof variety present in these eight\npieces. hings cool down brie\ufb02y on\nthe eleven minute \u2018Land of Famine\u2019\nwhich opens with Noble taking a bow\nto his cymbals and the pair allowing\ntheir sounds to stretch out a bit more\nbefore the duo\u2019s energy refuses any\nAMS album of the week\nThe World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am\nNo Longer Afraid to Die are an emo\nband. To some people, admitting to liking emo is something to be shared only\nin hushed tones to well trusted close\nfriends. However, I\u2019ve spent long enough\nin the emo closet, I\u2019m coming out. Emo\nis the best. Some of you might be having a bit of a snigger about that: you\u2019re\nan idiot. People who still think emo is all\nfloppy fringes and self harm are missing\nout on a world of fantastic music. Listen\nto this album and you will find your entire world torn asunder.\nWhenever, If Ever takes the calculated precise midwest emo of Sunny Day\nReal Estate and mixes in the lush landscapes of God is an Astronaut and the\ndynamic manipulations of Explosions in the Sky. It\u2019s intense on every level.\nLyrically, well it\u2019s emo, so it\u2019s, you know, emotional. \u2018Pictures of a Tree that\nDoesn\u2019t Look Okay\u2019 is about a forest in winter, and it\u2019s just beautifully written,\nthe highlight being the line \u201cA thousand frozen trees but still there\u2019s something\nburning\u201d. \u2018Gig Life\u2019 is the most poetic song I\u2019ve ever heard about being on tour,\nand there\u2019s plenty more I don\u2019t have enough space to discuss. Musically, this\nalbum is also spot on. There\u2019s always something extra to keep the attention,\na violin here, a synth there, a little bit of trumpet over this bit, but even at it\u2019s\ndensest it doesn\u2019t sound cluttered. This album took a few years to put together\nand it shows, every second is necessary. The undoubted highlight is \u2018Getting\nSodas.\u2019 7 minutes allows the post-rock side to really express itself, and that\u2019s\na great thing. This song ticks all the boxes. Instrumentally, it\u2019s one of the most\naffecting post-rock tracks written in the last decade or so. The lyrics are just as\ngood, the pinnacle being the life affirming \u201cThe world is a beautiful place but\nwe have to make it that way\u201d and the final \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid to die, then so am I\u201d.\nI think everyone should give emo a chance, and this album is a fantastic example of the genre. It is the antithesis of the style over substance attitude of the\nlikes of Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance. It is emotion and passion put\nto tape. So give it a try, and if you still want to snigger about emo then go ahead,\nbut idiots should at least be well informed.\nThe World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die\nWhenever, If Ever\nStuart Masson\nlonger to remain constrained and the\npiece reaches a thundering crescendo\nin the \ufb01nal minute.\nSo while perhaps there has been a\ntendency over the last thirty years towards a slight codi\ufb01cation of what is\nto be expected by free improvisation,\nhere\u2019s a highly original meeting proving that there are still many surprises\nin store. Let\u2019s hope that the likes of Fataka and Cafe OTO will continue help\nthese new voices \ufb01nd their way to the\nears of the public. Maybe free improvisation\u2019s great era isn\u2019t over \u2013 perhaps\nit\u2019s still just getting warmed up.\nhe duo play Dalston\u2019s Cafe OTO on\nMonday 24th July, alongside a solo\nperformance by pianist Pat homas\nwho released an excellent new solo\nalbum entitled \u201cAl-Khwarizmi Variations\u201d earlier this year, also on Fataka.\nhttp://www.fataka.net\nTogether their voices\nsynthesise into one intense crystalline form,\napparently with a life\nof their own, never pre-dictable, and constantly\nevolving.\n\u201d\nntly with a life\nntly with a life\nr own, never pre-r own, never pre-e, and constantly\n, and constantly\ng.\nLove listening to sick\ntunes?\nWant to be Music Editor\nnext year?\nEasy, email:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\nTogether their\nTogether the\nsynthesise into o\nsynthesise into o\ntense crystalline\ntense crystalline\nappare\nappar\n\u201d\n\u201d\nntly with\nntly w\nwith\nw\n\n"

Don\u2019t\nlet the hotpants fool you \u2013 the Pole Soc\ngirls (and guys!) routinely bust out human \ufb02ags and the exposed skin is used\nfor grip.\nAnyone walking into Metric last\nhursday night would have been met\nby an unusual sight as the society\nturned the nightclub into a pole studio in preparation for their summer\nshowcase. he lineup included three\nroutines written by the Pole Soc Committee, as well as having poles on hand\nto let attendees give it a go. he night\nstarted o\ufb00 well with a good turnout\nand the drinks \ufb02owing as the performers warmed up \u2013 three girls and\none man down to their short shorts in\nMetric.\nhe \ufb01rst performance kicked o\ufb00 at\n9 with Jessica Haddon and Annabel\nKeeler strutting their stu\ufb00 in a re-choreographed version of the society\nroutine from the ICSM fashion show\nearlier this year. he routine ran seam-lessly with the two girls performing\non just one pole alternating strength\nmoves with careful, elegant dance and\nchoreography, with a small slip-up at\nthe end was betrayed only by the girls\nbeing unable to contain their laughter.\nhis was followed at 9.30 by a synchro-nised routine by Jessica and Esther\nBerry, this year\u2019s President.\nhe \ufb01nal routine of the night saw\nEsther performing opposite her presidential replacement and the only male\nmember of the society, Maths fresher Ben Howitt. he routine started\nwell, with graceful dance moves from\nEsther and an impressive show of\nstrength from Ben that left all the men\nin the room green with envy. However,\nas they progressed through the fast-paced routine into their double superman \u2013 a move in which both dancers\nlay \ufb02at in the classic \u2018superman\u2019 pose,\nsupporting their weight between their\nlegs \u2013 the worst thing possible hap-pened. he pole collapsed. Ben, who\nwas around 2.5m from the ground at\nthe time, saw the top coming away\nfrom the ceiling and leaped to safety.\nhe pole then came away completely,\nsmashing into a lighting cage which\nslowed its fall, before coming crashing\ndown onto the stage. his saved it from\nlanding squarely on Esther, who was\n1.5m up. She hit the ground directly\nunderneath the fallen pole.\nAs a stunned silence resounded\naround the room, the Union Stewards\nand Committee sprang into action.\nhankfully the two performers had\nescaped merely bruised and shocked,\nand they decided to \ufb01nish what they\nhad started. According to one, \u201cif we\nhadn\u2019t powered through, I think I\u2019d\nhave had real trouble getting back on\na pole again. You tell yourself it will\nnever happen, and when it does \u2026 it\nwas terrifying\u201d. It was decided to complete the routine upstairs in their usual\npractice room of the Union Gym. Almost the entire audience turned out to\nsee the explosive routine \ufb01nished o\ufb00,\ngiving a great end to an eventful even-ing. Some spectators even said they\nfelt the performance upstairs was bet-ter, as they could see the moves more\nclearly, as well as appreciating the\nmore extreme aspects of the sport!\nhe issue was Metric itself; the seemingly solid steel girder in the ceiling the\npole was attached to had become slick\nwith that particular Metric grime and\ncondensed sweat causing the pole to\nslip o\ufb00. Perhaps nightclubs are not the\nbest place for pole dancing after all.\nBlood, sweat and hotpants\nEsther Berry Pole Soc President\nMetric turns on Pole Soc for a dramatic end to their Summer Showcase\nAll photos courtesy of James Cronshaw.

Maxed out on oil again.\u201d \u2013 Me,\nwhen playing Oil Rush. Oil Rush is an\ninteresting take on the real time strategy genre. It is a naval strategy game\nthat takes place in the future, where\nnuclear war has melted the polar ice\ncaps leaving little habitable land on\nthe planet. As such, many people live\neither on ships or on platforms that\nhave been built in the sea.\nStrategy in the game focuses around\nclaiming and holding platforms in the\nocean. here are two main types of\nplatforms: oil rigs and unit construction platforms; the latter being further\ndivided by which unit the platform\nprovides. As such, the map is simply\nthe placement of these platforms, the\ntypes of platforms, and small sections\nof land that block sea passage.\nEach oil rig will produce as much\noil as it can, until the maximum of\n500 has been reached, and each unit\nconstruction platform will construct\nthe relevant unit until the population\nlimit has been reached. Note: it does\nnot cost anything to produce units\n(presumably oil is the only resource\nthat is limited, and no oil is needed to\nbuild these units).\nhis is one of two methods that the\ndesigners have employed to attempt\nto eliminate micromanagement in the\ngame. he other method is unit selection \u2013 instead of selecting units individually the player selects a platform,\ncombination of types of units, and\nthen what percentage of them he/she\nwants. he game automatically chooses the \u2018best\u2019 combination.\nBoth of these methods are very effective in completing their goal \u2013 the\ngame is very much focused on the\nbig picture. However, this does mean\nthat the player loses control. What if\nyou want to send the already weakened unit to get itself killed distracting the enemy while sending the one\nat full health to capture a platform?\nhe game doesn\u2019t know which attack\nthe player cares more about, and thus\nmay send bad combinations of units.\nhere is another very important difference between the two main types of\nplatform, which is that oil rigs must be\ndefended by units, whereas unit construction platforms can have towers\nbuilt around them for defence (tow-ers cost oil, and are the main thing\nthat you\u2019ll use which do so). his leads\nto the main strategic choices in the\ngame: how many units to leave behind\nwhilst you send the rest to capture the\nremainder of the platforms.\nAnd herein lies the main problem\nwith this game. Whilst fun, there is\nvery little strategic gameplay to be\nfound. I can quite easily beat the normal AI simply by capturing and keeping two or three oil rigs, and then\nsending a large force to attack all of\nthe unit construction platforms one\nby one. Some strategy is added by the\nfact that oil rigs cannot be defended,\nand there are also special powers\nthat players can use (decrease enemy\ndamage for x seconds, increase ar-mour, etc) which increase the strategy\nsomewhat as well. In addition to this,\nthe fact that no unit or tower can be\nhealed and each take time to be rebuilt\nadds something to this.\nHowever, the fact remains that the\nmost e\ufb00ective strategy is simply to\nleave behind very few units and attack\nas fast as possible.\nhere are two factions presented\nat the beginning of the campaign (ef-fectively rebels and empire), but by\nthe looks of things, these factions are\nentirely identical in terms of units and\nabilities \u2013 they exist in the game world\npurely to allow plot hooks. his is\nsomewhat disappointing, as most real\ntime strategy games give at least three\nfactions all of which play di\ufb00erently,\nlook di\ufb00erent and have a variety of\nsub-strategies, such as Starcraft or the\nCommand and Conquer series. his\nmay have been done simply because\nOil Rush is quite di\ufb00erent strategically\nfrom most other games in this genre,\nhowever.\nhe music and graphics are both\nhigh quality and very appropriate for\nthe game. In particular, the plane and\nship models are really very detailed.\nhe main campaign is very e\ufb00ective at\ntaking you through the main unit types\nand strategies, though it does feel a bit\nlike a very long tutorial. hings never\nreally pick up. In addition to this there\nis simply a \ufb01xed set of missions as opposed to, like in Dawn of War: Soulstorm (I was trying to forget about that\nexpansion. Curse you! \u2013 Games Ed.), a\nseries of missions where the outcome\nof the last e\ufb00ects the next. Or Rome:\nTotal War where there is a large scale\ncampaign map as a turn based strategy game followed by individual real\ntime battles. he addition of this kind\nof campaign would add a great deal to\nthe replayability of this game.\nOverall, I quite enjoyed this game\nbut I don\u2019t think it would have been\nthe cost if I\u2019d have bought it at full\nprice. Oil Rush is available from Steam\nor Desura now for \u00a312.99, but I\u2019d advise you to wait for the next Steam sale\nif you want to get it.\nSanchit Sharma\nOil, oil everywhere...\nGAMES SPORT\nCave Johnson\nHello exploitable summer test subjects,\nCave Johnson here.\nI expect that some of you missed me,\nand to be fair, who wouldn\u2019t? After those\nchildren at Black Mesa realised it was\nme waging incendiary citrus warfare\nagainst them, I\u2019ve had to lie low for a bit.\nWhilst we were away, the UROP\nstudents that we kidnapped however,\nthought up another new method for\ngenerating in\ufb01nite energy. his time,\nthere\u2019s less of the screaming, and none\nof the paperwork to \ufb01ll out. he downside is that is quite ine\ufb03cient, for an in\ufb01nite energy source, and we\u2019re running\nout of intact UROP students to devise\nany improvements.\nSo, I\u2019m extending a special o\ufb00er to the\nbored, fully-limbed students of Imperial.

In addition to\nthe standard: free healthcare, every\ninsurance you can name, time o\ufb00 for\nkids, reimbursed education, free legal advice etc, Google goes over and\nbeyond for its employees: free mas-sages/haircuts/gourmet food, sleeping pods and even an ice hockey rink\nand horseshoe pit in the workplace.\nOh, and if you ever have the urge to\ndo an Oscar Pistorius, make sure they\nwork at Google \u2013 if a Google employee dies their spouse gets half their salary for a decade. Basically, I wouldn\u2019t\nbe surprised if the company went to\nthe extent to pay for free escorts so\nemployees could look like they have\nhot girlfriends and would have a petting zoo every day of the year (rather\nthan one day to distress exam ridden\nstudents).\nIt\u2019s no surprise that their employees\nare happy. But combine this with a\npolicy that all engineers must spend\n20% of their time on a personal pro-ject, with 100% full autonomy, and\nyou get a crazy range of fascinating,\nuseful and sometimes pointless in-novations. hese include: GoogleAds,\nGmail, Plus, Maps, Streetview, Translate, Goggles etc.\nSo what have Google actually done\nover the last 12 months and what\nabout their future? Well, basically, it\u2019ll\nget a whole lot more evasive into your\npersonal space, but that\u2019s most de\ufb01nitely a good thing. It just means we\u2019ll\nbe able to do more and at the same\ntime be lazier.\nGoogle\u2019s driverless cars for example are completely legal and in use all\nover California.

Whilst this may be somewhat rudimentary, I\u2019ve really found labels to be an incredible source of new sounds in the year so far. I had to make a big e\ufb00ort to limit some of\nmy favourite labels from this period (e.g. Opal Tapes, Blackest Ever Black) to just one record. Consequently, I would highly recommend looking at a label\u2019s entire output if you like the release given in the list. I\nam unsure whether this has been a particularly good year for dark music or an awful year for me personally, but my picks from this year have been dominated by lo-\ufb01, dark, industrial sounds, and so wherever\npossible I have avoided using this description for the works. Instead I have tried to focus on what it is that makes them stand out within this (surprisingly) tightly themed block.\nPaul Jebanasam\nRites\nThere\u2019s something quite religious about Rites, with the kind\nof cavernous echoes \u2013 so effectively utilised (to the extent\nof really being the theme of the work) by label mates Emptyset \u2013 being combined with slow, choral vocals to produce\nan entirely indescribable wash of complete catharsis in the\nopening track. The peaceful, if emotionally affecting, opening\npassages soon fade out into growling, industrial sounds that\none might expect to see from The Haxan Cloak. Throughout,\nheart-tugging strings contrast against mechanical crunching\nand pulsing; I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s really any statement to that\nbut it certainly can put you down in a hole. Not one for the\nsummer listeners, but certainly a blinder for Subtext\u2019s roster.\nThe Haxan Cloak\nExcavation\nShapednoise\nTheDayOfRevenge\nAlexander Lewis\nALuminousVeil\nLumigraph\nNauticallyInclined\nRoss Gray offers dark obscurities and a dreamy indie release\nSimilar to Rites in its approach and crushing bleakness, it was\na pretty tough toss-up for which should take the top spot.\nWhilst Rites is dominated by beautiful structures occasionally decimated (to great effect) by industrial crunch, Excavation is an all-out, bass-heavy assault on the ear drum. Utilising\nthe bleak, symphonic ambient found in his body of work thus\nfar, Haxan adds to the previous terror found throughout his\nreleases with the aforementioned massive basslines \u2013 surely\nnot produced by orchestral means \u2013 that draw a great deal\nfrom dubstep. The thin structure makes each element aurally\narresting, and the introduction of weird spoken word samples in foreign languages builds upon the terrified confusion\ninstilled from the opening of the first track.\n\u2013\nIt seems to be a common assertion that a year was a \u2018good year for music.\u2019 As a teenager, I saw patterns, like many of the classic thrash artists releasing their opuses in 1986. Recently though,\nI\u2019ve discovered this idea to be a total fallacy. Thousands of amazing albums drop every year and 2013 is certainly no different. Weeks of combined total listening time painstakingly produced\nthis list. Think of it as a stationary representation of a list constantly in flux. The ordering is a little arbitrary. For example, Groupshow may be one of the least artistically accomplished here\nbut it\u2019s also the most loved and listened to. What I can assure you is that, love or hate, all of these people are doing something really captivating in their respective, mainly ambient, fields.\nGroupshow\nLive At Skymall\nGroupshow is a collaborative project of Berlin based musicians:\nHanno Leichtmann, Jan Jilinek and Andrew Pekler, who have\nall found acclaim separately. While I am normally not a fan of\nlive albums, when a formidable jam like 4-part opener \u2018Countdown To Naptime\u2019 presents itself, it\u2019s hard to resist. The album\nis essentially pedal driven electronica, enveloped in a warm\nanaloguehum.There\u2019salsoacomplexmixofkrautrock,jazzand\neven some glitch tendencies (especially on \u2018Pet Hair Magnet\u2019)\ninvolvedaswell.Thealbumisinsanelycatchythroughout,some\nserious grooves in what must have been a hell of a show. While\nit has artistic merit of its own, Live At Skymall features mainly\nbecause I\u2019ve found it utterly impossible to stop listening to.\nSvarte Greiner\nBlackTie\nMachinefabriek\nDoepferWorm\nMain\nAblation\nRiaz Agahi giveshispersonalfavouritesfromambientandothergenres\nFelix music present the best of the\nAlthough I initially thought it to be the guy\u2019s name, Svarte\nGreiner is actually a project of Erik K Skodvin, who is one\nhalf of duo Deaf Center, as well as being the S in B/B/S with\nAidan Baker and Andrea Belfi, releasing the also excellent\nBrick Mask this year. His work as Svarte Greiner is normally\nlabelled acoustic doom, which is pretty accurate. In fact, his\nwork has elements of classical, with what sounds like a string\nsection, especially on \u2018White Noise.\u2019 Doomy elements are certainly present, particularly on the first side. There is also a hint\nof jazz, and Black Tie at times recalls the likes of The Mount\nFuji Doomjazz Corporation but the main focus is ambient. It\ncan be heard how \u2018White Noise\u2019 devolves into what is virtually a pure tone. A gripping, dread-filled thrill of an album.\nIt took me about 5 listens to get into The Day of Revenge. It\u2019s\nnot really easy going material, refusing to be pinned down\nin one hole; too poppy for those into noise, too abrasive for\nthose not. I recommend you stick with it, as this is quite likely\nthe most inventive album I\u2019ve heard so far in 2013. A punishing soundscape is held consistently despite the wide variety\nof styles implemented throughout, from the empty, macabre\nand industrial ambient so common on this list to chopped,\nbeatless (yet intensely rhythmic) powernoise. Shapednoise\nalso collaborates with fellow label co-founder Violet Poison\nas Violetshaped, which is a marginally more restrained affair.\nRagingoutofBlackestEverBlack\u2019sincredible2013stableasamutantchildofFuck Buttons andKevin Drumm,thisphenomenal\ndebuttakespulsingsynthesiserlinesdriventhroughentiretracks\nand rips them apart with huge stabs of noise and distorted, disturbed vocal samples (check \u2018She Demands Attention\u2019), to build\ninto a droning hellish miasma with just a hint of accessibility.\nDeerhunter\nMonomania\nAn element of the dreamy sheen that permeated Deerhunter\u2019s discography has been exchanged for pop sensibilities,\nwith the vocals more prominent and melodies more distinct\non Monomania. They\u2019ve become more Pavement from their\nprevious My Bloody Valentine. Whilst I was a big fan of that\nhazy ambience, particularly on Cryptograms, the sheer catchi-ness of this record has lead to me coming back time after time.\nThisrepresentsthequintessentialOpalTapesreleasesofarthis\nyear for me, which is quite a noteworthy accolade considering\nthe strength of their output.

Trust no-one, shoot anyone who\ngets in your way, preferably in the\nface, and walk away having completed your mission.\nIt moves at a ridiculously quick\npace, picking o\ufb00 one bad guy after\nanother from a long list: Sly\u2019s side-kick, Sung Kang, playing a police of\ufb01cer, has a knack for tracking people\ndown with just a phone call. here\u2019s\nfriction initially, as James Bonomo\n(Stallone) is an assassin hired to hunt\ndown and mercilessly kill for money,\nwhereas Tyler Kwon (Kang) is a law-enforcer. here\u2019s uncomfortable ban-ter, Sly doesn\u2019t have a problem taking jabs at Tyler\u2019s Asian heritage, but\nsoon they put their problems aside\nand it\u2019s not long before the two start\nworking together.\nStallone and Kang certainly have an\neasy chemistry to pass as two leads in\na buddy-cop bromance action \ufb01lm:\nStallone and his deep growling voice\nis mighty talented when it comes to\ndelivering corny one-liners that end\nin embarrassing chuckles, and Kang\nis convincing being everything that\nStallone is not: i.e. strict, by-the-book\nand not very smooth when it comes\nto carrying out his job. Sarah Shahi,\nbeing the only woman in the cast\nguarantees that she will need some\nsort of rescuing help, which she of\ncourse does in the end.\nNo one else truly matters here: the\nbad guys consist of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (more easily remembered as Mr. Eko from Lost), who\ncouldn\u2019t be a more generic villain,\nChristian Slater is a neurotic lawyer\nand it\u2019s quite the comic relief to see\nhim scared out of his wits when Stallone stands over him with a pair of\npliers, and the young Jason Momoa\nprovides a worthy opponent to Stallone in brutal combats.\nBodies stack up, chaos ensues, and\nthere\u2019s plenty of carnage. And Stallone shows he\u2019s still got it at the age of\n60+. Director Walter Hill, known for\nhis male-dominated action, churns\nout yet another competent but not at\nall special feature that serves well as\na highly entertaining, mindless but\nstupidly fun ride.\nThe Last Stand\nDirector: Jee-Woon Kim\nScreenwriter: Andrew Knauer\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger,\nForest Whitaker, Johnny Knoxville,\nJaimie Alexander, Rodrigo Santoro,\nPeter Stormare\nParker\nDirector: Taylor Hackford\nScreenwriters: John J. McLaughlin,\nDonald E. Westlake (novel)\nStarring: Jason Statham, Jennifer\nLopez, Michael Chiklis\nArnold Schwarzenegger returns to\nthe big screen in a lead role and he\ndoes exactly what he does best: he\nuncomfortably mumbles through his\ndialogue (which has been restricted\nto the minimum), his thick accent is\nstill there, but when the villains dare\nto disturb the peaceful town where\nhe\u2019s the head sheri\ufb00, Arnie gets his\nkit in gear, and starts running them\ndown with his truck. hat\u2019s right, he\nsaid he\u2019ll be back, and he is.\nhe FBI is in a state of panic when\nnotoriously dangerous drug lord\nGabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega)\nescapes their rather \ufb02imsy custody.\nWith an incredibly fast car, this\nskilled driver is heading for the Mexican border, to resume his usual practices and lead his cartel once more.\nWhat does any of this have to do\nwith Sommerton, Arizona? Cortez\nhas come up with a brilliant idea to\ngo through a small town, where he\nsuspects there won\u2019t be any resistance\nwhatsoever, to make the smooth transition from the States into Mexico.\nHis gang led by homas Burrell (Peter\nStormare) are busy building a bridge\nacross a narrow canyon, and since\nthe FBI is absolutely useless when it\ncomes to sorting things out on their\nown (in the \ufb01lm, I mean), it\u2019s up to the\nsheri\ufb00 and his deputies to stop this\nmad man.\nAside from Ray (Schwarzenegger),\nthe others are not all that experi-enced. here\u2019s Sarah (Jaimie Alexander), Mike (Luis Guzman), and Jerry\n(Zach Gilford), plus some unexpected\nhelp from Frank (Rodrigo Santoro) a\njailed thief, and Lewis (Johnny Knoxville) who acts like a village idiot but\nsomeone you probably shouldn\u2019t\nunderestimate given what he keeps\nlocked away in his garage.\nNot exactly the most ideal team\nto defend your town, but what we\u2019ve\ngot here is good enough it seems,\nand with Arnie on your team, there\u2019s\nvery little chance you\u2019ll end up losing.\nhere\u2019s generally good build-up, if you\nexclude the obligatory blossoming romance subplot, and thanks to Knoxville and Guzman, there is casual humour to ease things along.\nJohn Park Film Editor\nDi\ufb03cult to sit through is any sequence involving Gabriel Cortez, the\nantagonist, opening his mouth, spewing dialogue as if it were written for a\nchildren\u2019s cartoon villain. Even worse\nis his female ride-along, Genesis Rodriguez, who doesn\u2019t have much to say\nbut when she does, you wish the excruciatingly clunky dialogue rides o\ufb00\nas quickly as the car they\u2019re driving\nin.\nBut where the \ufb01lm feels most con\ufb01dent in is where there\u2019s gun\ufb01re and\nexplosions. Director Jee-Woon Kim\ndoesn\u2019t shy away from any preposterous ideas and chooses instead to\nembrace them, adding style and noise\nto give the full-on blockbuster experi-ence. he \ufb01lm rarely takes any breaks,\nand as it works itself up to a much-needed showdown between Arnie\nand the villain, it pays o\ufb00 in a brutal\nyet satisfying sequence that shows o\ufb00\nArnie\u2019s ever-lasting physical prowess.\nJohn Park Film Editor\nJason Statham is no doubt a one-trick\npony who is outstanding at what he\ndoes. He\u2019s a moody-looking, moody-sounding Cockney Brit whose suave\ntough-guy act is di\ufb03cult to match. His\nmartial arts skills have always been\ncaptured well and because of this mix\nof qualities, no matter how useless the\n\ufb01lm, Statham has always come across\nas a reliable lead in whatever situation\nhe\u2019s placed in.\nUnless of course that vehicle is Parker, a \ufb01lm so invested in being taken\nseriously that it doesn\u2019t have enough\ntime to play around with its best as-sets.\nIt starts o\ufb00 promisingly enough,\nwith a well-executed robbery of a fair\nthat bags Parker (Statham) and his\ncrew of four men 1 million dollars.\nParker wants his share of 200,000 and\nto then walk away, whereas the rest of\nthe gang, consisting of men who he\u2019s\nnever worked with before (never a\ngood sign), wants to pool the cash in\nand invest for the next heist which is\nguaranteed to generate even more in-come. After this disagreement, Parker\ngets punched, kicked, shot, and is left\nfor dead.\nSome kind farmers \ufb01nd him, and\nhe\u2019s patched up very quickly and soon\nhe\u2019s back in action. Tracking down\nthose idiots who messed with him, his\nsearch leads him down to Palm Beach,\na process that gives Statham a chance\nto show o\ufb00 some slick moves. It\u2019s only\nwhen he gets to Palm Beach and becomes closer to his targets, the plot\ncomes to a screeching halt.\nHe has a woman in his life. Claire\n(Emma Booth) who sticks around no\nmatter how much danger his job puts\nher in. Her father Hurley (Nick Nolte)\nis his mentor, although the relationship between the three of them isn\u2019t so\nwell established or explored. Another\nwoman enters his life, Leslie Rodgers\n(Jennifer Lopez), a depressed, middle-aged divorcee who is far from the successful real-estate agent she wanted to\nbe.\nAs a part of his stakeout routine,\nParker needs to look at some houses,\nand this is how he runs into the single and desperate Leslie. And so starts\nthe awkward combination as the two\nstarkly contrasting characters bicker\ntheir way through getting even with\nthe traitors. Lopez, who hasn\u2019t had\nthe most impressive track record in\nthe \ufb01lm industry, is actually a valuable addition to the cast, adding some\nhumour to the otherwise very dry and\ndull atmosphere.\nStatham, although with all of his\nusual characteristics intact, is not\nallowed to show o\ufb00 enough and his\nscenes feel very stale. With a needlessly convoluted plot that doesn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with its leading man, every scene involving him is a tad stale,\neven though it is rather entertaining\nto watch Statham struggle through\nsporting a Southern cowboy accent.\nhere are good bursts of intense,\nbloody action; especially memorable\nis Parker\u2019s defence method to stop a\nknife going into his eye, but there\u2019s\nno doubt the pacing is a serious issue.\nhe predictable but tidy ending is an\nimprovement over the dud that is the\nmeandering, muddled middle part,\nbut it never reaches the height and potential of its gripping opening.\nMan of Steel - 30 years on...\n\n"

After all, this\nis a director who freely (and disarm-ingly) admits that in the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve minutes of any Shakespeare he watches he\nhas a moment of \u201cblind panic\u201d where\nhe thinks, \u201cI\u2019m the director of the National heatre, and I have no idea what\nthese people are talking about\u201d. In the\nOlivier performance every e\ufb00ort has\nbeen made to make the verse as coherent as possible, to the point of occasionally pruning and recasting the\ntext. his is no magnus opus of purist\npomposity. It is a racy, oppressive and\ncompelling \u2013 and so perhaps all the\nmore authentic for being occasionally\nunauthentic.\nIn keeping with recent trends, the\nset (designed by Vicki Mortimer) is entirely contemporary, kicking o\ufb00 in the\nshadows of a night club smoking area,\nbefore swiftly moving via a boardroom full of suits and disposable co\ufb00ee\ncups to the brutal ugliness of an army\ncompound. Super\ufb01cially, such staging\nmakes a trivial point (human nature\ndoesn\u2019t change! Shakespeare is so rel-evant! So true, so English Lit GCSE),\nbut the e\ufb00ect is, of course, considerably more subtle. In particular, the military milieu helps reveal, reinforce and\nmake sense of some of the plots central\nthemes, not least the importance of\ntrust in a world of high security and, by\nextension, the signi\ufb01cance of betrayal.\nhe only instance when the modernisation jars is when a strawberried\nhandkerchief is produced, midst the\nbullet-proof vests and \ufb02at-pack furni-ture, as Iago\u2019s trump card in convincing Othello of Desdemona\u2019s adultery.\nhe artefact feels more than a little in-congruous, but then I doubt even the\noriginal audience at the Globe were\ncompletely satis\ufb01ed by that plot line.\nIt would be churlish to focus on this\nminor quibble, however. he play is\nwidely regarded as one of the Bard\u2019s\nbest, and the cast make the beauty of\nthe verse sing. Lester plays Othello,\nand is utterly convincing as he transforms from sunny, charismatic hero to\ntortured obsessive. In Kinnear he has\na worthy Iago \u2013 sardonic, sly and un-nervingly faceless, more than capable\nof screwing the mental ratchets of the\nMoor\u2019s mind (and ours, as he goes).\nOlivia Vinall plays a persuasively na\u00efve\nDesdemona, but is perhaps outshone\nby her Emilia, Lyndsey Marshall, who\nbalances blu\ufb00 worldliness with a deeply moving portrayal of an abused wife.\nUnusually, Hytner focuses less on\nracism and more on sex: Desdemona\nand Othello radiate all the hormones\nof frisky teenagers, Page hree posters\nleer in the o\ufb03cers\u2019 mess and Kinnear\nspeaks of the \u201cold black ram\u2026 tupping\n[Brabantio\u2019s] white ewe\u201d with all the\nlechery of an o\ufb03ce pervert. It\u2019s a heady\natmosphere, intensi\ufb01ed by the thrum\nof crickets and the harsh exposure of\nthe strip lighting, and more than suited\nto thinking on \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201ccharms\u201d\nand \u201cconjuration\u201d and \u201cmighty magic\u201d.\nThe play is in repertoire until 5 October, and Travelex \u00a312 tickets are (in\ntheory) available. Sex and A-listers, all\nfor the price of three pints. Sounds like\na good Monday evening to me.\nKate Pumphrey Writer\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nRupert Neate\nRupert Neate was Editor in 2005-06. I\nmet him on a Friday at the Guardian\nheadquarters. He currently writes for\nthe economics section of the Guardian.\nTA: How did you get involved in Felix and why?\nRN: Started writing some news stories in my third year. hat was really\nfun. I liked it so I wanted to stand for\nelection, which I did and became the\nEditor for next year.\nCampaigning was great. Our campaign was very gimmicky. I dressed\nup as Rupert the Bear and had loads\nof Rupert the Bear stickers. Had slogans like \u201cVote Neate It\u2019ll be Sweet\u201d\nthat my friend Iain Heaton came up\nwith, and wrote that in chalk everywhere around College. College security told us o\ufb00 for doing that but we\ncontinued doing it anyway. hen I got\nbanned from the election for defacing\nCollege property. (pauses)\nTA: Wait? What happened then?\nRN: I then appealed.\nTA: And won, presumably?\nRN: Yeah. After we were told o\ufb00 I\nonly wrote on the pavements and not\nin College. hey were quite serious,\nbecause they didn\u2019t really want me to\nwin. hen they didn\u2019t really like me\nwhen I was in o\ufb03ce.\nIt\u2019s good not to be liked. You know\nhow they give Honourary Life Membership? hey voted not to give me\none. (laughs). Which was after I won\nthe awards [Guardian Student Media\nAward].\nTA: Did you think as Editor it\u2019s better to be liked or not liked?\nRN: Not liked. Generally. Especially\nnot liked by College. If you\u2019re liked\nby College you\u2019re doing something\nwrong.\nTA: What are the memorable stories you did?\nRN: We were very campaigning. College were trying to introduce a dress\ncode. hey were going to ban the hi-jab, the muslim headscarf. So we ran\na campaign against that and got a lot\nof coverage on it. Like on ITV News\nand that sort of thing. So they had to\nback track on that. I was quite pleased\nwith that.\nDid a lot of things about Ethos. hat\nwas all going to be really unfair. It\nwasn\u2019t going to be free and the previous ones were free. We did a thing\nabout College in Charing Cross Hospital \u2013 you know how they have the\nyellow bags of clinical waste? he\nwere just leaving it in corridors \u2013 so\ndid a thing about that. Did a thing exposing how many robberies there are\nfrom halls.\nA thing about security on College.\nBecause on the back of that dress\ncode thing they were saying they need\nsecurity. So I asked them why they\nneeded that. You know they\u2019ve got a\nlittle nuclear reactor. We did a piece\non that. hat was fun. It was very fun.\nI liked causing trouble.\nTA: What\nwere the\nhigh points\nof your year?\nRN: he\nhighs were\nwhen we have\nthe amazing\nstories and\ncampaigning\nstories. We\ndid a story\nabout the Astoria banning\nsome club\nor society. It\nwas basically banning them because\nthey were all black and they\u2019ve got a\nban on black music. So we got them\nto u-turn on that as well. hat was\nfun. We re-introduced Page 3 [now\nthe centrefold]. Someone had done\nit like 3 years before us. I liked doing\nthat. Appeared in it twice. Have you\ndone it?\nTA: I\u2019ve done it twice, yeah. So what\nwere the lows?\nRN: he lows were when we had no\none to write for us. And I didn\u2019t ever\nsleep on Wednesday. Every week because no-one had written anything,\nno one would \ufb01le on deadline. So you\nend up staying up all night, writing\nthe front page. hat\u2019s always the bit\nyou leave till last when you\u2019re knack-ered, so that is stupid. hen all layout.\nhat was low.\nTA: hat\u2019s interesting. Because I\nalways leave the front page till last.\nAnd my own editorial.\nRN: Yeah I know - I did the editorial\neven behind that. Get everyone else\u2019s\nshit out of the way. hat\u2019s a good editor though.\nTA: Yeah. I think so\u2026 I like to think\nit\u2019s sel\ufb02ess, but I like to tell everyone as much as possible..\nRN: Good that you\u2019re still having an\neditorial. here wasn\u2019t an editorial\nwhen I started one. I think there de\ufb01nitely should be one.\nTA: You\u2019re working at the Guardian\nnow. What are the big di\ufb00erences\nbetween being at Felix and a real\nnewspaper?\nRN: Lots of di\ufb00erences. Well. You\u2019re\nnot in charge. I liked being in charge.\nI liked being able to tell people what\nto do. Although you can\u2019t do that\nmuch because otherwise they won\u2019t\nwrite for you. I had a few of those in-stances. I liked being able to just have\nideas and then just do them. I liked\nthe stress because it was\nfun. It was the most fun\nI ever had. Working in a\nproper newspaper is dif-ferent, because you can\u2019t\nbe all over the most important story all the time.\nYou can occasionally, and\nthat\u2019s great, but you can\u2019t\ndo everything. You have\nto do your bit. Obviously\nit\u2019s a lot more profession-al. And then it\u2019s good to\nbe around so many other\npeople who are amazing.\nTA: Did you ever have\nany slow news weeks?\nRN: Yeah we did have some that\nweren\u2019t that great. I was looking\nthrough last night. here was only one\nor two that I\u2019m not proud of. I tried to\nkeep some stories back. If we had a big\nweek I\u2019d keep a story back in case the\nnext week we didn\u2019t have one.\nTA: Shit\u2026 hat\u2019s a really good idea.\nRN: Yeah, some weeks you\u2019ve got\nloads of good stories and that could\nsplash the paper so you save that one.\nYou\u2019ve got to make your news I\nthink. hat would be my advice. All\nof our big stories we made ourselves.\nFind some shit out. I always wanted to\n\ufb01nd the monkeys. here were always\nrumours that College were using them\nfor clinical research. We never did\nthat. You should de\ufb01nitely do that!\nTA: Did you have many complaints\nabout the paper?\nRN: We had complaints about Page 3.\nLike a lot. We did a poll and then basically everyone wanted Page 3. So we\nsaid we apologise if we o\ufb00ended any-one. We had a warning thing on the\npage before saying nudity was on the\nnext page.\nYou talked to Pallab Ghosh. What\ndid he say, did he like doing it? Did he\nstill remember?\nTA: He told me he tried to annoy\npeople. And a \ufb01gure in College he\ndidn\u2019t like he did a running cartoon.\nHe seemed that he would always try\nto \ufb01nd something scandalous.\nRN: hat\u2019s good. I like that attitude.\nWe did that with the sport guy. After we did lots of negative stories\nabout Ethos I went in there to re\ufb01ll\nthe bin. here were no papers in it\nand the bin wasn\u2019t there. Basically, he\nhad taken the bin for Felix and put it\nin the cupboard as he didn\u2019t want it.\nSo we did a whole story about press\ncensorship and freedom and all this.\nAnd we got all of these people the bureau on censorship to give us quotes\nabout this. About how he shouldn\u2019t\nhave taken away the issue because he\ndidn\u2019t like it. So that was brilliant. We\ndid a whole story about them trying to\ncensor Felix, which they hated. And\nthen did a cartoon of him as a dragon\neating Felix. Apparently he got some\nmoney from College for damages or\nsomething. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true,\nbut that\u2019s what I heard. He never complained at the time.\nTA: Of all the aspects of Felix, which\ndid you enjoy the most?\nRN: Writing the stories.\nTA: he least?\nRN: Laying it out and spell checking it.\nI didn\u2019t really bother for lots of pages.\nYou can\u2019t fucking read all those pages.\nI used to send a copy to my dad each\nweek. He rang me up one time and\nwas like \u201cyou\u2019ve got lots of \u2018cunts\u2019 in\nthe sports pages\u201d. Someone had written a review with basically \u2018cunt\u2019 all\nthe way throughout. I was like \u201cdo we?\nI didn\u2019t realise that\u201d. I did not read it.\nTA: I read everything before it gets\nsent o\ufb00! I still do get that from my\nparents though. Each week my mum\nEx-Editor interviews\ntexts me to point out a spelling error\u2026\nRN: Felix was brilliant. he only thing\nin my career afterwards that has bettered it since was the Liam Fox story\nthat made him resign that I did. hat\nwas when it was like being at Felix\nagain. I was working ridiculously hard.\nEvery day until like midnight every\nnight, so I could be above all the com-petition. hey were all my sources, so\nI had control and could do whatever I\nwanted and getting loads of stu\ufb00 out\nand it was very trouble making and\nvery much like Felix but on a massive\nscale.\nTA: So I guess I\u2019ve got the general\naim of your year was tear shit up!\nRN: It should be. Imperial is a di\ufb00erent\nuniversity to others. It\u2019s not fun. People are very willing to just do whatever\nCollege says. he Union weren\u2019t willing to stand up to College as they were\ntoo busy getting friendly with College.\nAnd I think it\u2019s important that you\nhave people there who can hold College to account, because no one else is.\nEspecially the Union.\nTA: How about the internet?\nRN: Internet was changing back then.\nOne of our editions was when we \ufb01nally were allowed Facebook. It was\noriginally American universities. hen\nAmerican universities, Oxbridge and\nLSE. We did a big double page spread\non it. Loads of people at LSE had Facebook and it was a known thing, we\nwere jealous. here was a massive\nthing about Facebook. Like how to\ntake your pro\ufb01le picture. All this stu\ufb00.\nhat\u2019s how long ago that was. Not that\nlong ago\u2026\n*OUFSTUJOH\u0001UIJOHT\u0001\nGPVOE\u0001JO\u0001UIF\u0001'FMJY\u0001\nP\u010aDF\u0001VQ\u0001PG\u0001HSBCT\u0001\nGSPN\u0001\u0373F\u0001)P\u0109\nQBHF\u0001\u0013\u0015\n'3&&\u0001\n/P\u0001\u0012\u0014\u0014\u0015\n\u0373VSTEBZ\n\u0012\u0011\u0001/07&.#&3\u0001\u0013\u0011\u0011\u0016\n\u0373F\u0001TUVEFOU\u0001OFXTQBQFS\u0001\nPG\u0001*NQFSJBM\u0001$PMMFHF\nGFMJYPOMJOF\u000fDP\u000fVL\nGFMJY\n&MJ[BCFUI\u00015PXO\u0001o\u0001\n)JU\u0001PS\u00014OPP[F\nQBHF\u0001\u0012\u0018\nQBHFT\u0001\u0012\u0015\u000e\u0012\u0016\n/6%*5:\u00018\"3/*/(\n1FNCSJEHF\u0001QPTTF\u0001OBLFE\u0001DFOUSFGPME\n\u0373JT\u0001JTO\bU\u0001TDIPPM\n4JS\u00013JDIBSE\u0002\n$PMMFHF\u0001BOOPVDFT\u0001ESBDPOJBO\u0001ESFTT\u0001DPEF\n:KDW\u00031RW\u00037R\u0003:HDU\u0004\u0003,PSHULDO\u00b7V\u0003YHULVLRQ\u0003RI\u00037ULQQ\\\u0003DQG\u00036XVDQQDK\u0003ZRQ\u00b7W\u0003OLNH\u0003\\RX\u0003ZHDULQJ\u0003D\u0003VFDUI\u000f\u0003KRRGLH\u0003RU\u0003\u00b4RIIHQVLYH\u0003FORWKLQJ\u00b5\u0003 OHIW \u0011\u0003\n<RX\u0003FRXOG\u0003EH\u0003HVFRXUWHG\u0003RII\u0003FDPSXV\u0003LI\u0003\\RX\u0003GRQ\u00b7W\u0003ZHDU\u0003\\RXU\u0003VZLSH\u0003FDUG\u0003DURXQG\u0003\\RXU\u0003QHFN\u0003 ULJKW \u0011\u0003,PSHULDO\u0003SOF\u000f\u0003KHUH\u0003ZH\u0003FRPH\u0011\n,PSHULDO\u0003&ROOHJH\u0003KDYH\u0003DQQRXQFHG\u0003D\u0003\nVWULFW\u0003GUHVV\u0003FRGH\u0003IRU\u0003LWV\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003DQG\u0003\nVWDII\u0011\u0003)DLOXUH\u0003WR\u0003FRPSO\\\u0003FRXOG\u0003UHVXOW\u0003\nLQ\u0003 VWXGHQWV\u0003 EHLQJ\u0003 \u00b4UHPRYHG\u0003 IURP\u0003\nWKH\u0003&ROOHJH\u00b7V\u0003SUHPLVHV\u00b5\u0011\u0003\n7KH\u0003GUHVV\u0003FRGH\u0003VWDWHV\u0003WKDW\u0003\u00b4DW\u0003DOO\u0003\nWLPHV\u0003ZKLOH\u0003RQ\u0003FDPSXV\u0003VWDII\u0003DQG\u0003VWX\u0010\nGHQWV\u0003PXVW\u0003ZHDU\u0003WKHLU\u0003&ROOHJH\u0003LGHQ\u0010\nWLW\\\u0003FDUGV\u00b5\u0011\u00032Q\u0003WRS\u0003RI\u0003WKLV\u0003HPSOR\\HHV\u0003\nDQG\u0003 VWXGHQWV\u0003 DUH\u0003 WROG\u0003 WR\u0003 \u00b4UHIUDLQ\u0003\nIURP\u0003ZHDULQJ\u0003FORWKLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003REVFXUHV\u0003\nWKH\u0003 IDFH\u0003 VXFK\u0003 DV\u0003 D\u0003 IXOO\u0003 RU\u0003 KDOI\u0003 YHLO\u000f\u0003\nKRRGHG\u0003WRSV\u0003RU\u0003VFDUYHV\u0003ZRUQ\u0003DFURVV\u0003\nWKH\u0003 IDFH\u00b5\u0011\u0003 7KH\u0003 UDWLRQDOH\u0003 EHKLQG\u0003\nWKLV\u0003 LV\u0003 WKDW\u0003 LW\u0003 ZLOO\u0003 \u00b4PD[LPLVH\u0003 RXU\u0003\n>&ROOHJH\u00b7V@\u0003FKDQFHV\u0003RI\u0003GHWHFWLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nSUHVHQFH\u0003 RI\u0003 DQ\\RQH\u0003 ZKR\u0003 VKRXOGQ\u00b7W\u0003\nEH\u0003KHUH\u00b5\u0011\u0003$FFRUGLQJ\u0003WR\u0003,PSHULDO\u000f\u0003WKLV\u0003\nGUHVV\u0003 FRGH\u0003 KDV\u0003 EHHQ\u0003 LPSOHPHQWHG\u0003\n\u00b4LQ\u0003OLJKW\u0003RI\u0003VHFXULW\\\u0003FRQFHUQV\u0003UDLVHG\u0003\nE\\\u0003 WKH\u0003 WHUURULVW\u0003 LQFLGHQWV\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003\nRFFXUUHG\u0003RYHU\u0003WKH\u0003VXPPHU\u00b5\u0011\u0003\n7KH\u0003 UXOLQJ\u0003 DSSHDUV\u0003 WR\u0003 EH\u0003 TXLWH\u0003\nXQHQIRUFHDEOH\u0003 DV\u0003 WKHUH\u0003 DUH\u0003 QXPHU\u0010\nRXV\u0003 HQWUDQFHV\u0003 WR\u0003 WKH\u0003 &ROOHJH\u000f\u0003 DQG\u0003\nWKHUH\u0003LV\u0003D\u0003SXEOLF\u0003ULJKW\u0003RI\u0003ZD\\\u0003VWUDLJKW\u0003\nWKURXJK\u0003WKH\u0003PLGGOH\u0003RI\u0003&ROOHJH\u0003DORQJ\u0003\n,PSHULDO\u0003 &ROOHJH\u0003 5RDG\u000f\u0003 FRQQHFWLQJ\u0003\n4XHHQV\u0003 *DWH\u0003 WR\u0003 ([KLELWLRQ\u0003 5RDG\u0011\u0003\n,W\u0003 LV\u0003 FOHDU\u0003 WKDW\u0003 &ROOHJH\u0003 DOVR\u0003 KDYH\u0003\nGRXEWV\u0003 DERXW\u0003 WKH\u0003 HQIRUFHDELOLW\\\u0003 RI\u0003\nWKH\u0003 UXOLQJ\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003 ,PSHULDO\u0003 VSRNHVSHU\u0010\nVRQ\u0003 WROG\u0003 )HOL[\u000f\u0003 \u00b4,W\u00b7V\u0003 QRW\u0003 D\u0003 TXHVWLRQ\u0003\nRI\u0003 LW\u0003 EHLQJ\u0003 HQIRUFHDEOH\u0003 \u00b2\u0003 UDWKHU\u0003 LW\u0003\nLV\u0003 D\u0003 TXHVWLRQ\u0003 RI\u0003 &ROOHJH\u0003 VHFXULW\\\u0011\u0003\n:H\u0003H[SHFW\u0003DOO\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003WR\u0003WDNH\u0003WKHLU\u0003\n&RQWLQXHG\u0003RQ\u0003SDJH\u0003\u0016\n5XSHUW\u00031HDWH\n(GLWRU\n\n"

Jesse (Ethan\nHawke) approached Celine (Julie\nDelpy) on a train from Budapest.\nhey talked, they connected, and they\nparted, promising to meet each other\nsix months later. hey met again in\n2004, with the hastily arranged meeting never having taken place. Once\nagain they talked, they connected,\nand they prepared to part, only for the\naudience to \ufb01gure out in 2013 that in\nfact, they didn\u2019t part. Turns out Jesse\nmissed the \ufb02ight he was supposed to\ncatch from Paris back to America, and\nthey had been together since then.\nSounds like a fairytale romance\ngone absolutely right despite some\nhiccups on the way, but Jesse and\nCeline\u2019s relationship, as we\u2019re about\nto \ufb01nd out, is far from perfect. Now\nthat he\u2019s divorced, Jesse has a teenage\nson living in America who he rarely\ngets to see, and with Celine they have\n7-year-old twin daughters with whom\nthey\u2019ve settled down in Europe.\nOpening with a scene where Jesse\nis dropping o\ufb00 his son at the airport\nafter a fun summer together, we instantly sense trouble brewing as it\u2019s\nobvious Jesse wants to play a bigger\npart in his son\u2019s life, a signi\ufb01cant portion of which he\u2019s already missed. Celine is at a crossroads as to whether\nshe should accept a new well-paid job\nin the government.\nWe join them on the last day of their\nfamily holiday in Greece. here are\nno doubt some beautiful backdrops\nand scenery, but that\u2019s all secondary\nto the two characters we want to focus on. Keeping up with the tradition\nand arguably the Before trilogy\u2019s (for\nnow) most remarkable strength, this\nis a \ufb01lm in which we see long single\ntakes of characters talking. hat\u2019s all\nthey do, they exchange words. And\nyet, it\u2019s all so endlessly fascinating \u2013\nit\u2019s sweet, charming, and consistently\nfunny with quotable lines throughout\nits exceptionally well written script\nthat covers a whole range of ideas and\ncommunicate them using its talented\ncast.\nAs usual Hawke and Delpy (who\nalso co-wrote the screenplay) are\nabsolutely brilliant \u2013 they have that\nmagical chemistry that makes everything look so easy and natural. Coming across as completely spontaneous\nand e\ufb00ortless is no easy task, and yet\nthe duo who have been at the centre of\nthis romance manage this beautifully.\nAs the cracks begin to show, we are\nreminded that there is no such thing\nas the perfect relationship. Life hap-pens, challenges present themselves,\nthere are con\ufb02icts, and the longer\ntwo people are together, the more apparent this becomes. he courtship\nbetween the two is long over \u2013 now\nis the time for compromise and sacri\ufb01ce. hey disagree, they bicker, until\neventually there is a full-on \ufb01ght in\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s most climatic scene set in a\nhotel room, easily the best moment in\nthe trilogy. he mounting problems\nthey have faced over the years come\nto a head, harsh words are exchanged,\nbut the \ufb01lm does well to remember\nthat these characters are not larger-than-life, overly melodramatic in-dividuals. heir arguments aren\u2019t as\n\ufb01ery or loud as say, what Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor get up to in\nthe overlong Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia\nWoolf? but are more natural and most\nimportantly, relatable.\nUnlike its predecessors there is a\nfair amount of screen time given to\nits supporting cast (lovely insightful\nfriends they meet on holiday), making use of di\ufb00erent perspectives and\nviews, although in the end keeping\nthe narrative \ufb01rmly grounded in the\ncentral couple.\nHere is a sequel that seems to\nhave been carefully planned out, not\nrushed through and thrown out on\na whim for pro\ufb01t. A lot of consideration has gone into making a follow-up\nworthy of the high bar set by the previous two instalments. here are no\neasy answers to the issues that arise,\nand yet there is something so wonderful about two people who love each\nother after all these years. Will this\nbe the end of the Before franchise? I\ncertainly hope not. Come on Mr. Linklater, Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy, I\u2019m\nready for at least three more \ufb01lms\u2013\nall set nine years apart or so. As I can\nwatch this couple talk for days on end.\nRock slide ends happy marriage\nSpinach in his teeth is so gross\nNo. I ordered Coke. If I wanted a\nfucking Pepsi I would HAVE SAID\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 21 JUNE\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMaciej Matuszewski Reporter\nHealth Centre confusion\nAngry responses have continued to\npour in concerning the decision by\nthe Imperial College Health Centre\nto stop treating Imperial postgraduates who live outside of the Centre\u2019s\ncatchment area. he Health Centre\nonly receives money from the NHS\nto register patients living within this\narea but additional funding received\nfrom the College has traditionally allowed it to treat out of area students.\nhese students do not o\ufb03cially \u2018register\u2019 at the Health Centre but rather\n\u2018join\u2019. his allows them to use all of the\nHealth Centre\u2019s provisions apart from\nthe out-of-hours service, but they are\nstill encouraged to register with a local GP.\nDespite the College recently increasing the money that it pays to the\nHealth Centre a loss of some NHS\nfunding due to a decrease in the number of registered patients led to the\ndecision to restrict access to services.\nWhile Imperial postgraduates are no\nlonger able to join the Health Centre\nout-of-area Imperial undergraduates\nand both undergraduates and postgraduates from the Royal College of\nMusic are still able to do so. Undergraduates living in the new Hall of\nResidence in Acton will, in fact, have\nto join rather than register since the\nHall\u2019s W3 postcode is outside the\nHealth Centre\u2019s catchment area.\nIn a statement given to Felix about\nthe changes a\ufb00ecting Imperial post-graduates, Dr Sarah Freedman of the\nImperial College Health Centre said:\n\u201cLast summer we \ufb02agged up with the\nCollege the fact that there was likely\nto be insu\ufb03cient funding from them,\nfor the continued provision of all the\nservices for students, which are not\nfunded by the NHS. hese include all\nservices provided to students, who are\nnot entitled to register under the NHS\nbecause of where they live, but also a\nvariety of other services, such as certi\ufb01cation to tutors, for students who\nare registered. It became clear late in\n2012, that the anticipated shortfall\nwas a reality. he College informed\nus, that they were unable to make up\nthe shortfall as there were no additional funds available and so advised\nus to cut services. We were really disappointed by this news as we understood that this would negatively impact student welfare.\n\u201cAfter lengthy deliberation, we made\nthe decision to stop seeing unregistered postgraduate students \u2026 his\nwas not a decision we wanted to make,\nbut we felt we had no other option, as\nit is not possible to run a service without su\ufb03cient funding.\n\u201cI appreciate that some postgraduates were receiving repeat medication and ongoing monitoring here.\nHowever we have always advised all\nthose who use our service, but are not\neligible to register with us under the\nNHS, that they should be fully registered with a local NHS GP. hose that\nfollowed this advice should not have\nhad signi\ufb01cant problems with the\ntransition, although I accept that their\nhealth provision may have become\nmuch less specialised and convenient.\nhis is surely an argument for the College to provide adequate funding for\ntheir care here in future.\u201d\nhis explanation, however, was disputed by Professor Denis Wright,\nImperial College London Dean of\nStudents, who said: \u201che funding gap\narose due to a fall in student registrations in the Health Centre, which\nin return reduced the capitation fees\nthe Health Centre (which is an NHS\npractice) receives from the NHS. We\ncould not secure additional College\nfunds at that time as these are set annually through the planning round but\ndid instigate a campaign though Wardens in Halls to increase registrations.\nhis has worked to some degree, although registrations are still below the\n2011/12 level. We did not advise the\nHealth Centre to make cuts in services\nand regret that the Health Centre did\nso for non-registered PG students.\u201c\nhe Health Centre has not allowed\nUnion o\ufb03cials to view the agreement\nit has with College concerning how it\nshould use College funds. In a statement given to Felix, Becky Lane, Deputy President (Welfare), said: \u201che\nHealth Centre are blocking me from\nseeing the Memorandum of Understanding between the Health Centre\nand the College, despite the fact that\nthe College are happy for me to see\nit. A freedom of information request\nwould be futile due to commercial\nsensitivity. It does beg the question of\nwhat the Health Centre have to hide\nand what the agreement is based on\nthe College subsidy.\u201d\nPostgraduates were initially informed of the decision, which came in\nforce on 1 March, by a notice on the\nHealth Centre website. All postgraduates were subsequently informed of\nthe changes by an email from the\nUnion \u2013 which prompted some 200\nreplies from students expressing their\ndissatisfaction at the changes. On 30\nApril, the Union Council unanimously\npassed a paper resolving \u201cto work with\nCollege sta\ufb00 to lobby the Health Centre to change their policy on seeing\nPostgraduates outside the registration\narea\u201d.\nSpeaking to Felix, Helen Pennington, Graduate Students Association\nAcademic and Welfare O\ufb03cer for\nLife Sciences, said: \u201cOne of the main\nconcerns raised by a postgraduate\n(who wishes to remain anonymous)\nwas that any students receiving mental healthcare who were outside the\ncatchment area may have had their\ncare/counselling stopped. I imagine\nthat this would be distressing, especially because there is something of a\nstigma in the UK about mental illness.\n\u201cIt should also be noted that there is\na di\ufb00erence between undergraduate\nmasters (for example physics 4th year)\nand postgraduate masters (for example any biology masters). hese students will usually be in the same age-range, and often doing the same kinds\nof courses, but are treated di\ufb00erently\nunder College policy. his does not\nseem entirely fair.\u201d\nResponding to these concerns \u2013 and\nthe case, raised at the Union Council,\nof a student \u201cexperiencing an anaphylactic episode\u201d being turned away\nfrom the Health Centre and advised to\ncall an ambulance instead \u2013 Dr Freedman said: \u201cWe felt that [Postgraduate\u2019s] maturity better enabled them to\nmanage their health care needs, without the support of the Health Centre,\nthan the Undergraduate population.\n\u201chose with mental health problems\nwho were receiving talking therapies\nat the Health Centre were encouraged\nto complete their treatment course\nhere. hose who were on the waiting list prior to treatment starting\nwere advised to access treatment via\ntheir local registered GP. So it was not\ncorrect to say that patients had their\ntreatment stopped. Once again we feel\nsympathy for those students a\ufb00ected\nbut reiterate that we cannot run a\ncomprehensive service for all students\nwithout adequate funding.\n\u201cIn general terms though, our policy\nwould be to see anyone with medical\nemergencies, whatever their registration status. However, our obligation to\npatients not eligible to use the Health\nCentre is to provide advice in an emergency and sometimes that advice may\nbe \u2018to call an ambulance\u2019.\u201d\nCuts in services to postgraduates still unclear\nVolunteer Awards\nOn Monday Metric\nwill be hosting the\nfirst ever Volunteer Awards, which\npromises to be\nan action-packed\nevent definitely\nnot to be missed.\nIt will give everyone the chance to\nshow their support\nby voting for the\nbest volunteering\nprojects while enjoying free cake (!)\nand also allow people to learn more\nabout volunteering\nat Imperial.

Banging\nbeats!\nHave you ever volunteered or dreamt of volunteering?\nCome along to\nComplaints on the rise\nFigures from the official watchdog, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator\n(OIA), show that complaints by students at universities in England and Wales\nhave reached an all time high.\nIn 2012 there were 2012 complaints against universities, compared to 1605\nthe year before. Of the complaints, about 4% were deemed to be justified, 6%\nsettled and 8% unjustified. 59% were declared to be unjustified. In total, universities paid \u00a3189,892 in compensation to students.\nWith regards to the nature of complaints: most (69%) were for academic sta-tus. This however means that 31% were for other complaints. Rob Behrens, OIA\nChief Executive, stressed that these complaints are most likely not from the\nfee rise and that the impact of the \u00a39000 fees will be seen later. He said: \u201cWe\nhaven\u2019t seen the full impact of the fee increase yet, because most complaints are\nfrom third year students and the fees do not apply to them yet.\u201d \u2013 Comment 18\nTim Arbabzadah\nRector\u2019s Awards Announced\nPresident & Rector\u2019s 2013 Awards and Medals for Excellence in Teaching, Pastoral Care, Research Student Supervision and Supporting the Student Experience.

It\nis chock full of innovation that is just\nsimply amazing.\nhe greatest and most profound\nchange to iOS 7 is the whole new\nepicly redesigned and beautiful inter-face. After years of perfecting the incredible art of skeuomorphism, Apple\nonce again has delighted us with the\nphenomenal redesign that is incredibly gorgeous and just amazing. Apple is once again leading the industry\nthrough its magical innovation. Critics\nwill lambast Apple as simply conforming to trends of minimalism but this\nis not so \u2013 simplicity is often equated\nwith minimalism, yet true simplicity is\nso much more than that. Simplicity is\nabout making things \u201cjust work\u201d. iOS 7\nis a pure representation of simplicity.\nApple iOS 7 also has a whole host\nof new, epic features that has never\nbeen seen in any other operating sys-tems. A new control centre that is one\nswipe away brings access to common\ntasks like toggling on and o\ufb00 WiFi and\ncontrolling music playback in a simple\nand gorgeous manner that just works.\nhe incredible noti\ufb01cation centre has\nalso become more powerful by displaying more relevant information in\na gorgeous way.\nMulti-tasking has been revamped\nwith a new, incredible, and beautiful\ncard-based interface. Camera-a\ufb01cionados can now add special magical\ne\ufb00ects to the pictures they take with a\nnew gorgeous camera interface. Apps\ncan also update themselves automatically in what Apple insisted was a new\nfeature, rather than a bug \ufb01x. hese\nrepresent a mere tip of the iceberg for\nall the epic and fantastic changes in\niOS 7.\nApple also took the time to deride\nits competition. It, rightfully, compared its superior position in terms of\ngetting the latest version of the OS to\nconsumers when compared with Android. Its magical formula is simply\nthe incredible lack of fragmentation.\nApple also expects to launch multiple\nlawsuits against companies that have\ncopied its redesign in the near future,\nespecially Microsoft for the Windows\nPhone series.\nAll of these new features in iOS 7\nmake it a super fast, super clean, super\nbeautiful, super gorgeous, and super\nincredible new version of the world\u2019s\nmost advanced mobile operating sys-tem. It is no wonder that Phil Schiller\nso adamantly and indignantly derided\ncritics with the line \u201ccan\u2019t innovate\nanymore, [his] ass\u201d. He is right. Apple\nwill continue to live long and prosper.\nYong Wen Chua echoes Apple: \u201ccan\u2019t innovate anymore, my ass.\u201d\nSteve Ballmers thoughts reviewing the year according to Max Eggl\nA\neah, MS is back, baby!\nhe most awesomest\ncompany on Earth has\ndelivered this year in\nevery possible area avail-able. I\u2019m like serious people, we did\nlike everything. Not only have we revolutionised the smartphone world but\nalso shaken up the PC market, tablets\nand games consoles.\nWith the Windows 8 phone, everyone has just been like wooahhh, what\nis that?! I mean the smoothness of the\ninterface, the speed of the software\nand general greatness of Windows\non a phone, toooootally makes up for\na lack of apps. And the competitors?\nApple and their iOS? Wait... didn\u2019t we\ngive \u2018em 150 million dollars back in\n1997? Yeah them. Oh and Goo...who...\ngle? hat OS with their fragmentation and stupid food names are soooo\n2012. I mean with Windows 8, you\nhold the future man, it\u2019s so modern\nthe UI is called \u201cModern UI\u201d! hem\n\ufb02at tiles just give you all the info you\never could need, wanted or unwanted.\nIt\u2019s even so cool and new that Apple,\nthe oh-so-high-and-mighty Apple,\ncopy us. You can stick that in your\niPipe and smoke it, Cook!\nOh yeah and the Windows update?\nWindows 8, it\u2019s like so intuitive, even\nyour Grandpa could use it.... Oh wait.\nAccording to that video he may not\nbe able to. Well anyway, we took away\nthat start button because it was like\noutdated and you guys didn\u2019t want it.\nYeah, I know you were saying you did\nwant it, but look deep, deep down into\nyour heart, you didn\u2019t actually want it,\nright? Well, we\u2019ll give it back to you an-yway, even if you don\u2019t want it! Aren\u2019t\nwe such a great and all-knowing com-pany? So, like, it\u2019s such a change from\nWindows 7, even though all of you still\nstay in the desktop mode, which looks\nlike Windows 7.\nWhat about the tablets? Absolutely,\nlike totally, style. he RT does everything you wanted it to do (no, not\nnothing)! he pro is the best tablet-laptop hybrid you ever wanted, and if\nyou wanna get one, just go for it, they\nare still in stock! And the best bit is\nyou get the Windows 8 experience on\na tablet! All 35 GB of it!\nOh and what about Xbox (B)one(d).\nLike why would you need backwards\ncompatibility? hat\u2019s like backwards\nthinking, man! Oh, and you want a\nconsole that actually is aimed at gam-ers? Well, we also make that kind of\nconsole, its called an Xbox 360, bro!\nYeah, but apart from that like it\u2019s the\none device you will need (see that\ncreative naming, man?!). So the cons:\nsharing games; why would you share\ngames anyway? Gamestop would have\nripped you o\ufb00 if you sell it, and, man,\nyou never know if you really found\nALL those golden stars, if you give it\nto your friend! Kinect; yes we know it\u2019s\nannoying that the Kinect always has\nto be plugged in, but dude, no matter what we see, we will keep it secret\n(maybe give it to the US government,\nand possibly anyone that asks for it!\nBut apart from that, no one I swear\nman!). Lastly that internet thing: I\nmean c\u2019mon, whoever doesn\u2019t have internet at least at some given point in\nthe day is as backward as... as... a cat\nwith toast on its face... oh wait. What\nare you gonna do about it though? Buy\na Wii U?! Lol, don\u2019t kid with me here,\nI have a weak heart. PS4, yeah right,\nlet\u2019s see if Sony even lives out the year!\nWith Microsoft you know at least we\nwon\u2019t go bankrupt due to some Tsunami or something.\nWell all in all it has bin a fab year for\nMS, I mean kick-ass products that will\njust make you feel like you are in heav-en. Just connect all your devices, and\nlean back while we listen and video\neverything in your life. Trust me man,\nyour data is in good hands!\nY For all of you unfortunate\nenough not to know what\nthis is:\nThis. Is. Cat.Breading.\nI\u2019m so incredibly fabulous that I defecate amazing rainbows\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nJohn Park Film Editor\nFit Cavill in tights\nAfter the disappointment of Superman Returns that gave very little of\nwhat audiences were really looking\nfor, here comes another reboot that\nstarts o\ufb00 a well-known superhero\ncharacter story from scratch. And\nhere is the kind of loud, bombastic action feature this de\ufb01nitive superhero\nreally deserves.\nUnder the assured guidance of Zack\nSnyder (300, Watchmen as well as the\nhighly underrated Sucker Punch and\nLegend of the Guardians: he Owls\nof Ga\u2019Hoole), Man of Steel wastes no\ntime in getting stuck in with spectacular action. Opening with the\nvisually awe-inspiring planet Krypton that\u2019s about to self-destruct, JorEl (Russell Crowe) dodges bombs\nand bullets, \ufb01ghts o\ufb00 coup-leading\nGeneral Zod (Michael Shannon), to\nsend o\ufb00 his baby son Kal-El to Earth\naway from all the chaos. Krypton is\nsoon destroyed, and baby Superman\nsafely crash-lands on our planet to be\ndiscovered and adopted by the Kents,\nMan of Steel\nDirector: Zack Snyder\nScreenwriters: David S. Goyer,\nChristopher Nolan\nStarring: Henry Cavill, Amy Adams,\nRussell Crowe, Michael Shannon,\nKevin Costner, Diane Lane\nJonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane).\nGrowing up as Clark Kent (Henry\nCavill), he struggles to \ufb01t in with the\nrest of the world, di\ufb03culties he\u2019s often faced as a child, shown to the audience in several \ufb02ashback sequences.\nHe\u2019s faster, stronger, and just generally better than everyone else (x-ray\nvision, laser beams from his eyes etc),\npowers his adopted father fully accepts but is determined to keep hid-den, as he wisely sees that the rest\nof the world isn\u2019t ready to embrace\nsomeone so di\ufb00erent. Clark does\neventually \ufb01gure out his origins, his\ndestiny, how he should be a hero blah\nblah blah (the rite of passage superhero talk remains the same), all of this\nexplained to him by the memories of\nhis real father who is now dead.\nAs can be expected for an origins\nstory, there is a lot of set-up before\nthe fun can really start. Having two\nimportant father \ufb01gures is something\nSnyder plays around with; having\ntwo very strong actors, Costner in\nthe \ufb02ashbacks, Crowe in the present,\ngive Clark the guidance he needs to\nbecome the saviour he\u2019s destined to\nbe, and \ufb01nd his place in the world.\nhere are particularly e\ufb00ective scenes\ninvolving both fathers, ones that contribute to successfully shaping an\nemotional arc within the story.\nWhen telling the story of Clark, a\nlot is said and done around the char-acter, but the man himself has frus-tratingly very little to say. Cavill is\nvery good at reacting appropriately to\nthe tons of lectures he\u2019s given by those\nwho surround him, however he isn\u2019t\ngiven much to expand on. He has no\ntrouble looking serious at every turn,\nand although there is an element of\npain and loneliness in his expression\nstemming from being an outsider, not\nenough time is spent on Cavill to truly dig deep into the titular role. hat\nsaid, he absolutely rocks the newly-designed, red-underwear-less (and\ntherefore, much better) suit, and he\nfully embodies the physical stature of\nthe Man of Steel.\nEnter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and\nGeneral Zod with his gang of powerful antagonists to really kick things\no\ufb00. Lois is a Pulitzer Prize-winning\njournalist investigating this mysterious and illusive superhero, and Zod\nlands on Earth to destroy it with his\ngigantic sci-\ufb01 spaceship. Both relatively important supporting players,\nbut both thinly drawn. Adams is as\nlikable as ever, and to her character\u2019s\ncredit, she does play an important\npart in taking down the bad guy, but\nshe lacks her own personality to stand\nfor herself. here is de\ufb01nite spark between her and Superman, one that\nperhaps needs to be explored further\nin the future. Shannon has never had\nproblems playing psychopathic maniacs before, and he comfortably pulls it\no\ufb00, and he\u2019s a villain of many intense\nwords, full of big speeches and ges-tures, something that suits the actor\nwell.\nMost impressive however, is the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s \ufb01rm grasp on the huge action\nsequences. Once they get going, there\nis no stopping them, and the scale\nat which everything is executed is a\ngrand, magni\ufb01cent one. Despite having Snyder behind the cameras, there\nare no extreme slow-motion captures,\none of the director\u2019s previous trade-marks. he \ufb01nal showdown isn\u2019t without some incredibly repetitive ideas\n(characters \ufb02y into each other, they\nrebound into buildings which subsequently get destroyed and knocked\ndown, presumably killing thousands\nand thousands along with it \u2013 but\nthis being a 12A feature, it kindly\noverlooks the collateral damage), and\nis perhaps reminiscent of Michael\nBay\u2019s Transformers franchise, but the\ndi\ufb00erence here is that it\u2019s incredibly\neasy to follow every step of the various \ufb01ghts. Snyder closely follows the\nspectacle and captures the many,\nmany \ufb02ights of Superman perfectly.\nIn\ufb02uenced by the success enjoyed\nby Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman fran-chise, Snyder is little interested in\nhumour, and has turned this into a\ndeathly serious entry, with hardly any\nlight-hearted touch. Which is just as\nwell, because the \ufb01lm doesn\u2019t have\nroom for comedy. It\u2019s better to leave\nthings the way they are, rather than\ntrying to make awkward one-liners\n\ufb01t, especially when they have absolutely no bearing on the story whatso-ever. Clark is on a very serious quest\nto uncover his identity, and anything\ninappropriate would have been a\nneedless diversion.\nAll in all, he\u2019s back, and safe to say,\nfor good. A sequel is under works, and\nwe\u2019ll be glad to have him \ufb02ying back\nto our screens.\nI\u2019m sexy and I know it...ba ba ra ba\nI\u2019m so pretty\nAnd here, I\u2019m on fire\nYes...more pics of me...this is all about me...\nCENSORED\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 FRIDAY 21 JUNE\nPallab Ghosh\nPallab Ghosh was Felix Editor from\n1983/84. He is currently a science\ncorrespondent at the BBC. I met him\nin the BBC o\ufb03ces. When he was Editor they printed in their in house print\nshop and the Editor was also the manager of the print shop, who printed\nclub lea\ufb02ets.\nTA: Something I\u2019ve noticed is that\nthere is a general underlying tone,\nbut there are changes from year to\nyear. One year it\u2019s a bit more light\nhearted, then the next year it\u2019s a bit\nmore serious. How did you choose\nthat?\nPG: Yes it tends to go like that. I took\nmy inspiration from a guy called Steve Marshall, who was Editor when I\nwas a \ufb01rst year. He had this certain\napproach (humour). he Editors\nwho followed him were a bit more\nstraightforward. hey wanted to kind\nof distinguish themselves by not having the same approach. You only get\none shot at it and it\u2019s great fun. So you\nshouldn\u2019t have any regrets at the end\nof it.\nTA: How did you get involved at Felix?\nPG: I didn\u2019t think of journalism or\nnewspapers as my thing. I was quite\nkeen on athletics. I went along to a\nmeeting of University of London Athletics Club and there was no one there\n\u2013 I probably turned up at the wrong\nplace. So I thought, I\u2019ll have to \ufb01nd\nsomething else to do.\nhere was a guy across the hall from\nme who was involved in the student\nnewspaper. So I got involved. he\nEditor at the time lived in the same\nhalls, and he was nocturnal. So Patrick would say \u201ccome along and meet\nSteve\u201d, and we\u2019d go along to his room\nand they\u2019d get chatting and then he\nsaid \u201ccome along and work on Felix\nand do some collating\u201d. I was very under con\ufb01dent about my writing. I was\nmore there for the crack \u2013 as in the\nIrish term, rather than something untoward going on. hen I got more into\nit, did a bit of photography. When it\ngot to the end of my third year I hadn\u2019t\nbeen involved in that Editor\u2019s Felix,\nbecause he was far too straight laced\nand whatever and not part of what Felix was about. So I decided to put myself forward as Editor, because I really\nliked the layout and design.\nTA: My lecturer Alan Armstrong\ntold me that you produced the halls\u2019\nnewsletter actually.\nPG: Yes. It was this thing called the\nWellsian. he newsletter of the H. G.\nWells society, which we created while\nI was there. It just gave me a taste\nof doing layout and design, which I\nloved. Back then, the production was\none of the main things that the Editor did. Obviously, he gave it an editorial direction, but I thought if I got a\nsta\ufb00 of writers I could manage. hen\nwhen I got elected I redesigned the\npaper and I got other people to write\nthe news stories. I hoped that my\ngirlfriend at the time would write the\neditorial. She was too busy so I had\nto do it myself. It was with one hour\nto go and I wrote it and it was \ufb01ne.\nIt was just this thing in my head that\nmade me think I couldn\u2019t write, then\nI found out I quite enjoyed writing. I\nthoroughly enjoyed it.\nSo I just drifted into it [being Editor]\nand because I enjoyed Felix and liked\nthe journalism I decided to become a\njournalist.\nTA: Did\nyou do the\nh e a d e r\nyourself?\nPG: I commissioned\nsomeone to\ndo it. I was\ninto layout myself\nbut with\nthe logo it\u2019s\ngood to do\nthat. It was\ns o m e o n e\nwho wanted\nto be a prof e s s i o n a l\ng r a p h i c\nd e s i g n e r.\nWe had a\nchat and it\nwas just something bright, and a new\ndawn, and I wanted the cat on.\nTA: he logo changing so much is\nreally weird. I remember my brother trying to give me advice and telling me I shouldn\u2019t change the logo.\nI said look at the issue archive they\nchange the logo every year.\nPG: here\u2019s the sense that he Times\nyou don\u2019t get them changing the logo\nbecause it\u2019s the brand. But that\u2019s the\nbiggest way you can make your mark.\nTA: I think with Felix the name is\nthe brand. What it looks like changes year by year, and that\u2019s almost\npart of the brand that it changes\nyear by year.\nPG: Yeah, because you don\u2019t get Editors changing at he Times every year.\nTA: Any standout moments from\nyour year? News stories or features\nthat you think came o\ufb00 well?\nPG: Well. I\u2019m the only Felix Editor\nthat riled the Rector so much that\nthey brought out their own newspaper against me! It was just generally a\nbody of work that rattled lots of cages\nand got a reaction. Everyone was involved in Felix in one way or another.\nhey\u2019d rush to open it to see who had\nbeen slagged o\ufb00, who hadn\u2019t been.\nYou know, obviously the news is im-portant, but with a student newspaper it should be part of the commu-nity. If I were to describe what I felt\nproud of it would be that everyone\nwas engaged in it. We couldn\u2019t print\nmore than a certain number of copies\nas we\u2019d exceed our budget, but they\nwere gone by 9:30 \u2013 \ufb01rst lectures.\nTA: Looking back on stories that\nseemed to be\nvery important,\nhow important\ndo they seem in\nhindsight?\nPG: Well, there\nwas a story\nabout a student\nwho had committed suicide,\nwhich was a serious story. We\nproduced a special issue on that\n\u2013 I don\u2019t know if\nit made it to the\nbound editions\n[which are big\neditions that has\nevery paper in\none place]. Most\nof the time it was\nreporting the\nnews. here were\nno big standout moments. My Felixes\nwere more magaziny. here was a bit\nof news, which was reported.\nWe ran a campaign to save a tea\nroom. It was the Head of Biology who\nwas trying to shut it down so we portrayed him as Hitler.\nTA: So what stories stand out as big\nstories from your year?\nPG: So there was the student who was\nshot dead. It turned out he had killed\nhimself. So that was challenging to report that.\nhere was a pornography show that\nthe RSM used to show. And one of\nthe students campaigned against it.\nIt doesn\u2019t bear thinking about these\ndays that the RSM used to invite\nthese strippers along and show pornographic \ufb01lms, some of which were\nkind of very hardcore, involving animals and so forth.\nTA: hat was allowed?\nPG: Exactly. It seems bizarre. One of\nthe students campaigned against it.\nSo that was a\ngood running\nstory. I had\nsome good\nrunning stories I think.\nStories that\nmatter to peo-ple. You\u2019re at\nthe mercy of\nthat happen-ing. Quite a\nlot of the time\nthe news can\nbe slow or un-interesting, so\nyou\u2019ve got to\nmake sure that\nthe rest of the\nnewspaper \u2019s\nentertaining in\nsome way.\nTA: Did you do that with the rest of\nthe paper? Make sure it\u2019s entertaining so there\u2019s always something fun\nfor people to read.\nPG: Yeah there\u2019s always something fun\nfor people to read and it looked good.\nYou know, whether there was good\nnews or not. But news is the thing that\npeople care most about.\nTA: Were people ever upset by what\nwas in the paper? Did you ever get\nany complaints?\nPG: Oh I got loads of letters of com-plaints, which I published (laughs).\nSome of them were written in the right\nspirit \u2013 a bit of banter back \u2013 but I got\ncomplaints, and I published them. It\nmade for a lively letters section.\nTA: At the time did you feel upset,\nI mean, I can\u2019t imagine you found it\nfun to receive those?\nPG: Oh it was! I deliberately set out\nto upset people and it was sort of\ngreat satisfaction to me that they were\n(laughs).\nTA: Did Felix prepare you for your\ncareer in science journalism? Is it\ndi\ufb00erent how you do things now\ncompared to back then?\nPG: he process is the same. You have\na sense for what people care about and\nyou talk to them about it and you report it. hat\u2019s the same now as it was\nhundreds of years ago. One of the\nthings Felix does teach you at an early\nage is the stories. Once upon a time\npeople used to leave school and work\non the local paper and work for the\nlocal radio stations doing the basics;\nthey\u2019d learn what stories were. Now\nEx-Editor interviews\npeople do journalism courses it\u2019s all\nabout the academia of impact of news\nand that sort of thing. Many editors\ncomplain that people don\u2019t know what\nstories are. If you\u2019re an editor, you\u2019ve\ngot a community, you know what\nworks, almost instinctively.\nTA: Do you think working in Felix\ngives you a sense of what students\ncare about and what they don\u2019t\ncare about? And if they should care\nabout it, how to make them care?\nPG: To be honest I think it was in-stinctive. I just wrote about stu\ufb00 that\nI found interesting and it worked. It\ngot a reaction and went to plan. So. I\nthink you know what you\u2019ve learnt in\nretrospect.\nTA: Do you feel science journalism and communication are going\nthrough a renaissance period?\nPG: Well \ufb01rst of all I\u2019d make a distinction between science journalism and\nscience communication. Communication is what NASA and CERN do.\nhey feel like they have an obligation\nto put on their websites \u2013 and I feel\nthe web has changed things a lot \u2013and\nalso through the media explain what\nthey\u2019re doing. But, at the end of the\nday, it\u2019s still propaganda. It\u2019s for them\nto show that they are doing the right\nthing, that it\u2019s important. I think even\nwith things like explaining the Higgs,\nwhat science journalists need to do is\nto ask awkward questions: has it really\nbeen worth the money? Do these results really stand up? Is it all that it\u2019s\ncracked up to be? Unless science journalists do that there\u2019s no reason for the\npublic to get their science news from\nany other place than the NASA website or Wellcome Trust website.\n. + ( \u0019 ( \u001e *\u0001 ' \u001e\u0001 !\u0001 \u001d * \u0019 $\u0001 \u001b ' $ $ \u001d \u001f \u001d\u0001 - & !

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nFEBRUARY\nSpring seemed to have sprung in sci-ence, if not elsewhere during February, with flowers and butterflies revealing their secrets to the biologists.\nFlowers were proved to have a negative electrical charge to attract positively charged bumblebees in an effort to encourage pollen interactions.\nMeanwhile it was found that migrating monarch butterflies use temperature to dictate flight\ndirection, monitored\nby their internal\nclocks.\nChemists discovered a process for\nextracting hydrogen from the fuel\nmethanol, which, due to being liquid,\nallows it to be easily transported and\nstored. hey also managed to produce\nelastic, ultra light carbon foams with a\ndensity lower than air; a busy month\nfor chemists if not for the love lives\nof students at Imperial with a record\nhigh of those residing in the library\nrather than out on February the 14th.\nExcitement for\nphysicists peaked this\nmonth with a meteor\nstrike in the Russian\ncity of Chelyabinsk,\nalthough the same\ncan not be said for the\ncity\u2019s residents with\nover a thousand people\ninjured. he explosion\nwas the equivalent of\naround half a mega-tonne of TNT and\nis believed to be the\nlargest object to strike\nEarth since 1908.\nMARCH\nMarch was a busy month for science\nand students at Imperial alike. Neuroscientists, continuing with their previous success in research, discovered\nthe source of migraines. In contrary to\npopular belief that these were caused\nby repetitive hounding from Union\nhacks badgering you to vote in the Big\nElection, they were actually found to\nbe due to waves of cellular depolarisa-tion in the cortex.\nWith the approach of \ufb01nal year projects and exams for third year biologists also came a paper determining\nhow sleepless nights can a\ufb00ect gene\nactivity, much to their dismay. Genes\nconcerning immune and stress responses are in particular negatively\na\ufb00ected by sleep deprivation; again\nyet another\nreason why\nmaybe sometimes it is ok\nto sleep on\nthe library\nfloor during\ntedious revision sessions.\nB i o l o g i s t s\nalso found\nthat mice preformed better on learning tasks and\nmaze navigation when\ni n j e c t e d\nwith human\nbrain cells,\nso at least we\ncould claim\nwe are cleverer than the rodents this\nmonth.\nAs biologists were slogging away in\nthe library, chemists were having a\nAPRIL\nMAY\nApril was an exciting month for Imperial \u2013 researchers from the Department of Medicine identi\ufb01ed new\nmutations in the bird flu virus, H5N1,\nthat allow for it to replicate more\nreadily in mammals.\nMeanwhile, at Imperial\u2019s National\nHeart and Lung institute, a study on\nstem cells allowed for the identi\ufb01cation of possible treatment for those\nsu\ufb00ering from the bleeding disorder,\nvon Willebrand Disease (vWD). vWD\nis caused by a malfunctioning clotting\nfactor, but using stem cells, researchers were able to pinpoint exactly what\ndefects were present in di\ufb00erent pa-tients, and hopefully develop tailored\ntherapy.\nSuch \ufb01ndings may have come at a\nprice however; this month saw the\nBUAV posting \ufb01ndings of animal mistreatment within the labs based at the\nHammersmith campus, causing our\nown golden boy, Brian May, to implore Imperial to stop animal testing.\nWith students more engaged with\ntheir revision than the video of mice\nbeing guillotined however, this blip in\nImperial\u2019s scienti\ufb01c history went widely unnoticed; with even the College\nitself o\ufb00ering a half-hearted investigation into the matter, this has not been\nheard from since. It is presumed the\nundercover BUAV protester working\nat the lab was \ufb01red, although again\nno one seemed to be too bothered to\ncheck up on this fact.\nOn a happier note however, biologists found a new hormone within\nthe liver that spurs the growth of in-sulin-secreting cells, which could be\nmanipulated for future treatment of\ndiabetes.\nhe hormone, named betatropin,\ninfluences the beta cells of the liver\nand alters their gene expression to\ngive them characteristics of their\nneighbours, alpha cells, that already\nmake insulin.\nE x a m\ns e a s o n\ndescended upon\nc a mp u s\nwith its\nusual fluid, unbroken sweep across\nthe library, bringing student activity\nto a halt. Fortunately the same can\u2019t\nbe said for scienti\ufb01c development in\nMay.\nhe 3D printer delivered results for\none particularly lucky six year old pa-tient, with a windpipe produced using\nthe new technology. he windpipe\nwas printed in a biocompatible bio-plastic and allowed Kaiba Glonfriddo\nto breathe again without di\ufb03culty.\nTo the relief of both culinary connoisseurs and the historians out there,\nthe pathogen that was the cause of\nthe Irish Potato Famine was \ufb01nally\nidenti\ufb01ed as a strain of Phytophthora\ninfestans. Identi\ufb01cation of the DNA\nof this pathogen was done using 11\nhistorically preserved specimens, although they can gladly say that the\nstrain that caused the famine may now\nbe extinct.\nIt also seemed this month that\nBUAV really didn\u2019t have a lasting effect in their campaign to stop animal\ntesting, with 4,00 people signing an\nonline petition in May to support the\nscientists in the University of Milan.\nResearch facilities were invaded by activists (not the BUAV) in April, with\nthem taking around 100 animals and\ndelaying research substantially, and it\nbeing predicted that it will take years\nto redo work.\nhese are only a few of the great scienti\ufb01c advances this year, and, with an\nincrease in the technology available, it\nis likely that such scienti\ufb01c landmarks\nare only going to be coming thicker\nand faster than ever. he same may or\nmay not be said next year\u2019s Freshers.\nfew beers\nin the name\nof science.\nX-Rays allowed for\nthe study of\nthe chemical components of\nbeers and\nwere able to\nidentify the\nmolecular\nstr uc ture\nof humu-lone comp o u n d s ,\nwhich give\nbeer its bitter taste.\nP h y s i -cists too\nwere getting very excited this month,\nwith evidence of the Higgs Boson being found in CERN. he Higgs Boson\nmay be able to provide a way in which\nparticles gain mass, although its nickname of he God Particle is misleading \u2013 with the boson unable to shed\nany light on the existence of any sort\nof omnipotent entity. Regardless of its\nweaknesses concerning religious out-pourings, it can still be bene\ufb01cial to\nmany elements of theoretical physics.\nAn infant was also successfully\ncured of HIV in March using antiviral\ndrugs, after being born with the ret-rovirus. he secret to the treatment\nwas the speed at which it was ad-ministered, with drugs taken from 30\nhours after birth. Unfortunately, this\nprogress into HIV research was somewhat counteracted when an anti-HIV\ntrial failed due to subjects not actually\ntaking the drug being tested, leading\nto an inconclusive determination of\nwhether the drug tenofovir actually\nworks.\nThe comet that struck Chelyabinsk\nThe best thing physicists did all year\n\u2013 an attempt at a spirograph picture\nThe BUAV\u2019s poster mouse for why\nImperial needs to stop science\nWhat happens when you don\u2019t\nprint safely \u2013 a windpipe that\nwon\u2019t leave you breathless\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\n40\nFelix-ception. BWWWAAAAM!\nGood old E3. Every year, hundreds of\ngame developers and publishers, outline what it is that\u2019s going on in the\nworld on gaming at the moment, and\nwhat\u2019s upcoming in the year ahead. Be\nit the latest technology or the games\nthemselves, us gamers are treated to\na literal feast of information, being\npacked into exciting press conferenc-es, high-action trailers and impressive\ndemonstrations.\nhis is great, but I feel there is a\nproblem. As hyped up as E3 is, or\nrather tries to be, I feel that it\u2019s lost\nsome of its original excitement lately.\nhe event feels too similar each year;\nwe\u2019re greeted with a lot of sequels,\nnearly all from the same developer or\npublisher powerhouses, and overall I\nget the impression that not much is\nchanging. And while I\u2019ve always preferred to play games on my PC, the\nnew consoles from Sony and Microsoft don\u2019t appeal hugely either.\nSo what is so disappointing about\nthe show this year? Let\u2019s start with\nthe obvious \u2018anti-star\u2019; Microsoft\u2019s\nnew console, the Xbox One. Although revealed almost a month in\nadvance of E3, it has already met with\nharsh criticism. he requirement of\nan \u201cinternet veri\ufb01cation\u201d every 24\nhours for o\ufb04ine play, restrictions on\nthe resale of used games, and the requirement for the use of Kinect to be\npermanently attached to the console\nhave already caused a lot of contro-versy. his apparent slow erasure of\nconsumer rights has provoked a lot\ndiscord from gamers. Whilst anti-pi-racy measures are understandable, it\nseems a shame that many companies\nstill opt for draconian DRM meas-ures.\nSony\u2019s latest device, the PlayStation 4, doesn\u2019t feature any of these\nrequirements thankfully, receiving many cheers at their conference\nwhen this was announced. Indeed\nthe \u201cO\ufb03cial PlayStation Used Game\nInstructional Video\u201d is an excellent\npiece of marketing. Not only this, but\nSony have shown a lot more support\nfor independent developers, allowing\nself-publishing on their new console.\nHowever, I \ufb01nd it still fails to appeal.\nhat multiplayer play on the PS4 can\nnow only be accessed as part of the\npaid \u201cPlaystation Plus\u201d subscription\nservice seems to be an odd choice,\nespecially as it was a key selling point\nfor Sony\u2019s previous console. Also like\nthe new Xbox, there doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe much variation in the games announced for the new consoles.\nAs one would expect, there are a\nlot of sequels announced at E3 for the\nalready well-established franchises.\nCall of Duty, Mario Kart, and FIFA\nare three particular examples which\ncome to mind. No doubt these games\nsell well enough, however for a conference which aims to show the latest\nin gaming, it seems somewhat ironic\nthat we are greeted with such a similar selection of titles each year. I can\nprobably guess that next year\u2019s conference will involve many more of the\nsame names. I\u2019m not against sequels at\nall, but a lot of the focus could be said\nto be around so called \u201cshovel-ware\u201d.\nhese are releases which are perceived\nto be more-or-less the same game in\na long line of sequels from consecutive years. Is this really anything to be\nexcited about? Some more variation\nwould be nice; there have been other\ninteresting concepts for games which\nhave appeared in the past few years. It\nwould be good to see something other\nthan the standard array of sports ti-tles, modern/futuristic military shooters and fantasy RPGs.\nPerhaps this is nonsense though. I\nsuspect my view of previous years is\nclouded by some nostalgia of teenage\nexcitement for what was then the next\nbig thing. hat and my prolonged waiting for Valve\u2019s \u2018Ricochet 2\u2019 means that\nsurely anything I say should be taken\nwith a pinch of salt? Maybe so, but I for\none was not particularly enthused by\nmuch at E3 this year. hat\u2019s not to say\nI\u2019m not looking forward to anything.\nhere are of course of lot of interesting\nnew games out there \u2013Watch Dogs and\nMirror\u2019s Edge 2 to name a couple. he\noverall spirit of the conference seems\nto be missing, however.\nGAMES COMMENT\nGAMES NEWS\nGAMES FOOD\nJoshua Price\nE3 \u2013 I am disappoint\nAs new Editor for Food section, I want\nto share with you favourite sandvich.\nSandvich ideal for pushing kart\nor having break b e t w e e n\ncrushing puny spines. Cake best for\ncelebration.\nhis sandvich recipe was handed\ndown through family, and very good.\nYou need: bread, meat, salad, cheese,\nplus olive and toothpick. To make,\nput ingredients on plate, and eat. If\nyour friend is sad, you can drop\nsandvich on \ufb02oor, and friend feel\nhappier.\nCake is masterpiece. Made\nfrom tears of enemy, mixed\nwith their fear. Tastes like vic-tory. Many little men try to\ntake cake, but unable to eat, because\nof broken bones. I break, because\ncake for winners. Unlike sandvich,\ncake recipe is national secret. Noone to be told recipe. If anyone ask,\ncake is lie.\nGAMES ART\nhe weather outside was lovely yes-terday. I saw a deer. I drew a painting\nfor you, I hope you like it more than\nyour parents ever liked you. hat isn\u2019t\nhard though. Even looking at it the\npainting counts as a win in my book.\nThe Heavy\nomnomno..\nmnomnom\nGLaDOS\nne to be told recip\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni e. If anyone ask\nake is lie.\nIt\u2019s a tenuous link to news, but as you\nmight have noticed, from the hearse-delivered copies of Felix this week, this\nis the last issue of the year.\nWow, I can hear your crying from\nhere \u2013 tone it down a bit.\nAll joking aside, it\u2019s been a great\nyear for gaming, with the next generation of consoles revealed (for better\nor worse), and a great array of games\nthat threaten to blow the cobwebs\nout of the works. We\u2019ve got he Last\nof Us, Borderlands 2 and Bioshock: Infinite leading the charge, but backed\nup by a slew of smaller releases, such\nas Dead Space 3, Monaco, FarCry 3\n(plus Blood Dragon) and Dishonored.\nI just wish I had more time and space\nto talk and play about more of them.\nAs always, the casualties of war are\nyoung and the killing blow happens\nsuddenly. Aliens: Colonial Marines\nhad so much promise, but shot itself in the foot with a smart-gun, and\nSimCity, well... \u2018nuff said.\nhe Games section of Felix would\nhave been way more boring and sar-castic, if it wasn\u2019t for the rest of the\nGames and Felix teams, so I extend\nmy heartfelt thanks to them, for\nkeeping these pages relatively clean\n(it\u2019s surprisingly easy to start complimenting a game, and then quickly slip\ninto describing the developer\u2019s mothers in a less than desirable light...),\nso to you guys, I raise my glass (of\nRibena).\nhis year, being Games Editor has\nbeen a great experience, and I\u2019ve had\nway too much fun procrastinating\nfrom the life of an Imperial student, it\nshould be illegal. I\u2019ve gone to BAFTA\nviewings, gaming conventions and\nhad review copies thrown at me, all\nin the name of \u2018journalism\u2019.\nI don\u2019t know who is going to be my\nreplacement, but I know that the next\nyear promises all the goodies (and\nbaddies) we\u2019ve seen from E3, and\nwhoever feels like taking up the mantle as Editor, is going to have a great\nyear ahead of them. If any of you are\ninterested, drop us a line!\nIt was a triumph! I\u2019m making a note\nhere: huge success....\nA most spectacular journey\nRoss Webster\n\n"

Many tricks of the trade were\nprobably employed in this circum-stance. The classic is the hand in\npocket adjustment. I bet he was\ndoing this. Just casually slip a hand\nin your pocket and grab hold of the\nwriggling worm. Then, boom, push\nit down in your tight fitting boxers\nor try to push it so it\u2019s not as up-right. Or, if you\u2019re really desperate,\ntuck it into your belt. That may cut\noff circulation though.

Those that don\u2019t are either\nvery luck or a bit vain. Usually the latter. Occasionally they are\nswapped for lab goggles to perform various mating rituals known as\n\u201clabs\u201d where the student attempts to chat up their lab partner, only\nending in embarrassment for all involved.\nThe Studentium do contain sexual organs. However, they are almost never used. For a long time\na theory existed that somehow the Studentium\nreproduced through masturbation, as they spend\na siginificant portion of the day practicing this ac-tivity. It was latter found, through breakthrough,\nnight time surveillance, that they are actually just\nlonely and need something to help them relax at\nnight after seven hours of revision.\nThe mouth of the Studentium is almost exclusively used to partake in\nwhat is known in academic circles as\n\u201cshit chat\u201d and \u201ctalking about their\nboring subject\u201d. It is believed this is\na defence mechanism to ward off\nfriends. Many have been found to be\ncompletely incapable of using their\nmouth when around others.

    "content": "HANGMAN\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n43\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\nOhbitchuaries\nAfter a whole year of \u201cworking hard\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d, they all tragically\ndied in a series of mishaps. Their legacies are remembered here...\nPaul Beaumont\nPresident\nShiv Vorha\nMedics President\nHenry Whittaker\nClubs & Societies\nStefan Nubert\nFinance & Services\nDoug Hunt\nEducation\nBecky Lane\nWelfare\nW\nell know\nfor not being very serious when\nd e a l i n g\nwith Union matters, Paul died\nof exhaustion on a treadmill in\nEthos when someone pointed\nout it stated in the Constitution that he had to run for 5000\nhours on the highest setting\nbefore being allowed to \ufb01nish\nhis Presidency. Others would\nshy away from such a chal-lenge. However, deciding the\nConstitution was the most important document to ever exist\nin human history (\u201cFUCK THE\nMAGNA CARTA\u201d was his battle cry), Paul took the challenge\non.\nPaul did manage an impressive 24 seconds until the hunger pains started setting in. By\nthe end of it, his body was only\nidenti\ufb01ed by the note in his\npocket saying \u201cis a\ufb00ordable and\nclose housing that much to ask\npeople. Really.\u201d\nHe was known for campaigning against halls being built in\nActon and also bringing the students an open bar Summer Ball.\nAlthough the bar was only open\nto sta\ufb00 who would be behind\nthe bar selling drinks to people.\nHis \ufb01nal request was to be\nburied near to the university\nthat he cared about so deeply.\nTop dons at College therefore\nhave laid him to rest in Manchester, for a small but explain-able fee of \u00a310 million. hey\ndidn\u2019t tell anyone until after it\nwas done.\nA\nlways known for\nhis incredibly\nworking class accent and scru\ufb00y\nappearance, Shiv\nVorha was a big character in\nthe Medic world at Imperial.\nShiv met his sticky end in a\nliteral and metaphorical way.\nHe just couldn\u2019t handle being away from medicine for a\nyear, so he started to practice\nsurgery on himself. He decided that the best place to start\nwould be the scrotum. So he\nused a chainsaw to attempt\nto delicately shave himself to\nprepare for the operation. Unfortunately, at the time he was\nin Reynolds and the disgusted\ncrowd\u2019s chants put him o\ufb00. He\nslipped and the rest, as they\nsay, is a costly medical bill in\na private hospital as the A&E\nunits in all of the local hospitals were being closed to save\nmoney. At Reynolds someone\nshouted asking if a doctor was\nin the house. Everyone looked\nsheepishly at the \ufb02oor saying\n\u201cwe don\u2019t do that sort of thing\nuntil 5th year, sorry\u201d.\nSta\ufb00 at Reynolds had to use\nindustrial strength bleach to\nremove the semen and blood\nthat spewed out. hey have\nbeen paid treble overtime for\nthe trauma that they have re-ceived. His last words were, re-portedly: \u201cOn second thoughts,\nI should have just gone with\nthe scalpel\u201d. He was buried in\na t-shirt, stockings and with a\nstethoscope around his neck,\nas per his request.\nN\now he is mainly\nremembered for\nconquering the\nstage lighting,\nwhich he viewed\nas his main task for the year. As\na DramSoc techie there was\nonly one way that Henry was\never going to depart this Earth:\nautoerotic asphyxiation. Or,\nto give it its scienti\ufb01c name:\nchokewankmishap.\nhe alarm was raised when\nhe was not seen \ufb01ddling with\nsome kind of light for two\nweeks. By this stage his corpse\nhad several mice living in it.\nhe student that found him\ndied from shock and arousal.\nHenry is survived by thousands of hours worth of paperwork to do and an inbox full\nof unreplied emails asking for\nhelp with everything from getting dressed to buying a small\nisland in Greece, which, due to\nthe economic crisis, is actually\nsomething that 99% of clubs\ncan a\ufb00ord nowadays.\nDramSoc have decided to\nscript and rehearse a tribute\nplay to him. hey have enlisted the help of Keanu Reeves\nto play the title character of\nHenry. he play will be based\non scripts found in Henry\u2019s\ndraw. hey are all set in a \u2018utopian vision of the future\u2019, where\nthe Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) gets to order death\nby \ufb01ring squad to those that\n\ufb02aunt the rules in place. Keanu\nReeves said that he was \u201creally\nout of work and can\u2019t believe\nit\u2019s really come down to this\u201d.\nK\nangaroos and\nother animals\ngiddily bounced\non Stefan\u2019s limp,\nlifeless corpse\nmaking it only recognisable by\nthe expression on his face.\nLong know for his high-spir-its and cheery outlook on life,\nStefan occasionally rubbed\npeople up the wrong way by\nbeing too smiley all the time.\nHe risked getting smile lines,\nwhich, at his ripe old age of 92\nwould have been permanent.\nhe tale of how he came to\nend up in Australia is a strange\nand ba\ufb04ing one. After tasting\nthe Union food, he decided he\nneeded to \ufb02ee the country so\nhe wouldn\u2019t be associated with\nit. He nearly changed his mind.\nHe tried having a vodka coke\nto calm him down. Unfortunately he had to wait 5 minutes\nfor the tap to pour some mixer\ninto the plastic cup. By then he\nwas just to annoyed to change\nhis decision to \ufb02ee the coun-try. Using a stolen passport he\nmade his way to the airport.\nhe alarm was raised soon\nafter when someone wanted\nto buy something and so sent\na \u2018polite\u2019 email to him as a\nreminder that there is something to approve. On the run\nfrom the law he tried to hide\namongst the wild life down\nunder. His costume hadn\u2019t arrived as he was waiting for\nhimself to approve the ex-penditure. He was spotted as a\nfraud and stampeded. His last\nwords were \u201cBah Humbug\u201d\nE\nventually the dildo\npenetrated deep\nenough to cause\ndamage to the internal organs. hat\u2019s\nwhat the o\ufb03cial report says.\nhere are doubters who believe\nit could be a conspiracy theory.\nPerhaps killed by a Departmental Representative who no\nlonger gave a fuck about how\nmany people did SOLE.\nDoug was found in the bathroom of the Library by a student who did not wish to be\nnamed. His face was apparently\ntwisted into \u201ca mixture of relief\nand terror\u201d. he student is now\nbeing treated for post traumatic stress syndrome, and has\nbeen given extra time to resit\nher exams. Ironically, there is\nnow \ufb01nally an example of a student that has found a Deputy\nPresident (Education) to be actually useful in their role.\nA Hangman reporter showed\npictures of his corpse to friends\nto get a reaction. After they\nstopped laughing, they said\nthat they were upset to hear of\nhis demise.\nIt took over \ufb01ve weeks for\nDoug\u2019s rotting corpse to be\nfound. Most people saw his\nFacebook status updates had\nbecome spare and were glad\nabout it, deciding to not raise\nthe alarm.\nDoug was a lover of many\nthings, mainly dildos. Although\nhis demeanor means he will\nnot be missed by many people.\nActually, that sentence didn\u2019t\nneed the fourth \u201cm\u201d in it.\nR\narely did Becky\nLane ever touch\nalcohol. She was\nnoted for her t-to-tal attitude. In fact,\nshe used to faint at the sight of\nvodka. However this wasn\u2019t the\nway that she met her end.\nBecky brie\ufb02y ran for Union\nPresident, meaning she would\nbe a sabbatical for two years\nstraight. his was classed as a\nsure-\ufb01re sign of a serious mental health problem, and was, in\nall likelihood, a cry for help.\nShe was known for wanting to reduce stress in students\u2019 lives. What most people\ndon\u2019t know is that there was a\nlengthy legal battle after the\nmassages given to students in\nthe Library turned out to include happy endings. It was\na shame that it rained when\nthere was a bouncy castle on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, and an even bigger shame that she slipped and\ndied. Unfortunately for her everyone was bouncing so much\nthat nobody noticed. hey\neventually bounced so much\nthat she fell into a crevice.\nFast forward three months\nand nobody has realised. Except for the company that hires\nout bouncy castles. hey were\nterri\ufb01ed and scared they would\nlose their livelihoods. So they\nhatched a brilliant plan. hey\nhired a replacement to stand in\nfor her, like that stupid Elizabeth I rumour. he trickery was\ndiscovered last weekend when\neveryone realised Becky wasn\u2019t\noriginally a 6 foot 2 black guy.\n\n"

    "content": "King of the Artistic Jungle\nAlejandro Torrado Pacheco looks at a promising debut novel\nonathan is the King of the\nJungle. A small jungle,\nnestled in Central London, with its population of\ndrunks and crack-heads,\nsmack-heads and prostitutes, and the\no\ufb03ce girls eating their lunches in the\nSun. Once a painter and a major \ufb01gure in the London art scene, Jonathan\nis now a park-keeper and professional\n\u201ctramp shit picker-upper\u201d. He spends\nhis days taking care of the trees and\n\ufb02owerbeds, making sure the garden\nis clean and that its gates open and\nclose on time. Most de\ufb01nitely not the\nlife of an artist. It is clear early on that\nhe despises his previous life, he speaks\nbitterly of it and of other painters and\nwriters.\nMediocrity. Most of us know that\nfeeling: that however good you are at\nsomething you know that someone,\nsomewhere is inde\ufb01nitely superior,\nabsolutely brilliant at it, in that particular way that is both apparent after\njust a glance and yet unde\ufb01nable. Unless that one is you, of course. Mediocrity glori\ufb01ed: this would be the two-word de\ufb01nition of the contemporary\nart scene for Jonathan. His arrogance\n\ufb01ts his persona, as we learn that he\nwas indeed one of the best, if not the\nbest, the King. Even after four years of\nsilence he is recognised and admired\nwhen he makes an appearance in the\nart circles that his former college\nclassmates frequent.\nIt is puzzling to think that, in such\nconditions, he should hate that environment so much, to the point of\nretiring to a life that o\ufb00ers him no\nsatisfaction. he question \u201cWhy?\u201d\nspontaneously crops up in the reader\u2019s\nmind repeatedly, and mostly remains\nunsatis\ufb01ed. Silkwood manages to\ndraw a powerful character that we can\nonly fully appreciate in his entirety\nafter the last page is turned. hen, a\ncomplex human being appears; and\nhis sad, bitter story. Despite all his\nboasting, cutting humour and strong\nopinions the picture of Jonathan that\nemerges is one of deep insecurity; not\nthe super\ufb01cial kind, but the struggle of\na man unable to hold on to anything\ngood that he possesses.\nIf it is not art it is love, and the prospect of a life spent with a woman and\ntheir child. he artist too-brilliant-to-risk-mediocrity prefers anonymity (a\nword that comes up a lot) and \u201cthe shit\nend of the stick\u201d. He doesn\u2019t want to be\npart of the fake world of private views\nand glossed up appearances; he wants\nto \ufb01nd \u201cin the mundane the fantastic\u201d;\nhe chooses the low-lives instead, and\nhe ends up one of them, drunk all day\nevery day, losing contact with his peo-ple, his friends, his love and his child.\nOne cannot help but think that the\nscorn Jonathan feels is unjusti\ufb01ed. It\nis more of an internal \ufb01ght than anything else. His lonely bitterness and\nself-destructive impulses take over\ncompletely as he tries to erase himself\nfrom the world. And just when he is\nabout to pull himself out of it, someone else does the job for him.\nIt would be unfair to reduce the novel to this psychological reading. It is\nclassically post-modern, attacking the\nsuper\ufb01ciality and attachment to appearance of modern society. he rare\nmoments of human compassion and\nkindness in the book, very powerfully\ndelivered by Silkwood, involve people at the fringe of society; the author\nmanages, through Jonathan\u2019s eyes, to\nJ\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 21 JULY\n30\npaint a dark world, almost without us\nnoticing. he story is told slowly, in a\nbrusque and direct way. he use of the\nsecond person engages the reader and\nthe book feels like a confession, a painful trickle of memories and feelings.\nhe \u201cKing\u201d is not without \ufb02aws,\nsuch as the lack of development of\nsome of the themes introduced, and\nthe predictability of the ending, which\nfelt as inevitable as it was foregone. It\nremains however a great e\ufb00ort by a\nyoung author. As the \ufb01rst volume of\na trilogy, King of the Jungle certainly\nholds good promises for the following\nbooks, where hopefully the room for\nimprovement available will be made\nuse of.\n\n"

This abstractdoodlewasdrawnbyIoannaKalogeraki.\nFRIDAY 21 JUNE\n28\nhat does it mean\nto be an \u2018Outsider Artist\u2019?\nWhile the majority of famous artists follow the time-tested route from\nthe art school to the gallery, there are\nthose who slip through the cracks of\nartistic society, exploring their creative\nvisions outside the atelier. he majority of these artists trickle away into ob-scurity, but this summer, a select group\nof the outside art world has found a\nhome in London, being displayed in\nboth the Wellcome Collection and the\nHayward Gallery.\nhe term \u2018Outsider Art\u2019 originated\nfrom the French artist Jean Dubuffet\u2019s idea of art brut, and describes\nart made outside the structure of the\nmainstream artistic world, by artists\nwho have often received no formal\ntraining. Similar to na\u00efve art, outsider\nart often makes use of improbable per-spective, simplistic forms, and bold\ncolours, creating works which are de\ufb01antly di\ufb00erent to the mainstream artistic culture; the di\ufb00erences are not only\nin the manner of the work, but also\nwhere it is created \u2013 most outsider\nartists do not work out of an o\ufb03cial\nstudio, instead working in their home,\nor as part of therapy.\nIt is the role of art as occupational\ntherapy that is explored in the Wellcome Collection\u2019s latest exhibition;\nentitled \u2018Souzou\u2019, a Japanese term with\nno direct translation, but meaning im-agination, or creation, it collects work\nfrom 46 artists who are attendees and\nresidents at a number of social welfare\ninstitutions. Many of these artists have\nsome form of mental disability, but experience the overwhelming desire to\ncreate, producing work that re\ufb02ects\ntheir unique world view.\nSome of the works, such as Shinichi\nSawada\u2019s mythical monsters, bristling\nwith spiky points, come directly from\nthe artist\u2019s imagination, but a large majority relate to everyday objects in the\nartist\u2019s life. Hiroyuki Komatsu\u2019s clunky\ncartoons encapsulate episodes and\nplot arcs of his favourite morning TV\nshows, while Daisuke Kibushi\u2019s work\nconsists of reproductions of post-war\nmovie posters, meticulously recreated\nfrom memory.\nhese works possibly provide a way\nfor the artist to express what they feel\nabout the world around them; with\na alphabet system as complicated as\nJapanese, it can often be di\ufb03cult for\nthe artists to articulate what they want\nto say, and working with media gives\nthem an outlet.\nHowever, although many of the artists do have mental health problems,\nit would be ill-informed \u2013 and o\ufb00enW\nOutsider art\nFred Fyles examines a new art craze\nsive \u2013 to see them as child-like. A large\nnumber of the works deal with issues\nof relationships, both platonic and sex-ual, such as Masao Obata\u2019s cardboard\npictures, which feature the recurring\nmotif of couples, and relate to his lifelong ambition to get married. Others,\nsuch as Marie Suzuki, use art to express a far darker side of their person-ality. Her cramped, claustrophobic images of sexual intimacy have a pulsing\nundercurrent of fear, and are crammed\nwith groping hands, worms, and vulvic\nimagery. Sakiko Kono\u2019s woollen dolls\nstrike a happier note, portraying kind\nsta\ufb00 from the residential facility she\nhas called home for the last 55 years.\nSimilarly, it would be untrue to\npresume that there is a lack of self-awareness on the artists\u2019 part; Yoko\nKubota projects her own desires for\nbeauty onto her drawings of models,\ncopied from fashion magazines, while\nYukiko Yamada\u2019s series of delicate\nwatercolour portraits, entitled She Is\nNobody, can be seen as an existential\ncall to arms, exploring ideas of self-importance, uncertainty, and anonym-ity. Even Takahiro Shimoda\u2019s pyjamas,\nfestooned with images of his favourite\nfoods, display a keen sense of humour\nand self-awareness\nhroughout the exhibition there is\nan underlying theme of repetition;\nsince the art is a form of occupational\ntherapy, much of the works centre\naround a single idea that fascinates\nthe artist. Both Mineo Ito and Ryoko\nKoda utilise their own names in their\nworks, Ito repeatedly writing it until\nit becomes a dense scrawl, and Koda\nre\ufb01ning hers into a single symbol,\nwhich she then writes again and again;\nthese works remind me the In\ufb01nity\nNet series by Yayoi Kusama \u2013 another\nJapanese artist who has been institu-tionalised due to mental illness \u2013 in\nwhich repeated crescent shapes coalesce to form a net pattern. his repetition is combined with the theme of\nunorthodox working material in Shota\nKatsube\u2019s army of miniatures, created\nfrom the twist-ties used to fasten bags;\neach \ufb01gurine is unique, and minutely\ndetailed, while the sheer scale of the\nnumber of pieces make the work quite\noverwhelming.\nWhile this exhibition shows the role\nthat art can have in the lives of the\nmentally ill, a role that includes self-representation, actualisation, and personal exploration, if we cross the river\nwe can \ufb01nd another group of outsider\nartists creating very di\ufb00erent works,\n\n"
