We had our own\nfreedom in mind, conquest over the\n'pe in ture vend eure s' XI( Painting\nSellers). The \u00a311 million exchanged\nfor Turner's masterpiece was not\ninstrumental enough to mute our\ntrumpeting tunes.\nThe game opened with a Charlie\nParker tumult eo us saxophone solo,\nas Holloway blew hard towards an\nearly lead. However, Charlie\nParker's dead, so with a flourish of\nbrass we took control of the game.\nOur midfield came up trumps as the\nvirtuoso channel of Lain-Fairhurst\ngainfully opened our account. The\nsun was shining. (1-0.)\nMore beams of golden light\ndance'd over Holloway's cloudy\ndefence. They parted again letting\nSteve Ian cross from the left\nallowing E Spencer Penfold to\ndisplay his span gly collared\ngoal mouth panache\\ no one could\nbelieve it. We couldn't believe it,\nthey couldn't believe it. Perhaps we\nwere under the influence still in Da\nSnooker\nTwo IC teams set out for Glasgow\nand the annual university snooker\nchampionships. Both teams got off\nto bad starts against tough\nopposition the ' A' team winning\nonly one of three group matches and\nthe ' B' team losing all three.\nThere were better things to come\non the second day as the ' A' team\nfound their touch with an inspiring\nperformance from Paul Kellet who\ndidn't lose a frame all day and solid\nplay by the rest of the team. A series of stunning victories saw the\n' A' team through to the final of the\nsecond stream tournament with the\n'B's losing in the first round. The\nfinal was a close match against\nQueens (Belfast) ' B' team but\ndespite a comeback from 45 points\nbehind by Paul Kellet in one frame,\na string of black ball defeats put the\npressure on and the IC 'A' team had\nto settle for second place. Queens\nthen completed a clean sweep of the\nprizes winning the first stream and\nsingles competitions. IC will be\nback next year.\nRugby 1sts Triumph\nVinci's, but no! It was real. We\nwere swinging like Big Bill Bronzy\nand his big swing band. As lapp in' bass solo from the aforementioned\nStephen Lam was rewarded by a trip to the floor. John Furlong\ncompleted our treble clef of goals\nfrom the penalty spot.\nSo, at half time, the score rang\nlike the Mardi Gras through the\nsmokey New Orleans atmosphere\nwhich had strangely intoxicated us.\n3-0 to IC (yi pee). In the true sense of sporting\nclich es, the second half was as sick\nas a parrot's hospital. We sat back\nand let Holloway's wind sway\nthrough our defensive quack grass.\nBasically we were all played out, a team waiting for the whistle. It was\nnot a surprise when they got one\nback. A bit of suet dumpling\ncarefully dropped on our plate. It\nwoke us up and heavy limbs started\nto get back on the road. Holloway\nwasted their remaining\nopportunities and our one-legged\nlong jumpers sprung into the sand\npit of victory. Chariots swung,\nhorns played and Imperial Hockey\nTeam had finally fulfilled their early\nseasonal promise. (Many thanks to\nour galant supporters who shouted\nat us when we needed it.)\nIC44 Thames Valley University\u20140\nDespite the dry, warm conditions\nwhich were ideal for open running\nrugby, IC started in rather nervous\nfashion with several passes not\ngoing to hand and some good ball\nwasted. This was no doubt due to\na combination of lack of match\npractice and the team's excitement\nat seeing a number of spectators\nwatching the action. However, the\ncrowd was sent into rapture at the\naward of an early penalty and the\nsight of fly-half Stuart 'Jean-Ba'\nPaynter opening his legs to slot the\nball between the uprights. A few\nmint u es later, Paynter broke blind\nand deftly stroked a kick through\nthe Thames Valley defence for left\nwing Dave Bolton to catch the ball\nfor the first time since Christmas\nand touch down in the corner.\nThe score remained at 8-0 until\ngood work by Andrew\nMontgomery and Chris Telling sent\nRichard Stubbs over for the first of\nhis two tries, which Paynter\nconverted to the screams of his fans\non the touch-line. Two more tries\nfollowed before half time from\nSteve Townsend, a second row who\nseemed more at home on the right\nwing, and from Montgomery who\ncrashed over from two yards out,\ntaking the whole opposition pack\nwith him. By the time Paynter\nslotted the conversion, the cheerleaders had been forced to retire due\nto exhaustion.\nSustained pressure after half time\nled eventually to a pushover try for\nTelling which Paynter strode up\nmanfully to convert. As the second\nhalf drew to a close, IC scored\ntwice more. The penultimate try\ncame after a poor Thames Valley\nclearance kick was fielded by\nStubbs who sent Roger Gilchrist\nover. However the final try was the\npiece de res it ance of the whole\nseason. A great drive down the left\nby the IC pack led to fast ball which\nenables Paynter to utilise the pace\noutside him. Quick, sharp passing\nfrom centres Anton Fields and Nick\nFinn and full back Gilchrist fed\nStubbs who managed to shrug off\nthe covering defence (but not his\n'Fat Boy' reputation) to score in the\ncorner and make the final score\n44-0.\nIC: Gilchrist (c), Stubbs, Finn,\nFields, Bolton, Paynter,\nMontgomery, Corbett, Carr,\nBaker, Townsend, Drage,\nDennison, Orr, Telling.\nPakSoc \u2014IC Champions!!\nThe conclusion of the indoor soccer\ntournament took place last Friday.\nThe Pakistan Society and AntiApartheid Society teams had\nreached the final after beating tough\nopposition i.e. the Sikh Society and\nCypriot Society teams respectively\nin the semi-finals the day before.\nBoth semi-finals were closely\ncontested with special mention for\nthe spirited performance put up by\nthe Sikh Society who played\nundoubtedly their best game of the\ntournament and were unlucky to\nlose. The Cypriot Society team also\nwere unfortunate to lose to the AntiApartheid Society who gave a professional performance. Dinos\n(Cypriot Society goalkeeper) was\nagain at his best and had a terrific\nmatch, and deserves the award as\nthe goalkeeper of the tournament.\nThe player of the tournament\naward goes to Peter D 'Mello who\nhaving scored 40 odd goals helped\nthe Pakistani team reach the final.\nIn the final he yet again scored vital\ngoals at vital times. He has the\nuncanny ability of being at the right\nplace at the right time. He did this\na few times in the final, at the\nfrustration of the Anti-Apartheid\nteam. The final was a thrilling game\nwith the Pakistani team taking the\nearly initiative in the first half. They\nbuilt up a three goal lead and it\nseemed as if they were sailing\ntowards victory. However, the\nsecond half saw the Anti-Apartheid\nSociety make a spirited effort to get\nback into the game. With a flowing\ngame, played in a good spirit and\nattractive to watch there were\nnumerous chances, and many\nchances went begging or were well\nsaved by the respective\ngoalkeepers. As the game drew on\nthe Anti-Apartheid team drew\nwithin two goals of the Pakistani\nteam, the goal scoring attribution of\nPeter D 'Mello saw the Pakistani\nteam home, winning by three clear\ngoals. The final score was 8-5 to the\nPakistan Society.\nThe game was a great advert for\nthe footballing potential available\nwithin Imperial College and the\nOverseas societies. However, there\nis still a need for this footballing\ntalent to be nurtured and given a chance to be used at a higher level.\nOverall the indoor football\ntournament has proved to be a great\nsuccess. I would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all the people\nwho have contributed and\nparticipated in the tournament.

    "content": "'eat ure12 March 1993 Felix 962\nExcellence thru enjoyment\nKeith McNully Bass voice representative at IC Choir examines the\n130th performance of that august body.\nIn the Great Hall on 19th March,\nImperial College Choir will\nperform its 130th concert. Ever\nsince its foundation in January 1950\nthe tradition of giving a performance every term has been\nunbroken. The present conductor,\nEric Brown, has conducted 115 of\nthese concerts and is now in his 40th year as conductor of IC Choir.\nNumerous times has Queen\nAlexandra's House, the RCM and,\nafter 1969, the Great Hall been\nfilled to hear yet another rendition\nfrom a choir whose reputation has\ngrown tremendously since its\nformation.\nAmong the choir's many\nperformances has been the London\nPremiere of Benjamin Britten's Hymn to St Peter, in 1955, under\nImogen Hoist, and the World\nPremiere of Christopher Shaw's No\nRoom at the Inn. Also memorable\nfor a different reason is the choir's performance of Britten's unaccompanied Hymn to St Cecilia,\nin which under-ventilation and\nfatigue resulted in the choir\ndropping pitch by a full tone and a half. The situation was saved by a soloist who, in sheer panic, sang a solo that was completely different\nfrom what was written in the score,\nbut somehow managed to restore\nthe pitch, thus saving the piece from\ntotal collapse.\nToday, IC Choir is just as strong,\nif not stronger than ever. How has\nthe choir managed to survive the\nenvironment of a purely scientific\ncollege? Firstly, and perhaps most\nimportantly, the choir considers\ntalent secondary to dedication.\nDedication is something you need\nto be a member. Talent is developed\nwhile you are a member. For this\nreason, the choir does not audition.\nIt simply requires that you attend a minimum number of rehearsals in\norder to sing in the concert.\nFurthermore, members of the\nchoir find a good balance in their\nactivities. For every hour of\nrehearsal there is an hour of fun.\nThis is particularly evident in the\nchoir's weekends away. The first of\nthe year comes in mid-February to\nBedgebury, an all-girls hording\nschool in Kent. Here, an intensive\nrehearsal schedule is well\ncomplemented with opportunities to\nenjoy the surrounding countryside,\na quiz and games night on Saturday,\nfollowed by the highlight of the\nweekend\u2014the infamous Bedgebury\nBonfire.\nThe second weekend away comes\non the last weekend of the Easter\nvacation, to Pigotts, a farm/music\ncamp in Buckinghamshire. Pigotts\nhas been an annual date on the\nchoir's calendar for almost 30\nyears, and its reputation has made\nmembers all too pleased to give up\nthe last weekend of their holiday.\nAs well as fitting nine rehearsals\ninto three days, there is plenty of\ntime to enjoy the spring sunshine\n(providing it doesn't snow like it did\nin 1981). The team of cooks\nproduce food to suit all tastes, while\nIC Choir in 1954\nthe Pigott's Barn Dance is possibly\nthe most popular social event of the\nyear.\nAll this madness, however, must\nhave an organising force behind it,\nand that is the job of the Choir\nCommittee. Annual committees\nhave unfailingly managed to make\nthe choir's year run smoothly. They\nhave had to deal with numerous\ncrises over the years. For example,\njust before the 100th concert in\nMarch 1983, the Mezzo-Soprano\nsoloist, Mary Lloyd Davies, was\ntaken ill. At the last minute, a replacement was drafted in in the\nform of Miss Anne Mason, and the\nconcert became yet another success\nfor IC Choir.\nUltimately, though, it is in the\nter rn ly concerts that the choir shows\nthe true dedication and talent of its\nmembers. Next week's concert\nshould be no exception. Mozart's Solemn Vespers, Mendelssohn's Lobgesang Choral Symphony and\nthe strange but rhythmically\nexciting Brazilian Psalm by Jean\nBerger should provide yet another\nenjoyable evening courtesy of IC\nChoir.\nThen back to business, when\npreparation starts at Pigotts for the\n131st termly concert. Perhaps this\nis the secret of IC Choir's success,\nits un halting continuity in moving\nfrom one concert to the next. There\nis no time to relax, it's heads down\nstraight away in preparation for the\nnext performance. In this way the\nchoir gathers momentum through\nexperience and is constantly\napproaching the excellence it strives\nfor.\nIC Choir's Easter concert takes\nplace in the Great Hall on Friday,\n19th March at 8pm. Tickets can be\npurchased from Choir members or\nthe Central Library, price \u00a32 for\nstudents and \u00a35 for non-students.\nStudent price is \u00a33 on the door.\nThe Choir also welcomes new\nmembers. They rehearse on\nThursday evenings at 6.15pm in\nMech Eng 342. If you are interested\nin singing in the Summer Concert\nyou must attend the rehearsal on\nThursday 25th March in order to\nfind out how to get to Pigotts.\nLadies from other University of\nLondon colleges are welcome to\njoin.\nPage 10\n\n"

Tom Snow,\nLondon area officer for the National\nUnion of Public Employees\n(NUPE), says that plans by the\nUniversity to make 98 cleaners\nredundant are a breach of\nUniversity employment protection\nregulations. Mr Snow says that the\nUniversity plans to save money will\n'exploit the poverty trap of the\nprivate cleaning market in London.'\nPeter Howell, a principal of one\nof the University colleges, denied\nthe University was breaking the\nlaw, and said that the cleaners were\nbeing offered severance terms\n'twice as good as the statutory\nrequirement.' NUPE claims that\nsome staff are only being offered 12\nweeks pay if they leave work\nimmediately. The University says\nthe redundancies will save 47% of\nthe cleaning budget. The cleaners,\nwho work in 6 of the 8\nintercollegiate Halls of Residences,\nare to be served with notices of\ndismissal on 19th March. In past\nredundancy cases, redundancy\norders were served with 90 days\nnotice.\nDeans Change\nby Andrew Tseng The two largest constituent colleges\nwill have new Deans come the next\nacademic year.\nProfessor Bruce Sayers will step\ndown as the Dean of the City and\nGuilds College at the end of\nSeptember. He makes way for\nProfessor Julia Higgins, currently\nthe College's Senior Tutor, who\nwill hold the position from October\n1 to 31 August 1994.\nThe new Dean of the Royal\nCollege of Science will be Professor\nJohn Pendry, from the Department\nof Physics. He replaces Professor\nTrevor Stuart and has been elected\nto hold the position from 1\nSeptember to 31 August 1996.\nThe Deans of St Mary's and the\nRoyal School of Mines,\nrespectively Professor Peter\nRichards and Professor Tim Shaw,\ncontinue in their current post.\nIC Virtuoso\nby Declan Curry\nA17 year old violinist will take\ncentre stage tonight for the spring\nconceit from Imperial College\nOrchestra. Lucy Jeal, studying in\nthe Royal College of Music, will\nplay solo violin in Tchaikovsky's 'Violin Concerto'. The concert,\nwhich begins in the Great Hall at\n8pm, will also include Debussy's 'Nocturnes', and Stravinsky's 'Rite\nof Spring'. Miss Jeal, a pupil at\nlocal Westminster School, has\nplayed in several major venues in\nLondon, including the Royal\nFestival Hall and the Queen\nElizabeth Hall. The concert will be\nconducted by Imperial's Richard\nDickens.\nCounselling Call\nby Declan Curry\nSchools and colleges have been\nordered to pay more attention to\nstudent counselling. Tim Bos well,\nthe Higher Education Minister, said\nthat high drop out rates in further\neducation were due to insufficient\nattention being paid to students and\ntheir progress. Mr Bos well added\nthat counselling may be one of the\nnew performance indicators for\nfuture further education funding.\nMore student counselling is\nprovided in higher education than\nin further education. Don\nAdlington, Student Counsellor at\nImperial College, said that there\nwere arguments to show that\ncounselling had an effect on dropout rates in higher education. 'It is\nalmost certainly true that students\nstay in the university system due to\ncounselling support through\ndifficult periods,' he said. Legal,\ndebt, financial and immigration\nadvice is provided by Stef Ruis,\nImperial College Union Advisor.\nMr Ruis can be contacted on\ninternal extension 3507, and is\navailable between Monday and\nThursday, except for Wednesday\nmorning. Mr Adlington has an\noffice on the first floor of 15\nPrince's gardens, and can be\ncontacted on internal extension\n3041. He can see students during\nnormal office hours, and says that\nhe is 'always anxious to see people\nquickly.'\nFood Fight!\nMary's students join in their annual food fight at Charing Cross Hospital.\nSome years the fire brigade have been called to clear up the mess.\nC&G Hustings\nby Andrew Tseng The first ever City and Guilds\nCollege Union (C& GCU) hustings\noccurred on Tuesday.\nVery few new policies or ideas\nwere brought forward. Standing for\nthe post of President, Paul Griffith\nproposed a City and Guilds Sports\nDay. And in a year that has seen the\nConstituent College Unions lose\ntheir student appeal, Joe Baguley,\nstanding for Vice President, called\nfor C&GC U to increase its profile.\nOf those posts available only the\npost of the City and Guilds College\nAssociation Representative sees a member of this year'sC&G CU Exec standing.\nThe most closely contested post\nlooks set to be that of Ents Chair.\nTim Atkinson, who last year was\ndefeated in the election for the post\nof Honorary Junior Treasurer,\nstands against Subhashis\nChowdhury. Mr Chowdhury has\npromised an increase in the number\nof joint events with other\nUniversities.\nNew Election will be standing for\nall posts. Voting will take place in\nC&G Department Foyers on 15th and 16th March from 12-2pm. Silwood Outreach\nby Declan Curry\nImperial College Union (ICU) held\nanother 'outreach' stall on\nWednesday of this week. Members\nof ICU staff travelled to Silwood\nPark at Ascot to meet students and\nraise awareness of the Union. Chris\nDavidson, ICU President, said that\nthe event was a 'very successful\nday', adding that Silwood students\nwere 'pleased with the effort made\nin bringing the Union to them'.\nAfter a tour of research labs and\nfacilities, Mr Davidson, along with\nMichelle Began, Union\nReceptionist, and Stef Ruis, Union\nAdvisor, held a meeting with\nSilwood students. Mr Davidson said\nthat students at Silwood were\ndisappointed that they did not\nqualify for the 'London weighting'\nfor local authority maintenance\ngrants, and also had problems with\ncatering and accommodation. Mr Davidson added that he would be\nlooking at grant levels and the levels\nof food pricing at Silwood. Rick\nBilby, ICU Deputy President,\nwould look at accommodation\nmatters. The Silwood stall follows\non from a similar stall set up\nrecently in the Junior Common\nRoom (JCR) at South Kensington.\nImperial College Union is said to be\npleased with response to this first\nstall.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 962\nReviews12 March 1993\nDivine Words This extraordinary production by\nthe Loose Change Company is the\nBritish Premiere of Divine Words.\nIt is the story of a group of\nsomewhat repulsive villagers in\nrural Galicia (in the north west of\nSpain) in the twenties. A mentally\nand physically disabled young man,\nwho is pulled around in a primitive\ncart, is orphaned, and despite the\ninconvenience of having to care for\nsuch an invalid, his aunt and uncle\nfight to look after him. Their\nmotives, however, are not altruistic.\nIt can easily be assumed, whilst\nwatching it, that the play is an attack\non the hypocrisy of a society who\nproclaim to be strict Catholics, but\nin fact, are rather selfish. However,\nthe author (Valle-Inclan) is simply\ntelling a story, and if anything, is\nshowing how human codes of\nbehaviour contradict our natural\ninstinct.\nThe acting is brilliant, and the\nprops, despite being simple,\nenhance the atmosphere and make\nthe play a little more light-hearted.\nThe dialogue is carried out in an\nIrish accent whose 'colouring and\nlyricism seem to be the nearest\napproximation to Galician.' This, I think, is rather apt, although a couple of characters are more\ndifficult to understand. The music,\ntoo, is very well suited to the story.\nDon't go and see it if you are\nlooking for a laugh or two. The\ncharacters are, as I have said, rather\ngrotesque and the story could be\ndescribed as a little disturbing.\nOtherwise, it has my wholehearted\nrecommendation.\nBill\n\u2022 BAC, Lavender Hill, Bus 45a from South Kensington. Box Office\n071-223 2223. Tickets \u00a36-\u00a37.50 to\nMarch 21st. Running Dream The action of Running Dream takes\nplace simultaneously in Dominica\nand England. Essentially, it is\nconcerned with the lives of three\nsisters, Grace (Sherlina\nChamberlain), Clementine\n(Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and\nBianca (Cathy Tyson), but to say\nthat it is their story is misleading for\nthat implies a kind of linear\nprogression from beginning to\nmiddle to end. Trish Cooke's play\nis a more truthful portrayal of life\nand she resists the temptation to\nimpose any author i al, all-knowing\ninterpretation. However because of\nthe humour (uninhibited laughter\nabounds) one leaves the theatre with\nthe sense of satisfaction that even\nif life is not explicable it is funny.\nCoupled with its wit, the strength\nof the play is its music. It is almost\ninsulting to compare the music\npresent in Running Dream to that\nof a musical which seems plagued\nwith the eternal question, how do\nwe start singing and yet appear to\nbe normal humans going about our\neveryday life? Rather, the music\nhere seems to beat out the\nsubconscious, it is the heart and soul\nof the play\u2014something larger than\nthe play. In Running Dream we\nhave the perfect blend of bittersweet humour, music and real life.\nSJ. \u2022 Theatre Royal Stratford East,\nGerry Raffles Square, E15,\nStratford East tube/BR.

The Merchant Of Venice This was a joy to watch, not only\nbecause I think that this is one of\nShakespeare's finest, but the cast\nwere right for the role. The part of\nAntonio was played extremely well\n- full marks to Paul Hatton. Others\nworth mentioning are Andrew\nMcDonald (Shylock) and Sarah Ball\n(Jessica).

Opera\nThe Mikado Purists might feel surprised when\nthe curtain rises upon this\nproduction of The Mikado; it is set\nin an English country club, in the\n1920s, and all the characters\n(despite claims to be Japanese) are\nRunning Dream\ntotally English. Ah, but this is a revival of the Jonathan Miller\nproduction, and a delight to watch.\nRichard Stuart has replaced Eric\nIdle as Ko-Ko, and plays the part\nwith enormous enthusiasm: his\nrendition of the (revised) Lord High\nExecutioner's song, 'I 've got al it de list', had the audience in stitches.\nNanki-Poo, sung by Barry Banks,\nwas a touch indistinct at times but\ngenerally quite reasonable; Katisha,\nsung by Anne Collins, was quite\nsuperb, and won the audience's hearts, with her ferocious stalking\nabout the stage and vicious delivery.\nA marvellous production and pure\njoy to watch,\nScarlet.\n\u2022 The London Coliseum, St\nMartin's Lane, Charing Cross or\nLeicester Square tubes.

    "content": "'eat ure Felix 962 12 March 1993\nToo X treme?\nZaeem Sivardeen shows the side of Malcolm X not revealed in Spike\nLee's film, that of a true muslim.\nMore than twenty-eight years after\nhis death, Malcolm-X \u2014Alhajj\nMalik El-Shabazz\u2014still towers over\nthe Statue of Liberty. He refuses to\ndie. And with the release of Spike\nLee's film X this Friday the 5th of\nMarch, his memory continues to\nlive.\nWith the film has come the hype.\nEveryone claims him to be of\nthem\u2014from civil rights activists to\nblack nationalists; from rappers to\neven socialists (!). And of course,\nthere are the Muslims, who also\nclaim him. Afterall, it was Islam\nthat Malcolm X advocated as a solution to the Race Problem. At\nfirst he was a member of the deviant\nblack nationalist group, so called\n\"The Nation of Islam' and then after\nhis Pilgrimage to Mecca he reverted\nto mainstream Islam. His period in\nmainstream Islam was short\u2014and\nas a result the film X does not cover\nit in great detail, but this short part\nof his life was the most important\npart. The ideas he had at this time\nwere the ideas which he died\nwith\u2014indeed, it was probably\nbecause of these new ideas he had,\nbased on mainstream Islam, that he\nwas killed.\nBelow is a letter he wrote to 'his\nloyal assistants in Harlem....from\nhis heart.'\n'Never have I witnessed such\nsincere hospitality and the\noverwhelming spirit of true\nbrotherhood as is practised by\npeople of all colours and races here\nin this ancient Holyland, the home\nof Abraham and Muhammed... For\nthe past week, I have been utterly\nspeechless and spellbound by the\ngraciousness I see displayed all\naround me by people of all\ncolours...\n...There were tens of thousands\nof pilgrims, from all over the\nworld. They were of all colours,\nfrom blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all\nparticipating in the same ritual,\ndisplaying a spirit of unity and\nbrotherhood that my experiences in\nAmerica had led me to believe\nnever could exist between the white\nand non-white.\nAmerica needs to understand\nIslam, because this is the one\nreligion that erases the race\nproblem. Throughout my travels in\nthe Muslim World, I have met,\ntalked to, and even eaten with\npeople who in America would have\nbeen considered 'white'\u2014but the\n'white' attitude was removed from\ntheir minds by the religion of Islam.\nI have never before seen sincere and\ntrue brotherhood practised by all\ncolours together, irrespective of\ntheir colour.\nYou may be shocked by these\nwords coming from me. But on\nthis pilgrimage, what I have seen,\nand experienced, has forced me to\nrearrange much of my thought\npatterns previously held, and to toss\naside some of my previous\nconclusions. This was not too\ndifficult for me. Despite my firm\nconvictions, I have been always a man who tries to face facts, and to\naccept the reality of life as new\nexperience and new knowledge\nunfolds it. I have always kept an\nopen mind, which is necessary to\nthe flexibility that must go hand in\nhand with every form of intelligent\nsearch for truth.\nDuring the past eleven days here\nin the Muslim World, I have eaten\nfrom the same plate, drunk from the\nsame glass, and slept in the same\nbed (or on the same rug)\u2014while\npraying to the same God\u2014with\nfellow Muslims, whose eyes were\nthe bluest of blue, whose hair was\nthe blondest of blonde, and whose\nskin was the whitest of white. And\nin the words and in the deeds and\nin the actions of the 'white' Muslim,\nI felt the same sincerity that I felt\namong the black African Muslims\nof Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana.\nWe were truly all the same\n(brothers)\u2014because of their belief\nin One God had removed the\n'white' from their minds, the\n'white' from their behaviour, and\nthe 'white' from their attitude.\nI could see from this, that perhaps\nif white Americans could accept the\nOneness of God, then perhaps too,\nthey could accept in reality the\nOneness of Man\u2014and cease to\nmeasure, and hinder, and harm\nothers in terms of their 'differences'\nin colour.\nWith racism plaguing America\nlike an incurable cancer, the socalled 'Christian' white American\nheart should be more receptive to\na proven solution to such a destructive problem. Perhaps it\ncould be in time to save America\nfrom imminent disaster\u2014the same\ndestruction brought upon Germany\nby racism that eventually destroyed\nthe Germans themselves.\nEach hour here in the Holyland\nenables me to have greater spiritual\ninsights into what is happening in\nAmerica between black and white.\nThe American Negro never can be\nblamed for his social animosities\u2014\nhe is only reacting to four hundred\nyears of the conscious racism of the\nAmerican whites. But as racism\nleads America up the suicide path,\nI do believe, fr m the experiences\nthat I have had with them, that the\nwhites of the younger generation,\nin the colleges and universities, will\nsee the hand-writing on the wall and\nmany of them will turn to the\nspiritual path of truth\u2014the. only way\nleft to American to ward off the\ndisaster that racism inevitably leads\nto.\nNever have I been so highly\nhonoured-. Never have I been made\nto feel more humble and unworthy.\nWho would believe the blessings\nthat have been heaped upon an\nAmerican Negro? A few nights\nago, a man who would be called in\nAmerica a 'white' man, a United\nNations diplomat, an ambassador,\na companion of kings, gave me his\nhotel suite, his bed.\nNever would I have even thought\nof dreaming that I would ever be a recipient of such honours\u2014honours\nthat in America would be bestowed\nupon a king\u2014not a Negro.\nAll praise is due to Allah, the\nLord of All the Worlds.\nSincerely,\nEl-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.\n(Malcolm X). It's quite clear that Malcolm X, after going through much\nexperience came to the conclusion\nthat mainstream Islam\u2014the love\nand obedience of the One Creator\nof the Worlds\u2014and not black\nNationalism nor the deviant 'Nation\nof Islam', nor socialism (!), is the\nonly thing that could bring the\nvarious races of humanity together\nunder one umbrella of peace, love\nand harmony.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\n12 March 1993 Felix 962\nTravellers World Guides Christopher Riley takes an\nimaginary trip to Southeast Asia to\ntest the new travel guide boos from\n'Travellers World Guide'.\nSo you've just arrived at the railway\nstation at Saigon, and you want a cheap but safe hotel for the night.\nYou're new to Vietnam, the\ncurrency, the people, the politics.\nThis is what your travel guides are\nfor - to guide you through the\nnightmare of travel tribulations laid\nto waylay you and wear you down\nalong the way.\nThe sweat is running down your\nforehead, as you strain to stand up\nin the sauna conditions, your\nrucksack keeping you buoyant in\nthe platform crush. There are five\nlittle men tugging you this way and,\nthat, as you fumble with your guide\nbook to check the hotel as they are\ntrying to entice you in to.\nAs with all guide books, space is\nat a premium, and consequently the\nwriting is small and closely spaced.\nDespite this the 'Thailand,\nIndochina & Burma' handbook\n(\u00a313.95) runs to 816 pages, and the\nhardback although only 11x19 cm,\nweighs over 400 grams. Both are\nimportant when you only have one\nsmall bag to cram everything into\nfor maybe 12 months.\nSo how do these little white\nguides stand up to seeking quick\ninformation about obscure back\nstreet markets, changing money\nduring the national holidays, or\nbuying a ticket for the weekly bus\nto Can To on the Mekong Delta.\nToo many guides on the market are\ngreat on the history and the culture\nof obscure, 'off the beaten track\nplaces', but they don't give you\nenough information to get there.\nIn contrast to many tame tour\nguides, the travellers World Guides\nare marketed as the definitive\nhandbook for the independent\ntraveller. The book begins with a short practical introduction,\nincluding a detailed section on\nhealth care, followed by an\noverview of the region. The book\nis then divided into countries, each\nof which begins with its geography,\nhistory, culture, religion, politics\nand economics, with even enough\ndetail to cover the local radio\nfrequencies for the BBC World\nService and the Voice of\nAmerica., .etc. After these\nformalities are out of the way, the\ntravel nitty-gritty are covered,\nstarting with the capital then\ncovering the country region by\nregion.\nBut just how practical is this\ninformation being a new and\nindependent traveller in town?\nThere are a few things to do before\nseeing the sights and sounds. The\nfirst order of the day is a ticket to\nyour next destination and a place to\nlay your hat.\nHotels are divided into categories\nA to E,A being the most expensive.\nAccommodation is crammed into\none or two chunky paragraphs,\nhotel names highlighted in bold.\nThe locations of most are shown on\ncomprehensive street maps, all with\na north arrow and scale bar - vital\nwhen on foot. The problem is that\nthey are in Roman script - not very\nhelpful when you thrust the book at\na local in despair and beg to be\ntaken to the Sky Guesthouse in\nSukhothai New Town, central\nThailand. Two maps, one being in\nthe local language, would\noccasionally be useful.\nSo you've got somewhere to stay\n- next task a ticket away from\nSaigon, from a rundown bus depot\nsomewhere across town you've\nnever been to and in a language you\ncan't speak. On this account, the\nlittle white books offer a section on\n'Transport to and from... by air,\ntrain, bus, ferry, and ship' which\nincludes the main routes, times to\ndestinations, some costs and brief\nvisa information. This section is\neven included for the smaller places\nwhere it is most needed. The\nconcise 1 page vocabulary section\nat the end of each country is just\nenough to buy a ticket, but it could\nbe expanded to help with buying\nfood.\nSo at last we have which comes\nclose to the legendary Australia\nbased Lonely Planet series of guides\nwhich assume you can get your\nluggage off the carousal, and covers\neverything from those that speak\nEnglish in Kumning bus station, to\nbribing your way across the\nBurmese border. The problem with\nLPs is the time it takes for them to\ncome out, being updated every 2-3\nyears. TWGs aim to update their\nbooks every year. But for my\nmoney, the larger, clearer print of\nthe LPs still takes the edge. In\nhardback, the TWGs will probably\nlast the mil age better; but the\nquestion remains - do you want\nyour trusty guide to look like it's been to the ends of the world with\nyou or not?\nThe She e by Joe Donnelly Born in Blood This is a book which in a way seems\nbased upon Tutankhamun and his\ncurse which fell \u2022 upon the\narchaeologists that discovered his\ntomb. The plot is as simple as that.\nArchaeologists digging in Kilgallan,\nIreland, discover what they initially\nbelieve to be a tomb for one of the\nancient Celtic Kings. However as\nthey continue their studies, they find\nthat things are not as they originally\nseemed. The tomb turns out to be\nthe prison of the Shee, the epitome\nof evil which feasts on fear, horror,\nviolence and ultimately (as with any\nother horror story) death -preferably as horrific as possible.\nThe archaeologists inadvertently\nhelp it to escape, before they realise\nwhat they have done.\nThe book is well written, the\nvarious characters being carefully\nand cleverly woven into the plot,\ngiving the book life. The unwitting\nhero is a journalistic photographer\nwhich seemed a very unlikely\nchoice until you got deeper into the\nstory. The only problem with the\nbook, was the amount of gore - it\nwasn't that it was too gruesome but\nit wasn't anything new and it\nbecame slightly repetitive, 'though\none wonders what kind of mind it\ntakes to think of these acts of\nviolence. Joe Donnelly does\nintroduce some of Ireland's history\nto the reader along the way, which\nis interesting and quiet ens it down\na bit. Not brilliant, but not bad!\nGB H \u2022 Published by Arrow, \u00a34.99\nBlood, guts, re li go us hypocrisy -ah, now this is a book which makes\nhistory interesting, nay, exciting; it\nhad me riveted. Its basically\nhypothesis inga link between the\nancient order of the Knights of the\nTemple and modern day\nFreemasonry, all very dry you may\nthink but it tells the sordid history\nof the medieval hierarchy so\ngraphically you'll be held to each\npage. It contains many short, almost\npython esque, anecdotes like the\nCatholic execution of cutting open\nyour stomach while still conscious\nand slowly pulling out you\nintestines. If it wasn't for the fact\nthat this was actually practised on\n'heretics' it would be hilarious.\nWARNING: if you're of a Catholic\ndisposition you may find some of\nthe book offensive. Why? Because\nit exposes the outright hypocrisy\nand evil that was the church. How\nit condemned the Templars to\ndestruction just because of its greed\nand desire for their extensive\nproperty holdings and consequent iy forced them to go underground only\nto emerge centuries later as masons\n- its all chronicled with breathtaking\npla usability. You' ll also be\nsurprised at how many famous\nfigures of history were Masons:\nfrom Christopher Wren to the\npresent Prince Philip.

On Tuesday 16th March\nhe will face the assembled 'elected\nrepresentatives' of London\nUniversity and attempt to convince\nthem that he can do the job of Vice\nPresident (Finance and Societies).\nThe last UL U officer who came\nfrom Imperial is so shrouded in the\nmists of time that Marc Samuels,\ncurrent UL U President could not\nfind an Imperial crest on the display\nwall in his office. Trevor Phillips\none time IC, UL U and NUS\nPresident, now part time presenter\nfor LWT and after dinner speaker,\nis a more memorable figure from\nIC to have been part of the larger\nbody of the University. An individual who Ben Hancock\ndismissed as a 'professional student'\nwhen I spoke to him.\nAs with all UL U posts the\nprocess for getting elected is a little\nobscure. Every election takes place\nUGM\nFriday 12th March, 1pm in\nthe Concert Hall (Union\nBuilding, 2nd Floorl the\nfollowing posts are up for\ngrabs:\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nICCAG\nEnts Chair\nUGM Chair\nRag Chair\nExternal Affairs Officer\nWelfare Officer\nHousing Officer\nPost Grad Affairs Officer\n2 Ordinary Members of\nCouncil\n\u2022 GET INVOLVED*\n\u2022 BRING UNION CARDS* at General Union Council (GUC) of\nUL U, in this body are the 'elected\nrepresentatives' from each college\nof London University. After a brief\nspeech, and a series of questions the\nmeeting votes on which candidate\nshould be allowed the post. Unlike\nthe clam our of the elections just past\nin Imperial, Joe student doesn't even get a look in.\nThis obvious lack of student\nexpression in UL U is clearly a sore\npoint, because when I mentioned\nthe idea of campus wide ballots to\nBen, a stream of stock excuses\nemerged. Expense, time for each\ncandidate to canvass 60,000\nstudents and the fact that people are\nnot usually known outside their own\ncollege were all wheeled out as\nreasons for continuing the old\nsystem. Fine, think I, but it's still\nstudents' money that sabbaticals are\npaid with.\nEven with this original definition\nof democracy, winning is not a foregone conclusion. Of his\ncompetitors for the post Ben is\ndismissive, 'I can never remember\ntheir names' he says describing a list of accommodation officers from\nUL U, Kings and Goldsmiths who\nfeel that they could fill the post\nmuch better than he could. Is he\ngoing to win? 'I'm quite confident..\nI have better financial experience\nthan the rest' he replies.\nDescribing the actual job, Ben\ngoes into more detail: The 'normal\ntreasury things' and supporting\nSocieties in UL U as well as liaising\nwith the full time Entertainments\nManager, UL U employ to run the\nbands and performances there. His\nprevious experience appears rather\nnarrow, having been heavily\ninvolved in the Sailing Club and\nlittle else. Ben does not see this as\na problem, as, he feels, the\nimpressive array of sailing\nchampionships that he has\norganised has given him a wide\nrange of experience in finance and\nevent management. Although about\nthe minutiae of the post, he is a little\nuncertain, the same, no doubt, as\nevery person trying to enter a new\njob.\nWhat about the 're examination' of Imperial's role in the University\nof London that Sir Eric Ash,\nImperial's Rector announced in his\nCommeration day speech last year?\nAlthough he has not spoken to Sir\nEric yet, Ben does not regard it as\nan immediate problem, but if\nImperial were to show signs of\nmoving out of the federation, 'I plan\nto fight him' is the clear signal to\nSir Eric's successor.\nBen is convinced that Imperial\nCollege students' Union and UL U can coexist, saying that UL U provides a different centre to\nstudents in London and the chance\nfor Imperial students to mix with a different group of people. 'It is\nimportant that Imperial students\nhave a choice' he comments, and\nplans to increase the profile of UL U in Imperial if elected.\nIs there a future in the University\nPIC BY JOE BAGULEY\nof London Union? Again the stock\nanswer is reeled out; UL U represents all the small colleges in\nLondon, places that would lose a strong voice if UL U were not there\nto defend them. Whether this will\nbe enough to keep UL U out of the\nfate that is being prepared for the\nNUS in the upcoming white paper\non Higher Education is not certain.\nAnd what can he do for London\nstudents if he gets the job? 'Provide\na well run facility at Ma let street\nshowing the things they want to see\nat a price that they can afford.'\nSounds like the promise of a well\nmeaning politician? Well, we can't tell until we see him in action, and\nthanks to the UL U voting scheme\nfew of us will get a say in that.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "union\n12 March 1993\nBanned leaflet\nIn last week's issue of Felix,\nMark Richards of ICU Conservative Society wrote a disparaging letter which derided the\nIslamic Society's sincere attempts\nto open a dialogue concerning the\nproblems of the Middle East, and\nIslam as the ideological solution to\nthese problems and all problems\nworld-wide. Mr Richards sneered\nat the concept of Islam being a complete ideology. I find it strange\nthat someone, who seems to have\nno real knowledge of Islam, can\ncheerfully dismiss it without even\nexamining it. This does not strike\nme as being a terribly open-minded\nor enlightened attitude.\nIslam, the Ideology\nAn ideology is an intellectual\ndoctrine from which a system\nemanates. This system should\nprovide comprehensive solutions\nfor people's problems and a method\nfor satisfying their needs. An ideology, therefore, should not only\nhave an intellectual basis, it should\nalso provide mechanisms for\npractical implementation of the\naforementioned doctrine. Islam,\nlike Capitalism and Communism,\nhas these mechanisms. Islam has\nvery detailed political, economic,\njudicial, educational and social\nsystems. These systems are all\nembodied in the Islamic State which\nis responsible for their\nimplementation.\nThe Islamic State\nThe current Muslim states do not\nrepresent Islam in the ideological\nsense. They are secular states\nwhose populations happen to be\nMuslims and whose laws sometimes\nhave a vague cultural affinity with\nIslam. So Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq\netc, are definitely NOT Islamic\nStates and any criticism of Islam\nusing such countries as examples is\ntotally invalid. To being with, these\ncountries do not even adopt the\nIslamic political system; this is the\nCaliphate (Khilafah) which was\ndestroyed with British complicity in\n1924. There are many groups of\ndedicated Muslims across the world\ninvolved in re-establishing the\nproper Islamic State. What would\nan Islamic State be like though?\nJudicial System\nThe Islamic judicial system is often\ncriticised on the basis that some of\nits punishments, such as the\namputation of the hand of the thief,\nare barbaric. But is not the mindless\nmurder of two year old Jamie\nBulger barbaric? This may be afa rely rare incident at the moment,\nbut for how long? Remember\nRachel Nicole, Julie Dart or any of\nFelix 962\nthe hundreds that didn't make it\nonto Crime Watch? In Britain,\ncrime is now reaching endemic\nproportions:\nThere is now a burglary ever 24\nseconds. A car crime every 21\nseconds. A rape every 2.5 hours.\nWe live in a sick society where\nmen, women and children cannot\nwalk the streets without fear of\nbeing robbed or assaulted. Even the\nhorses in the Home Counties cannot\ngraze freely without some\ndisgusting pervert carving up their\nprivate parts? Yet smug critics have\nthe audacity to ridicule Islamic\nsolutions when their own\ninstitutions have addressed these\nproblems with monumental\nincompetence and empty rhetoric.\nIslam be lives that the belief of a person in the after-life, and a consequent accountability for\nactions in this life, will motivate a person to refrain from committing\ncrime. Islam also recognises that\nhuman beings are inherently weak\nand therefore open to temptation; so\nIslam provides a deterrent. The\ndeterrent principle is after all\napplied by the West to justify its\nnuclear arms and there is no reason\nwhy the analogy cannot be extended\nto a societal level.\nEconomic System\nBritain is cur rend y in the grip of the\nworst recession since the 1930s. As\na result of this lit de downturn, 1200\nbusinesses have been going under\nevery week. The high street banks\nhave not exactly helped matters\nwith their overcharging, untimely\nrepossessions and seizure of\nbusiness assets. These actions have\nbeen well documented in all\nsections of the press. The banks\npoint out that other large\ncorporations have also made a substantial profit during the\nrecession; and anyway they are not\na charity but a business whose duty\nis towards the shareholders. Other\nlarge companies, however, are not\nin the position of controlling the\nmedium of exchange in this\ncountry. Neither do these same\ncompanies make their profits from\ndisplacing 75,000 people from their\nhomes or making their businesses\ncollapse. When faced with the\nchoice of commitment to their\ncustomers or submission to their\nshareholders, the banks always\nchoose their shareholders. So there\nwill always be a conflict of interests\nas long as banks are in private\nhands.\nThe Islamic State would have\nonly one bank; the Government\nBank. This bank would be free from\nany obligations to greedy\nshareholders so it could get on with\nthe job of helping businesses to\nprosper, thus creating a successful\neconomy. But what about the\nmassive fluctuations in interest\nrates? State ownership of the\nbanking system cannot remedy that,\nsurely? Actually, that is the really\ngood bit; There are currently a lot\nof people calling for a cut in interest\nrates to improve the\ncompetitiveness of British industry.\nUnder the Islamic economic system\nrates are always low: 0%\npermanently, to be precise. So\nbusinesses will save billions in\ninterest repayments, and this cash\ncan be invested in the creation of\njobs and prosperity.\nConclusion\nI have so far only briefly mentioned\nthe judicial and economic systems\nof Islam since economics and law\nand order are .both pretty topical\nissues. Regarding the issue of\nBritish foreign policy in the Middle\nEast, it is well documented that\nBritain has always exercised\nhegemony in the region: the RAF gassing of Kurds, the Sykes-Picot\nagreement, the Balfour Declaration,\nthe destruction of the Caliphate, the\ncreation of artificial countries such\nas Iraq, Jordan or Syria, the\nprecipitation of the Suez Crisis, the\nmassive arms deals with Saddam\nHussein; these are but a few\nexamples of the British\nestablishment's arrogant and evil\ninvolvement in the wanton\ndestruction of people's lives. I strongly urge Mr Richards to\nparticipate in an open debate about\nthese matters or to make a public\napology for his slander against\nIslam and Muslims and withdraw\nhis ill-informed and puerile\ncomments. If he really does believe\nin market forces, democracy,\nBritish foreign policy and the caring\nConservative philosophy, let him\ndefend it intellectually and publicly.\nThis leaflet was written by Najeeb\nKhan and was banned by Security.\n\u2014 Monday 22nd of March \u2014\nDEMOCRACY IN ACTION:\nCOME AND STATE YOUR VIEWS\nTHE NEXT VICE CHANCELLOR\nOF THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON\nYOUR PART IN HER OR HIS CHOICE\nBy\nProfessor Geoffrey ALDERMAN\nChairman of the Academic Council\nWho will answer your questions\nOPEN MEETING: STAFF AND STUDENTS WELCOME\nIn the Read Lecture Theatre Sherfield Building at 1.00 pm\nPage 6\n\n"

The\nGambler is a story of Russians\nabroad, especially those who\ngathered in the European spas and\ngambling resorts with which the\nauthor himself was all too familiar.\nLuckily, the Gambler is not\ndevoted to philo soph ising or to\nrecollection of the distant past\nwhich is so common for\nDostoyevsky's world. There are, it\nis true, moments of reflection on\ngambling: 'Round and round the\nwheel she goes, and where she\nstops\u2014nobody knows', or on the\nattitude of Russian women to\nFrenchmen. But play is based upon\na tale of passion, intrigue and public\nscandal.\nAlexie Ivanovich, the gambler\nhimself (Andy MacKay) is\nobsessive and emotionally disturbed\nin his relations with other people.\nThe main objects of his obsessions\nare gambling and a beautiful young\nRussian women, Polina (Sian\nJenkins). Polina is also adored by\nan English aristocrat, and French\nMarquis and that is what makes the\nstory complicated, but interesting at\nthe same time.\nAndy McKay as Alexei gave a very good performance.\nFurthermore, the dramatic\nappearance of Grandmother (Eve\nShickle) was very notable. A presumably fatally ill old woman\nshowed up unexpectedly and\ninstantly disrupted all plans the\ngroup had built upon expectations\nof her death.\nThe idea of presenting roulette as\na pattern on a floor with each player\nstanding on their choices, supported\nwith appropriate lights and sounds,\nwas very impressive. But at the end\nit was one of those mild\nperformances which are either not\ntoo good, or not too bad, just\nenough that at the end of the night\nyou won't feel anything (apart from\ncold feet).\nElena.\n\u2022 The Courtyard Theatre Club,\n10-14 York Way, Kings Cross tube.\nBox Office 071-833 0870.

The noises of\nthe pub above, however, are not too\nnoticeable and the play is\nenthralling enough not to plan a quick dash upstairs for a pint.\nThis is not a play for Shakespeare\ntraditionalists.

    "content": "'eat ure12 March 1993 Felix 962 Felix 962\n'eat ure12 March 1993\nA Time to Fast\nSarmad Qureshi takes a brief look at the Islamic month of Ramadan\nFasting was practised by many\nprophets of the past including those\nmentioned in the Old Testament\u2014\nMoses and Elijah are said to have\nfasted continuously for 40 days, a feat that was later repeated by Jesus,\nwho also recommended fasting as\nan example and as a teaching.\nIndeed, fasting is strictly practiced\nin Judaism and the Jews fast on the\nday of Atonement and the\nChristians during the period of\nLent. These practices are observed\nas a command from God, and in the\nQuran God says\n'O you who believe fasting has\nbeen ordained for you as it was\nordained for those before you, so\nthat you may develop Godconsciousness' Quran 2:183\nIt is from this verse that the\nmuslims have been commanded to\nfast. So in a continuation of the\nmessages that come before it the\nQuran prescribes the month of\nRamadan for the muslims as the\nperiod in which they fast from dawn\nto dusk. 'Ramadan is the (month)\nin which was sent down the Quran,\nas a guide to mankind, also clear\n(signs) for guidance and judgement( between right and wrong). So\neveryone of you who is present (at\nhis home) during that month should\nspend it in fasting...' Quran 2:185\nIt is for this reason that Ramadan\nis considered as one of the holiest\nmonths in Islam, and the month is\nspent not only in fasting but also in\ngood deeds. The Quran can be\nJieard being recited from all corners\nof the world, as muslims seek its\nguidance and understanding. \"This\nis a Book of Guidance in which\nthere is no doubt. It is for the Godconscious' Quran 2:2\nBut the fast that is observed\nduring Ramadan is more than a mechanical abstention from food\nand drink. It also prohibits all\nsexual relations between spouses,\nduring the period of fast, as well as\na strict observance of one's actions\nand words and also encouraging\nacts of charity and good deeds to\nothers.\nWhat, however, is the wisdom\nbehind fasting? There are numerous\nbenefits that a person who fasts will\nenjoy, encouraging the person's character to progress, and those\nwho fast with intention and devotion\nleave the month richer in spirit.\nThe act of fasting itself can\nsometimes prove to be very\ndemanding. The month of Ramadan\nmay fall during the summer where\nthe long daylight hours can mean\nthat the fast lasts from 3am to\n9.30pm. This can prove to be very\nintensive especially as the period of\nRamadan progresses towards its\nfinal days. Elsewhere in the world\nRamadan may fall during the hot\nseason, meaning having to bear\ntemperatures of 40 \u00b0C normally\nunbearable, but made even more\ndifficult when you cannot drink or\neat. It is for this reason that the\nperson who fasts develops the\npatience and willpower being able\nto bear out his circumstances, with\nthe knowledge that his reward will\ncome at the time he breaks his fast,\nand in the hereafter. \"Those who\npatiently persevere will truly receive\na reward without measure.' Quran\n29:10.\nWithout the need for a check it\ncan be very easy to take things for\ngranted. It is all too easy to\nsuccumb oneself to the desires of\nthis world, eating to and beyond\ncontentment with little care, or even\nsatisfying ones sexual desires. But\nit is only when these avenues are\nclosed and you have to refrain from\nthese channels does one realise how\nmuch one relies on them. This\nlesson is to be learnt for all, as\nhunger does not prejudice between\nthe rich and poor. This is all very\nhumbling as one then realises how\nreliant he is and gives perspective\nto one's mortality. But the lesson to\nbe learnt from this is not only\nhumility as restraint from that\nwhich is permitted should also\ndevelop restraint from these actions\nthat are discouraged.\nThe fast is also meant for one to\nabstain from bad thoughts and\nspeech and to avert his eyes from\nthat which does not concern him.\nSo one has to dev leo p not only a physical control of one's action but\nof a mental control of one's impulses and thoughts. Only when\nthis control is developed does one\nrealise how much he was led by his\ntongue or eyes, how it insulted\nothers or the pain it caused. Then\ndo you realise how you can easily\nbecome enslaved to your corrupt\nside.\nBut fasting is not seen as a bru den nor does it cause a radical change\nin lifestyles as muslims carry on\nliving their normal lives during\nRamadan but being more vigilant of\ntheir practices. The fasting is seen\nas a blessing, which makes people\nenrich their lives and being more\nmindful of others. People are also\nexpected to practice the lessons of\nself-restraint learnt after the month\nhas passed so that the benefit is\npermanent and the rewards attained\nimmense.\nThe celebration of Ramadan in\nmuslim countries is a joyous\noccasion and everyone contributes\nto give to the feeling. In order to\npreparation for life where\ninvaluable lessons are learnt and\npractised. But Islam is not only\nabout self-control of the individual.\nMuslims are encouraged to seek the\ntruth and to contribute to society by\nbeing righteous and fair in all\ndealings with people, and that is\nwhere the challenge lies.\n'The Believers, men and women,\nare protectors one of another: they\nenjoin what is just and forbid what\nis evil: they observe regular\nprayers, practice regular charity\nand obey God and his Messenger.\nOn them will God pour his mercy:\nfor God is exalted in power, wise. '\nQuran 9:71.\n\"Those who have faith and do\nrighteous deeds, they are the best\nof creatures. Their reward is with\nGod: Gardens of Eternity, beneath\nwhich rivers flow; they will dwell\ntherein forever.' Quran 98:7-8.\nTONIGHT\nat 5.50pm The Imperial\nCollege Islamic\nSociety is holding\nan Iftar dinner, to\nbreak fast, in the\nJCR.\nsignify the be girin ing and end of the\nfast, drums, cannon shots and even\nalarm sirens are used . People\nusually come together to open their\nfasts in mosques or at their homes.\nBut overeating at the period of\nopening and closing the fast is\ndiscouraged as this would contradict\nthe principles of self-control learnt.\nAt the end of the month the feast of\nEid-ul-Fitr is celebrated and\nmuslims man k ful for their blessings\ngained, come together in large\nnumbers for prayers and then go out\nto meet friends and relatives, but\nagain moderation being the\nunderlying element in the\nfestivities.\nAs can be seen the period of\nfasting during Ramadan is a The Holy Prophet has said: 'Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave'.\nTIMETABLE\nfor the rest of Ramadan\n(which began on 22nd Feb)\nFajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Esha denote the times of prayer\nDAY MAR RAM Fast FAJR ZUHR ASR MAGHRIB ESHA\nBegins Fast Ends\nFRI 12 19 4.37 4.52 12.12 3.17 6.02 8.02\nSAT 13 20 4.35 4.50 12.11 3.18 6.04 8.04\nSUN 14 21 4.32 4.47 12.11 3.19 6.06 8.06\nMON 15 22 4.30 4.45 12.11 3.20 6.07 8.07\nTUE 16 23 4.28 4.43 12.10 3.21 6.09 8.09\nWED 17 24 4.25 4.40 12.10 3.22 6.11 8.11\nTHU 18 25 4.23 4.38 12.10 3.23 6.12 8.12\nFRI 19 26 4.21 4.36 12.10 3.25 6.14 8.14\nSAT 20 27 4.19 4.34 12.09 3.26 6.16 8.16\nSUN 21 28 4.16 4.31 12.09 3.27 6.17 8.17\nMON 22 29 4.14 4.29 12.09 3.28 6.19 8.19\nTUE 23 30 4.12 4.27 12.08 3.29 6.21 8.21\nPage 12 Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nFelix 962 12 March 1993\nTapping the Source\nSave the Rainforests! support the\nrubber-tap per s? Rubber-tap per s have been in the\nAmazon since the end of the 19th century when the world market for\nrubber was expanding, and migrant\nmale workers were recruited by\nmanagers of rubber estates.\nRubber is collected between May\nand December, then during the\nrainy season Brazil nuts are\ncollected. Rubber-tap per communities are small (settlements\ntypically consist of 4 or 5 houses),\neconomically viable, and largely\nself-sufficient. A rubber tree can\nyield latex for over 50 years.\nThough rubber tap per s work\nindividually, the formation of\ncooperatives is an integral part of\na new range of survival skills that\nthey have had to learn. Only\ntogether can they be strong enough\nto resist the threat to their way of\nlife, and to the very existence of the\nfor st \u2014the opening up of the\nAmazon region to the cattle\ncompanies.\nThe ownership of the forest is\nlegally unclear. The rubber-tap per s assert their rights to the land as\nbeing at least as good as anyone\nelse's. However, they are often\nunaware that pieces of paper have\nbeen exchanged in the cities, until\nthe logging crews move in.\nWith each tiny community of\ntap per s often many days' journey\nfrom each other, it was difficult for\nthem to meet and plan a response\nto the land grabs. A lack of\neducation compounded the\nproblem.\nThen in the late 1970s a local\nvoluntary group began Project\nSerigueiro (Project Rubber-Tapper)\nwith funding initially from Oxfam.\nProject workers opened up the\npossibility of forming cooperatives\nso that the tap per s could market\ntheir own rubber. They also\nest bali shed schools where initially\nadults, then later children, could\nbecome literate and numerate.\nChico Mendes, for many years the\nleader of the rubber-tap per s, described the importance of\nschooling:\n'My life began just like that of all\nrubber-tap per s, as a virtual slave\nbound to do the bidding of his\nmaster. I started work at nine years\nold, and, like my father before me,\ninstead of learning my ABC,1 learnt how to extract latex from a Tapping in progress\nrubber tree. From the last century\nuntil 1970, schools were forbidden\non any rubber estate in the Amazon.\nThe rubber estate owners\nwouldn't allow it. Firstly, because\nif a rubber-trapper's children went\nto school, they would learn to read,\nto write, and to add up, and would\ndiscover to what extent they were\nbeing exploited. That wasn't in the\nbosses' interests. Also, it was better\nfor production to have the children\navailable for work rather than at\nschool.\nSo for many years, the great\nmajority of us could neither read\nnor write. The rubber-tap per worked all year hoping he would\nfinally make a profit, but always\nremained in debt. As he couldn't count, he couldn't tell whether or\nnot he was being cheated.\nProject Seringueito brought the\nrubber-trappers together, and along\nwith education came organisation.\nThe first rubber-tap per s unions\nwere formed in 1975 and many\nothers followed. In 1985, the\nNational Council of RubberTappers was formed to coordinate\ntheir activities. This level of\norganisation has given them the\npower to defend their way of life,\nand with it the rainforest. Their\nstandard response to the arrival of\na logging crew within one of their\nareas has become the em pate \u2014a peaceful organisation. Chico\nMendes described the technique:\n'When a community is threatened\nby deforestation, it gets in touch\nwith other communities in the area.\nThey all get together in a mass\nmeeting inthe middle of the forest\nand organise teams of people to take\nthe lead in confronting the workers\ncutting down the trees\u2014all this in\na peaceful but organised way. These\nteams try to convince the workers\nemployed by the landowners to\nleave the area. The rubber-tap per s also dismantle the camps used by\nthose workers to force them out...\nAt the same time as 180 or 200\ncolleagues are involved in the\nem pate, standing in the way of the\nchain-saw and the scythes, we aim\nto have a team whose job it is to get\ninformation about what is\nhappening to Xapuri, where another\ngroup will make sure it travels all\nover Brazil and the rest of the\nworld.\nFor us the important thing is to\ncontinue to make a political impact.\nWe feel our resistance can produce\nresults through pressure by the\npress and lobbying organisations, at\nboth national and international\nlevel.'\nThe rubber-tap per s have learnt\nthat the real threats come from far\nbeyond the forest\u2014from the intergovernmental lending agencies like\nthe World Bank, and the InterAmerican Development flank, and\nfrom the headquarters of\ntransnational corporations. Hence\nthey have built up an impressive\nrange of alliances with Third World\nand Green movements in North\nAmerica and Europe. They have\ntestified to the UN's Bruntland\nCommission on the environment,\nand have lobbied the World Bank.\nChico Mendes was assassinated\nin December 1988.\nThe rubber-tap per s' struggle goes\non. Central to their efforts is the ii own strength, and their alliances\nwithin Brazil. In 1989, to get he i with groups representing in dig i nous peoples, they created the Alliance\nof Forest Peoples.\n'To defend the Amazon you have\nto support the unions, the women's organisations, the residents'\nassociations. Since Chico's death\nthe press have started calling him\nan ecologist. But he always called\nhimself a trade unionist. We don't see any distinction between\nenvironmentalism, and trade\nunionism.'\n(Atanagildo Matos, National\nCouncil of Rubber-Tappers).\nOn Tuesday 23th March, Third\nWorld First and EnviroSoc are to\nhold ' A Night of Brazilia' in the\nUnion starting at 8.30pm.

    "content": "Opinion\n12 March 1993\nSt Mary's Vote\nDear Jonty,\nHow terribly sad it is that once\nagain the record needs to be set\nstraight between St Mary's and IC\nUnion, however the front page\narticle in Felix 960 leaves us little\nalternative.\nIn the four years that we have\nbeen involved in the Union\nactivities\u2014including design and\nimplementation of the Union\nmerger\u2014we have noticed a lessening of the anti-IC feeling in\nPaddington, but a corresponding\nstrengthening of the an it Mary's lobby in South Kensington. We are,\non the whole, satisfied with the\nmanner in which IC Union officers\nhave treated and assisted the Mary's Union, whenever it was able to do\nso. Much of this has been made\npossible by the good working\nrelationships between the last three\npresidents of IC and St Mary's Unions. Paul Shanley, Zoe\nHellinger and Chris Davidson were\nall well supported by St Mary's students in their respective\nelections; this illustrates two points.\nFirstly, that these three could win\nthe confidence and support of St\nMary's students was a comment on\ntheir personalities, their\ncapabilities, their performance in\ndifficult situations, and yes, their\ncharisma; the very qualities which\nFelix 962\nalso made them successful\npresidents. Secondly, they chose to\nget to know students at St Mary's and understand their concerns-most notably Wilson House and\nTeddington\u2014and consequently\nwere then able to offer useful backup to the St Mary's Union. This we\nbelieve they all did admirably.\nAllow us then to stress four\nserious concerns arising from the\narticle in question.\n1. ICU knows that the St Mary's Rag Week is planned to coincide\neach year with the United Hospitals\nRugby Cup Final\u2014the dates of\nwhich are set years in advance.\nWhy then does ICU not choose to\ntry and avoid holding its hustings\nduring this period of high spirits and\nmischievous merriment, when it\ncould so easily do so?\n2. What sort of democratic\nsystem allows its leaders to be\nelected with 'an easy ride' as\nDominic Wilkinson believes\n'hustings should be run\"}\n3. Past experience has shown that\nthe knowledge and understanding of\nthe concerns of Medical Students\nthat ICU candidates have at first is\nunderstandably negligible. Also\nnegligible is the relevance to\nmedical students of much of what\nthe candidates have to say relating\nto issues at South Kensington, since\nthe Mary's Union generally runs its\nown financial, social and\nrepresentative affairs within the\nMedical School. Therefore, what\nwe look for in the candidates is the\nability to cope in difficult situations,\nwillingness to listen, learn and\nunderstand, capacity to talk one self\nout of almost anything, and most\nimportantly to ensure they do not\nhave a serious lack of the qualities\nnecessary for leadership i.e. charisma and sense of\nhumour...which leads nicely on to\nDominic Wilkinson!\n4. Mr Wilkinson and his belief\nthat 'Mary's students weren 't fit to\nlick the shit off our shoes' really\ngoes beyond the bounds of common\ndecency. Rarely have we known a Union officer anywhere in London\nwho has had such ab latent and\nabsolute disdain for his electors\u2014\nand with ignorant Union officers\nhardly being thin on the ground in\nLondon colleges, you, Mr Wilkinson, have managed to beat\noff tough competition!\nIt is, therefore, obvious to us that\nMr Wilkinson neither desires to nor\nis capable of representing over 650\nmembers of his electorate. This\nleaves us two alternatives. Firstly,\nthe ICU Exec must all publicly\ndissociate themselves from Mr Wilkinson's comments, leaving Mr Wilkinson no alternative but to\nresign. With his past record of\nstorming out of meetings in a sulk\nMediterranean\nDear Jonty,\nWe, the members of the Turkish\nSociety, felt that we have to write\nto you regarding the articles\n'Greece' and 'Cyprus' in the Felix\nInternational Night Special issue.\nIf we had told the international\ncommunity at Imperial College that\nthere are some Greek fanatics who\ndream to annex Cyrpus, where both\nTurkish and Greek communities\nlive, very few people would have\nbelieved us. If we had told\ninternational community that they\nclaim territory from Turkey as well,\nnot many people would have\nbelieved us either. However, if you\nread the article 'Greece' in Felix\nInternational Night Special Issue\nwritten by the Hellenic Society, you\nwill see that they themselves openly\nsay so. I'd like to take this\nopportunity to thank them for\nshowing their true faces. The fact\nis that they don't just dream, they\ntry to do it in real life. For example,\nthey came to invade Turkey in the\n1920's and caused loss of hundreds\nof thousands of human lives\nincluding their own. They also tried\nto annex Cyprus in 1974 and started\nConflict\nto massacre Turkish communities;\nand as a result Turkey had no choice\nbut to intervene according to the\narticle IV of the 1960 Treaty of\nGuarantee (They claim it was\noccupation!).\nWe sincerely believe that those\nfanatics do not represent real Greek\npeople and we want to stress that we\nwant to live in peace with our Greek\nneighbours as well as with all other\nnations. We also urge those fanatics\nto wake up and see the realities, the\nsooner the better.\nYours faithfully,\nErsin Akartuna on behalf of the\nTurkish Society.\nDep Reps\nDear Jonty,\nJust a quick note about last\nweek's Felix.\nFirstly, can I point out that being\na Dep Rep may, admittedly, not be\na major responsibility in terms of\nthe overall organisation of the\nuniverse; but within IC the Dep\nReps are most decidedly the unsung\nheros of my department, being\nresponsible for all things from\nkeeping the chocolate machine\nstocked with Twixes, to calling staff\nstudent committees at a time\nconvenient to everybody involved.\nI'd like to thank Alison, Andy,\nDuncan, Matt and Rhian\u2014you've\nkept me sane and always been there\nwhen I 've need to rely, and depend,\nupon you, and only you.\nSecondly, 'Rachel 'fred' Bassett.\nDoes Mr Doddery (sic) realise how\npetty, maddening, irritating,\nannoying, boring, old, sad, sick,\npo in f less, useless waste-of-space etc\nand infantile it is to repeat a very,\nvery old joke thinking you're the\nonly person intelligent enough to\nthink of it (every time guaranteed).\nYou can't blame the parents for a name they give, or indeed are\ngiven, in all innocence, but you can\nblame the insensitive brutes who\nthink anybody will smile; and I for\none intend to until the end of my\ndays if needs-be.\nLots of love,\nSarah Lee, RCSU AAO.\nAny comment about worth\nwaiting for and I might turn green\nand either explode messily all over\nyou or bite your head off. Slowly.\nI haven't decided yet.\nif he does not get his own way, he\nis presumably not averse to walking\nout on his responsibilities, so this\nshould not present a problem.\nAlternatively, the Mary's Union\nshould demand its own\nrepresentation at all levels\u2014\nincluding Governing Body effectively declaring UDI from IC\nUnion, something it is perfectly\ncapable of doing. The second\nalternative however, would simply\ndestroy five years of diplomatic\nhard graft, which, until Mr Wilkinson's injudicious,\npatronising and offensive\ncomments, has been successfully\nachieving a good working\npartnership between our two student\nbodies.\nWe sincerely hope that Chris\nDavidson and his Exec do not allow\nthis sad situation to do lasting\ndamage to Mary's \u2014IC relations,\nand that the successful candidates in\ntoday's elections do not perpetuate\nMr Wilkinson's totally unsuitable\nattitude.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon P Stockill, Ex President\nSMHMS SU (91/92)\nSimon GT Smith, Ex President\nSMHMS SU (90/91)\nEaster\nDear Jonty,\nWithout wanting to make a big\ndeal out of it, I would like to point\nout that the 'Easter decorations'\ncartoon in last week's Felix (5th March) was offensive. You surely\nmust have known this before putting\nit in. Not only does it offend\nChristians but also the other\nreligions who have Jesus as a prophet.\nEaster means many things to me.\nJesus endured a very painful death\non a cross in order that He may take\naway everything that everyone has\ndone wrong. For three days he\nfought with death, which is worse\nthan anyone can imagine. He came\nback to life on the third day,\nshowing that he had won over all\nsin. It is through these three days\nthat Christians believe we can have\neternal life.\nChristians often wear crosses,\nwhich remind us that Jesus went\nthrough all that for everyone, but\noften those crosses are empty-Jesus is no longer on the cross, He\nis alive!\nTo ridicule a painful death as this\ncartoon did is insensitive\u2014please\nbear in mind that Jesus suffered\nthese things for YOU as much as\nfor me.\nLaura Burgess, Geology I.P.S. When did anyone put up\nEaster decorations anyway?\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "Sf\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 JJ JJ 1 il Issue96212 March 1993\nElections Knocked Queen'sT Splat\nApathy is as prominent as ever at\nImperial College according to a mini survey carried out by Felix\nduring this week's sabbatical\nelections, with the elections as a whole coming in for a great deal of\ncriticism.\nAlthough 54% of voters were\naware of the elections taking place\nand what they were for only 30%\nof those surveyed had bothered to\nvote. The final result of New\nElection for the Hon Sec post, was\nechoed in the survey, with students\nbeing unsure what the post actually\ndid. A large compliant from those\nsurveyed was the feeling that the\nelections were irrelevant to the vast\nmajority of people. This was\ndemonstrated in the low turn out\nduring the poll when 23 % of those\neligible voted. One particular voter\nbased in Silwood Park, said that\neveryone there had voted for New\nElection, as no candidate had\nconsidered them.\nMany complained about the\ncandidates, saying that there was no\nclear choice. Although campaigns\nwere better than last year, but were\nobviously marred with dirty tricks.\nPosters appeared just to say vote for\na candidate with manifestos and\nleaflets being very short on real\npolicy. Many voters had real\ndifficulty working out actual\ndifferences between candidates as\nmany seemed to agree on the vast\nmajority of issues.\nThere was a little confusion with\nthe voting system with a significant\nnumber being marked with a cross\nor tick, instead of the numbers as\nwas clearly marked on the ballot\npaper.\nIn reply to this comment Mr Dominic Wilkinson, the current\nHon Sec (events), made a detailed\nreply:\n\"If the electorate could not spare\na few minutes to vote then they have\nlittle right to complain about the\nquality of the incoming sabbaticals.\nThe opportunity to vote was given\nwith New Election being the option\nfor those dissatisfied with the\nsuitability of the candidates. At the\nend of the day the well worn phrase\n'You get what you deserve' rings\ntrue.\nI am concerned that some think\nthat the Union bears little relevance\nto their lives. Unbeknown to them,\nthe work that the Union does will\ntouch every aspect of their time at\nImperial. This is an attitude that we\nare acutely aware of and through\nour increased communication with\nstudents, via, for example, the\nreaching out stalls and focus\ngroups, we can alter this perception\nto one that more accurately reflects\nthe work that the Union does for\nstudents.'\nDoor Damage\nWednesday saw severe damage to\nthe toilets in the Union Building\nopposite Da Vinci's during the\n'Libido' disco night.\nA wall inside the Men's lavatories was smashed leaving a large hole. Who actually was\nresponsible for the damage is\nunclear, but it is believed that a large number of students who had\nbeen drinking in the Da Vinci's bar\nmay have had a role. Union\nStewards on the scene said it was\npossible that the damage had started\naccidentally and individuals passing\nthrough the toilets had added to the\ndamage as the evening progressed.\nSpeaking to Felix yesterday,\nChris Davidson, ICU President,\nsaid that the matter had been\nreported to the Police. He added\nthat if any of those responsible were\nidentified, criminal charges would\nbe brought.\nThe large 'splat' put on the Queens Tower last week in support of today's comic relief day. The 'Splat' was paid for by charity donations by West\nLondon Chaplaincy, and will be lit up tonight.\nResignation Call\nby Andrew Tseng Relations between Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) and St Mary's Hospital Medical School Students\nUnion (SMHMS SU) have taken a turn for the worse this week\nfollowing a letter published in this\nissue.\nThe letter by Ex-SMHMS SU\nPresidents, Simon Stockill and\nSimon Smith, demands the\nresignation of Dominic Wilkinson,\nHonorary Secretary (Events). Mr Stockill and Mr Smith also demand\nthat the rest of the ICU Exec\ndistance themselves from Mr Wilkinson. The alternative that the\nletter cites is the complete\nseparation of SMHMS SU from\nICU.\nWhen interviewed by Felix, Mr Wilkinson said that he would be\nreplying to the letter privately and\nwould not make any further\ncomment. Questioned by Jonty\nBeavan, the editor of Felix, Mr Wilkinson elicited a response of,\n'oh go away you tedious editor'.\nWhen asked if the rest of ICU\nExec would condemn Mr Wilkinson, Chris Davidson, ICU President, said that it was 'not the\nusual thing that it seeks to do'. He\nadded, given that Mr Stockill and\nMr Smith were not present at he\nhustings, that 'it would probably be\ndifferent if were there'.\n3/4/5/6 8\nLetters Alternative\nExtravaganza Manifestos\n9\nULU\nHope\n11\nMalcolm\nX "

No grubby sports\ncentre or church hall for us; the\nvenue was the Great Room of the\nGrosvenor House, Park Lane, a magnificent ballroom and amazing\nbackdrop to the 30th annual event.\nThe big guns of Oxford and\nCambridge were well represented,\ntogether with 19 other universities\nat IC. The pressure was on us; not\nonly had IC won the IV for the past\ntwo years, but had also swept the\nboard at the Sheffield and Southern\nBalls earlier this term. Cambridge\nCan't Pay?\nWon't Pay!\nAfter presenting the 'Twelfth\nNight' last December, DramSoc\ngives a jump both in time and in\nspace to present this term 'Can't Pay? Won't Pay!' by one of Italy's most important twentieth century\nhas even resorted to the desperate\nmeasure of rearranging their entire\nA Team, in a final bid for victory.\nIn the past 29 years, only the 4\ncouples comprising each A Team\nhad competed at the IV. This year,\naB Team competition was also\narranged. IC must have been\nfavourites for this, too: at the\nSouthern Ball, we beat all other B's, only narrowly missing Cambridge\nA. However, a different marking\nsystem and 3 weeks frenzied\npractice by the other universities\nsuggested 2 very close\ncompetitions.\nThe afternoon programme, of\nExploding Heads\nTomorrow, Saturday 13th March,\nICSF is pleased to be holding its\n11th small one day convention\n(hence called Picocon 11) in the\nUnion building. Entry is just \u00a31 to\nmembers (membership \u00a33) and gets\nyou into all manner of events,\nquizzes, video showing, book and\ncomic trading, panels and talks.\nOUr main guest this year is the\nrenowned SF author Colin\nGreenland, who will be reading\nfrom his latest, unpublished novel\nand prizes for competitions through\nthe day include a complete set of his\npublished novels.\nThe theme of ICSF's next double-bill is Canadian horror director\nDavid Cronenberg. On Monday at\n6pm, we'll start with a showing of\nhis famous 'Scanners'. Cameron\nVale, a wandering tramp, is a scanner, possessing the ability to\ntune into and control other people's nervous systems, as a result of\nwhich he is hunted by a mysterious\norganisation of scanners who are\nresponsible for a number of\nassassinations. As the net tightens\naround him, Vale learns that the\nother scanners' aims are far more\nsinister than at first they appear and\nthat he must destroy the leader of\nthe organisation in as a nner duel to\nstop his heinous plot. The film has\na great cast (Patrick McGoohan\nfrom 'The Prisoner' and Michael\nIronside from ' V and 'Total\nRecall') and some terrific exploding\nheads too.\nAt 8pm, we have 'Videodrome'\nfeaturing James Woods and Debbie\nHarry. Woods plays a cable TV programmer who gets involved\nwith a chat show host (Harry) and\nwho stumbles across a snuff/SM\nTV channel. The more he watches\nit, the more unable he is to stop\nwatching it and the more\nhallucinations (or are they?) he\nsuffers from. Eventually he\ndescends into, a state of existence\nwhere he cannot define the\nboundary between reality and his\ndrug-crazed imagination and where\nhe may or may not be a pawn in the\nhands of a political megalomaniac.\nThis movie features some strikingly\nunusual sex (!), violence and\ngruesome ness( if you're likely to be\noffended, don't turn up). It also acts\nas a suitable precursor to the\ndirector's later film 'Naked Lunch'\nwhit h its drug-induced illusions and\nalso relates to the novels of Philip\nK Dick (source of 'Bladerunner'\nand 'Total Recall') with its themes\nof defining absolute reality.\nThe films start at 6pm on Monday\nthe 15th in Chem Eng LT1. Entry\nis free to members and membership\nis just \u00a33.\nFoxtrot and Samba, with a Quickstep for the Beginners, saw\nsome fine individual performances.\nSeveral IC couples made the finals,\nand Satin and Shelagh won the BCD\nSamba. This was the warm-up for\nthe main event, the Team\nCompetitions, starting dead on time\n(rather than the more usual hour late\nat such events).\nAll of the IC couples made their\nrespective finals\u2014but Oxford,\nCambridge, Bristol and Liverpool\n(to name but 4) were well\nrepresented here, too. While nails\nwere bitten, we were entertained by\na professional Latin American\nplaywrights, Dario Fo.\nDario Fo, probably best known\nin this country as the author of\n'Accidental Death of an Anarchist'\nis not only a play writer but also a political activist.\nThe production we are staging is\nan extremely funny political farce\nabout a strike by London\nhousewives against price rises,\nalthough the original is set in Italy.\nSo if you feel like spending an\nevening of laughter, come to see\nthis comedy full of 'anarchy, theft,\nclass war and bopping the fuzz'\nwhich is bound to 'extract\nwhooping laughter from social\ninjustice'\n'Can't Pay? Won't Pay!\nWednesday 17th to Saturday 20th March, 7.30pm, Union Concert\nHall, \u00a32 (\u00a31 cones).\ndemo and the Offbeat Competition.\nThe latter is a Team event which is\nmarked on both dancing ability and\nentertainment value. Tracks ranged\nfrom 'It's Raining Men' to some\nManchester 'Madness'.\nFinally the results. Both A and B competitions were decided by the\nlast dance, the Jive. But we did it:\nretained the A trophy, put our\nnames on the new B trophy, and\ncarried off the Offbeat with a20's Lindy-Hop/Charleston. After the\nLast Waltz, we retired to the JCR,\nfor a celebratory party (and of\ncourse, more dancing!).\nThanks are due to the IV\norganisers, and our trainers.\nOpSoc\nOpsoc would like to announce a workshop on the musical 'Guys &\nDolls'. Rehearsals will be on\nTuesday 16th March, 7.30pm, Huxley 308 and Sunday 21st March, all afternoon inthe UDH for\na performance on Sunday evening.\nAnybody is welcome, we hope to\nsee you there.

    "content": "The Indigo Girls \u2014 T&C The Indigo Girls played a stunning\ntwo hour set to a packed Town and\nCountry Club last Friday night.\nEmily and Amy were accompanied\nby a nearly all female band\nincluding, I am pleased to say, a cellist and a violinist. Their new\nmaterial is so good that they had\nlittle need to resort to old favourites.\nThe new album 'Rites of Passage'\n(Epic 471 363 4) is a true pleasure.\nTheir sound is a little changed\nlive. A powerful blend of acoustic,\nringing guitars and close vocal\nharmony. With just enough folk\ninfluence to keep your spine tingling\nand enough country to keep your\ntoes at appin'. On top of this are two\nof the most powerful and pure\nfemale voices around today with\ntunes and lyrics to lift you up to\nhigher places.\nIf this wasn't enough\u2014it was\u2014\nthe concert closed with a guest\nappearance of the legendary Joan\nBaez. If you haven't heard of her\nyour parents will have all her\nalbums! Their three voices together\nwere matched in ability\u2014a complement to the musical skill of\nthe Indigo Girls.

Simply sound choon s or\nas a friend of mine would put it\n'tude. Smart, smart melodic indie\nthat leaps and jumps around out of\nthe banal indie guitar fashion, but\nso loosely like floppy hair.\nHyperhead are loud and chunky,\nbut I 've seen more activity in a packed tin of sardines than this\nplace. Live exuberance surpassed\nonly by Nitzer Ebb, bass is so\noverwhelming it seeps under your\nfeet, grabs your ankles and pulls,\nleaving your teeth chattering\nuncontrollably. Percussionist and\nsinger in a wild, unrestrained frenzy\nscorching traces on the psyche; only\ngripe is 3 guitar w anker types doing\nnothing but pose. Still, it was\nSmashing.\nSloan were overpowered tonight,\nbut the subtleties made their\nstatement. Hyperhead were in\noverdrive and only a fool would've\nwalked out.\nMC4 were there, Huggy Bear\nsupposedly were there, but where\nwere you?\nLucas\n\u2022Sloan's 'Underwhelmed' out\nnow on Geffen.

Arguably Jack of all\ntrades and master of none, but what\nis undeniably important is the\nunderlying attitude.\nAvocado Baby were a little shy\nfor their own good, but top marks\nfor the blok e who was dress-ed up.\nAs a band they really weren't together, and were in fact shite.\nItchy Poo potted their president,\nand despite only two numbers\nshowed a lot of potential.\nEnraged and incensed were\nBikini Kill, stomping through but\nsomehow didn't have the\nspontaneity despite the tons of\naggression. Better than the previous\nacts by a long way, but not as good\nas was about to come.\nAt last, Huggy Bear got up on\nstage; technical prowess not their\nforte, but their confrontational\naudacity kicks you in the face. They\ndon't want to be lumped in with\npunk, but they are. The original\npunk was partly a backlash against\n60's flower power that had been\ndragged into the early 70's( escapist\nvs confrontational attitude).\nSimilarly Huggy Bear are repressed\nall right, all the bands were, but\nwhat differentiates this lot is that the\nrepression has fermented anger,\nwhich rips chunks out of conformity\nin magnanimous proportions. Just\nfeel the voice of society muted by\nthe anger of youth and never forget\ninsanity breeds genius. I must admit\nI was a cynic before, but am now\ndefinitely converted; I must also be\nsome sort of warped pervert, angry\nwomen turn me on!\nBikini Kill and Huggy Bear were\nthe only two bands worth going to\nsee, they could both definitely incite\na riot, but a revolution? Time will\ntell.\nLucas.\nFelix 962\nMUS1C\n12 March 1993\nThe Tragically Hip, The4 of\nUs, Ghost of an American Airman \u2014 T&C It was a night for the vocalist to strut\ntheir wares in front of faceless and\npretty dour bands. First into the\nlimelight was Ghosts. Dodge\nMcKay; high on the Spinal Trap\nrating. Looking something like\nMorrissey and acting like a squirrel\non acid, the stage was his world.\nJumping up and down, into the\ncrowd and most memorably\nperforming a handstand, motionless\nfor a minute, he mirrored the\nintensive nature of their music.\nEnergetically loud. Unfortunately\nthat was about it, loud. The golden\negg in their basket was 'Freakshow'\nfrom their EP '4'. Roll up and see\nDodge the hyperactive squirrel\u2014\nit's got a ring to it.\nThe 4 Of Us in it it ally appeared\nto be a ill framed bunch. There were\nfive of them and their lighting\nlooked like a reject from the Gary\nGlitter farewell tour. Nevertheless\nthey managed to rise above it for at\nleast half the time. The psychedelic\nswirling tracks had a bite to them,\nwhilst the more conventional stuff\nlike 'Sensual Thing' was going\nnowhere; rather like the two\nguitarists who didn't move except\nto breathe and then none too often.\nAgain it was the lead singer, one\nBrendan Murphy who carried the\nday. Drooping black fringe and\nevidence of an acne ridden past\ngave note of a man ready for rock\n'n' roll stardom.\nThen it was time for the 'Hip' as\nthe initiated call them. (To be\ninitiated you had to be Canadian and\ntalk lie something out of Wayne's World.)\n'Hi, Winnipeg.' 'Hi Vancouver.'\n'What are you doing over here,\ndude?' 'Hey, I work for IBM( garth)' 'Yer dude, my dad was\npresident of IBM, Canada.' 'No\nWay.' 'Way.' Party on Wayne,\nhere's a stick of dynamite!\nThankfully The Hip weren't too\nlong before corning on. Swiftly they\nbroke into their new album 'Fully\nCompletely'. The live ness breathed\ncolour into an album which had\nbeen rather 2D on first hearing.\nTracks like 'At the 100th Meridian'\nand 'Pigeon Camera' were more\naccessible, dragging you into a wall\nof rhythmic motion. Even weaker\nsongs like 'Lionized' and '50\nMission Cap' started to crack a whip like they wanted to go\nsomeplace.\nFrontman Gord Downie was an\ninteresting mix of Henry Rollins\nand Robin Williams. Facially it was\nWilliams; pulling faces and\nscrewing up his eyes but under it all\na concentrated energy all dressed up\nand ready to play.\nThroughout, all the initiated\ncontinued to jump merrily around,\nand then start a feud with the T&C security. By the end about 20\nembryonic stage-divers had\nattempted to plunge. Most being\ntreated to the 40 second trip marked\n'EXIT'. Still the show went on and\nfinally ended with a trim phant 'Eldorado'.\nFor a band renowned for their\nlive performances, they had\nimpressed and I hadn't understood\na word God had said; especially the\nbit about his Grandmother and a nuclear submarine. Tragic.\nTintin.\n\u2022 'Fully Completely' released no\non MCA. A Riot Grrrl yesterday.\nThe Devil plus one. Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 962\nReviews12 March 1993\nOrlando\nOrlando is a 'person' who lives for\n400 years, initially as a man then\nas a woman. The story begins in the\n17th century, when he is charged\nwith entertaining Queen Elizabeth\nI. We are then taken through the\nchapters of his (and then her) life,\neach a different period and theme\n: 1600 - Death, 1612 -Love, 1700 - Poetry, 1750 -Politics, 1800 - Sex, etc.\nculminating in a return to the\noriginal location but in the present\nday.\nThough Orlando is about\nambiguous sexuality, the direction\nis distinctly feminine, with each\nshot a delicate framing of the central\ncharacter (Tilda Swinton) in\nextrovert colour. This combined\nwith the simply constructed music\nreminds one of Peter Greenaway's films, but Sally Potter has added\nsuch personal features as the\ncharacter occasionally addressing\nthe camera and an outrageous\nflying, singing Jimmy Somerville\nappearing at the end. Her intention\nseems to be to emp a this e the\naudience with Orlando, with\nnumerous silent close-up's thor ugh out the film, which became\noccasionally tedious, though I think\nthe desired effect was achieved. The\nOrlando.\ncostumes and period sets where\ndelightful and almost a distraction\nfrom the central theme, a great deal\nof effort has obviously gone into\nthis production from actors and\ncrew alike. Whether this is an\naccurate adaptation of Virginia\nWoolfe's novel I cannot say but it\nstands as an intelligent and original\nwork in it's own right. This is\nwhere British cinema should be\nheading.\nAralia Elegantissima.\nFood\nInternational Night\nOK, here is the second instalment\nof the Good Food Column. This\nweek we review the biggest and best\nevent IC stages - International Nite.\nBut us being food types will review\nthe Food Fair only, leaving the\ncultural thing to those cultural kinda\npeople!\nThere were dishes originating\nfrom 11 different countries, giving\nInternational Nite the uniqueness\nnot achieved at any other time in IC.\nThis year professional chefs were\ncalled in to cook, and by all\naccounts their efforts were well\nappreciated.\nWe cannot list the actual dishes\nthat were to be tried, as there were\njust too many and if we do forgive\nthe spelling, including veggie and\nnon-veggie food. And we would\nlike to say now that if we do not\nmention some food it does not mean\nthat it was not good, it just means\nthat we could only try a limited\namount of food! Also all the food\nwe tried we liked, and by asking\nothers it seems that all the food was\nSUPERB, so don't get offended if\nyour food has not been mentioned.\nVic first tried some Italian,\nserved by three very unlikely\nItalians! It was a spinach pancake\nthing, and was wonderful even\nmore so as Vic had never tried it\nbefore. Nainish went and accosted\nthe Iranian people and was\nsubsequently served a huge helping\nof sweetened rice (no idea of what\nwent into it) with peas and chicken.\nThe Latin American food was a must to try and Vic got a plateful\nof Brazilian rice (notice how the\nstaple food is rice for so many\ncultures?) and some crab dish (Crab\nMoqueca?). The Turkish stall gave\nus some stewed lamb curry, cooked\nthe Turkish way and to sweeten our\npalates there was a plateful of\nTurkish Delight. Nainish found the\nNigerian food to be a completely\nnew experience with a huge choice\nof dishes, from which he chose the\nblack bean stew, fried plantains and\nsome bread fruit, and now strongly\nrecommends the M DH to cook\nmore African food!\nGoing on, the Spanish stall had\nsome crispy chicken which we\nwanted to try, but by now both of\nus were too full to try any more!\nThe Indian stall ran out of food\nbefore we even had a chance to get\nthere, which speaks volumes for the\nattracting power of the food and\npeople serving it! The Malaysian\nand Singaporean (joint) stall was\nattracting great attention at the end\nwhere the deserts were creating a huge commotion - this coloured\njelly (Ayam Golek?), some sponge\ncake with coconut and fruit.\nSumming up the food at the Fair\nwas more authentic than most\nrestaurants that either of us have\nbeen to, because it was all prepared\nin a rush and in bulk like is done\nwith a big family in a crowded\nkitchen, with no time for the chefs\nto do their nouvelle cuisine stuff.\nThe atmosphere in the M DH was\ntruly brilliant, with all the cultures\nand foods mixing so well together,\nand giving many people the chance\nto try taste sensations they would\nnever have otherwise.\nCongratulations must go to the\nOSC for the time and effort gone\ninto organising this, especially Nina\nBhanap who managed to cajole and\ncomfort 10 touchy chefs throughout\nthe day well enough for them to\nproduce some amazing food.\n(No marks awarded as the\nexperience only happens once a year!)\nVic & Nainish\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "Cat's Eyes\nRed Nose Day IV\nI'm not going to start moaning\nabout charity in general and how it\nwould be unnecessary if all wealth\nwas distributed evenly, since this\nmatter is often brought up by\nsomebody else and it is boring to\nread or listen to anyway. It seems\nthat perpetrators of this argument\nare banging their heads against a brick wall because the situation has\ngot worse; more charity events such\nas Comic Relief and benefit\nconcerts are occurring. These are\nto the general delight of the public,\nsince the concerts are often\nexcellent and Comic Relief has\nnever caused me to do anything but\nlaugh. But I feel that ideas are very\nthin on the ground though, as far as\nRed Nose Day is concerned. The\nRed Nose-type object has become\nthe symbol of Comic Relief since\nit started in 1987; first the noses\nwere small, then they were bigger,\nthen they developed hands and now\nit has metamorphosis ed into a tomato. What will they do for Red\nNose Day V in 1995?\nRachel Basset\nI think I owe her one whopping\ngreat apology for last weeks\nrepetition of what I see now was a particularly cruel joke that was\npossibly out of order. This action\nis not instigated by that letter from\nSarah Lee (RCSU A AO BITCH),\nbut by reports from people at the\nhustings that she defended me. It\nseems then that I owe her a thankyou as well. (I can't believe I'm writing this!)\nMalcolm X How much publicity has been given\nto this film!!? I think everyone\nwould agree: too bloody much. I have not seen it yet because despite\nDenzil Washington's alleged\nsparkling performance, the identity\nof the director has put me off. Spike\nLee's previous efforts, although\nentertaining and possibly very close\nto real life, always focus on the\nFelix 962\npair i, anguish, torment blah, blah,\nblah, that the white community has\nand is inflicting on the black\ncommunity. I go to the cinema,\nmainly to be entertained, but also\nto learn a few things. I don't go to\nexperience a guilt trip, as many of\nmy white friends have, and then\nleave with a feeling that all the\nhatred among the black community\nis my fault. I remember seeing or\nreading an interview with Spike Lee\nin which he said this was not the\naim of this film. Things don't always turn out the way we want\nthem to. Being a member of the film\nindustry, I am surprised he hasn't learn this lesson yet.\nSabbatical Elections\nAfter denying that I would not\nmention the election to several\nstudents in Felix, I find myself\ngoing back on my word. All I want\nto say is congr atu al at ions to all\nwinners and I hope they do a damn\ngood job next year.\nP.J. Dodd Opinion\n12 March 1993\nCredits\nNews: Gareth, Jacob, Declan,\nAndrew.

Islam\u2014as we\nstressed a number of times\nbefore\u2014is not a mere religion\u2014\nwhich is commonly known to tackle\nthe spiritual aspect of Man only\u2014\nbut indeed a full and complete way\nof life, since it would not be right\nor wise for God to create Man\nwithout providing him with the\nrules and guidance necessary for\nhim to run his own affairs in a just\nand fair way.\nAnd history bears witness to this\nfact when it was implemented\nwholly and fully.\nIt is obvious from last week's Beit\nBack article, that its author found\na book on Islam written by a good\nold orientalist repeating the same\ngood old false, biased,\nmisinterpreted allegations.\nIslam is the last religion sent\ndown from God to the whole of\nMankind and not a certain nation or\ntribe and is similar to all the\nmessages that came before it. It was\nbrought down through Angel\nGabriel (peace be upon him), and\nI consider it foolish to assert a nationality to any of God's Angels\n(peace be upon them).\nAs for the claims made on the\nQuran, indeed they are not but\nclaims short of any substantial proof\nor evidence 'And if you are in doubt\nas to what we have revealed to our\nservant then produce a chapter like\nit and call your witnesses or helpers\nbesides God, if you are tm th ful. But\nif you cannot, and of surety will\nnot, then fear the fire whose fuel is\nmen and stones which prepared for\nthose who reject faith' Quran\n2:22-23.\nAs for the slaughtering of non-muslims you must be either joking\nor lying.

Four sabbaticals\nvoice their wishes.\nPRESIDENT\nThe Presidents job cannot be\nsummed up in 300 words or\nprobably even in print. In many\nways it is what you make of it and\nmost of my work is self inflicted.\nThe few administrative jobs which\nI do have are delegated to the\npermanent staff, because they will\nIf I were here next year I would like\nto see a change in areas of\nresponsibility of the various\nofficers. In many cases there is\nconfusion as to who is supposed to\nbe doing what. I am responsible for\nclubs & societies and the HonSec\nis responsible for overseas students,\nso who takes care of overseas\nstudent societies? Further, it always\nstrikes me as absurd that the Deputy\nPresident has to arrange security for\nevents coordinated by the HonSec\nHON SEC\nThis may appear to be something of\na tired old clich e\" but it's painfully\ntrue. There are only 24 hours in a day. Whether you like it or not you\ninevitably end up prior it ising your\ntime. Things that at the start of the\nyear you'd had the best of intentions\nto put right, to devote endless hours\nof effort to, become,\nunintentionally, rusty heaps on the\nroad side.\nI 've always tried to work by the\nethic 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'.\nRag has seen very little of me. I don't think they've needed me. My FELIX EDITOR\nMost of the job of Felix Editor and\nPrint Unit Manager is running fast\nto just keep standing still. With the\nneed to produce and organise a weekly magazine, a job that in the\nmedia industry is usually broken up\nbetween a team of people, precious\nlittle time is left for planning and\nimproving Felix.\nOn top of this, working and being\nresponsible for the machinery of the\nPrint Unit makes the job even more\ndifficult. If I had my time again, I would concentrate on two things:\nbo a better job of them.\nI have to be all things to all\n(wo)men. I have to deal with every\ncustomer in an individual, be they\na student, member of my staff,\nmember of college staff and so on.\nThe type of queries I get are the\nones that nobody else knows the\nanswer to and, on the whole,\nand arranged by Ents. If they were\nall done by the same person, life\nwould be a lot simpler.\nUnion sabbaticals are a wasted\nresource. There is an awful lot of\nwork currently undertaken by\nsabbaticals that need not be. The\none thing that I think I have spent\nmost time on this year is security.\nIt has been satisfying to shake the\nUnion security operation into some\nsemblance of order, but it only\nneeds to be overseen, and not run\nab sense doesn't seem to have\naffected them because they've\nraised incredible amounts of money\nthis year. They ain't broke and they\ndon't need fixing. I'd like Rag to\nthink that if they wanted any help\nthen I was around to give it. I hope\nthat the OSC Commitee feel the\nsame way.\nIf I had my time again then I'd try to spend more time with the\nstudent societies. This is though\nsomething of a false promise but I feel obliged to make it.\nWhat I set out to do from the start\nFirstly organising the structure of\nthe Print Unit and Felix so the\npeople who work here understand\nthe organisation better. Secondly,\nto spend much more time at the\nbeginning of the year, dragging\npeople into Felix so it is much more\nrepresentative of Imperial College.\nThe unfortunate fact is that while\nthe Union has bucked up its ideas\nand joined the 1990's, Felix has\nnot. Felix needs to get more\nstudents writing for the magazine\nso, pressure is taken off those who\nrequire delegation, although if I just\ndid that I would be a poor President.\nI identify and solve problems. This\nmay mean setting up a major project\nor simply having a few words with\nthe appropriate people. At the end\nof the day it all takes time and that\nis one thing I seem to have none of.\nI have a year left to do in my\nby a sabbatical.\nWhen you consider that between\na third and half the DP's time is\ntaken up with external work i.e. representation on College\ncommittees, the time he/she is able\nto devote to internal affairs seems\nall the more precious.\nI would like to see the Deputy\nPresident in more of a management\nrole, making sure the financial side\nof the Union runs smoothly, and\nkeeps changing with the times.\nof my year was to promote the\nUnion as a social centre. The\nrefurbishment of the bar was a great\nhelp and I'd now like to think that\nstudents, particularly first years,\nalways think of the Union as the\nfirst place to go on a night out. If\nI had another year then I'd push the\nUnion even harder. There's still too\nmany people who don't know\nwhat's going on. You can never\nspend enough on advertising; I hope\nmy successor doesn't let this slide.\nWhen I set out my manifesto I purposely didn't fill it with false\nspend a great deal of time and\nenergy putting together sections of\nour magazine at the moment.\nAnother section of the Felix job\nis DOBSON, very few at Imperial\nwill even know what this stands for.\nDOBSON is a directory listing all\nthe student newspapers in the\ncountry, and is organised through\nthe Felix Office. It has enormous\npotential, maybe expanding to\ncover other countries, other student\nmedia, and possibly sending student\nnewspapers over electronic mail.\nChris Davidson\ndepartment but when I do look for\na job I would like one that is similar\nto my job now, if perhaps better\npayed. In short I love the job but\nit is not good for the health, mental\nor physical.\nAll the best,\nChris.\nRick Bilby\nResponsibilities for the day-to-day\nrunning of the Union should be\ndevolved to other Union officers or\npermanent staff.\nI have instigated changes to make\nfairer the distribution of Union\nfunds, but I believe that we could\nget rid of a lot of the red tape and\nmake the system run more\nefficiently. I know which areas need\nthe most attention, and I hope my\nsuccessor will carry on where I leave off at the end of July\nDom Wilkinson\npromises. I am always angered by\ncandidates whose pledges are as\nsolid as the foundations of castles\nin Spain. If you talk bullshit then\nyou eventually end up with some of\nit on your face. I knew what I could\nachieve in the time I had and so I'm fairly content.\nA Sabattical year will always be\nfrustrating because it's too short. By\nthe time you've learnt the ropes it's the twelfth round and you're out.\nPerhaps it's time for a new member\nof staff?\nJonty Beavan\nCo-operation over all the\nUniversities of the UK is immensely\npowerful. A network of student\nmedia could exist without the\nendemic problems of the NUS and\nwould mean we are taken a great\ndeal more seriously than at present.\nI hope my successor realises this\nand continues the work of the\nprevious Felix Editor who set up\nDOBSON.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\nPage 8\n\n"
