When a\npair of eyes were drawn\non the box, however, the\ntakings for the next week\nwere much higher.\u201d He\nwonderedwhetherwithout\na \u201cdivine spy camera in\nthe sky reading their every\nthought\u201d people would be\nmore willing to do wrong.\nWhile not much of\na story in itself, it does\nhighlight an important\npoint. Guilt, while not\nthe most popular emotion\nthese days, can be a great\nforce for good when it\ndrives people to behave\nbetter.\nThe Royal Shakespeare\ncompany has recently\nhalted a partnership with\nBP that funded subsidised\n\u00a35 16-25 youth tickets\nto all performances after\ncoming under sustained\npressure from climate organisations such as To BP\nOr Not BP, youth groups\nand the resignation of\nMark Rylance on environmental and BP divestment\ngrounds.\nIn his resignation letter,\nRylance explained that\nthe sponsorship gave BP a\nblank cheque to continue\npolluting by allowing it to\n\u201cobscure the destructive\nreality of its activities\u201d\nthrough philanthropic and\narts funding.\n\u201cI do not wish to be\nassociated with BP any\nmore than I would with\nan arms dealer, a tobacco\nsalesman or anyone who\nwilfully destroys the lives\nof others alive and unborn.\nNor, I believe, would\nWilliam Shakespeare,\u201d\nWhile my inner curmudgeon instinctively\nreacts against this and\nscoffs at his historical revisionism the facts of the\ncase speak for themselves.\nBP is the 6th most\npolluting company in the\nworld, pumping out 34\nbillion tonnes of carbon\ndioxide a year, they have\nactively lobbied the\nTrump administration to\nexpand oil exploration\nand drilling in the Arctic\nand have propped up\nand traded with regimes\nwhich have been accused\nof serious human rights\nviolations in Azerbaijan,\nAlgeria, Libya, Indonesia,\nand other countries. This\nis on top of the ecological\ndamage caused by disasters such as the Deepwater\nhorizon drilling rig explosion which released just\nunder 200 million gallons\ninto the ocean \u2013 the\nlargest marine oil accident\nin US history. Despite all\nthis, in 2018 BP\u2019s profit\nrose to a five-year high\nof $12.7 billion, double\nthe previous year\u2019s $6.17\nbillion.\nThe RSC sponsorship\non the other hand is\nthought to make up only\n0.6% of the RSC budget\nand combined sponsorship\nto the British Museum,\nthe National Portrait\nGallery, the Royal Opera\nHouse and the Royal\nShakespeare Company\namounted to only \u00a37.5\nmillion over five years.\nThe small size of the\nsponsorship deal is at odds\nwith the positive effect\nthat these sponsorship\ndeals can have for BP\u2019s\nreputation. At an AGM\nin 2012, BP admitted\nthat sponsorship deals go\nthrough \u201cexactly the same\nprocesses as we would for\nany investment\u201d. Furthermore, research by sponsorship specialist Havas\nSports & Entertainment\nshowed that of the people\naware of BP\u2019s sponsorship\nof the Olympic games\n38% believed BP that\nhad been getting better at\nworking towards a cleaner\nplanet. Importantly, this\nwas in 2012, only a year\nafter Deepwater Horizon.\nThe point is that BP\nclearly understands the\nvalue of sponsorship\ndeals when it comes to\nimproving their image.\nInstitutions like the Royal\nthis doesn\u2019t address the\nfunding hole that this will\nleave. Proposals for the\ngovernment to make up\nthe difference are na\u00efve at\nbest.\nInstead, our cultural\ninstitutions should\nrecognise the value of\na sponsorship deal and\ncharge for them correctly.\nJust like carbon offsetting\nplaces a financial cost on\ncompanies that are polluting by charging them\nper ton of CO2, providing\na financial incentive\nto decrease emissions,\ncompanies trying to repair\ntheir reputation should\nhave to pay dearly for it.\nWhile forcing the RSC\nto bow under pressure\nmight give the activists\ninvolved in the campaign\na rush of pleasure, they\nshould not feel that they\nhave advanced the cause\nof environmentalism.\nInstead, BP just has more\nmoney and a valuable\ninstitution has less.\nRather than disassociate themselves from BP\nthe RSC should simply\nremove the BP logo from\ntheir tickets and website\nand continue to accept the\nmoney. If BP complains,\nthe RSC should simply\nexplain that BP adversely\naffects the reputation\nof the RSC and that if\nthey wish to associate\nthemselves with some of\nBritain\u2019s most important\ncultural institutions, they\nmust either pay more or\nimprove their reputations.\nIf we keep our eyes on\nBP, acting as the judges\nthat refuse to engage with\nthem unless they improve\ntheir behaviour, maybe\nBP can be forced to put a\ncouple more pounds into\nthe pot.\nThe RSC Theatre doesn\u2019t come cheap // Pixabay\nShakespeare Company\nhaven\u2019t realised and are\ntherefore selling themselves short. To return to\nthe example that began\nthis article rather than\nputting the correct amount\nof money into the arts\nand culture honesty box\nto offset the harm that\nthey do BP has managed\nto get themselves into a\nsituation where they toss\na few pennies onto the\nfloor and everyone thanks\nthem for their generous\ncontribution.\nBy cutting off funding\ndeals with BP the RSC\nhas made the first step,\nrecognising the error of\nproviding reputational\nrelief to companies at\nsuch a low rate. However,\n\u201cBP clearly\nunderstands\nthe value of\nsponsorship\ndeals\u201c\n\n"

New members\nare settling into the team,\nhave largely been trained,\nand a few of them have\neven been fully integrated\ninto our cult and joined the\nweekly Felix drinks. Oh,\nsorry, I meant \u201csociety\u201d,\nnot cult. Be sure to sign\nup to Felix for free on the\nUnion site, kids.\nIn fact, a few people\noffered me the highest\npraise they know how\nto give: \u201cthis could have\ncome out in Fred\u2019s year.\u201d\nTo some of you that\nwon\u2019t mean much \u2013 for\ncontext, Fred Fyles was\nEditor two years ago and\nis considered by those\npeople praising the issue\nto be little less than super-human. Living up to that\ntype of legacy at Felix\nwas one thing that both\nexcited and unnerved me\nwhen deciding whether\nto run for the Editor role;\nit\u2019s nice to have somewhat\nreached it in week two.\nOn the other hand,\nit would also be nice\nto escape that shadow.\nThere is a slight fear that\neverything I do this year\nwill only be considered\nrelative to how it has\nbeen done before, when\nI\u2019m most passionate\nabout the new things I\u2019m\nintroducing \u2013 both in the\npaper and behind-the-scenes.\nThis is something I\nsuspect many Imperial\nstudents can relate to.\nWe are all thrown into\none of the hardest degree\ncourses in the world, and\nexpected to match up to\nvery high standards \u2013 a\nlegacy left by great names\ncome before us, and that\none guy in the year above\nwho never revises but\nsomehow still comes out\nwith 93% in every effing\nexam. Especially those\nof us who want to go\ninto academics know that\nto succeed we not only\nhave to match, but rather\noutdo the clever clogs\nwho have preceded us. It\u2019s\ninfuriating and inspiring\nin equal measure, a challenge to both our pride\nand our insecurity \u2013 traits\nI think most of us have\nin abundance, openly or\notherwise.\nPersonally I think that,\ncollectively, we need to\ngive ourselves a damn\nbreak \u2013 and remember\nthat there will always be\na path to where we want\nto be, even if we don\u2019t\nsucceed at every stage.\nLet me be a lesson: I\nscrewed my degree up, as\nthe Physics Senior Tutor\nwill surely attest, but was\nfortunate enough to find I\nlove writing (as you can\ntell by this meandering\nmess of an Editorial) and\nto land a great job doing\nthat. There\u2019s always a\npath.\nUnfortunately, this philosophy of giving oneself\na break needs to be tempered by an understanding\nof when it is appropriate\nto do so. Back to my\nhubris. Let this be another\nlesson \u2013 in what not to do,\nthis time.\nLast week turning\nout very well led me to\nallow myself a whole two\ndays off in a row, after\nworking something like\na combined 140 hours in\nthe previous two weeks \u2013\nincluding a nice 37-hour\nshift over last Wednesday\nand Thursday.\nIn the words of the\nfabulous Eddie Izzard:\n\u201cOh, stupid man.\u201d (If you\nhaven\u2019t seen Dress to Kill,\nstop reading this nonsense\nand watch it immediately.)\nI was not prepared.\nThe nature of Felix\nis that one has to be a\nfirefighter, fixing all the\nsmall things that pop up\nat the last minute. Do not\nget me wrong \u2013 this is the\nmost satisfied and driven\nI\u2019ve felt in years, but there\nare also a lot of things\nthat aren\u2019t delving into\ninvestigations, but rather\nmanaging relationships\nor (most dreaded of all)\nadmin.\nMy complacency\nmeant that the flames\nstoked higher without\nanybody to notice, and\nwe very nearly got burned\nthis week. The inflamed\nimages of the first issue\u2019s\ncopy problems, scorched\ninto my retinas, floated\nbefore my eyes.\nOnce again, I am\ninclined to believe this is\na highly relatable feeling\nat university \u2013 although\nperhaps that\u2019s just the\nlatent scruffy, disorganised teenager that lurks\nin my cold mid-20s heart\nshining through a bit.\nI\u2019m writing this on\nWednesday evening \u2013\nand things are burning a\nlittle bit. Consider this a\nmetaphorical cry for help.\nSo all I can hope is that\neverything worked out\nokay, and I can pretend\nthat none of it ever\nhappened. Perhaps after\nanother 37-hour shift (oh,\nyay).\nI\u2019ll just walk out of the\noffice on Thursday night,\nwhistling nonchalantly in\nthat way that lets everybody know you\u2019re trying\nto be inconspicuous and\nthus failing in that task\nmiserably, at 3am long\nafter the print deadline\nhas passed and poor Beit\nfreshers are stumbling\nfrom the Union into their\nconveniently located beds.\nYou can pull anything off\nif you just commit hard\nenough, whether that\u2019s\nthe violently neon catsuit\nyour mates convinced you\nto parade around Metric\nor a passion project you\njust scraped in on time!\nFront Cover // Taja Strle\nT\nAnother week,\nanother issue,\nanother rant - this\ntime on hubris,\nexpectations, and\nhow they can\nburn you!\n\n"

Asking\nfor a postponement is\nactually required by law,\nthe Benn Act, which\nreceived Royal Assent\nby the Queen on 9th\nSeptember. Johnson\u2019s\ngovernment confirmed last Friday\nthat the Prime Minister\nwill indeed ask for a\ndelay on 19th October\nif no deal between the\nUnited Kingdom and\nthe European Union is\nreached by then. The piece\nof legislation provides\nrequirements surrounding the phrasing of the\nletterthatJohnsonwillhave\nto write, which dramatically reduced, but has\nnot excluded, the possibility of finding a\n\u201chole\u201d through which he\ncan ignore the will\nof Parliament and instead head for a no deal\nscenario.\nIn the past, many\nmembers of the Government have been outspoken about pursuing an\nextension, including Foreign Secretary\nDominic Raab and the\nChancellor of the Duchy\nof Lancaster Michael\nGove. The Prime Minister\nhimself declared that he\nwould \u201crather be dead in a\nditch\u201dthandefertheBrexit\nsaga to January 31st,\nthe new possible date set\nby the House of\nCommons for UK depar-ture. However, Johnson\nbelieves that he can still\nreach a deal before having\nto write to Brussels, an\nd on Thursday October\n3rd unveiled plans that\nmade new concessions\nto the EU concerning the\nIrish backstop question.\nAccording to these plans,\nNorthern Ireland would\nabide to single market regulations for manufactured goods and\nfood, and that this would\nbe subjected to a decision\ntaken every four\nyears by the NI\nAssembly. Both the EU\nand the Irish Government have expressed scepticism about the feasibility\nof such measures, which\nwould require border\nchecks. These have\nbeen deemed by\nmany to undermine the commitments of\nthe Good Friday Agreementthatwasputinplaceto\nend the fierce conflict in\nthe region. In the Brexit\ndebate, the Leader of\nthe House, Jacob\nRees-Mogg, has previously suggested the\npossibility of exclusively implementing digital checks, but\nit has also been\nstressed that nowhere\nin the world are such\ncontrols already in place.\nFurthermore, the question\narises as to whether it\u2019s\nwise to introduce such\nchecks while being about\nto leave the block, in\na region where sectarian violence could\neasily be revived. Despite\nhis best efforts, Johnson\u2019s\nproposal for the backstop\nhas been \u201cditched\u201d by\nEU leaders due\nto concerns that his proposition is untested and \u201cnot\nserious at all\u201d, however,\nEuropean Commission\nPresident Jean-Claude\nJuncker told MEPs that he\nwould not exclude a deal\nin the coming days.\nOn this note, the PM\nhas reiterated his view\nthat the main cause for a\ndeal not being agreed\nyet is the EU\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate. In\ncontrast, Secretary of\nState for Work and\nPensions Amber Rudd\nresigned on the 7th of\nSeptember, citing the\ngovernment\u2019s disinterest\nin negotiating a deal\nand denouncing that its\nfocus has been solely on\npreparing for a hard\nBrexit. In fact, the government announced at the\nend of July that an extra\n2.1 billion pounds would\nbe spent on preparations for a no-deal Brexit,\nto stockpile medicine,\nset up new border and\ncustoms operations,\nand improve infrastructure at ports.\nHowever, the level\nof the nation\u2019s prepara-ly seems improbable. On\nthe economic side, inflation could impact the\nsocial care sector and the\noverall price of imported\ngoods might increase, affecting the lower class in\nparticular. Many businesses on the Irish border\ncould be severely struck,\nwith the risk of rising\nunemployment and the\ndevelopment of illegal\nactivities in proximity of\nthe border. Disruption\nwould also manifest in the\nform of consistent queues\nin Kent, towards Dover,\nwith a worst-case estimation of travel time necessary for a lorry to cross\nthe French border exceeding 2 days.

    "content": "IC Fishing Society finds affordable fishing in London\nO\nkay now you\u2019ve\ntaken the bait.\nThere is no\nImperial fishing\nsociety, but I do recommend starting a society if\nenough of you are inter-ested. Also I am gill-ty of\nnot technically fishing in\nLondon, it was Epping,\nbut Central line does go\nthere! Affordability is also\nquestionable, \u00a340 for a\nfull day fishing rainbow\ntrout, being able to take\ntwo fish home, and equipment hire is pretty damn\nsteep. Thankfully this was\na birthday treat and for me\nit was free.\nIn my younger years\nI was a keen watcher of\nRiver Monsters and ever\nsince watching Jeremy\nWade wrestle beasts from\nthe deep, I\u2019ve wanted to\ntry my hand at fishing.\nAs well as the thrill of\nthe catch, the aspect of\nchilling on the bank with a\nbrewski is very appealing.\nSo last Saturday six of\nus headed to Thornwood\nextremely helpful. We\nwere given our fly fishing\nrods, nets and priest (a\nbat for killing fish), and\noff we went! Only two\nmembers of the group\nhaving fished before, and\nno one having fly fished.\nWith our combined vast\nexperience we did not\ndecide to buy the instructor package whereby Peter\nwould have helped us.\nPeter having noticed our\nperplexed looks kindly\ngave us a small tutorial on\nfly fishing. Unfortunately\nour incompetence knows\nno bounds and on being\nset loose on the lake we\nbegan having problems.\nPeter was great about it,\ndetangling, reattaching\nfloats, re-tying lines. He\nwasn\u2019t upset or annoyed,\nbut disappointed. Like a\nfather figure we tried to\ngain approval by quickly\nimproving our fishing\ntechnique, and our first\ncouple hours of fishing\nwere fortuitous; six fish\nwere caught! Steve\u2019s\nguidance was trout-lessly\nhelped us, but as the\nday cooled the fished\nstopped nibbling and we\nended up with only ten\nbefore heading home and\ncooking.\nThe act of fishing is\nnot only fun, but relaxing,\nexciting and somewhat\ntherapeutic. When a fish\nbites and you first feel\nit thrashing away it is\nexhilarating, yanking the\nrod, keeping tension on\nthe line and pulling the\nunfortunate lil bugger in\nis thrilling. Chilling on\nthe bank keeping an eye\non the float is suspense-ful, and it does require\npatience. Sitting on the\nbank with my besties,\nsipping brewskies, and\nthe sunset in the beyond\nthe M25 wildlands was\na lovely experience. I\nwill be sure to go fishing\nagain!\nSPORTS\nImraj Singh\nSports Editor\nIf you don\u2019t have matching bucket hats did you really go fishing? // Peter\nFELIX ISSUE 1729\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n47\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

Although\nthere is a focus on the\nrelationship between\none group of Western\nteenagers and a Syrian\nartist-turned-refugee, it\nforces the audience to\nconfront their relationship\nwith the terrible images\nthat haunt our television\nscreens every time there is\na news bulletin concerning conflict. It encourages\nthe viewer to look past the\npornography of suffering,\nexplosions and death, and\nput oneself in the position\nof someone enduring\nthe sheer brutality of\nthe Syrian civil war. As\nopposed to abstraction\nand passivity, it aims to\ngenerate empathy.\nThe artwork was\nlocated in an intimate\nsetting, with a small\naudience of ten or so\npeople. Each member of\nthe audience was given\na pair of headphones, an\narmchair and an old-fash-ioned television set,\nthrough which footage\nwas played. I am sure this\nwas intended to simulate\nthe isolation in which\nwe experience the news,\nalthough of course in this\nday and age, we are far\nmore likely to be reading\nabout the conflict hunched\nover a smartphone on\nthe tube than in a genteel\nliving room.\nI found several other\nstylisticchoicesalsorather\nodd. In order to simulate\nsnowfall, for example,\na fan gently sprinkled\nsmall bits of paper around\nthe room. Removing the\npaper from my hair afterwards was frustrating, and\nthe sheer unnecessariness\nof it further annoyed me.\nThe brief attempts at pro-fundity, speculating about\nstatic on the television as\nremnants of the Big Bang\nalso wound me up as more\nunnecessary additions.\nThe concept of how we\nengage with modern conflicts through the medium\nof news is surely profound\nenough without adding\nBryan Cox into the mix.\nThe area where the\nart succeeded most of all\nwas the footage. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ll be able to forget\nthe video of one of the\nartist\u2019s relatives breaking\ndown during the conflict.\nReem Karssli is masterful\nwith a camera. I also\nthought that instructing\naudience members to\ncluster cross-legged\nclaustrophobically close\nto one another on the floor\nto simulate a sea crossing\nin a small boat was rather\ninteresting. However,\nthis technique did rather\ndepend on effective\naudience participation,\nsomething that could\nnot be relied on as two\nmembers of the audience\nignored the instructions\nand just did their own\nthing.\nOverall I think, as a\npiece of art, it is mediocre\nat best but the message\nthat it is sending is hugely\nimportant. As opposed to\nthe version of conflict we\nare used to, a war reporter\nwith a flak jacket standing\nin the wreckage of a\nschool next to a bearded\nman in battle dress\nclutching a Kalashnikov,\nbreathlessly wanking\nhimself off about how\nclose to the frontlines he\nis, Now is the Time to Say\nNothing provides an alternate vision. That of the\ncivilian, forced to relocate\ndue to a brutal conflict.\nAlthough not brilliantly\nexecuted, this remains an\nimportant piece of art.\nInterview with the makers of Now is the Time to Say\nNothing\nWould you mind\nbriefly summarising\nyour stories?\nCaroline Williams: This\nis the story of Syrian artist\nReem Karssli\u2019s life during\nthe Syrian conflict. It follows\nthe story of what happens\nwhen a group of teenagers\nfrom London tries to contact\nher. It is about how we can\nstay connected to the people\nwe love when war and the\nneed for survival gets in the\nway.\nWhat would you like\npeople to take away\nfrom the art?\nCW: That real people exist\nat the centre of these huge\nconflicts and that those people matter.\nWhy did you choose\nto make the experience individual?\nCW: It begins as an individual experience so that it\ncan then become a communal one. The piece is about\nconnecting so it makes sense\nthat it would go from an isolated individual experience\nto a group experience.\nDo you think this\nmedium (of film) is\nthe main way people\nconsume news media\nnow? Did you consider using other mediums in conjunction\nwith film?\nCW: Obviously social media\nis a big part of how news is\nconsumed now. We did consider it but you can\u2019t make\nwork about everything!\nWould you be able to\npoint to an inspiration for your work?\nCW: Adam Curtis and of\ncourse the main inspiration\nis Reem Karssli\u2019s Every Day\nEvery Day.\nIn your article [Car-oline WIlliam\u2019s Run\nRiot piece] you mention the protests in\nEgypt as being a spur\nto begin this project.\nDo you think that the\nevents in the Middle\nEast receive enough\ncoverage?\nCW: It depends where you\nlook. Obviously different\nnews outlets have different\nfocus. I think we all know\nthat conflicts can fall in and\nout of the news based on a\nnarrative and politically motivated appetite for what\u2019s\nhappening.\nDo you think that\nthe events receive\nenough of the right\ncoverage? What do\nyou feel are the main\ndifferences between\nthe narrative you are\ntelling and the narrative you see in the\nmainstream media?\nCW: Ours is a personal\nnarrative. Not only are the\nstorytelling tools we are using different (sound, light,\ntouch) from mainstream media but the content doesn\u2019t\nhave to fit a news room spec.\nWe are focusing on the stuff\nof the everyday - the tedium\nand real slow creeping grief\nof war.\nDo you think that it is\npossible for a Western audience to truly\nempathise with the\nsituation in Syria?\nCW: No. But I think they\ncan stay open and put themselves in a space to try and\nempathise.\nHow did you choose\nthe young people\nthat took part in this\nproject?\nCW: I auditioned them and\nchose the ones who didn\u2019t\nlook bored when I spoke\nabout politics.\nWhy did you choose\nyoung people and\nnot a broad spectrum of ages?\nCW: Young people have\nan amazing way of asking\nthe difficult questions that\nadults are afraid to ask.\nWhat impact would\nyou say you have had\non the young people\nthat are part of the\nproject?\nCW: I hope it\u2019s shown them\nthey can make art and that\npeople will want to engage\nwith it.

Instead, Rice\nchanges the point of view,\nadding depth to our perception of the characters\u2019\ncomplex inner lives.\nIn Offenbach\u2019s version,\nOrpheus hates his wife\nand constantly says so,\nembarking on a rescue\nmission just because\nPublic Opinion (yes, that\u2019s\na character) compels him\nto. Apparently that was\nfunny at the time\u2026 Rice\nadds a backstory during\nthe orchestral overture\nand shifts the narrative\nto that of a couple broken\nby tragedy in a path to\nforgiveness and reunion,\nrestoring Orpheus (played\nby Ed Lyon) to his traditional role of a romantic\nhero. Public Opinion (por-trayed by Lucia Lucas) is\nstill there, helping him\nand driving/flying an\nactual black London cab.\nOther significant changes\nare that Eurydice (played\nby Mary Bevan) is now a\nvictim of the abuse of the\ngods who take advantage\nof her trauma, instead of\na mere prop being tossed\naround; and Jupiter (por-trayed by Willard White)\nis a powerful bastard\nwho always gets away\nwith sexual assault and is\ndespised by every other\ngod. Bevan deserves a\nshout out for her first-rate\nsinging and clear, bright\nvoice. It really makes\nus sympathise with the\ncharacter, all the way\nfrom the discussions with\nher husband to the frenzy\ndance of the final act.\nThe show has a\nlukewarm start, with a\nlengthy spoken introduction that delays the\nstart of the music, but\nrapidly warms up with a\nridiculously funny chorus\nof sheep and bees. Pluto\n(played by Alex Otterburn), a very good flirt\nwith a terrible evil laugh,\nseduces a despair-driven\nEurydice and tricks\nOrpheus into killing her.\nThe scene then changes\nto Mount Olympus, a\nluxurious white-tilled\nvacation complex, and\nfrom then on it\u2019s strong,\nquality fun until the end.\nWe see the gods accusing\nJupiter of being an incorrigible sexual predator,\ncondemning his actions\nbecause \u2018love is only\nlovely when the loved\none agrees\u2019. The topic of\nabuse recurs, with the god\nof gods turning into a fly\nto seduce Eurydice in a hilarious scene whose great\nprotagonist is someone\nwaving a stick with a giant\n\u201cfly\u201d at the tip. Then she\nis assaulted by John Styx\n(portrayed by Alan Oke),\nBacchus and Pluto again.\nIt is definitely not fun to\nbe Eurydice in this story.\nOriginally in French,\nthe libretto was freely\ntranslated to English\nfor this production. The\nbest thing about it is that\nit allows itself enough\ncreative freedom to bring\nhumour that suits the\nmodern taste, without\ndrifting from the main\ntopics. It is also incredibly\nwitty, and many a time\ndid the audience laugh out\nloud. It isn\u2019t every day that\nyou hear someone singing\n\u2018Shit, he\u2019s coming\u2019 in an\nextremely operatic voice.\nThe dance numbers are\nalso incredibly energetic,\nand at times touching\nupon the ridiculous,\nin a parody to excess.\nColourful sets and a very\nactive chorus add extra\nlayers of action to the\nstage. A particularly good\nexample is the final of act\ntwo: the clouds are made\nof giant balloons, people\nwear balloon tutus and the\nlights alternate between\nall primary colours. All in\nan exuberant celebration\nof the decision that the\ngods \u2018are going to follow\ngod [Jupiter] to hell.\u2019 It\ncan only be a good idea\nbecause, as they put it, the\nsecret to a good life is to\n\u2018chose a good leader and\nfollow them everywhere\u2019.\nThe climactic scene of\nthe final, that Offenbach\ncalled \u201cgalop infernal\u201d\nbut is known as the music\nfor the cabaret dance\n\u201ccan-can\u201d, hits just the\nright amount of tragedy\nand sordid appeal. Set in a\nhorrendous peep show in\nthe underworld, there is a\nstark contrast between the\nglamour of the costumes\nand Eurydice\u2019s terrible\nwords, all observed at a\ndistance by keen males\nwith binoculars. Fated to\nremain in the Underworld\nserving Bacchus, her only\nalternative is to \u2018embrace\nthe frenzy and the pain\nuntil the mad becomes the\nsane\u2019.\nWith catchy tunes,\nstunning sets and great\nperformances, Orpheus in\nthe Underworld promises\nto become a great night\nout - funny, appealing and\ndeeply rooted in today\u2019s\nworld.\nOrpheus in the Underworld is a hilarious account of bored gods abusing the mortal world\nMount Olympus in all its splendour - but the gods are not happy with Jupiter // Clive Barda\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The young,\nin general, are far more\npro-XR than the old who\nare probably still trying to\nwork out whether having\npetrol drenched seagulls\nfor breakfast is a bad idea\nyet.\nXR, frustrated with the\nlack of response to the impending Climate Change\ninduced disaster from\ncentral government have\nturned to the Vietnam era\nmethod of inspiring political change \u2013 civil disobe-dience. Methods such as\nmass protest, gluing themselves to public transport\nand in general being a\nnuisance are specialties\nnow widely associated\nwith the sandal wearing,\nlettuce loving environmental enthusiasts. The\noverall effectiveness of\nthis method for achieving\ntheir objectives remains to\nbe seen.\nXR in the UK have tree\nmain demands:\nGovernment must tell\nthe truth by declaring a\nclimate and ecological\nemergency, working with\nother institutions to communicate the urgency for\nchange.\nGovernment must act\nnow to halt biodiversity\nloss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to\nnet-zero by 2025.\nGovernment must\ncreate, and be led by the\ndecisions of, a citizens\u2019\nassembly on climate and\necological justice.\nThe first two demands\nappear reasonable.\nDeclaring a climate\nemergency would be in\nline with the policies of\nother governments such\nas Canada and probably\nmatches the level of\ngut-wrenching fear we\nshould be experiencing\nwhen considering the\nprospect of the potential\nfor chaos as a result\nof a Climate Change\ninduced alterations to the\nhabitability of the entire\ncoastline. Unless you\u2019re\nfrom Norfolk, or perhaps\nWindsor, you\u2019re unlikely\nto be equipped with gills,\nor the webbed feet to\nthrive in 2050 Blackpool.\nThe government acting\nnow would be a very\nsensible thing. Reducing\nemissions to net-zero by\n2025 would likely be very\nchallenging, but perhaps\nwe could manage it.\nIt is the final demand\nthat I truly take issue\nwith. The formation of\na citizens\u2019 assembly to\noversee the decisions of\nthe UK parliament is truly\nmoronic. I understand that\nthey are mostly composed\nof anarchists and left\nleaning libertarians that\ntrust central government\nas much as a Kulak in\nthe 1930s, but honestly.\nTheir proposal is to take\n100 random members of\nsociety and assign them a\nleading role in combatting\nclimate change. To quote\na television programme,\n\u201cthe problem with the\npublic, is that they\u2019re\nfucking horrible.\u201d If you\nthought it was easy for\ncorporations to manipulate politicians to their\nends, you\u2019d be surprised\nhow little it takes to get\na standard human being\nto go from respectable to\ndespicable.

Upon\narrival, having been blown\naway by the beautiful\nscenery the year before,\nthey headed straight to\nLac Vert, through tricky\npaths and cold streams. As\nthe cheerful dozen reached\nthe lake, the bravest went\nin for a swim in the crys-tal-clear water. Up early\nthe next day to make the\nmost of their time there,\nthe party embarked on\ntheir long climb up to\nMer de Glace, tackling a\nhefty 1400m of elevation\namidst the intimidating\npeaks and under a glorious\nsunshine. Spirits were as\nhigh as these mountains.\nFor their third day, more\nlake-packed action was in\nstore as the crew headed\nNorth and climbed upto\nLac d\u2019Emosson, getting\nmore mileage in and going\nhere.\nAlthough not the VK\nmost consume on their\naverage Wednesday\nevening, this was a tiring\neffort all of them savoured\nas they reached the top\nas well as during the\nfollowing run down the\nmountain, which unsur-prisingly felt much faster,\nburning all that potential\nenergy. As a rest day was\nnever an option, ex-Trail\ncaptain and newly-elected\npresident Henry Hart\nand trail-lover Heinrich\nHummel took on the\nMatterhorn expedition,\nleaving in the cold hours\nof 4am. Despite not quite\nreaching the summit, the\nduo still saw a beautiful\nsunrise and put in a valiant\neffort on this very tactical\nmountain path.\nOn their final day, the\nbrave squad lined up at\nthe start of the Zermatt\nMarathon; with nearly\n2000m elevation distributed over the course of the\nmarathon, the group took\npart in this beautiful race\neither on their own or as\na duo, marking the perfect\nend to a week of exemplary trail running and\ncountless calories burnt\nclimbing up and down\nthe peaks of Chamonix.\nA sensational trip all\nI see a peng lake and I pose // ICXCAC\nLac Vert with the crew // ICXCAC\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n48\nthrough Switzerland.\nThe following day,\nalways eager to do more,\nthe company went on to\nclimb the 1800m separating them from Mont Buet\non another very strong\neffort. This brave bunch\nthen decided to climb a\nvertical kilometre from\nChamonix: those unfamiliar with the concept\nsimply need to imagine\na near-straight path with\na kilometer of elevation\ngain on as short a distance\nas possible, roughly 4km\nwill remember and look\nforward to repeating next\nsummer!\nW ith summer progress-ing, preparations for the\nnext tour came to life in\nthe early hours of September, as Imperial\u2019s brightest\nand fittest converged to\nHeathrow\u2019s Wetherspoons\nready to board their\nplane for Munich, before\nmeeting up with the rest\nof the gang and heading\nto Austria for a week\nof running, swimming,\nsun-bathing and self-care.\nUpon their arrival\nand witnessing the end\nof the Zell-Am-See\nHalf-Ironman race, the\nclub was welcome by\ntorrential rain, but this\ndidn\u2019t dampen their spirits\nas they converged towards\nthe local pub to experience\ntraditional Austrian deli-cacies. Although the rain\nhad stopped overnight,\nthe skies weren\u2019t quite\nclear yet as the group\nleft the villa for their first\nrun. A 10km loop around\nthe lake for most and the\nsteep climb up Hundstein\nfor the trail enthusiasts.\nThis was followed by a\nmore laid-back afternoon,\nwith the optional core\ntraining session. While\nsome favoured the plank\nsets, others were getting\nfamiliar with the local\nbrews; when in Austria\u2026\nThe next day saw part\nof team run around the\nlake while the rest, led\nby Tour organiser Filip,\nclimbed up to the Mooserboden reservoir, walking\npast the impressive\nKesselfall gorge. Upon\nreaching the lake at lunch-time, the hikers rewarded\nthemselves with some\nmore traditional Austrian\nmeals and a well-deserved\nnap by the lake.\nThe following two days\nsaw the club members take\npart in much more than\njust running: with tennis\nperformances worthy of\nWimbledon, sunbathing\nand swimming in the local\nlake of Zell-Am-See and\nfinally spending a day at\nthe spa, the mid-week saw\nslightly less running for\nsome, but the water slides\nand numerous games\nprovided their legs with\na happy break before the\nrest of tour.\nThe next day saw\ndifferent groups head\ntowards different moun-tains, with the most\nenthusiastic tackling the\nKitzsteinhorn. While the\nglacier presented a severe\nobstacle, the hike or jog\nleading to it, nearing the\n2000m elevation in the\nmist and the cold was\nappreciated by all.\nAs the week drew to its\nend, the club decided to hit\nthe local club for a night\nof memorable (for some)\ndancing and partying. The\nnext day saw most recover\nfrom the night out and go\non unsurprisingly shorter\nruns than the rest of the\nweek, at the exception of\nthe night-time treasure\nhunt that concluded the\ntrip, where some competitors gave it everything\nand sprinted most of it and\nothers opted for a more\nlaid-back approach and\nsimply enjoyed the walk\naround the nearby hills\nand paths.\nThe next morning,\nthe islanders said their\ngoodbyes to the Villa and\nwent home to London,\nending their trip with a\npint at Hammerspoons.\nIf you want to get\ninvolved with the club and\ngo on such tours, contact\nthe club at run@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cThe bravest\nwent in for a\nswim in the\ncrystal-clear\nwater\u201d\n\u201cWhile some\nfavoured the\nthe plank\nsets, others\nwere getting\nfamiliar with\nlocal brews\u201d\nCross-country and athetics club surrmount the Alpine peaks as well as take on the Munich Half-Ironman!\n\n"

The\njourney has been a right\nlaugh and I only have 3\ngames left. Fallout 4 and\nFallout 76 are going to be\nvery enjoyable I am sure;\nI am deep into the lore\nnow and nothing is going\nto stop me putting 100\nhours into another PostNuclear RPG, not even\ncoursework. However,\nthere is one game which\ncontinues to be the bane\nof my existence.\nFallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel. Even\ntyping this now gives\nme shivers as I think of\nthe un-inspired, \u2018Help\nus find a Vault\u2019 story and\nmonotonous turn-based\ncombat system. The\nworst part about it is that\nI enjoy the game when it\ngets going, but it rarely\ndoes that. I am walking\naround the isometric map\nwith my squad of 6 in\nreal-time and suddenly\ncombat starts \u2013 initialising\na turn-based system until\ncombat is over \u2013 but there\nare no enemies to be seen.\nWhen I finally find the\nthing shooting at me, I\nhave already wasted so\nmuch time that I wonder\nwhy they were even there\nin the first place. There\nare 23 levels in this game\nsupposedly, I am on level\n6 and I\u2019m already tired of\nplaying. If you are looking\nto play the Fallout series\nat any point, I would\nrecommend just sticking\nto the main series games\n(and New Vegas). Unless\nyou\u2019re a die-hard fan of\nFinal Fantasy Tactics\n(the heavy inspiration\nfor Fallout Tactics) then\nit would be advisable to\nsteer clear.\nIs it weak to give up\nso quickly? Should I\npower on and complete\nit whilst neglecting the\nfar superior, Game of the\nYear nominated Fallout 4?\nI have not decided yet but\none thing is for sure, it is\non hold for now.\nI love gaming, and\nhopefully next week I will\nhave some good news to\nspread on my progress.\nWith Trine 4 coming out I\nsee myself sinking far too\nmany hours in that to care\nabout Fallout, but I guess\nwe just have to wait and\nsee.

    "content": "PUZZLES\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\n6\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Education), Ashley Brookes, to talk about his first weeks on\nthe job, including NSS and PRES survey responses, improvements to postgraduate research, and training for reps\nAshley Brookes, the DPE // ICU\nFelix: So what have\nyou been doing in\nthe first couple of\nmonths?\nAB: The first thing I\nlooked at was the NSS and\nthe Union\u2019s recommendations to the College,\nwhich we had to get ready\nfor the first Learning and\nTeaching Committee\nand Faculty Education\nCommittees of the year.\nI\u2019ve also been looking at\nthe PRES (Postgraduate\nResearch Experience\nSurvey) and will be\nfinalising results on that\nin the next few weeks\nbefore taking it to PRQC,\nthe Postgraduate Research\nQuality Committee.\nThe LTC is a higher-level\ncommittee focused on\nbroad college teaching\nstrategies, such as the\ncurriculum review. The\nFECs consist of senior\nstaff from faculties along\nwith faculty-level student\nreps. The PRQC is one\nof the most senior committees at the College on\npostgraduate research\nmatters.\nAB: The Union recommendations to the College\nafter the NSS are focused\non broader, college-wide\ntrends we can identify as\nneeding improvement.\nGood examples are things\nsuch as looking at what\none department may be\ndoing really well \u2013 such as\ngetting exam and lecture\ntimetables to students very\nearly, which is a general\npolicy at the college and\nmakes a big difference\nto students\u2019 revision and\nproject planning \u2013 and\nthen recommending that\nother departments follow\nsuit.\nActual operational\nchanges are broadly\ndecided at the departmental or faculty level \u2013 after\nthe recommendations are\nreviewed by the Provost\nBoard and LTC, they\nmove on to NSS Working\nGroups who look at how\nto apply those broad\nprinciples within their departments on the specific\nlevel. I haven\u2019t had one of\nthose yet, but I\u2019m hoping\nthat at that stage we\u2019ll start\ngetting into details, like\n\u201cyour recommendation 13\nprobably is not possible\nand here is why.\u201d\nFelix: Are all these\ncommittees \u2013 the\nlevel of bureaucracy and the split of\ndecision-making by\nseniority \u2013 helpful in\nterms of actioning\nchange, or does it get\nin the way?\nAB: At this point it\u2019s\nhard to say, having only\nattended one LTC. That\u2019s\nwhy I want to get to the\nWorking Groups to see\nwhat changes do get made\n\u2013 or whether things do\nget shuffled around from\ncommittee to committee.\nFelix: Do operational\ndecisions need to\nbe made at a higher\nlevel \u2013 for example,\ndoes the LTC need\nto actively enforce\nadhering to policies\nlike getting exam\ntimetables to students in reasonable\ntimeframes?\nAB: Maybe there is something to be said for them\nprodding departments\nwho fail to adhere to\npolicy a bit more \u2013 but\nreally, the conversations\nshould happen at faculty\nor departmental level. The\ndesire and concern for enhancing and improving the\nstudent experience is very\nmuch there at the level of\nFECs, where they\u2019ve developed a nuanced way of\nlooking at NSS scores and\nunderstanding the results.\nFelix: Coming back to\nthe PRES and PRQC\n\u2013 you\u2019re interrupting\na PhD to take up the\nDPE role. Compared\nto previous DPEs,\nwho are usually\nundergrads, are you\nexcited to get more\ninvolved in postgrad\nmatters which have\nbeen neglected in\nthe past?\nAB: Absolutely. I was\nthe Vice President\n(Representation) at the\nGraduate Students\u2019 Union\nlast year, so I\u2019ve been to\nPRQC a couple of times\nbefore, and it\u2019s something\nI want to focus on this\nyear. I especially want\nto liaise with the GSU in\norder to have a collective\nvoice with which to implement change. There\u2019s\na big problem with quality\nassurance on postgraduate\nresearch placements,\nwhich is emerging in the\nPRES results \u2013 just a lot\nof variance in students\u2019\nexperiences, all highly dependent on their relationship with their supervisor,\nwhich defines so much of\nyour life as a postgrad.\nFelix: Do you want to\nreform the way postgraduate research\nplacements are run,\nso that there is less of\na dependence on one\nperson and more of\na broader system in\nplace, like there is at\nundergraduate level\nwith Senior Tutors\nand DUGs and so on?\nAB: Yes! The dependence\non one individual is the\nproblem \u2013 in engineering\nwe might call it a \u2018single\npoint of failure\u2019! There\nneed to be other people\nand mechanisms in place\nto be able to cope with\nthat and build a more resilient system \u2013 one where\na student\u2019s experience\nisn\u2019t solely defined on the\n\u2018luck of the draw\u2019 with\ntheir supervisor. A bad\nrelationship there can ruin\nyour entire PhD, unlike\nat undergraduate level\nwhere one bad course may\nonly affect you for a few\nweeks.\nFelix: How do the\npostgraduate reps\nplay into this?\nAB: Things get complicated when you talk about\npostgraduate research\nreps. Unlike at undergrad,\nthere\u2019s no \u2018clean\u2019 way of\ndivvying up by department \u2013 you have different\ndoctoral training groups,\nsections within depart-ments, MRes students\ngoing on to PhDs, and\nso on. Alongside the fact\nthat PhDs don\u2019t follow the\nundergraduate academic\nyear \u2013 and thus don\u2019t\nfollow the timescales\nthe elections and roles\nare based on \u2013 often we\nstruggle to get postgrad\nreps. In a number of de-partments, they even end\nup being locally elected\nin processes organised by\nCollege! I really want to\nbring the postgrad reps in\nthis year, so the Union has\nbetter input and oversight\nof that process \u2013 we\u2019re\neven running separate\ntraining sessions for\npostgrad reps this year.\nFelix: Regarding rep\ntraining: some student volunteers have\nalready been in roles\nfor four months \u2013 a\nthird of their tenure \u2013\nwith no training, and\nplanning information\nhas not been sent out\nother than a confirmation of the date of\ntraining on October\n23rd. Why?\nAB: I wasn\u2019t involved in\nthe process of planning\nthis year\u2019s rep training\n\u2013 that was organised last\nyear\u2013andsoIcan\u2019tstrictly\nsay. Regarding planning\ninformation, I think that\nhigh staff turnover at the\nUnion might have delayed\nthings while people get\nto grips with their new\nroles. Another problem is\nthat we haven\u2019t finalised\nall the elements of the\ntraining sessions yet.\nI\u2019m hoping that a communication will go out\nthis week about at least\na rough timetable. We\u2019re\nvery lucky as a Union that\nsome of those untrained\nvolunteers \u2013 particularly\nCU reps \u2013 have been able\nto get on with things,\neither as a result of a good\nhandover from predecessors or them having been\nvery proactive. But it\u2019s a\nshame to have missed the\nopportunity to give them\nmore support earlier on.\nI think it\u2019s unacceptable,\nand training should have\nhappened earlier. If I\u2019m\ninvolved in that discussion for next year, I will\nsupport and encourage the\ntraining for these roles to\nhappen a lot earlier, in the\nJuly period.\n\n"

One\nquestion remained: \u201cwhat\nthe hell do I write about?\u201d\nWith nothing much approaching except a stream\nof consciousness, I guess\nI had better just give my\nreview of Welcome from\nthe perspective of a senior\nStudent Volunteer, and in\nthe meantime not-so-sub-tly comment on the utter\nstate of my life.\nA great deal of preparation went into Welcome\nWeek (at least from the\nCGCU\u2019s side - a lot of\nour committee having\ngiven up summer to\nplan). I\u2019ll start at the very\nbeginning \u2013 which is\nusually a very good place\nto start. Monday saw me\nad-libbing to some 1400\nfreshers - a uniquely terrifying experience where I\ntried my best not to swear\n(again) in front of the\nProvost, Ian Walmsley.\nHaving succeeded and\nnot committing social\nsuicide (I think, though\nI probably still said too\nmuch), the next big thing\non our plates was the farce\nthat was the Welcome\nFair. I\u2019d really like to\nsee ICU\u2019s event plan and\nrisk assessments for this.\nI could bitch for hours\nabout the ICU\u2019s utter mismanagement of Welcome\nFair - but this isn\u2019t the\nplace - and it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time before they\nsilence me further.\nThe rest of the \ufb01rst\nweek went by fairly inci-dent-free, to my knowl-edge. On the whole it has\nbeen fairly peaceful, with\npleasantly few emails to\nsend to the Union, or to\nhave sent to me\u2026 I guess\nthat life can be pretty\ngood when the Union tell\ntheir volunteers to stop\nemailing them!\nFor those of you who\nremember the eight Engineering Welcome Talks\nwe delivered, we hope\nthey weren\u2019t as dull as the\nmaterial that followed.\nFor those who skipped, I\ncongratulate you for using\nyour freedom wisely - just\nremember to cook, stay\nhydrated and sleep eight\nhours a night.\nIn other Guilds-related\nnews, we\u2019re copying the\nRCSU and hosting a pub\ncrawl next week - not that\nwe\u2019re overly endorsing\ndrinking to excess. We\nalso had our mascots\nstolen on the Monday\nof the second week by\nthe RCSU, only to steal\nthe RSM\u2019s Davy lamp\non Tuesday whilst their\nPresident was in Union\nCouncil. I\u2019m also personally saddened by the new\ngreen \u2018Lloyds\u2019 advertisements in FiveSixEight - is\nthere nothing the Union\nwon\u2019t sponsor these days?\nOverall though, as I\nsaid, a great \ufb01rst couple\nof lies that is Imperial;\nthe non-virgin chemical\nengineer, who has to\nchoose between\nethical divestment and\nactually having a job; the\ncommittee member overworked and overstressed\nbut happy with positive\nresults.\nA moment of silence\nfor those poor newbies\nthough \u2013 I\u2019ve already\nseen the plethora of IC\nExposed posts about\nsharking and lanyards.\nMy advice (which is not\nthe of\ufb01cial advice of the\nUnion) is this: have a\ngood life. Go out. Have\nfun. Be young. But be re-sponsible. The thing that\namazes me the most about\nthe incoming year is that\nfew of you drink, and in\ntypical Imperial fashion\n\ufb01nd social situations dif\ufb01cult. Bless. Take the time\nto come out of your shells,\nand remember you\u2019re here\nto grow into well rounded\ncitizens of the world.\nFor returning students,\nI hope you\u2019re not falling\nback on Panopto yet (in\nerror I have committed to\nthis for 90% of the \ufb01rst\nweek\u2019s lectures - hopefully I\u2019ll have actually gone\nto some in the second).\nAnd don\u2019t worry - as one\nof my profs said \u201cthe\ngood news is you\u2019ve got\nthrough years 1 and 2 and\nonly have 3 and 4 left\u201d.\nI guess the counterpoint\nwas \u201cthe bad news is\nyou\u2019ve got through years\n1 and 2 and still have 3\nand 4 left\u201d.\nHaving wrapped up\nmy thoughts and anything\nof value (of which there\nwas little) for this week,\nI look forward to getting\nsome genuinely relevant\nand constructive content\nin the coming weeks.\nFreshers\u2019 fortnight has\nbeen a big learning curve,\nand I\u2019ve learned a lot\nto take forward into the\nfuture if I get the chance.\nAs an endnote: enjoy\nyour weekends. I feel\nlost when they occur.\nTake a break, and as my\n\ufb02atmate\u2019s phone spits\nout at him every so often:\n\u201cremember to breathe\u201d.\n\u201cI could bitch\nfor hours\nabout the\nICU\u2019s utter\nmismanagement of\nthe entire\nWelcome Fair\n- but it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time\nbefore they\nsilence me\nfurther\u201d\nB\ny the time you\nget to read this,\nit will be the end\nofyourFreshers\u2019\nFortnight.

Most people\nhave a contradictory attitude towards it which probably stems\nfrom ill-definition. Bureaucracy is, approximately, \"a body\nof officials (bureaucrats) who, according to some set of rules\nor 'norms', carry out their tasks of communicating, usually\nin a non-critical and non-decisive way, often involving paper-work, between various parts of a bureaucracy.\"\nMost of us have come face to face with bureaucracy, be\nit the obstinate, mindless, delaying, slow, unfeeling motions\nof officialdom as practised by many local governments, or the\ncrazy convulsions of a delirious, mad, soft-sell(?) ad machine\nlike the Reader's Digest. Such experiences must make us\nwonder how the mind of a 'perfect' bureacrat works, so let us\nexamine some pictures.\nWires or Dustbins?\nBureaucrats (Bs) have, or are indoctrinated to have, a\ncertain way of thinking. They see the world as built up by a\nlarge number of independent entities\u2014a series of isolated\ncardboard boxes\u2014not overlapping, perhaps enclosing each\nother but nevertheless separate. Each box is some organisation or thing or problem, e.g. a government department, a\nperson, 'the starving millions', etc. Some boxes may be joined\nup by a communication wire which is operated by a faithful\nbureaucrat who conveys messages. Whether or not the\nbureaucrat sees any boxes joined up really depends on\nwhether or not he sees any 'channels' of communication\nbetween them. Ratiocinative (often scientific) people tend\nto categorize things so that categories\u2014i.e. boxes depends\non words and is thus language dependent. So we see the\nbureaucratization of a person is language dependent.\nUsing a similar picture idea we see that unbureaucrats\n(UBs) tend to think, from the point of view of B\ns, in a\nconfused way. Everything is a kind of big mess (dustbin\nmind'?!) of blobs and lumps which are all joined on to each\nother. The name of a lump describes some approximate\nregion which is fused onto another region (each region being\nsomething to do with an organisation or thing, etc.) Everything is part of some big thing\u2014everything.\nIt would be a good idea to say that Bs and UBs are not\nabsolute pictures but merely ends of a scale\u2014rather like tidiness and order (see FELIX, Spring 1968) are very different\nends of a scale.\nHaving drawn pictures of B\ns and UBs, let us see what\ntendencies they might be prone to. A poet (?) once said:\n\" . . . . Language limits thought, destroys totality,\nWord-thoughts fragment concepts . . . .\".\nWe can see from the above discussion that the B\ns word-description and categorization of the world does indeed cause\nthe totality of the world to become broken\u2014a name makes\na box which is separate from other boxes, concepts which also\ninvolve a certain wholeness become similarly fragmented.\nThis poses a question, not to be discussed here.\nLanguage fragments concepts, but can concepts exist without language?\nSince B\ns think of everything as being basically unconnected it may be easy for a B to hold contradictory views\nwhen failing to see the interconnectedness of things\u2014which\nbrings us to 'double-think'. Orwell defines: \"Double-think\nmeans the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's\nmind simultaneously and accepting both of them.\" We are\nsaying that B\ns are prone to Double-think\u2014and of course\nDouble-think was in fact upheld and continued by virtue of\na rigidly bureaucratic state\u2014which made people think of\nworlds of cardboard boxes.\nWe might expect that UBs are less prone to Double-think\nthan B\ns because their thoughts (according to the picture) are\nmore part of a whole even if they do not have so many\nthoughts as Bs.\nPB or NBs?\nIf we agree that B\ns are prone to Double-think does it\nmean that all Bs are bad? The word 'Bureaucrat' has been\nlimiting our thoughts! There are all sorts of bureaucrats,\ne.g. Positive bureaucrats (PBs) and negative ones (NBs).\nNBs are those whose activities deliberately prevent things\nhappening or cover up for incompetence or suppress knowledge and information, e.g. passport officials, censors, 'front\nclerks' who have a string of ready answers\u2014'Being looked\ninto', 'under consideration', against the regulations', not feas-ible, etc. etc....\nPBs are those Bs who make use of bureaucratic systems in\na creative and constructive way and are fundamentally different in outlook from NBs. As examples of PBs we have\ngroups of activists, ad-hoc committees, organisers (usually).\nClubs in IC are obviously operated by, essentially, PBs\u2014they\nare trying to make things happen, have meetings, etc. PBs of\ncourse are liable to resort to the methods of NBs to hide their\nmistakes, appear in 'full control' and stop things happening.\nQuite often PBs think a bit more like UBs than NBs.\nAre you a PB, UB or NB? Does IC teach people to be\nany one type?\nD\nO\nU\nB\nL\nE P\nU\nN\nI\nS\nH\nM\nE\nN\nT\nFollowing Brian Hains' article on College Discipline, Spike Bantin writes on how he feels justice\nshould be administered by State and University.\nI would like to point out that Brian Hains' article in\nFELIX last term arose out of discussion held by Council,\nafter receiving several documents from JURGO concerning\ndiscipline in Universities. On considering them, it was found\nthat the only points over which there was likely to be disagreement were double punishment, the internal College\ndisciplinary procedure and the ill-defined crime of bringing\nthe name of the College into disrepute.\nI should like to take this opportunity to elaborate on these\npoints as they could be vitally important to any one of us\nat sometime in the future.\nDouble punishment is defined in this case as the exercising of justice through two bodies for the same offence, and\nas such often occurs throughout society. However, this does\nnot infer that this is either necessary or satisfactory. To\nanalyse further, we might refer to the texts on English law,\nfrom which one may conclude that the State is bound to\nintervene when a crime is committed relating to the upholding of public order. In this case, therefore, any action taken\nby the College would amount to double punishment. Any\nsuch crime is considered by the state because, as well as any\ninjured party, it finds it abhorrent, the trial resulting in\ncriminal rather than civil justice. If convicted, the purpose\nof punishment is fourfold and relates to demonstrating to\nthe community that law is being maintained.\ncondone it. It is my opinion that no further action should\nbe taken since it can only result in further suffering, probably much greater than that caused by the original sentence.\nThe classic argument against this may be generalised by\nproposing that a crime may be more significant to one\nbranch of society than another. It is obvious, but not often\nconsidered, that criminal misdemeanours are always more\noffensive to that part of society in which they occur, and\nthis is exactly the reason that the legal system was instituted.\nIf this were not so then the punishment of any crime would\nrelate to the power of the injured party rather than the\nsignificance of the crime. Moreover, statistics have shown\nthat only some twenty per cent of first offenders were ever\nreconvicted. It may be argued further that this twenty per\ncent are generated by the hostile attitude of society when\nfinding employment for these people after their first imprison-ment. Thus in repunishing an individual a second time we\nare ignoring statistics and succumbing to the old attitudes\nand prejudices. I would contend that if a student is tried for\na crime by the State it should be impertinent and inhumane\nfor the College to subject him to further punishment.\nHowever, in the case where an offence is a crime against\nthe College or Union By-Laws the College has a right and\nduty to uphold these By-Laws for the benefit of all. Since\nthe By-Laws already exist, it remains only to have a system\navailable to deal fairly with any offences. At the moment\nthere is no real system, hence Council attempted to rational-would act as prosecution providing such information and\nwitnesses that are required. This would be coupled to a\nhigher appeal system.\nThe importance of holding disciplinary proceedings in the\nopen cannot be overstressed since it acts as a deterrent, as\nprotection for the individual and against rumour. This is\nthe failing of the present system since investigations are held\nin camera and verdicts are propogated by hearsay.\nHall Discipline\nHall discipline procedures are better defined, but I have\nfound them through my own personal experience to be\nunconvincing in operation. Therefore for continuity and improvement I would propose that the general disciplinary\ncommittee be used for serious Hall matters as well. With a\nsystem such as this in existence there could be no doubt that\njustice was being done. Moreover, such a committee would\nbe able to record its verdicts and therefore future crimes\ncould be assessed with a good idea of past actions. The\nsetting up of this committee would be a great step forward\nand must be instigated forthwith.\nFinally to the third point, the more nebulous concept of\nbringing the name of the College into disrepute. To me\nthis seems impossible to define, but, one presumes, arises from\nPUZZLES\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\n26\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nTHROWBACK felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis year is Felix\u2019s 70th anniversary, so we\u2019re celebrating with a look back at some of the best moments from our\nlong history.

Along with\nfellow engineer Leo, the\npair have been producing\nmusic together since the\nend of last year. Beginning\nthis July under the title\nGioLeo (genius name)\nthey have been releasing\nmusic to the public. The\nduo now has five songs\nout on Spotify. Gio was\nsurprised when I asked\nhim about their song on\nSoundcloud. Turns out\nthey didn\u2019t post it, but they\nmust be doing something\nright if someone\u2019s stealing\ntheir music.\nIn true Imperial spirit\nthey\u2019ve decided to make\ninternationalism one of\ntheir key ideals and artistic\nmotives. As we\u2019re talking\nabout why students\nshould go check them out,\nGio leans into the microphone to directly address\nIC students - \u201c\u2026that\u2019s\none of the most beautiful\nthings of imperial is how\ninternational it is. We\nbelieve that the hip-hop\nworld has alienated a lot\nof your beautiful languages and cultures, GioLeo\nis a reaction against that\noppression and we\u2019re\nrefocusing music onto a\nwider range of cultures\u201d.\nGioLeo\u2019s international\nreach isn\u2019t just an idea,\nit\u2019s already being put\ninto practice. Raised in\nShanghai, Leo is fluent\nin Mandarin and Gio has\nbeen learning, now incorporating it into his verses.\nThe track \u201cLive Life\u201d\nfeatures a friend of theirs\n- Monica Curtin -singing\nin Spanish, and their most\nrecent release features\na Guinean rapper who\u2019s\nvocals are in Sousou. As\nfor the future, the pair\nare in contact with an\nAngolan rapper, Chinese\nrapper, Burmese singer\nand American rapper\nRyan Oakes.\nDespite all these international collaborations,\nthey seem pretty set on\nworking within Western\ntrap/hip-hop/pop style.\n\u201cMany of my friends not\nfrom the west aren\u2019t fans\nof trap music from their\nown countries\u201d Gio says,\n\u201cthey enjoy the production\nand style of Western trap,\nso we want to provide\nthat but with a bridge for\nthe culture\u201d. The boys\ntake their production\ninfluences from Justin\nStone, Shawn Mendez,\nMajor Lazer and Drake.\nHowever, their desire to\nexpand genres is leaving\nthem open to further influence from artists across\nthe world.\nFrom last December\nLeo has been working\nhard to learn the ropes\nof production with help\nfrom fellow Imperialites.\nTheir hunger to grow is\nstill strong and they\u2019re\nwelcoming any other\nstudents to come be a part\nof the process. It\u2019s not just\nmusic either, a possible\nICTVxGioLeo collab\nmusic video for their\ndebut single GAMMA is\nin the works. At the end\nof our conversation Gio\nonce again reaches out\nto the IC students saying,\n\u201canyone who has had a\ndream of singing, making\nmusic or rapping, please\nreach out to Gio and Leo\n[@xgioleox], because\nwhat we really love is\ncollaborating and making\nmusic with other people\u201d.\nDanny Brown Lets Us Down\nD\nanny Brown\nhas become\nsomething of\na legend of the\nunderground hip-hop circuit this decade, with the\nability to rhyme almost an-ything, an imppecable wit\nand a penchant for insane\nbeats. On epic albums\nlike XXX and Atrocity\nExhibition Brown\nexplores his lifestyle\nas a drug dealer-turned\ndrug fiend, painting the\nsynapse-searing highs\nand depressing lows of\nthe lifestyle in agonising\ndetail. It is these, often\nexperimental records he is\nbest known for.\nRelatively fresh off the\nhigh of 2016\u2019s Atrocity\nExhibition, the news\nthat Danny Brown was\nworking with a \u201clegendary\u201d producer, built hope\nthat he would be able to\ndeliver another stellar\nblend of lyricism and\noff-kilter instrumentals.\nEl-P of Run the Jewels\ntweeted in January that\nhe had heard Brown\u2019s\nnew record and that it was\n\u201can instant classic\u201d, news\nfollowed in April that\nQ-tip, hip-hop veteran,\nMC and producer was\nthe legend Brown spoke\nof, it seemed certain that\nuknowwhatimsayin?\nwould be an impactful\nrecord, sadly, Danny\nBrown\u2019s latest offering\ncomes to less than the sum\nof its parts.\nThe record opens with\n\u2018Change Up\u2019, a shuffling,\nlow-key beat that sees\nDanny delivering decent,\nbut ultimately uninteresting verses on how he\n\u201cnever looks back\u201d and\nhas to \u201ckeep going\u201d, the\ntrack lacks any musical or\nlyrical elements to draw\na listener back. \u2018Theme\nSong\u2019 packs another weak\npunch, with old-school\nsamples lumbering behind\nwhat appears to be a diss\ntrack for \u201cbitch-ass\u201d\nrappers, there is no doubt\nthat Brown knows how to\nthrow an insult but nothing\nhere compares to tracks\nlike \u2018Monopoly\u2019 where he\ndecries foes for \u201crocking\ncrocs at Walmart\u201d.\nWhile Singles \u2018Dirty\nLaundry\u2019 and \u20183 tears\u2019\nhave interesting beats\ncourtesy of Q-Tip and\nJPEGMAFIA respec-tively, Brown once again\nfails to bring his A-game.\nOn \u2018Dirty Laundry\u2019 the\ninfluences from comedians (particularly Richard\nPryor) Brown spoke of in\nthe lead up to the album\u2019s\nrelease are visible, with\na lackadaisical delivery\nfull of pauses, serving\nwordplay filled anecdotes\nabout sex, drugs and\nlaundry.\nTracks \u2018Belly of the\nBeast\u2019, \u2018Best Life\u2019 and\n\u2018uknowhatimsayin?\u2019\nall bring watery and\nsomewhat aimless instrumentals behind half-heart-ed bars, but toward the\nend of the album\u2019s 30\nminutes a few tracks\ndo stand out. \u2018Savage\nNomad\u2019 a direct groove\nthat could have come\nstraight from underground\nproducer Alchemist\u2019s\nvault sees Brown on respectable form with bars\nand one-liners about his\npast life as a drug dealer.\nFeatures from Blood\nOrange and JPEGMAFIA\nare both standouts, with\nstrong hooks that help\npull their respective tracks\ntogether.\nFinally, closer Q-tip\nproduced \u2018Combat\u2019 brings\na driving beat, adorned\nwith bumbling jazz-trum-pet and Brown\u2019s strongest\nverses on the record, the\nline \u201cI\u2019ll die for this shit\nlike Elvis\u201d alone makes\nthe track a worthwhile\nlisten.\nWhile unknowha-timsayin? delivers\ninstrumentals and verses\nthat are more interesting\nthan the average hip-hop\nrecord it is far from El-P\u2019s\npromised \u201cinstant classic\u201d\nand is certainly a weaker\npoint in Brown\u2019s discog-raphy.\nMUSIC\nRappers in the streets, MechEng in the sheets // @xgioleox\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Danny Brown.\nLabel: Warp.

Since House\nseats are up for re-election\nevery two years, having\nthe Democratic Party\nsupport impeachment\ncould hurt the re-election\nchances of these moder-ates.\nThe second is that\nimpeachment is a political\ndecision \u2013 in other words,\nit must pass a vote in the\nHouse and in the Senate\nto be upheld. The Senate\nis currently controlled\nby Republicans, none of\nwhom show any desire at\nall to allow impeachment\nonto the Senate floor for\nvoting. Furthermore,\nopening an impeachment\ninquiry could backfire for\nthe investigating party\nif it is unpopular with\nthe general public. Bill\nClinton\u2019s impeachment\nfollowed such a path \u2013\nimpeachment was pushed\nforward by Congressional\nRepublicans but not\nsupported by the public,\nresulting in backlash\nagainst the Republicans\nfor seeming overly critical\nand a surge in public popularity and sympathy for\nClinton.\nOn September 23rd, 7\nof these moderate Democrats \u2013 whose seats Pelosi\nhave been trying to protect\n\u2013 published an op-ed\nin the Washinton Post\ndelineating their decision\nto support impeachment.\nThese members all have\nbackgrounds in national\nsecurity, and to that effect\nthey have found what\nPresident Trump did un-acceptable.\n\u201cThe United States\nhas been very good to\nUkraine... I wouldn\u2019t\nsay that it\u2019s reciprocal\u201d,\nTrump said to the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky during\na July 25th phone call.\nUkraine receives military\naid from the United States\nto protect themselves\nagainst Russian-backed\nseparatist forces in the\neast of the country. 391\nmillion dollars of this aid\nhad been approved by\nCongress weeks earlier,\nbut unbeknownst to officials had been halted from\nbeing delivered by the\nTrump administration.\nIn the call, President\nZelensky acknowledges\nthe financial support\ngiven by the United\nStates. Trump then says,\n\u201cI would like you to do\nus a favour\u201d. Trump asks\nfor two things: (1) to have\nthe Ukrainian Attorney\nGeneral open an investigation into the origins of\nthe Mueller Investigation,\nwhich he believes stems\nfrom information that\nthe Ukrainians and Democrats colluded to give\nto the FBI; and (2) for\nUkraine to cooperate with\nRudy Giuliani (Trump\u2019s\npersonal attorney) and\nAttorney General of the\nUnited States William\nBarr in the investigation\nof whether Joe Biden had\npreviously abused his\npower as Vice President\nto have a prosecutor\nimproperly fired. The\nprosecutor was investigating a Ukrainian oligarch\nwho owned the largest\nprivate energy company\nin Ukraine, the board of\nwhich, Joe Biden\u2019s son,\nHunter Biden, had sat on\nfor five years. Neither\nof these assertions by\nTrump have any evidence\nbacking them.\nThe whistle blower\u2019s\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump // Wikimedia Commons\n\u201cThe United\nStates has\nbeen very\ngood to\nUkraine...\nI wouldn\u2019t\nsay that it\u2019s\nreciprocal\u201d\ncomplaint, filed onAugust\n12th by a member of the\nNational Security Council\nstaff, describes a violation\nof Trump\u2019s constitutional\nduties as a President. According to the allegations,\nTrump is holding back aid\nthat Congress has already\nappropriated for Ukraine\nas leverage, to pressure\nZelensky into cooperating\nin an investigation against\na political rival. If proven,\nTrump used the power of\nhis office to solicit interference from a foreign\ncountry in the 2020 US\nelection, which is against\nfederal elections law. Not\nto mention that by withholding the 391 million\ndollars of aid appropriated\nfor Ukraine, Trump has\nundermined Congress by\nutilising it for personal\ngain.\nThe complaint also\nalleges abuse of the\nnational security process\nwith regards to how\ntranscripts of the phone\ncall were handled. Upon\nrealizing how politically\ndamaging the call may be\nif released, White House\nlawyers directed senior\nWhite House officials\nto restrict access to all\nrecords of the phone call,\nespecially the word for\nword transcript that is\ncustomary for all phone\ncalls between the President and foreign leaders.\nInstead of the standard\ncomputer systems used to\nstore these transcripts, the\nrecords of the call were\nuploaded onto a special\nserver with restricted\naccess, used for handling\nclassified and sensitive\nmaterial for national\nsecurity. As the call did\nnot contain any remotely\nsensitive information that\nshould warrant its restricted access, it has been\ndescribed as a misuse of\nthe system and an abuse\nof classification privileges\nby the White House. The\nwhistle blower alleges\nthat this has been done\nwith multiple calls in the\npast.\nWhat, then, should we\nexpect from the proceeding impeachment inquiry?\nLikely a battle over executive privilege, a legal fight\nover Congress\u2019 subpoena\npower over the Executive\nbranch, and much more\npublic and media scrutiny.\n\n"

To put some\nof this stark reality into\ncontext, XR points to the\nfact that atmospheric CO2\nconcentration is higher\nthanithasbeenin3million\nyears, the ocean has not\nexperienced present day\nincreases of acidification\nfor at least 300 million\nyears, and extinction\nrates are 1000 times\nwhat they are usually.\nThe present \u2018business as\nusual\u2019 scenario, without\ndramatic reductions in\ngreenhouse gas emis-sions, could realistically\nlead to a global temperature increase beyond 4\ndegrees by 2100, with\ncatastrophic impact. XR\nnotes some of the direct\nenvironmental effects\nincluding biodiversity\nloss, sea level rise, deser-tification, wildfires, water\nshortages, crop failures,\nand extreme weather. This\nhas shocking impacts on\nsociety: the displacement\nof millions of people;\nthe potential spread of\ndisease; and increased\nrisk of wars and conflict,\njust to name a few.\nKey to their strategy is\nnon-violent direct action\n(NVDA). Motivated by\nthe success of past civil\nrights movements lead\nby the likes of Martin\nLuther King Jr. and\nMahatma Gandhi, XR is\n\u201cKey to their\nstrategy is\nnon-violent\ndirect action,\nmotivated by\npast civil rights\nmovements\u201d\ncommitted to disruptive,\nbut peaceful, actions\nwhich force governments\nto act. Partial success has\nalready been achieved via\nmass protests across two\nweeks in April earlier this\nyear. Key central London\nsites were blocked including Piccadilly Circus,\nOxford Circus, Marble\nArch, Waterloo Bridge,\nand Parliament Square.\nShortly following the\nprotests, then-Prime\nMinister Theresa May\ncommitted the UK to a\nlegally binding target of\nreaching carbon neutrality\nby 2050, with other major\nEuropean countries following suit. In addition,\nthe UK Parliament\nsuccessfully declared a\nclimate emergency. XR\nhas implemented further\naction to ensure tangible\naction is taken to make\nthis declaration legitimate.\nThe present two-week\nrebellion taking place\nacross the globe has\nalready gathered widespread media attention\nand forced the environmental emergency into the\npolitical debate (despite\nthe domination of Brexit!)\nIn particular, London has\nseen Westminster virtually\nshut down, with over 500\nprotesters being arrested\nin just two days of action.\nImperial College XR\nUniversities have\ntraditionally played a\nkey role in pushing for\nsocial progress; the April\nprotests included support\nfrom the youth faction of\nXR, although a specific\nUK-wide university\ngroup had not formed.\nStudents were able to\njoin their local or regional\nXR group, although their\nterm-time efforts were\nnot being effectively\nutilised. The summer\nbreak allowed for many\nstudents to engage more\ndirectly with XR strategy,\nsubsequently leading to\nthe formation of many\nuniversity groups in early\nAugust with a callout for\nmore to join the fold.\nGathering support for\nthe group at Imperial was\ninitially a slow process,\nalthough it was aided by\nthe structures put into\nplace by the newly formed\nXR Universities group.\nMore recently, Imperial\u2019s\ngroup has dramatically\ngrown in size \u2013 in part\ndue to increased media\ncoverage, but also because\n(perhaps more in the spirit\nof XR\u2019s grassroots style)\nmembers are volunteering\nto \u2018spread the word\u2019 and\norganise events to encourage others to join.\nKey successes of the\ngroup so far have included\nengagement on the 20th\nSeptember Climate\nStrike and a collaborative\nworkshop with LeoSoc\nto design banners and\nplacards for the October\nrebellion.\nOn the 9th of October\nXR Imperial formally\nengaged with the London\nactions, arriving at 10am\nin St James\u2019s Park for a\nfull day of protest. Those\nwho joined found the\nevents to be overwhelmingly positive; there were\ncelebrations with music\nand dancing as well as\nentertainment acts to\nmake light of what would\notherwise be a sombre\nsituation. A key moment\nwas Imperial\u2019s role in\nthe `die-in\u2019 at Trafalgar\nSquare \u2013 this involved\nplaying dead in order to\nconvey the severity of\nthe oncoming environmental crises and remind\nmembers of the public of\nthe urgent action that is\nrequired.\nTributes were paid\nthroughout the day to environmental activists who\nhad been killed across\nthe world, and spirits\nremained high despite the\nlarge number of arrests\nand confiscation of equip-ment. Joining with the\nrebellion strengthened the\nresolve of members of XR\nImperial and brought to\nthe forefront the necessity\nfor immediate and widespread measures to tackle\nboth climate change and\nthe ecological emergency.\nWhile the two-week\nprotest will eventually\ncome to an end, XR\nImperial intend to\ncontinue working closely\nwith other environmental\ngroups around the College\nto push for more transparency and greater efforts\nto combat the environmental crises. Successes\nso far (which have been\na long time coming)\nhave included the levy\non plastic cups and the\ncommitment to renewable\nsources for all bought-in\nelectricity on campus.\nCollege to stop investing\nin fossil fuel companies\n- a step already taken by\nmany leading UK universities - but Imperial\u2019s\nleadership maintain that\ndoing so would undermine any environmental\ncause.

Firstly,\nthey play an informational role where capital flows\nto companies with the best\nprospects. The stock price\nMoney and Capital Markets\nis a financial instrument\nthat holds some form of\nmonetary value.\nLastly, financial\nmarkets allow for optimal\nallocation of risk. The\nwide variety of securities\nin the market allows\ninvestors to select securities based on their risk\nappetite and this benefits\ncompanies who could\nthen issue securities at the\nbest possible prices.\nHowever, financial\nmarkets cannot function\nwithout the support of\nfinancial intermediaries\nand investors.\nFinancial intermediaries are key to an efficient\nmarket system. They\nidentify potential lenders\nto match borrowers and\nassist in the transfer of\nthese funds from surplus\nunits to deficit units. Intermediaries also reduce\nthe investment friction\ncost between lenders and\nborrowers which provides\na more efficient allocation\nof wealth throughout\nthe system, leading to\ngreater efficiency for the\neconomy.\nFrom the investor\u2019s\nstandpoint, there are 2\nmain types of financial\nmarkets, Money Markets\n(short-term maturities)\nand Capital Markets\nity to governments, banks\nand other large organi-sations. For an example,\na large corporation with\nsurplus cash would prefer\nto invest a portion of it in\nthe money market as it\nearns higher interest than\nkeeping it in its retained\nearnings. Similarly, an\nindividual investor would\nnot invest all of their\nmoney in risky assets.\nAfter allocating part of\nour funds into the optimal\nrisky portfolio, we would\nprefer to allocate the rest\nin low risk instruments\nfound in the money\nmarket to insure against\ninvestment risk (the risk\nof incurring losses).\nCapital Markets\nThe capital market\nconsists of long-term\ndebt instruments, equities\n(stocks) and other financial securities which\nare issued by firms on\nthe primary market and\ntraded by investors on the\nsecondary\nmarket. Capital market\ninstruments are characterised by longer maturities,\nhigher risk and higher rate\nof returns.\nThe long-term debt\ninstruments have maturities that range between\n1 year to 30 years. Some\nexamples of these instruments are corporate\nbonds, treasury bonds,\ninflation-protected securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. These instruments generally carry\nhigher default risk (risk\nof being unable to repay\nlenders) than those found\nin the money market.\nHowever, they also\nprovide higher interest\npayments to compensate\ninvestors for this additional risk.\nDebt securities are first\nissued on the primary\nmarket where it is\nopen to large-scale and\ninstitutional investors.\nIt is difficult for retail\ninvestors to gain access\nto the primary market;\nhence they purchase these\nsecurities in the secondary\nmarket instead.\nThe secondary market\nis where these instruments\nare traded and circulated.\nIn this market, it is difficult\nto purchase these bonds\nat face value. Investors\nhave to purchase them at\na premium or discount\ndepending on prevailing\nmarket forces.\nStocks represents the\ncompany that you buy\nshares in. Buying shares\nwhich refers to buying\nshares in 100 companies.\nShares released on\nthe primary market are\nknown as an Initial Public\nOffering (IPO). Investors will purchase these\nequities directly from the\nissuing company at face\nvalue. These equities are\nsold to large-scale and\ninstitutional investors and\nare generally inaccessible\nto retail investors. Instead,\nindividual investors go\nthrough the secondary\nmarket to trade equities.\nKey takeaways\n\u2022 Markets allow for\nefficient allocation of\nfunds from lenders\nto borrowers.\n\u2022 Financial markets\nare supported by\nfinancial intermediaries & investors\n\u2022 The 2 main types of\nmarkets are Money\nMarkets (Short-term\nmaturities) and\nCapital Markets\n(Long-term maturi-ties).\n(long-term maturities).\nWhen a security matures,\nthe firm must repay the\nfull principal amount plus\ninterest to the lender.\nMoney Markets\nMoney market constitutes of short-term debt\nsecurities with average\nmaturities of one year or\nless. The money market\nis characterised by high\nliquidity (i.e. easy to sell),\nlow risk and relatively\nlow rate of returns. Some\nexamples of securities\nthat are traded are treasury\nbills, commercial paper,\nfederal funds and money\nmarket mutual funds.\nThe function of the\nmoney market is to\nprovide short-term liquid-Flow of funds within the financial markets // Eugene Gwan\n\u201cA financial\nmarket is\nwhere a\ntransfer of\ncapital from\nthe people\nwho supply it,\nto the people\nwho demand\nit\u201d\nof a company reflects\nthe market\u2019s outlook for\nthe company and hence\nstock prices rises and falls\naccordingly.\nSecondly, financial\nmarkets allow investors to\ncontrol their consumption\ntiming. Throughout a\nlifetime on an individual\nor firm, they might experience high and low earning\nperiods. In order to \u201cshift\u201d\npurchasing power from\nhigh to low earnings\nperiod, they might use\nsecurities to store wealth\nand transfer consumption\nto the future so that in\nlow-earnings periods,\nthey can sell these assets\nfor liquidity.

Since\nthen the problem has\nbecome recognised\ninternationally. It is\nestimated that around\n700,000 people every\nyear die from drug-re-sistant infections, and\nprojections suggest that\nby 2050, this could rise\nto a disturbing 10 million\ndeaths annually. Causes of\noverprescribing include\nexpectations and demand\nby patients, expensive\ntesting leading to unclear\ndiagnoses, and excessive\nduration of treatment.\nArecent report by NICE\nindicated that between\n\u201cProjections\nsuggest that\ndeaths due to\ndrug-resistant\ninfections\ncould rise to\n10 million\nannually by\n2050\u201d\ncrobial resistance is still a\nmajor healthcare problem\nin the UK. It is estimated\nthat somewhere between\n9% and 23% of antibiotic\nprescriptions are inappropriately prescribed in\nEnglish primary care. A\nrecent study published\nin the BMJ compared\nantibiotic prescriptions\nin England with national\nguidelines and found that\na substantial proportion\nof antibiotic courses\nexceeded the recommended duration of treatment.\nNICE has a few recommendations in place to\nhelp combat this problem.\nOne is its promotion of\nantibiotic stewardship\nteams, which recommend\nthat all healthcare settings\nin the UK have a team of\ncore people, including an\nantimicrobial pharmacist\nand a microbiologist,\nwho can be consulted\nto provide guidance on\nbest practice of antibiotic\nprescribing. NICE also\nhas guidance on changing\nrisk-related behaviours\nin the population, which\nfocuses largely on education of the public on\nthe dangers of overuse of\nantibiotics, and the dissemination of advice and\nresources on how to avoid\nthe spread of infections.\nFurthermore, NICE is\nworking with new funding\nmodels which aim to\ndelink payment from the\nvolume of antimicrobials\nprescribed, providing a\nmuch-needed economic\nincentive for the development of new antimicrobial\nmedicines.\nThe national implementation of strategies\nto prevent antimicrobial\nmisuse is a small step\ntoward tackling this global\nproblem. The widespread\nuse of antimicrobials both\nin medicine and the vet-erinary/agriculture industries is leading to a high\nselective pressure which\ncreates dangerous strains\nof resistant microbes,\nat a rate that cannot be\nmatched by research and\ndevelopment into new\nantimicrobial medicines.\nAntimicrobial resistance remains a health problem in the UK // pxhere\nISSUE 1729\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\n2013 and 2017, although\nantibiotic prescribing\nwas reduced by 4.5%,\nthe number of infections\nresistant to key antibiotics\ncontinued to rise by 35%,\nhighlighting that antimi-Felix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

    "content": "ISSUE 1729\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Farewell\nThis exceptionally charming film serves as both a conduit with which to showcase Awkwafina\u2019s expanding talent,\nas well as a moving portrayal of a disconnected family uniting under tragic circumstances; Lulu Wang\u2019s second\nfeature proves she\u2019s a director to watch out for.\nY\nou\u2019d be forgiven for not\nhaving heard\nthe name Lulu\nWang before Sundance\n2019, but after making a\nbig splash this year with\nThe Farewell, her name\nshould be at the top of\ndirectors we can be sure\nto expect more of in the\nfuture.\nBased on Wang\u2019s\nown experience, The\nFarewell follows Billi\n(Awkwafina), an aspiring\nAmerican-Chinese writer\nwho returns to China after\nbeing informed her family\nhave received a terminal\ndiagnosis for her grandmother (Zhao Shuzhen),\nyet are collectively withholding this information\nfrom her. Under the guise\nof a fabricated wedding\nbetween Billi\u2019s cousin\nand his fianc\u00e9, the whole\nfamily unites in Changchun to spend some final\ntime with Nai-Nai as a\nfamily.\nDepending on who you\nask, family gatherings\ncan either be a hellish or\na joyous occasion, yet for\nthis expertly written story\nWang has managed to\nweave in both scenarios,\ncreating a beautifully\nbittersweet film in the\nprocess.\nAt the helm of this\nensemble is Awkwafina,\nwho\u2019s character Billi,\nseems to be caught in\na cultural tug-of-war\nbetween Eastern vs\nWestern culture. Raised in\nAmerica, the dissonance\nin her \u2018western views\u2019\ncompared to her Eastern\nheritage provides an\nemotional minefield for\nher to walk through, as\nshe struggles to connect\nher childhood memories\nto the everchanging\nlandscape around her.\nThe family all see her as\n\u201cFamily\ngatherings\ncan either\nbe a hellish\nor joyous\noccasion \u201d\n\u201cThe\ndissonance in\nher\u2018western\nviews\u2019with\nher Eastern\nheritage\ncreates a\nminefield\u201d\nthe successful product of\nAmerican life, yet early\nin the film we see she\u2019s\nstruggling financially and\nis unsuccessful in her\nwriting career (which she\nchooses to keep hidden).\nThis burden of expectation and hidden self is a\ncommon theme throughout all the main characters\nin the film. Each character\nis hiding a huge piece of\ninformation from the matriarch of the family and\nthis leads each character\nto play a fictitious version\nof themselves. This is\nheavily visualised through\nthe brilliant cinematography of Anna Franquesa\nSolano, who expertly\nframes each scene to\ngive a very intimate and\naccessible feel to the\npicture. The isolated\nshots of characters as\na juxtaposition against\nmany of the wider-angle\nshots involving the whole\nensemble emphasise the\ndisconnected family, who\ncan at times feel like a\ngroup of strangers. The\ncolours used in the film,\nfrom wedding photos to\nthe streets of Changchun,\nall seem to be so fitting of\nthe moment used. Neither\nextravagant nor forced,\nthey give a feeling that\nis very intimate, making\nit more immersive and\ndown to earth; this is not\na film that tries too hard to\nbe attractive yet in doing\nso becomes very visually\npleasing.\nHowever, I don\u2019t want\nyou going away thinking\nthis is exclusively a heart\nwrenching film; due to\nthe brilliantly written\nscript and the absurd impromptu wedding that\u2019s\nbeing thrown, there is\nan overarching comedic\ntheme. There\u2019s this one\nbit of information that we\nall know, this little secret\nthat the audience is in on,\nyet Nai-Nai is unaware.\nThe whole crazy scenario\nmakes for some brilliant\nmoments, with Zhao\nShuzhen delivering some\nreal zingers throughout.\nThe fact that it also plays\nas a comedy is testament\nto the brilliant writing\nand direction of Wang, to\nhave a comedy under the\npretence that someone is\ndying, whilst also making\nit heartfelt and real is no\neasy task, yet it is done so\neffortlessly here.\nFinally, it would be an\ninjustice not to mention\nthe brilliant job done by\nAwkwafina. Before The\nFarewell we\u2019ve seen her\nin Oceans 8 and Crazy\nRich Asians, where she\u2019s\nbeen known mainly\nfor her comedic chops,\nand not to mention her\nrapping. However, here\nwe see a totally different\nside to her in Billi, where\nshe expertly tugs and pulls\nat our emotions bringing\nso many elements to the\ncharacter. Billi is at a\nslump in her life, she\u2019s\nfinished college, but she\u2019s\nnot started her \u2018proper\u2019\nlife yet; this is embodied\nquite literally through\nAwkwafina in a rounded\nshoulders posture adopted\nby her throughout a lot of\nthe film. In the opening\nshot we see Billi speaking\nin and out of different\npersonas is where Awkwafina excels in drawing\nthe audience in and\nmaking her so accessible;\nwe can see her keeping\nthe \u2018act\u2019 for her Nai-Nai,\nbut then slipping out of it\nwhen alone or speaking\nEnglish. Because we\u2019re\nable to see the \u2018real\u2019 Billi\nit makes her so much more\nrelatable and believable\nas a character. Hopefully\nthis can be a launch-pad\nfor Awkwafina to begin\ntaking on more serious\ndramatic roles as we\u2019ve\nseen she clearly has a\ntalent for it.\nTo bring it back to the\npicture as a whole, by\ncombining intricate and\ndelicate writing with an\noutstanding ensemble\ncast, Wang has created a\nbeautiful film that stands\nto bring a stark perspective on American vs\nChinese culture.\nA tight-knit performance by the ensemble cast // A24 Films\nFILM\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nDir: Lulu Wang.

    "content": "Binge of the Week: Killing Eve (Seasons 1 and 2)\nA thrilling mouse-and-cat tale told with unbelievable charm and wit\n\u201c What draws\nthe attention\nof many\nbesides the\nenthralling\npremise\nand sapphic\nchemistry is\nthe meticulous\nset design\u201d\nB\nBC America\u2019s\nspring spy\nthriller Killing\nEve takes a\nunique twist on a traditionally masculine genre,\nfeaturing a rather atypical\ntale of mutual obsession\nbetween a British intelligence investigator, Eve\nPolastri (Sandra Oh) and\na sociopathic assassin\nnamed Villanelle (Jodie\nComer). Critically acclaimed for its production\nas well as the acting, the\nshow has been nominated\nand received awards including Primetime Emmy,\nGolden Globe, Screen\nActors Guild Award, just\nto name a few.\nOriginally based on\nLuke Jennings\u2019s Villanelle\nnovels and produced by\nwriter Phoebe WallerBridge known for her\nperformance and writing\nin the play-turned-series\nFleabag, Killing Eve was\nmeant to be extraordinary\nfrom the very beginning.\nEffortlessly blending\nthrilling action sequences\nwith dark humour, WallerBridge manages to bring\nout the absurd and the\ncomical even in life-and-death situations, which\nsets a terrifying yet witty\ntone for the show through\nthe psychopathic yet well-loved protagonists.\nAs a character-driven\npiece, the plot of Killing\nEve moves rather slowly.\nHowever, it still features\ntypical elements of\nsuspense that keep the\naudience hooked, like an\nunderground organisation\noperating with spies\nrooted deep in the govern-ment, untold conspiracies,\nand plot twists. But what\nsets it apart is its unique\ncharacters breaking traditional molds. Villanelle\nis ostentatious and outlandish - not the kind of\nkiller who hides behind\nthe shades or shoots from\na distance. Her kills are\nmessy and almost always\nunexpectedly theatrical.\nEve Polastri relies not on\nher intelligence or logic\nto hunt down Villanelle;\ninstead, she is gifted and\ninstinctive and spontane-ous. What it lacks in its\nslow-paced plot Killing\nEve certainly makes it\nup with the dynamics\nbetween the characters.\nThe superb acting undoubtedly brings the show\nto life. Oh, well known\nfor her previously starring\nin Grey\u2019s Anatomy as Dr.\nCristina Yang, takes on\nthe role of Eve Polastri.\nAt the start of the show,\neverything in Eve\u2019s life is\ngoing fine. Her husband\nis fine; her job is fine; her\nfriends are fine. There is a\nlittle more out there that\nshe yearns for beyond her\nboring MI5 office job.\nThe sudden appearance of\nVillanelle acts as a switch\nthat flips her world upside\ndown, pushing her to her\nlimits as she drifts further\naway from everything\nshe ever has as the story\nprogresses. Through her\nsuperb acting, Sandra\nOh manages to have the\naudience rooting for Eve.\nThe way Oh delivers her\nrole evokes emotions and\nmakes everything implausible so believable.\nThe role of Villanelle\nis a complex one. The\nteam even consulted a\npsychologist specialised\nin female psychopaths in\norder to build as much\nof a three-dimensional\ncharacter as possible. Her\ndifficult upbringing eventually results in her psychopathic tendencies, yet\nshe shines through with\nher confidence and charm\nand childlike personality.\nThere is a balance between\nher humor and innocence\nand indifference towards\ndeath, and Jodie Comer\ncaptures that perfectly\nlike a child who happens\nto love to kill. \u201cHow do\nyou make people care\nabout psychopaths is a\nquestion that kept coming\nup early on,\u201d said show\nproducer Waller-Bridge,\n\u201cAnd the answer is, cast\nJodie Comer.\u201d\nWhat draws the attention of many besides the\nenthralling premise and\nsapphic chemistry is the\nmeticulous set design.\nEvery scene was shot in\nthe actual place where it\u2019s\nset, from kills in Tuscany\nto a prison in Moscow\nto Gare du Nord station\nin Paris. This extent of\ncommitment definitely\npays off as each location\nhas its irreplaceable depth\nand flavour. The creative\ncrew steered away from\niconic landmarks and\ninstead searched for the\nhidden corners of each\ncity, casually juxtaposing\na ruthless assassin in\neveryday streets -- we\ncould all just be right next\nto a psychopath. Despite\nthe diverse filming loca-tions, the series maintains\na coherent palette with its\ndistinctive cinematogra-phy.\nThe set design is yet\nanother detail worth\napplauding given how\nit creates the starkly\ncontrasting atmospheres\nbetween the two main\ncharacters. Villanelle\u2019s\ngorgeous flat in Paris\nfeels like the home of\nany twenty-year-old\nParisian woman, chic and\naesthetically pleasing,\nintertwined with murderous spins -- guns in a\nbeautiful chest of drawers,\npoison mixed in perfume,\na jeweled hairpin where\nthe razor-sharp edge\nserves as a weapon. On\none end of the spectrum\nis Villanelle\u2019s cold-blood-edly charming lone wolf\u2019s\nden, and on the other end\nis Eve\u2019s comforting and\ncozy home, with warm\nlights with yellowish tints,\nleftover Shepherd\u2019s pie\nKilling Eve // IMDb\nTELEVISION\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTelevision Editor\nCreator: Phoebe WallerBridge Starring: Sandra\nOh, Jodie Comer, Fiona\nShaw, Kim Bodnia\nSEASON 1\nSEASON 2\n\u201cVillanelle is\nostentatious\nand outlandish - not the\nkind who hides\nbehind the\nshades\u201d\n\u201cCasually\njuxtaposing\na ruthless\nassassin in\neveryday\nstreets\u201d\nin the fridge and undone\nlaundry in the hamper.\nServing a similar role\nis the costume design of\nKilling Eve. Breaking\naway from the stereotypical leather suits and cargo\npants, Villanelle\u2019s closet\nstars designer blazers and\nbubblegum pink dresses\nand runway gowns. Every\noutfit choice of Villanelle\n\u201cDesigner\nblazers and\nbubblegum\npink dresses\nand runway\ngowns\u201d\nis simply a statement\non wits own. She stands\nout to blend in, and her\nwardrobe crafts the perfect\nimage of a captivatingly\nchic chameleon. Or as\nSteff Yodka of Vogue puts\nit, \u201cKilling Eve is the most\nfashionable show on TV.\u201d\nThe first two seasons\nof Killing Eve have many\npieces of the puzzle in the\nright place -- the cast, the\ncrew, the production. The\nthird season is currently\nin production aiming for\na release in the spring\nof 2020. With Suzanne\nHeathcote taking over the\nwriting, I look forward to\nseeing how she resolves\nthe season finale\u2019s cliffhanger and hope to see\nmore action and plot development incorporated.\n\n"

The first\nof these comes from the\nmid-eighteenth century:\n\u2018Orfeo ed Euridice\u2019, by\nGluck. It is of particular\nimportance in the history\nof music as it marks the\nturn to a simpler aesthetic,\nfocused on expressively\nconveying the plot, that\nmediated the transition\nfrom baroque to classical\noperas.\nOrpheus, played by\nAlice Coote, mourns\nthe death of his wife\nEurydice, portrayed by\nSarah Tynan, and decides\nto retrieve her from the\nUnderworld. Coote\u2019s sore\nthroat in the opening night\ndidn\u2019t spoil her enraged\nlamentations, punctuated\nby a greek tragedy style\nchorus. In the Underworld, a psychedelic\nswirl of strobe lights and\ncolour, Orpheus charms\nthe gods with his music\nand is allowed to bring\nEurydice back, under the\ncondition that he shouldn\u2019t\nlook or talk to her before\nreturning to the realm of\nthe living. Tempted by\nhis wife\u2019s protests against\nhis silence, he breaks\nthis promise and loses\nEurydice for a second\ntime. This is an intense\nscene that brings out both\nsingers\u2019 acting abilities,\nespecially because they\nare completely alone on\nstage for a long time.\nThen Gluck\u2019s version\ndiffers from the traditional\ntragedy as Love, through\nthe voice of Soraya Mafi,\nrestores Eurydice\u2019s life as\na reward for the couple\u2019s\ntrue love and they reunite\nin a delicate dance.\nSpotless musical performance by the orchestra,\nconducted by Harry\nBicket, accompanies the\nwhole performance. It\nadvances the progression\nof the story but also\nprovides moments of rest\nand references to past and\nfuture events. Unfortunately, ENO\u2019s policy of\nsinging only in English,\nto enhance emotional connection with the audience,\nalthough admirable, fails\nto pay absolute justice to\nthe original Italian work.\nThe poetic translation\nrespects the metric of the\nmusic but the musicality\nof the original text is lost.\nIt is really disappointing\nfor an aficionado to hear\n\u201cWhat is life without\nyou near me\u201d instead of\n\u201cChe far\u00f2 senza Euridice\u201d\n(What will I do without\nEurydice). It doesn\u2019t mean\nquite the same!\nThe production is\ndirected by choreographer\nWayne McGregor, which\nresults in an organic\nfusion of music and\ndance. In fact, fourteen\ndancers join the three lead\nsingers on stage, adding\nmovement and shape to\nan otherwise clean set. A\nhighlight of the show is\nthe clever way in which\nlight and shadows are\nexploited in conjunction\nwith the dancers\u2019 bodies,\nprojecting entrancing\nliving pictures on the\nwalls. The dance numbers\nare well constructed,\nlively and of sublime\nbeauty, well articulated\nwith the composer\u2019s principles of simplicity and\nexpressivity.\nExpressivity really is\nat the core of this opera.\nSubtle elements direct the\naudience to new, nuanced\nreadings of the story, in\nline with modern interpretations of the myth.\nThe cyclic structure of\nthis production, present in\nthe costumes and sets, the\npalette of dance movements and a surprising\nfinal scene - hints at this\nbeing an allegory for the\nprocess of grieving. After\nall, is this journey just\nhappening in Orpheus\u2019\nmind? And would that\nmake it any less real?\nNara: Sacred Images from Early Japan\nT\nhe city of Nara in\nJapan is perhaps\nb e s t - k n o w n\ntoday for the\nlarge number of deer\nfound roaming in Nara\npark. However, make\nyour way through these\ncreatures once regarded\nas divine and you\u2019ll\nfind Todaiji temple, one\nof Japan\u2019s largest and\nmost historically significant Buddhist temples.\nOriginally constructed in\n752, it houses a collection\nof over 9,000 sacred art\nobjects, with many having\nsuch cultural value that\nthey are deemed national\ntreasures. It is these that\nare the subject of the new\nBritish Museum exhibition \u2018Nara: sacred images\nfrom early Japan\u2019.\nThis display brings together a collection of 15\nBuddhist and Shinto objects from various temples\nand shrines across Nara.\nAmong the items on view\nare five national treasures,\nnone of which have ever\nbeen in the UK. On show\nalongside the objects are\na collection of paintings\nfrom the British Museums\u2019 own collection.\nThe collection exhibited is small, but this works\nin its favour as there is\nnothing superfluous here.\nEach object is beautiful\nand in a remarkable condition given that some of\nthem are over 1000 years\nold. Highlights include\n\u2018Yumechigai Kannon\u2019,\na 1300-year-old bronze\nsculpture of a deity believed to be able to change\nbad dreams to good ones,\nand the wonderfully expressive \u2018Divine Kings\u2019,\ntwo wooden statues\nperched atop a pair of\nworried-looking demons.\nThis exhibition is split\nacross two rooms, annoyingly on opposite ends and\ndifferent floors of the mu-seum. Most of the display\ncan be found in the newly\nrenovated Japanese Galleries. The natural wood\nand white walls work\nwell, giving the impression of the temples where\nthe items normally reside.\nHowever, the pairing of\nsuch significant objects\nwith the paintings from\nthe museums own collection can at times mean\nthey distract from each\nother. The objects are the\nstars here, so perhaps it\nwould have been better to\ngive them a bit more room\nto breathe without the additions .\nAn emphasis has been\nplaced on this exhibition\nbeing a cultural exchange,\nwhich is understandable\ngiven the complicated history involved with some\nof the key items in the\nBritish Museum\u2019s collec-tion. In making your way\nto the Japanese galleries\nyou might pass the Easter\nIsland statue (maoi), Hoa\nHakananai\u2019a, which received emotional pleas for\nits return from the Easter\nIsland governor in 2018.\nWe are truly lucky to be\nable to see such an object\nin person, but the experience is tarnished knowing\nthe culture that created it\ndesperately wants it back,\nand that their requests\nhave been refused. This\nis absent from the Nara\ndisplay, where there is a\nreal sense of enthusiasm\nfrom those in Nara who\nhelped organise the ex-hibition. The governor\nof Nara Prefecture, Arai\nShogo, speaking of the\nart on loan, hoped this exhibition would \u2018convey\ntheir beauty and spiritual\nessence\u2019, which it certainly does.\nIf you have any interest in Japan, the beautiful\ncollection of objects at\nthis short-but-sweet exhibition is worth a visit.\nEurydice in action // Donald Cooper\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?

So, do read on as I\ngo through all the different things that made me\nfall deeply in love with\nthis show.\nKeeping it in the\nfamily\nCreated by the real-life\nfather-son duo Eugene\nLevy (American Pie,\nanyone?) and Dan Levy,\nthe show stars the two\nLevy\u2019s as the family\npatriarch, Johnny, and the\nflamboyant son, David.\nEugene Levy\u2019s daughter,\nDan\u2019s sister, Sarah Levy\nalso has a small part,\nportraying the role of\nthe aloof waitress at\nCaf\u00e9 Tropical, where the\nfamily frequently dine.\nThe family matriarch,\nMoira Rose, is portrayed\nby none other than the\nincomparable Catherine\nO\u2019Hara (Home Alone,\nA Nightmare Before\nChristmas), who might as\nwell be considered family\nto the Levy\u2019s, having\nfrequently worked with\nEugene throughout their\ndecades-spanning careers.\nOne can\u2019t help but think\nthat one of the reasons\nfor the impeccable family\ndynamics within the show\nmay just be that these\npeople are, in fact, family.\nThere are some cast\nmembers who are new to\nthe family, though. Annie\nMurphy, who delightfully\nportrays Alexis, the\nRoses\u2019 selfish, self-ab-sorbed daughter who\u2019s\nhad many an adventures\nback in her days of wealth\n(kidnapped by a Thai\ndrug lord? Check! Being\npicked up by the South\nKorean secret police?\nCheck!). Emily Hampshire portrays the receptionist at the hostel that\nthe Roses resort to living\nin perfectly and captures\nthe essence of being an\noutsider to the absurd\nworld of the Roses, much\nlike the audience. Chris\nElliott and Jennifer Robertson are also delightful\nin their roles as the Schitt\nhousehold, who traditionally hold the mayoral\nposition in the town. A\nlater addition to the show,\nNoah Reid portrays the\nlovable Patrick so perfectly that one can\u2019t help but\nfall more in love with him\nwith each passing episode.\nCatherine O\u2019Hara\nYes, she really deserves\nher own section. A\ncriminally underrated\nactress, O\u2019Hara perfectly\ncaptures the essence of\nMoira Rose, an ex-soap\nstar who is completely\noblivious to life as most\npeople live it. Adopting a\nvery non-descript, hilarious accent, O\u2019Hara often\ndominates the show with\nher pitch-perfect comedic\ntiming. One of my favourite moments of the show\nis when the Roses go to\na car dealership, and for\nsome inexplicable reason,\nMoira decides to speak in\na (brilliant, magnificent)\nCockney accent to get\na better deal on a car.\nO\u2019Hara has just been\nnominated for an Emmy\naward for the role, so if\nyou don\u2019t believe me,\nbelieve the awards com-mittee. She is a complete\nrevelation.\nWhere Everyone Fits\nIn\nThe show is careful not\nto identify the country\nwhere the imaginary\ntown of Schitt\u2019s Creek is\nlocated.

The Council is\nthe highest democratic\ndecision-making body\nin the Union, at which\nthe full-time Officer\nTrustees (OTs) and key\nstudent volunteers put\npolicies into place, address ongoing issues by\nsubmitting and discussing papers, and receive\nupdates from the OTs on\ntheir activities to hold\nthem accountable.\nStanding Orders\nThe first action of the\nyear was to ratify a yearly\nrevision of the Standing\nOrders (SOs) of the\nCouncil, which outline\nthe rules and procedures\nthat govern its running\nand that of its subcommittees (SCs). Although\nFor example, the SOs\ncan now be amended like\nany other policy, rather\nthan needing a special\nprocedure - cutting down\non bureaucracy when it\ncomes to changing the\nfundamental operation\nof the Council and SCs.\nSimilarly, the Council can\nnow challenge the Chair\u2019s\ninterpretation of the SOs\ndirectly instead of having\nto appeal via the Union\nPresident. Additionally,\nthe Chair now has the\nleeway to interpret when\na \u201cconsensus\u201d has been\nreached on a decision and\nbypass a vote in that case.\nAnd finally, where a policy\non CU President time\ncommitments to the CWB\nhaving more members\nin general and thus less\nroom for additional\nrepresentation. Suggestions to reduce the ERB\nrepresentation to only one\nCU member was met with\nstrong statements about\nthe eradication of CUs\u2019\nability to represent their\nstudents. Although the\nCouncil decided to ratify\nthe SOs as they are, the\nissue will be revisited in\nthe future.\nAlso notable is the\nsplitting of the Clubs, Societies, and Projects Board\n(CSPB) into the Sports\nHub and the Societies and\nProjects Board, which\nwas voted on last year\nbut is being implemented\nnow. Further clarification\non this will be delivered\nby the DPCS at the next\nCouncil.\nBoard of Trustees\nAlso ratified were the\nchosen students for the appointed Trustee positions\non the Unions\u2019 Board of\nTrustees, Jinpo Xiang and\nMilia Hasbani, and a proposal to add an additional\nexternal Trustee \u2013 as there\nwere reportedly issues\nwith external Trustee\nattendance to Board meetings last year.\nReports from Officers\nFinally, there were\nreports from the Council\nChair and the OTs. These\nare visible online. Points\ndiscussed surrounding the\nreports included queries\nabout the lack of information on academic and\nwellbeing representative\ntraining (expanded upon\nin this week\u2019s A Conversation With section by\nthe DPE), the lateness of\nannual room bookings,\nthe status of the Union\u2019s\ntakeover of food service\nin h-bar, the postgraduate and undergraduate\nSummer Balls, and high\nlevel of staff turnover at\nthe Union.\nRegarding the lateness of the annual room\nbookings, the DPCS\nclarified that for rooms\nin the college, the\nUnion is dependent on\nresponses from Building\nManagers at the college\nitself \u2013 which often leads\nto delays. Additionally,\nthe high staff turnover\nin Student Activities has\nhad an effect on all of\ntheir activities, with work\ntypically done by unfilled\nroles distributed amongst\nthe DPCS and other\nmembers of the team. The\nvacant roles will be filled\nas soon as possible.\nThe DPFS offered\nseveralclarificationsabout\nthe lack of food service in\nh-bar, which was intended\nto begin prior to the start\nof term. The original\nconsultation survey that\nwent out was useful and\ninformed decisions made\nby the Union in regards to\nthe direction they wanted\nto take with food service.\nHowever, due to issues\nthat \u201cwent unnoticed\u201d, it\nemerged after those plans\nwere made that there was\nnot the correct equipment\nin the h-bar kitchen to\nenact that plan. There are\nnow ongoing discussions\nwith college about whose\nresponsibility it is to refit\nthe kitchen \u2013 as the space\nbelongs to the college,\nbut the Union wants to\ndeliver service there.\nCurrently there is no date\nset for when food service\nwill begin. Suggestions\nabout the introduction of\na reduced menu were met\nwith hesitance; the menu\nwould have to be severely\nreduced, and there was\na desire expressed to do\nthings properly rather\nthan rushing out a compromised service.\nThere were also questions raised about the\nSummer Ball. Last year,\nthe Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion ran a separate\nBall for postgraduates,\nand were disappointed\nabout the lack of Union\nsupport in organisation\ncannot commit to helping\nwith another large-scale\nFirst Meeting of Union Council: A Roundup\nFelix is committed this year to demystifying the Union for students, shedding light on the processes and people\nbehind decision-making - this week, we summarise the juicy bits of the first meeting of the Union Council\n\u201cA\ncontroversial\ntopic was\nConstituent\nUnion\nrepresentation\non the ERB\nand CWB\nboards\u201d\nfalls fully within the remit\nof a particular SC, that SC\ncan make decisions on\nthat policy without having\nto go through the Council.\nOne topic of controversy was the disparity\nbetween the representation of Constituent Union\n(CU) members on different SCs. While the Education and Representation\nBoard (ERB) has two, the\nCommunity and Welfare\nBoard (CWB) only has\none \u2013 leading CU representatives to question\nwhy.

The\nmain draw was the press\ntickets really.At first I was\nnervous about reviewing.\nWhat if my writing wasn\u2019t\ngood enough? Was I\nentitled to have an opinion\non things which I definitely wasn\u2019t an expert on? If\nan award-winning artist\nhad made something that\nI really hated, was I just\nincapable of appreciating\nits genius?\nIt took me some time,\nbut I eventually got over\nthose fears. Anyone can\nwrite (admittedly to\nvarying degrees of quality,\nbut that\u2019s what editors are\nfor). I also realised two\nimportant things: first,\nyou don\u2019t need to be an\nexpert to recognise good\nor bad art, and second,\neven award-winning\nartists produce squibs.\nI started to get excited\nabout seeing my articles\nin print \u2013 it was the best\nfeeling when people told\nme that they\u2019d gone to\nsee a show on the basis of\nmy review. Or the reverse,\nfor that matter. Writing a\nstinging review is actually\nmore fun than writing a\ngood one.\nWhat sort of art do I\nappreciate the most? It\u2019s\na difficult choice, but I\u2019d\nhave to say the opera. The\nsheer melodrama! Jilted\nlovers, seething passions,\nmurder and intrigue!\nThe soaring voices and\nsublime music! You leave\nthe grandeur and plush\nconfines of the Royal\nOpera House feeling, for\nManon\nM\nanon, based\non the\n1731 novel\nL\u2019histoire du\nchevalier des Grieux et de\nManon Lescaut by Abb\u00e9\nPr\u00e9vost, was reimagined\nby Kenneth Macmillan\nin 1974 as a ballet and\nremains a captivating\nstory to this day. It tells\nthe tale of Manon who,\nthough in love with Des\nGrieux, agrees to be mistress to Monsieur G.M. as\nhe offers her wealth and\nluxury. Over three acts,\nthe ballet recounts this\nstory between Manon and\nDes Grieux which ends in\ntragedy. I tried not to read\ntoo much about the story\nbefore I went in, to see\nhow much I could pick up\nfrom just the dancing \u2013 it\nwas amazing how expressive the dancers were and\nhow the story and characters can come across just\nfrom the movements, no\nwords or acting needed.\nParticularly amusing was\nRyoichi Hirano, playing\nManon\u2019s brother, in his\ndrunken party scene,\nsimultaneously graceful\nand deliberately clumsy.\nSarah Lamb does an\nexquisite job of playing\nManon, switching between a greedy, amoral\nwoman, willing to sacrifice happiness for a life\nof opulence, and an inno-cent, romantic lover to the\npoor student Des Grieux,\nmasterfully portrayed by\nVadim Muntagirov. The\nchemistry between the\ntwo of them is evident,\nand all their scenes together with the lifts, tum-bles, and entanglements\nwere mesmerising. The\nbedroom pas de deux in\nparticular was painfully\nbeautiful to watch.\nThe whole performance\nwas a masterpiece to me.\nEnsemble scenes with the\nwhole Royal Ballet company coupled with beau-tiful, intricate set designs\nby Nicholas Georgiadis,\nwere a feast for the eyes,\npainting vivid pictures.\nThe contrast between the\nlarge scenes with their\nhustling and bustling and\nstripped-back intimate\nlove scenes was important\nin intensifying the emotions in the pas de deux\nscenes between Manon\nand Des Grieux.\nBallet is often seen as\nrather high-brow, but this\nevening showed me that\nanyone can appreciate the\nbeauty and flair exuded\nby the dancers. Ultimately it is an art, and even as\nsomeone who knows nothing about dance, I could\nclearly see the dedication\nand sheer talent that goes\ninto a performance like\nthis. I was completely in\nawe. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve\nhad to knock off half a star\nbecause whilst I do think\nthat you don\u2019t have to be\n\u2018posh\u2019 to enjoy the ballet\nas an art form, on the economical front it remains\nan unnecessary expense\nfor the average student,\nespecially if you want a\ndecent seat with a view of\nthe whole stage.

Imp.\nA\ns the title\nimplies, this\nperformance\nwas comprised\nof four different plays,\neach increasing in length\n\u2013 the final play, \u2018Imp\u2019, was\none hour long. \u2018Glass\u2019tells\nthe story of a girl made\nof glass, discussing important themes of abuse.\nHowever, this aspect\ndidn\u2019t seem to quite fit in\nas I felt that it would have\nbeen equally as impactful\nif the short sketch was\nperformed without the girl\nbeing made of glass. \u2018Kill\u2019\nwas a bizarre monologue\nby \u2018God\u2019 talking about\nthe violence and absurdity of the Greeks who\ninvented all these Gods\nwho don\u2019t actually exist.\n\u2018Bluebeard\u2019s Friends\u2019\ncentres around a series\nof conversations between\nfour people whose friend\nhas just been found to\nhave been a serial killer\nwho murdered all six of\nhis wives, as they try to\nwrap their heads around\nit. Lastly, \u2018Imp\u2019 is the tale\nof an elderly pair who live\ntogether and get visits\nfrom a homeless man and\nan Irish girl, who eventually form a romantic\nrelationship.\nThere is not a single\nbad performance from\nany actor in any of the\nfour plays. The talent on\nthe stage was remarkable,\nparticularly the rapport\nbetween Deborah Findlay\nand Toby Jones in both\n\u2018Bluebeard\u2019s Friends\u2019\nand especially in \u2018Imp\u2019.\nMiriam Buether\u2019s set\ndesigns were wondrous,\nparticularly that of the\nsecond play, where the\nstage consisted of a\nfloating cloud with \u2018God\u2019\nsitting atop it, and also\nthe third play, in which\nbloodied wedding dresses\nhung in the background\nthroughout the whole\nsketch. But for me, none\nof this takes away from\nthe fact that I found the\nplays to be just a bit pointless \u2013 it felt like nothing\nhappened in the entire 2\nhours of performance,\nand whilst captivating to\nwatch the performances,\nit was too long a period of\ntime for nothing to have\noccurred. Simply put, it\ndidn\u2019t feel very satisfying.\nI walked out of the\ntheatre feeling very\nconfused as I heard everybody nattering around me\nabout how profound and\nwonderful the show was.\nThen a few days later a\nwhole slew of five-star\nreviews came out and I\nfound myself even more\nconfused. It is not often\nI give such an average\nrating for a play; usually\nI find something to rave\nabout, whether it\u2019s the\nacting, the set design, the\nwriting, or meaning, but\nthere is an overwhelming\nsense throughout this\nwhole play that it is definitely aimed exclusively\nat the bourgeoisie of\nLondon. Ultimately, there\nwas no action, there was\nno obvious meaning or\nrelevance. I know Caryl\nChurchill is an extremely\nwell-regarded playwright,\nbut perhaps this type of\nplay just suits certain types\nof people; evidently much\nof the audience enjoyed it\nso I\u2019d still give it a go and\nsee if you engage with the\ncommentary. Or perhaps\nthe meaning was hidden\ndeep within the subtext,\nbut I just personally\nfeel that for a play to be\nmeaningful it needs to be\naccessible to the average\nperson on some level.\nWhilst the set was great\nand there were some\nfantastic performances, I\ndon\u2019t think it did enough\nto outweigh the lack of\nsubstance nor did it justify\nthe price.\nONE: Rough Edged Insights to the State We\u2019re In\nR\neconciliation,\ncompromise &\nunderstanding.\nThese are words\none would be hard pushed\nto find mentioned in\nmodern British political\ndiscourse. So evident\nis their absence that the\nmore hopeless among us\nmay feel they have been\nforever barred from the\nBritish psyche. Here in\nOne, a show where theatre meets clowning meets\nperformance art, the sense\nof windows being opened\nto let fresh air and ideas in\nthe room is overwhelm-ing. The most promising\nscent of course being its\nexploration of this paragraph\u2019s opening words. To\nfocus solely on this single\nthematic exploration\nwould be to do a disservice to the multifaceted\ngreatness on display here.\nONE is funny, macabre\nand emotionally distressing at points. The control\nBert and Nasi manage to\nexert over you with their\npowerful performances is\ndisturbing but a testament\nto their skills as clowns,\nactors and artists.\nWe start surreal\n(don\u2019t worry it only\ngets stranger), Nasi up a\nladder, Bert asking him to\ncome down. Nasi likes the\nspace, the freedom. Bert\nseems keen on closeness.\nHis love bordering on\nsuffocating and selfish.\nThe fourth wall is never\nallowed to be built as\nBert brings the crowd in\nto the show from the off.\nNerveless in his respons-es, the witty back and\nforths would make one\nthink there were plants\nin the audience were the\nexchanges not so natural.\nThe stage is simple,\nconsisting of a chair, the\naforementioned ladder, a\ntable and a laptop. Bert\nand Nasi are casually\ndressed \u2013 looking like they\njumped out the audience\non to the stage. This all\ncreates a sense of comfort\nwhich allows the emotional range on display feel\nmore authentic \u2013 these are\n\u2018just some guys\u2019 and we\nsee ourselves reflected in\nhow they feel. It\u2019s acting\nbut doesn\u2019t feel like it. Idiosyncrasies abound, Bert\nin particular providing a\ncomic touch that is woven\nthroughout. This humour\nhelps to counter some\nof the more dramatic\nemotions on display\nwhilst also meaning you\nfeel emotionally dragged\nand don\u2019t know what to\nfeel when.\nNasi will eventually\njoin Bert on the floor,\nbut this only makes room\nfor further wonderfully\nstrange scenes \u2013 a highlight being Bert\u2019s creepy-yet-funny monologue\non stalking the audience\nhome. In one moment\nNasi comments on the\nstate of theatre and those\nwho are perhaps trying\ntoo hard to make something \u2018new\u2019. The brilliant\nirony of course is that they\nthemselves have really\nmade something that\nfeels different to anything\nwe\u2019ve seen. Each scene\nis an invitation to think\nabout how we relate to our\nloved ones and those who\ndiffer. The messaging is\nsubtle whilst provoking.\nIn this show we choose\nthe ending, tonight a\nhappy one. This injection\nof the \u2018democratic will\u2019\nis a fitting ending and\none can only hope such\na happy fate will follow\nfor the country.

    "content": "The Man Booker Prize 2019 Shortlist: The Testaments\nBOOKS\nSimran Kukran\nBooks Writer\nT\nhe Testaments\nis a sequel\nto Margaret\nAtwood\u2019s 1985\ndystopian novel, The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale. It is set\n15 years after the first, in\nthe same totalitarian state\nof Gilead, where a fertility\ncrisis and patriarchal fundamentalism have come\ntogether to foster a society\nwhere women are legally\nsubordinate, with many\nin child-bearing slavery.\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale has\nfound its way back into\npopular culture, more than\n30 years after its initial\nrelease. It has inspired\nprotests; in the US there\nhas been a series of\nprotests with the costume\nof a Handmade becoming\nsynonymous with the\nresistance to what has\nbeen seen as the curtailment of women\u2019s rights\nunder Donald Trump\u2019s\npresidency. Following a\ncritically acclaimed TV\nseries accompanying The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale that she\nhelpedwrite(andcameoed\nin), Atwood has written\na sequel, dubbed \u201cthe\nliterary event of the year\u201d.\nFollowing its release, the\nbook went straight to the\ntop of bestseller lists and\nwas also shortlisted for\nthe Booker prize ahead of\nits publication.\nThe Testaments follows\na similar patchwork style\nto its precedent work,\nwhere chapters are not\nalways chronological. It\nis even more fractured,\nnarrated by three different\ncharacters. In contrast,\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale is\ntold entirely from Offred\u2019s\nperspective,theHandmaid\nof high-ranking Commander Fred. Handmaids\nare fertile women who are\npassed around between\nelite families until they\nbear a child for them,\nwith pregnancy being the\nonly time they are given\nrespect or recognition.\nAny hint of individual\nidentity or agency is\nbanished to memory, with\neven their names taken\naway and replaced by\ntheir superiors. Offred\u2019s\nnarration of events comes\nwith personal introspection that is beautifully\npoetic and poignant at\ntimes. The Testaments, as\nthe name suggests, reads\nmore like a dialogue. It\nis the testimonial of three\nmain characters: Aunt\nLydia, Agnes and Daisy.\nAlthough less beautiful\nthan The Handmaid\u2019s\nTale, having three main\ncharacters\u2019 voices gives\nthe benefit of multiple\nperspectives, allowing\nthe reader to get to know\nGilead in a multifaceted\nway.\nThe most compelling\naccount in the book\ncomes from Aunt Lydia.\nShe is one of the founding\nmembers of the dictatorship and coordinates\nthe womens\u2019 sphere. As\nan aunt, she is among\nthe only rank of women\nwho is permitted to\nread and write, although\nher personal diary is\nsmuggled. She chronicles\nher journey from a liberal\njudge before the rise of\nGilead to the time she is\nwriting, where a statue has\nbeen erected in her honour\nand her portrait hangs\nin every girls\u2019 school.\nTorture and abuse is the\nmain part of this journey,\ninflicted on and then by\nher. The description of\nthese tactics is vivid and\nbrutal, and at times difficult to read. Atwood says\nall the tortuous techniques\ndescribed in the books\nare based on historical\narchives, and the details\nare chilling. The result\nis an incredibly cruel,\ncynical woman who has\ngone to incredible lengths\nto establish her power.\nAunt Lydia\u2019s account\nbears almost no resemblance to that of Agnes.\nRaised in Gilead in an\nupper-class family, she\nknows no different to\nthe society around her,\nand doubtful and pious\nin equal measure. She is\nnaive and hopeful, despite\nbeing traumatised by the\nbarbarity of the regime.\nHer youthful outlook is\nsimilar to that of Daisy,\nthe third narrator. Daisy\nhas grown up in Canada\nand offers an outsider\u2019s\nperspective on Gilead.\nHer language and focus\nDoes the Testaments live up to the hype of the Handmaid\u2019s Tale?\nThe Testaments // Penguin Books\nISSUE 1729\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\n\u201cThe\nTestaments\nreads more\nlike a\ndialogue\u201d\n\u201cAn incredibly\ncruel, cynical\nwoman who\nhas gone to\nincredible\nlengths to\nestablish her\npower\u201d\nreads, at times, like young\nadult fiction. While her\nfocus lies in toppling the\nregime, she makes time\nto ruminate on her crush\nand whether or not she is\nimpressing him.\nIn some ways, the three\nstorytellers have agency\nand hope, making The\nTestaments inherently less\ndepressingthanTheHandmaid\u2019s Tale. The feeling\nof optimism is helped, of\ncourse, by the fact that the\nreaders know that Gilead\ndoes eventually fall. The\ncomplex female characters are well-developed,\nwith their relationships\ndepicted masterfully. The\nplot is fast-paced and\nenjoyable, but ultimately\n\u201cA good\nsequel rather\nthan an\nexcellent\nwork in its\nown right\u201d\npredictable. The Testaments satisfies the need to\nknow more about Gilead\nand its eventual demise. It\ndoes not retract from The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale in any\nway, but it lacks originality and is a good sequel\nrather than an excellent\nwork in its own right.\n\n"

    "content": "The anomalous King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard\nA\ns the chuggy\nriff of \u2018SelfI m m o l a t e \u2019\nbroke out over\nAlexandra Palace last\nSaturday, someone threw\nan entire pint down me.\nNot the best start to one\nof the best gigs I\u2019ve been\nto in a long time, but\ncertainly a memorable\none. This night was\ndefinitely memorable for\nthe band playing as well:\nperforming their biggest\nheadline show to date,\nAussie psych-rock lords,\nKing Gizzard and the\nLizard Wizard, played to\na sold-out venue despite\nnever breaking into the\ntop 75 in the UK \u2013 weird\neven for a band called\nKing Gizz. Nonetheless,\nthey made the most of\nit, next swinging from\n\u2018Self-Immolate\u2019 into\ntheir catchy \u2018Mars for the\nRich\u2019, another song off\ntheir new album Infest\nthe Rat\u2019s Nest, about the\nimpending environmental\ndisaster we\u2019re facing. This\nwas really one to get the\npit going. Surprisingly,\nthey next moved onto\n\u2018I\u2019m in Your Mind\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m\nNot in Your Mind\u2019, and\n\u2018Cellophane\u2019, all songs\nfrom their older 2014\nalbum I\u2019m in Your Mind\nFuzz. By incorporating\ntheir older songs, you got\nthe feeling the band had\nthis setlist planned for\nyears, and suggested how\nmuch this sell-out show\nmeant to them; as singer/\nguitarist Stu Mackenzie\npointed out \u201cit\u2019s a\nbit different from the\nShacklewell Arms, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\nThey followed this up\nwith \u2018The Great Chain\nof Being\u2019 and \u2018Plastic\nBoogie\u2019, the latter off their\nalbum Fishing for Fishies,\nreleased in April this year.\nThis song stereotypes\nthe main sound they\nwent for in this album,\nan electro-boogie vibe\nwith singer/keyboardist\nAmbrose Kenny-Smith\nsqueezing out the iconic\nharmonica riffs which are\ncommon for the record.\nDrifting back to their\nfourth album of 2017,\nP o l y g o n d w a n a l a n d ,\nKing Gizz next took us\non a swooning journey\nthrough their 11-minute\nsong \u2018Crumbling Castle\u2019,\ncomplete with heavily\npsychedelic images\nprojected onto the huge\nscreen behind them to\ncompliment their insane\nnoise. A few sweaty,\njostling songs later and\nKing Gizz brought out the\nbig guns: \u2018Rattlesnake\u2019,\narguably their most\nfamous song. Its popularity in part due to the repeti-tively addictive riffs used,\nbut in a bigger part its\nsuccess in energising the\ncrowd was mostly due to\nthe ridiculously (not) difficult lyrics: \u201crattlesnake/\nrattlesnake/rattlesnake/\nrattlesnake\u201d.\nThis led us to the final\nsong. What would it be?\nWe hadn\u2019t yet had some\nof their classics such as\n\u2018Gamma Knife\u2019 or the\nmore recent \u2018Cyboogie\u2019.\nThe crowd got ready to\npounce upon another\niconic song. As the first\nfew notes trickled out, it\nwasn\u2019t one I (and everyone\nelse) recognised: looking\nat the setlist afterwards it\nwas \u2018Float Along \u2013 Fill\nYour Lungs\u2019 from their\n2013 album of the same\nname. Whilst not knowing\nthe song, it had math rock\nvibes mixed with Sgt.\nPepper-era Beatles, so\nwhat\u2019s not to love? As\nthey finished up their final\nsong and the house lights\nwent up over the 10,000+\naudience cheering along, I\ncould see why King Gizz\nchose such a poignant\nsong to finish off their\nbiggest, and best, gig of\ntheir career so far.\nSleep: the snoozefest in Kentish Town\nL\nast Friday night:\na dreary evening,\nwhere all I wanted\nas we headed off\nto Kentish Town was for\nmy heart, body and soul to\nbe warmed by heavy rock.\nLuckily, we were heading to\nthe lovely O2 Forum Kentish\nany room up). Entering the\nmassive, packed auditorium,\nSleep were already on, and\nwe tried to make up for lost\ntime by fighting through the\nmasses \u2013 not an easy job as\nSleep fans don\u2019t like to mosh\nbut instead apparently like\nto stand completely still,\nallowing only their necks to\nswivel in a doom-induced\ntrance. This hypnosis came\nmainly from bassist/singer\nAl Cisneros\u2019 all-consuming,\ndrawn out bass solos which\nfelt like they took up half\nthe set, whilst the other two\nmembers remained still\nwaiting for him to finish. As\nfar as the setlist went that\nfateful Friday, I simply don\u2019t\nknow when the band started\na new song \u2013 they all seemed\nto be the same and there was\nno interaction between band\nand audience, something\nwhich isn\u2019t necessary but\ncould\u2019ve really livened up an\notherwise quite boring show.\nPerhaps, as a stoner rock\nband, their live shows need\nto be enjoyed as the band\nwrote them \u2013 high beyond\nsense. However, I was bored\nbeyond sense, and having\narrived late I then left early,\nsomething I have never done\nat a gig before. Typically\nSleep then played their most\nfamous song \u2018Dragonaut\u2019,\nbut I was long gone.

Society does\nnot stand by and await\ndisaster, but acts through\ncommon efforts to avert\nit. The question that must\nfollow is therefore: Why,\nin the face of what may\nbe the greatest threat in\nhistory of mankind, are\nwe doing nothing?\nThe threats of climate\nchange should not be un-derestimated. The medical\njournal The Lancet\nrecently declared climate\nchange the \u201cbiggest\nglobal health threat of\nthe 21st century\u201d. They\nderived several expected\nglobal health issues from\nrising temperatures. Other\nthan the direct harm of\nheat stress, additional\neffects include the spread\nof certain diseases and\na reduction of people\u2019s\nability to work, particularly in the agricultural\nsector. Between 2000\nand 2017, the number of\npeople annually exposed\nto heat related risks has\nalready increased by 157\nmillion. Furthermore,\nrising temperatures has\nalso exacerbated deserti-fication, which currently\naffects 2.7 billion people,\nand is expected to cause\nup to 700 million migrations by 2050. Another\n280 million people, of\nwhich 3.8 million Britons,\nare expected to be forced\nto leave their homes as a\nresult of rising sea levels\nin the case of a 2\u00b0C\ntemperature increase.\nWe cannot even begin to\nimagine all the disasters\nthat climate change can\nbring, and it should be\nclear to everyone that we\nare heading towards a\nglobal crisis.\nUnfortunately, that\ndoes not seem to be the\ncase. Earlier this week,\nPM Boris Johnson described participants of\nthe ongoing protests as\n\u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d,\nand brought up Margaret\nThatcher as someone\nwho \u201ctook [greenhouse\ngases] seriously long\nbefore Greta Thunberg\u201d.\nIronically, he unintentionally pointed straight at\nthe problem: for 30 years\ngreenhouse gas emission\nhas been a recognised\nissue, and yet it has not\nbeen dealt with.\nIn signing the Paris\nAgreement in 2015, a\ntotal of 222 nations agreed\nto limit global warming to\n2\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels, and aiming for\nunder 1.5\u00b0C. Sadly, only\ntwo countries - Morocco\nand The Gambia - are on\ntrack to meet the 1.5\u00b0C\ngoal. (It is important to\nremember that, whilst a\n1.5\u00b0C increase would be\nmuch less severe than a\n2\u00b0C increase, the former\nwill still have dire con-sequences.) Because all\nother nations are failing\nto live up to their pledges,\nthe world is expected to\nsurpass 1.5\u00b0C already by\n2035, with an expected\nrise of 3.2\u00b0C by the end of\nthe century. At the current\nemission rate, the remaining \u201cCO2 budget\u201d (the\namount of CO2 that can\nbe emitted whilst maintaining a 66 % chance of\nmeeting the 2\u00b0C target,\nestimated by IPCC) will\nbe completely exhausted\nin 17 years, with only 11\nyears remaining in order to\nstay below 1.5\u00b0C. In other\nwords: we are running out\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilip Ani\u00e9s\nXR Imperial Organiser\nof time, and nothing is\nbeing done about it.\nA better future is\npossible\nOne argument that is\nfrequently used by opponents of investments in\nsustainable development\nis that future technology\nwill be able to solve any\nissues related to climate\nchange. For all those\npeople, there are good\nnews: the future is now!\nAs a result of recent\nadvances in wind and\nsolar power - improved\ndesign, lowered production costs, and an increase\nof utility-scale operations\n- renewable energy has\nnow become cheaper\nthan conventional energy\nsources. According to\na report released by the\nInternational Renewable\nEnergy Agency (IRENA)\nin May this year, renewable energy produced by\nwind turbines and photovoltaics are frequently\ncheaper than any fossil\nfuel alternative.As renewable energy production\ncosts continue to fall, new\ninstallations are expected\nto undercut even the\ncontinuation of existing\ncoal power plants. Furthermore, advancements\nare being made in the\nproduction, storage, and\nuse of hydrogen fuels,\nwhilst carbon capture, uti-lisation, and sequestration\nis an active research area\nwith the emerging market.\nSuch progress is proof\nthat necessary sustainable\ntechnologies are - at the\nvery least - well within\nreach, and their development does not require\nanything more than a\nwillingness to invest and\nadapt. However, the sole\nexistence of sustainable\ntechnologies will not drive\nchange. Again and again,\ninfluential individuals\nand organisations have\nactively worked against\nnecessary sustainable\ndevelopments in favour\nof their own short-term\npolitical and financial\nbenefits. We cannot\ntolerate this any longer,\nand sustainability must\nbecome as sought after as\neconomic growth is today.\nThe need of a global\nmovement to force\nchange\nThe risks and causes\nof climate change have\nbeen long known. Had\nwe acted early enough,\nwe would not have been\nin the urgent situation\nthat we are in now. But\nwe are, and we now need\nchange at an unprecedented rate and scale.\nPolitical campaigning has\nfailed. Corporations still\nscore short-term benefits\nfrom environmentally\ndamaging activities.\nTraditional activism has\nnot had the necessary\nlarge-scale impact.\nSelf-imposed individual\nbehavioural changes\nwill never be a realistic\nsolution to a global\nissue. Thankfully, history\nprovides a solution.\nFamous examples such\nas Gandhi\u2019s anti-coloni-alism, Mandela\u2019s fight\nagainst apartheid, and Dr\nMartin Luther King\u2019s and\nRosa Parks\u2019 civil rights\nmovement, all prove the\neffectiveness of civil\ndisobedience and non-vi-olent direct action. Once a\ngovernment starts arresting thousands of its own\npeaceful citizens, it soon\nloses its legitimacy. This\nis what is needed today: a\nglobal political movement\nwith widespread support\nfrom people, so immense\nthat it becomes impossible for those in power to\nignore.\nFor this to come true,\npeople must show their\nsupport for the ongoing\nprotests. Everyone is\nwelcome, and everyone\nis needed. Support can\nbe shown simply through\nsilent agreement, and\nmore preferably through\nparticipation, or even by\ntaking one\u2019s own initia-tives. One may even argue\nthat, in times of societal\nemergency combined with\npolitical inaction, civil\ndisobedience is a duty of\nevery citizen.\nDie-In coordinated by Red Rebels, XR Youth, and XR Elders at Traflagar Square // Extinction Rebellion Youth\n40\n\n"

Cambridge\nFamous for its universi-ty, Cambridge is no doubt\none of England\u2019s most\nappreciated towns, but its\nlocation means it has so\nmuch more to offer than\na solid education. You can\nstart off by following a\ntrail along the whopping\n31 colleges around the\nuniversity town, and sub-sequently, pay the River\nCam a visit and punt along\nit, whilst you observe the\nhistoric town\u2019s beauty in\nall its wonder as you pass\nthe town centre.\n2. Lake District\nWith its UNESCO\nWorld Heritage status, the\nLake District is unmistakably one of the most\nscenic on our list. Whether\nyou\u2019re looking for inspiration to write your next\npoem, book, song (or even\ndissertation), or you\u2019re\njust looking to spend some\ndowntime away from the\ncity \u2013 look no further.\nThe natural wonders\naround here include 12\nbeautiful lakes, with England\u2019s largest lake \u2013 Windermere, as well as one\nof the highest mountains\n\u2013 Scafell Pike \u2013 within\nwalking distance of each\nother. So, get ready for\na beautiful trail and the\nescapade of a lifetime as\nyou\u2019re bound to experience some of the most\ntranquil days ever here.\n3. Bristol\nVoted student city of\nthe year for years in a row,\nBristol is perfect for when\nyou want to get away\nfrom the hustle and bustle\nof London, but you\u2019re not\nquite ready to take on the\nstillness that comes with\nbeing in the countryside.\nBristol\u2019s great as that mid-dle-ground: use the day to\nfollow contemporary art\nand immerse yourself into\nBanksy\u2019s work, and then\npop over to the seafront\nfor some late-afternoon\nshopping and a scenic\ndinner.\n4. Cornwall\nTheUK\u2019ssur\ufb01ngcapital\nhas recently become\nmore and more popular\nfollowing the premier\nof Poldark, and we can\nde\ufb01nitely see why. Take\nyourself down to St Ives,\none of Cornwall\u2019s most\nartsy towns, and browse\nthrough some gorgeous\ngalleries \u2013 including the\nclassic Tate St Ives. Don\u2019t\nforget to follow this up\nwith a visit to the iconic\nWatergate Bay \u2013 what\nis arguable Cornwall\u2019s\nmost picturesque beach\n\u2013 and then pop down to\nSt. Michael\u2019s Mount \u2013 a\nmini rocky island with the\nlegendary cave in which\na giant supposedly lives.\nGuess you\u2019re going to\nhave to \ufb01nd out yourself if\nthis is indeed a myth or a\nfact\u2026\n5. Brighton\nThe Brighton Royal\nPavilion is among the\nmost prevalent attractions\nin the UK, and it\u2019s not hard\nto see why. This seaside\nfortress, initially belonging to Prince George IV,\nand contemporarily titled\n\u201cthe pleasure palace\u201d, is\nan Indian-style palace\nwith nearly 200 years of\nhistory, and an interior\nyour Instagram feed most\nde\ufb01nitely needs.\n6. Bath\nOne of England\u2019s\noldest cities, Bath is\nfamous for its Roman\nBaths, which reportedly\nhave healing waters that\nhave attracted sightseers\nfrom all over the world for\nover 1000 years. If you\u2019d\nlike to experience these\nfor yourself, head over\nto Thermae Vath Spa and\nprepare yourself for the\npampering of a lifetime\n\u2013 perfect for a post-exam\ntreat, or even just some\ntime away from the stress\nof uni.\nRiver View, Cambridge // Danny Navarro via Flickr\nLake District // Sarah Kotlova via Flickr\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhere have been\nreports that\nPrince Andrew,\nThe Duke of\nYork, will be visiting\nImperial\u2019s White City\ncampus on the 14th of\nOctober. The visit is in\ntandem with the \u2018Pitch@\nPalace' entrepreneurship\nscheme that the Duke\nbegan in 2014, the penultimate \u2018Boot Camp\u2019 stage\nof which is being hosted\non the Imperial campus.\nThe decision of the\nCollege to host the Duke\nis considered controversial by some due to the\nongoing investigation into\nhis friendship with Jeffrey\nEpstein. Epstein was\narrested in the US earlier\nthis year on charges of\nsex trafficking underage\nwomen, and had previously received jail time\nof soliciting minors for\nprostitution \u2013 though he\navoided full scrutiny then\nwith a secret plea deal.\nOver the years, dozens\nof women came forward\nto press charges. Epstein\nlater died in his jail cell,\napparently of suicide.\nThe Duke first met\nEpstein in 1999, but maintained contact with him\nfor many years afterwards\n\u2013 including after Epstein\nwas released from his first\nround of prison \u2013 which\nthe Duke later described as\n\u201ca mistake and an error\u201d.\nThe Duke is known to\nhave stayed at several of\nEpstein\u2019s properties, and\nwas photographed with\nEpstein in 2010 after he\nwas released \u2013 as well as\nreportedly appearing numerous times on the logs\nof Epstein\u2019s private jet.\nSubsequently, the Duke\nhimself was directly\naccused of abusing a\nminor, when Virginia\nGuiffre stepped forward\nand claimed that she was\nforced into having sex\nwith the Duke three times\nwhen she was 17 after\nallegedly being recruited\nby Epstein as a child sex\nslave. The Duke was photographed with Virginia,\nreportedly in 2001, in a\nnow-infamous photo.\nGiven the allegations,\nvisits from the Duke to\nother universities during\nthe Pitch@Palace tour\nhave received public crit-icism. Notably, his visit\nto the University of South\nWales was described as\n\u201calarming\u201d by the head\nof Plaid Cymru, Leanne\nWood, who subsequently\neven sought to pressure\nWelsh universities via\ngovernment into committing not to host \u201cguests in\nthis unsavoury situation\u201d.\nRegarding the event at\nImperial, the concern is\nprimarily that the College\nis prioritising entrepreneurial ties and the benefit\nof startup organisations\nover the welfare of young-women. Many incoming\nstudents, having just\njoined the College, are\nonly 17 \u2013 the same age as\nVirginia Guiffre when she\nwas allegedly abused by\nthe Duke. In other words,\nit \u201csends a very negative\nmessage to young women\nat the College\u201d, as one\nanonymous commentator\nsaid.\nThe College\u2019s statement does little to assuage\nthe fears of those who are\nconcerned. In response to\na request for statement,\na College spokesperson\nspeaking to Felix said:\n\u201cInspiring and supporting\nentrepreneurship is a\npriority for Imperial and\nwe promote a range of\nopportunities to help our\nstudents and others to\npursue their enterprising\nideas. This is the driving\nforce behind our decision\nto host Pitch@Palace\nBootcamp 12.0.\u201d There\nwas no mention of any\nconsideration for students\nwho may feel marginal-ised by the College\u2019s de-cision, despite a specific\nrequest for clarification\non that issue \u2013 only an\nacknowledgement that\nit would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for the College\nto comment, and that\nany external event at the\nCollege needs to adhere\nto a \u201ccode of conduct to\nensure a safe and inclusive\nenvironment.\u201d\nShree Thirumalaikumar, the Chair of the Feminist Society at Imperial,\nappears to disagree. She\nthinks that this decision\npromotes the opposite of\nan inclusive environment:\n\u201cIt feels wrong for\nImperial to host Prince\nAndrewinthefaceofthese\nunresolved allegations.\nIn a culture which tends\nnot to believe in women,\nit is hard not to view\nCollege\u2019s decision to run\nthe event as a disregard of\nthese accusations entirely\n- especially for an institution that is both of such\nsize and stature, and that\nis home to a large group\nof young people.\u201d\nThe rest of the College\nstatement addresses the\nfact that Imperial startups\nthat have gone on to win\nthe event and gain \u201cfurther\ninvestment\u201d \u2013 and of how\nthe College\u2019s competence\nin hosting the event\npreviously led them to be\noffered the chance to host\nit again. This agreement\nwas in fact made in May\n\u2013 which was after the allegations against the Duke\nhad already emerged.\nIt is important to note\nthat there is no formal\nrelationship between\nthe College and Pitch@\nPalace. Agreements to\nhost events are made\non a one-off basis, and\nthe College receives no entrepreneurs and innovation community.\u201d\nThe Royal Household\u2019s\npress office responded\nwith a refusal to comment\nwhen contacted.\nThe Duke of York has\nalso not officially declared\nthat he will be attending,\nthough it is assumed\nbased on his attendance\nat the other Pitch@Palace\nevents on this round. His\nofficial Royal Engagements page remains completely empty over the\nnext month. This is also\nthe reason given by the\nCollege for the lack of any\npublicity about the royal\nvisit: \u201cwe would not ordinarily promote notable\nvisits ahead of time. Announcements about Royal\nvisits are a matter for the\nRoyal Household.\u201d\nFelix will be gauging\nstudent reactions to the\nnews of the Duke\u2019s visit\nover the coming week.\nThe Duke met Epstein in 2010 after his release from prison // BBC\nPrince Andrew Planning to Visit College\nISSUE 1729\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Duke of York is likely attending the College as part of the Pitch@Palace initiative, with which Imperial has\nbeen involved for several years - but the decision is now controversial after the allegations earlier this year\n\u201cIn a culture\nwhich tends\nnot to believe\nin women,\nit's hard not\nto view the\nCollege's\ndecision as\na disregard\nof these\nallegations\u201d\nremuneration as a result.\nDespite that, the sense\nthat there are intangible\nbenefits is clear from the\nspokesperson: \u201chosting\nthe event exposes a powerful network of business\nleaders, investors and in-fluencers to the College\u2019s\n3\n\n"

We are bombarded\nby expletives on the\ninternet, in film, music,\ntelevision, literature (and\nsomesub-par\u201cjournalism\u201d\noutlets). It has corrupted\nthe youth and rooted\nitself deep into modern\npopular culture. Profanity\nhas taken control of us\nand invaded our lives.\nSwearing can be effective\nwithin context, but this\novergrowth of colourful\nlanguage has embittered\nourpalateforgood,healthy\nconversations.\nSwearing is defined to\nbe the use of \u201coffensive\nlanguage, especially as\nan expression of anger.\u201d\nThis is incredibly problematic in several ways.\nMany swear words are\nintended as a direct\nattack on some members\nof society. The oppressed\nalways have slang terms\nthat were imposed on\nthem by persecutors.\nThe underclass of the\nage will have negative\nwords associated with\nthem.\nThrough history:\nwomen, people of\ncolour, and LGBTQ+\npeople (in loose chronological order) have\nendured lasting offensive terms used against\nthem. At least in the\nEnglish language, the\nproprietors and gate-keepers of profanity are\nthe part of society that\nhave the least derogatory words describing\nthem. The middle-class\nwhite $man^{TM}$.\nThus, when those previously oppressed retrospectively speak out,\nand indulge themselves\nin the same forbidden\nfruit of profanity, they\nare quickly met with vitriolic backlash from the\nCaucasian community.\nThis is no good thing\neither but should make\nsome of us consider if\nwe should be using the\nwords that we force upon\nothers or respect the\nwords that those people\nhave chosen themselves.\nThese examples are not\nexhaustive but please\ndon\u2019t feel free to write\nyour own slang term\nfor [your least favourite\nethnic group here].\nCursing comes\nfrom a place of anger,\noften directly aimed\nat a thing or person.\nAnger is neither good\nfor your soul or others\non the receiving end.\nTo treat everyone with\nrespect is a rare thing\nthese days. There is no\nneed for this aggressive\nattitude; please, think\nof the children. Adults\nwill self-censor so as\nto behave differently\naround children, and\nthere exist restrictions\nfor sweary music, films,\nand television programmes so that young\npeople are not exposed\nto them.

These games are\npopular all over the world.\nStarcraft launched the\ne-sports industry; World\nof Warcraft is perhaps\none of the most popular\nand enduring games the\nworld has ever seen. The\nperception of Blizzard\nwas generally favorable\nfor many years. This\nweek Blizzard managed\na PR fuck-up of epic\ngamer proportions, when\nit banned multiple people\nthat showed support to the\nprotesters in Hong Kong.\nA Hearthstone player\ngoing by the name of\nBlitzchung gave an interview on a Taiwanese\nprogramme in a gas mask\nand shouted pro-Hong\nKong slogans. He was\nlater banned for breaching\nBlizzard\u2019s community\nrules specifically the\nrule against offending\n\u201ca portion or group of\nthe public, or otherwise\ndamag[ing] Blizzard\u2019s\nimage.\u201d Additionally,\nthe two casters on the\nlivestream were also\ndisavowed by Blizzard\nas a result of the player\u2019s\nwords, which seems rather\nunfair given that they had\nno idea what the person\nthey were interviewing\nwas actually going to\nsay \u2013 that is, without\nassuming prescience.\nTo add insult to injury,\nmembers of an inter-col-legiate Hearthstone team\nwere immediately banned\nafter they held up a piece\nof cardboard reading\n\u201cSupport Hong Kong.\u201d\nBoth of these actions\nhave gone down like a\nlead balloon in the wider\ngaming community that\nhas interpreted these\nactions as efforts to\nensure that the company\ndoes nothing to offend\nmainland Chinese sensibilities at the expense of\nfreedom of speech. Reddit\ncommunities such as r/\nBlizzard and r/Hearth-stone have been dominated with some high-quality\nmemes showing Blizzard\nas China\u2019s little bitch. Go\nand take a look. Furthermore, furious Blizzard\nassociates and employees\nhave responded by distancing themselves from\nthe company or covering\nup a rather ironic plaque\nin Blizzard HQ that reads\n\u201call voices matter.\u201d\nThis issue ties into\nwider problems that\nWestern companies have\nexperienced when operating with the Chinese\nmarket in mind. In the\nUS, a National Basketball\nAssociation manager\ntweeted in support of\nHong Kong and immediately faced the wrath of\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster\nwho threatened to pull\ntheir contract with the\nNBA.

The past\nand present of Chinese\neconomic development\nis intertwined with the\nChinese government, a\none-party autocracy that\nis considerably more\noppressive than others.\nWith this clash of cultures\nin mind, companies\nIt is important to point\nout, perhaps controver-sially, China is rightly free\nto operate as it wishes.\nChina is a sovereign state,\nand the West should not\nattempt to interfere with\nthe Chinese government.\nFiddling with sovereignty\nhas been a terrible experiment for the last 20 years\nof Western foreign policy,\nleading to widespread\ndisaster in almost every\ncase. However, the current\nposition of Western\ncompanies presents two\nissues, appeasement and\nabetment.\nIn order to maintain\ntheir access to the markets\nin China, companies such\nas Blizzard are willing to\nappease China by silencing critics in the West\nin return for potential\neconomic benefits. This\nis not acceptable. China\nmust not be allowed to\nleverage power through\neconomic manipulation\nof ethically malleable\ncompanies.\nCompanies must also\nnot abet China.
