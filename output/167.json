    "content": "FELIX Morphy Day continued:\nself: a large \"Ladies\" sign was left in his\nlap hut later removed on the advice from a sympathetic park-keeper that it was illegal.\nThe mobile mascots had arrived by this\n/ime and were lined up outside the Albert\nHaE attracting considerable attention from\npassers-by and diverting attention from the\ngoings-on across the road. Albert was\nquite unmoved by the antics going on\naround him, and eventually the mob\nki c over, through and under\" a pair\nof B.BC. vans on the way. Not to be left\nout of it the mobile mascots had a short race\nback to the Union, and despite some hairy\ncornering by Sammy Klat, fancying himself\nas a latter-day Charles Jarrott, Bo's age told\nagainst him and he came last. Back in Prince\nConsort Road an empty bus that happened to\nbe passing was commandeered, but for a short\nwhile only, for it soon became evident that\nthe bus was capable of pushing a good deal\nharder than the men holding it back, and it\nwas rapidly evacuated. Dan Elwyn Jones left\nhis exit rather late and was last seen disappearing eastwards waving from the platform.\nJust to finish things off the law arrived and\ntwelve constables stayed long enough to remove a bubble-car from one of the porches\nof the Albert Hall. The mob having disappeared (they were in fact dancing ring-a ring-of-roses found the quad.) the law retreated\nto their Black Maria and departed.

Owing to\nthe exuberance of one fresher after one and\na half pints, Mr. Bear passed an uncomfortable night in a broom cupboard, only to reappear still smiling at 9.30 a.m., the following morning.

    "content": "\u2014 6\n< W3I140 ILLUSIONS\nFELIX At a crowded meeting of the Mathematical and Physical Society held on Tuesday,\nOctober 31st, Professor Tolansky, once a member of I.C. staff, now Professor of Physics at Royal Holloway College, b ave a fascinating talk on Optical Illusions and their\neffect on physical measurements.\nThe Professor began by showing some\nslides of natural methods of camouflage. In\nat least one case one had to take the photo-graph er's word that there were insects on\nthe tree in the picture. He then introduced\nhis main subject, describing how his interest\nin optical illusions arose from some experiments of his on the hardness of materials. A diamond-pointed weight, dropped onto a a flat surface, makes a square indentation\nwhose size depends on the hardness of the\nmaterial. When dropped onto the point of c certain type of crystal, the indentation ns-shown below.\nBelieve it or not, AB= BC.\nProfessor Tolansky mentioned several examples where optical illusion could lead to\na systematic error of as much as thirty per\ncent in physical experiments. The golden rule\nis: Never guess where you can measure.\nPrinciples can be formulated for the construction of typical illusions. One's estimates\nof the length of a line depends on the position of surrounding lines, as in the well-known\ncase shown at the top of the page. One's estimation of the radius of curvature of an arc\ndepends on the angle subtended by it. A filled-in space looks smaller than an empty\nspace of equal size. A black object against\na white background looks smaller than a similar white object against a black background.\nSome these effects can be seen in the following illusion.\nOnly measurements can convince most onlookers that the two figures are of equal\narea, and that in each case A BCD is a square.\nIn conclusion, he quoted the case of a five\nper cent discrepancy between measurements\nof radioactivity made (a) with a Geiger\ncounter and (b) by visually counting the scintillation s on a zinc sup hide screen He concluded that those who watched the screen\nmissed some of the momentary flashes of\nlight because they spent five per cent of their\ntime blinking.\nProfessor Fred Hoyle will speak at the\nnext meeting of the Society, to which everyone is invited. This will take place next Tuesday at 4.30 in the Physics Building.\nDOMESTIC BURSAR'S BULLETIN1. QUITE AROUND? If one man owned all the property in\nQueen's Gate and collected a rent of \u00a34 per\nperson per week, every Christmas he could\nafford to buy one pint for every person in\nthe U.S.A.2. HOLD YOUR BREATH! Because the Earth is a barrage balloon it\ntakes the whole population four years to\ninflate it. The extra day every leap year has\nbeen assigned by international agreement as\na day of rest.\n3. CCC-CCP-IC\nOnce upon a time the Commonwealth\nCricket Conference (CCC) com misi one d Prof. C.B.C. B. Smallffry, B.A.,L. I.S., from\nthe Institute of Cricket, to as cert in the relative intelligence of the natives of the cricket\nplaying Empire\nHe worked out the numbers of cubic cricket pitches (CCP) per head of population for\nall cricket playing Imperial Colonies. His intelligence criterion (IC) was as follows: since\nthe countries were of approximately equal\ncricket ing standard, obviously the country\nwith the lowest number of CCP's per person\nhas the highest native intelligence. His results are published below:\nEngland 100\nWest Indies 150\nIndia 320\nNew Zealand 1000\nPakistan 1000\nSouth Africa 5000\nAustralia 10000\nCertain Colorties (Wales, Scotland, Canada, U.S.A., France) were not considered in\nthis survey since they had not even the intelligence to play cricket at all.\nThis year, as in every other year the, fall\nof the first trombone combination mute from\nthe trees was the sign for Imperial College\nJazz club to hold their first concert. The in-erudite mass of readers, ignorant of the yearly cycle of the Indian bean-tree like, may be\nunaware that this event occured on Thursday 2nd November. A large body of people\npacked into the Jazz Club band room( known\nto some idiots as the Concert Hall) to hear\nfour total y swinging groups. The whole thing\nwas a gas! The tr ad, jazz band led by Ken\nGibson Mew the first set- I don't remember\nprecisely what numbers they did expect that\nthe last one was \"Milenberg Joys\". Anyway\nit was a most cohesive and swinging noise.\nA Rimshot Gold Star goes to Phil Cammer'man for his bristling clarinet work.\nThe second group to appear was led by\npiano ing Stan Salmons, who, after some interesting reminiscences of New York, invited\nthe audience to \"take a number from one\nto four\". The significance of this apparently\nway out invitation is that Stan blew the first\nnumber solo, added, a bass (Dave Cain) for\nthe second, trombone (Ken Gibson) for the\nthird and drums (Mike Smith) for the fourth.\nDig? The numbers were \"Autumn in New\nYork\" Beethoven's Choral Symphony, \"Love\nfor Sale\", and \"Tangerine\". Stan's approach\nto modern jazz has changed considerably\nsince he last performed in concert, like. He\nshowed in crea sd maturity and originality.\nRimshot Gold Star for Stan.\nTh next group pn vi ded the climax to the\nconcert. It was, of course, the Dave Cain\nOrchestra featuring megaphone vocalist\nRichard Rushton. The orchestra was introduced by Mr. Kenneth Gibson, that famed\nmusic rh all trombone artist Mr. Gibson's speech was beautifully delivered and accepted with rapture by the audience. After\ntuning up, the orchestra went into \"7 got\nplenty of nutting* \" in their controlled pure\njazz style- After a \"Vamp till ready\" Mr. Rushton entered and sang the vocal refrain,\nin his own unique manner. Then came an\nintensely moving minor passage played by\nMr. Gibson. The number finished with an\nexciting tutti from the whole orchestra,\nplayed at double tempo. Rimshot Gold Stars\ngo to Mr. Dave Cain (piano), Mr. Ken Gibson, Mr. Phil Cammernan (clarinet), Mr. Jonathan Higley (baritone sax), Mr. John Clint\n(G banjo), Mr. Leachin Thims (drums).\n(Thank you Mr. Thim!) and Mr. Richard\nRushton (megaphone vocal).\nThe concert was wound up by the phenomenally funky \"Jazz Consortium\", or to be\nmore accurate, 4/5 of the Jazz Consortium\nand baritone sax. John Higley was d epping for Walter Skinner- The group consisting of\nGibson (trom b.), Higley (bari), Rushton\n(piano), Cain (bs.) and Smith (dr s), ladled out\nsoul in their rendering of \"Dance of the Ungulates\", \"Moanin' \" and \"Night in Tunisia\".\nRimshot Gold Stars all around.\nAs a result of the Dave Cain Orchestra's performance, it is proposed to nominate Mr.\nDave Cain for \"New Star 1961\" in the\nDownbeat magazine poll. He already holds\nthe title \"Mr. Modern Jazz 1912\".\nTo finish on a culinary note, I would like\nit to be known that a superb recipe for trombone combination mute soup can be obtained\non application to Ken Gibson.\nRIMSHOT\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX by COLCUTT\nICoundi'l has met, and it seems that the\n\"good old days\" are gone forever. For Coun\nc il to decide that the long and tedious discussion of C. N.D. that they had last session\nwas enough, and that the decision they came\nto last time was the correct one, seems fine,\nbut oh, the manner in which this decision was\nreached!! There was a time when Imperial\nCollege was proud that it had no \"pro ced ure\", no standing orders, and that any matter could be discussed sensibly and in a reasonable manner. Of course this system had\nits faults; once the meeting reached 8 p.m. \"the few\" became so fired by their own verbosity that the whole meeting degenerated into a morass of loquacity. Yet this was infinitely pref e able to the melee of proposals,\ncounter-proposals, motions, counter-motions,\nand motions Ithat the motion be not put\nthat made up this last council meeting, ft\nis to be hoped that the President will be\nable to restore some semblance of sane ness to Council before the next meeting.\nWhilst thinking of C. N.D., it is worth nothing that the secretary to the S. C.C. re-ting that the secretary to the S. C.C. recommend Council to re:\nn state the C N.D., whereas in fact they asked Council to reconsider its decision. We realise how pro-C. N.D. is the secretary but surely this should not\naffect her reporting of the S. C.C meeting.\nWhat a scruffy lot I.C. students are! T was sitting in the Queen's one day last week,\nbalancing my lunch on my knee, when I noticed how beer-stained my trousers were, so\nI glanced around at the other I.C. students\npresent. Here was no ordered casualness,\ncreated for economy and comfort; just plain\nscruffy ness. Never have I seen such a collection of unwashed bodies, silly inelegant\ntight trousers, pointed shoes and untidy hair-cuts. Even the briefest of conversations with\na few of them shows that their in tell in gence matches their appearance. If this College is\ntrying to give a University education, then it\nis trying to give it to students who would have\nprofited just as much at the local Tech.\nThe Bedford Union is to charge the IC. Union \u00a35 for supplying the girls for the\nFreshers' Hop. I hope you all had your mo-ney's worth. Thinking of women, four ladies\nfrom the Guilds Union were seen on Morphy\nDay hurling clods of earth. A pity they did\nnot have stronger throwing arms \u2014 many\nGuildsmen still have dirty necks. Morphy\nDay was also remarkable in that the Hostel\nWardens were only seen in pairs. In fact,\nMorphy Day was a great sport day, and it also\nended the saga of the spanner. I hear that\nthe R.C.S. man, designated to plant the last\nclue on the trail has not been seen since he\nset off.\nThe trouser-removing Freshers' dinners\nreach their logical conclusion, with the sight\nof a trouser less Si Lyle wandering round the\nUnion.\nJudging from a \"Sunday Times\" report of\na \"Pi\" report, Mooney is not the only refectory manager to suffer from students with kleptomania. U.C. is having the same trouble.\nMax Finney, the Guilds secretary, has a fabulous filing system. No one else can understand it, but it all seems to hinge around a vast rubber ball, sitting in the centre of his\nhostel room.\nThe new Electrical building has been\ntopped. The topping-out ceremony was car-i ed out by the Rector, who poured in the\nlast bucketful of concr et, whilst the College flag and the Union Jack were raised. Rumours that the Jazz Band had been\nasked to render \"God save the Queen\"\nhave been denied.\nSEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS A musical is always a gay light-hearted\nfilm. SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS is\nno exception and si much more. Many musicals tend either to be mere frameworks for\nthe musical numbers or alternatively to have\na plot to which the sudden outburst into\nsong seems foreign. In the former you are\npresented with a cavalcade of music, song\nand dance with no linking story. In the lat-ter, of which EXPRESSO BONGO was a prime example, you have this sudden break\nin continuity and are i forced to wait five\nminutes for the, next episode, during which\ntime interest flags. In SEVEN BRIDES, Stephen\nVincent Benet's charming American backwoods tale \"Sobbin' Women\" has been so\nadapted t that the musical numbers enable\nthe action to be continuously advanced.\nAdam, the eldest of seven brothers visits\ntown in search of a wife. He returns with\nMilly wh i is dismayed to discover she must\nalso care for his six dirty unruly brothers.\nOn a family trip to town the six brothers\nfind six girls but the town's young men intervene and, after a fight, the brothers have\nto retreat. On being told by Adam about the\nRape of the Sabine Women they try to kidnap the girls and a preacher. The girls are\ncaptured, but not a preacher, and are snowbound with the brothers for the winter. As\nin all musicals everything sorts itself out to\nmake a happy ending. Memorable numbers\nare 'Spring', a glorious celebrations of the\nseason's arrival, and \"Goiri Courting\" in\nwhich Milly teaches the brothers to dance.\nA mention, of a few others emphasises the\ngeneral quality \u2014 'Wonderful Day', 'Bless\nher Beautiful Hide', and Sobbin' Women' \u2014\nall presented well by Howard Keel, Jane\nPowell and the brothers. Michael Gidd's arrangement of the dancing is of a high order\nincluding a gloriously exuberant Barn\nDance. This film is well directed by Stanley\nDonen, an experienced hand in musicals who\nwas responsible also for FANNY FACE,and THE\nPYJAMA GAME, and jointly with Gene Kelly\nfor ON THE TOWN and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.\nThe result is one of the best post war Hollywood musicals.\nA. J. WALKER The Guildswomen mentioned oy Coicut; left\nto right, Sue Livingstone, Thelma West and\nMargret Lodge.\nOPERA AND BALLET A frequent complaint levelled by the beginner at Opera is that it is difficult to understand what is happening on the stage.\nWhen the Opera is sung in English, even if\nthe translation is atri ne archaic, this difficulty is less acute, but even then the listener\nmay have some trouble following the plot.\nA case in point is Verdi's\"// Travatore\".\nHere one can only advise a careful study of\nthe programme notes before the start of the\nperformance or preferably the student should\nread a little of the musical background behind the work, as well as fa mih arising himself with the essentials of the plot by reading the relevant article in some standard work\non Opera like Kobbe's \"Complete Opera\nBook\" (A copy of which is in the Haldane\nlibrary.). Although some people will feel this\nis taking their pleasure rather seriously I am\nsure they will find the extra effort worth\nwhile in the added enjoyment and satisfaction\nthey will get from understanding what is in\nprogress on the stage. \"II Travatore\" will be\nrevived at Sadkr's Wells on Dec. 1st and subsequent performances will take place on Dec.\n6th,8 th,19 th and 21st. Recently London had the privilege of hearing Stravinsky conduct a concert version of\nhis own \"Persephone\" \u2014 a melodrama combining music, dance, mime, song, and spoken\nrecitation. Now Covent Garden is to stage\nthe same work (Dec 12th,13 th,i5 th and\n21st) in a triple bill with two c it her one act\nballets. In th d new production the promising\nCanadian tenor, Andre Turp will sing the\npart of Eumolpus, while Benosova will play\nthe role of Persephone. The choreography\nwill be by Fredrick Ashton, one of the Royal Ballet's most successful choreographers.\nAdaptions of Shakespeare's plays have always\nbeen very popular with Operatic composers\n\u2014 particularly Verdi who was responsible\nfor three. The most recent adaption of this\nkind is Benjamin Britten's\" A Midsummer\nNight's Dream\" (Covent Garden Dec. 16th22 nd and 26th), though how much of the\nundoubted success of the work is due to\nShakespeare and how much to Britten is a disputed point.\nIX.

If\nyou are interested, contact the Editor (Room 38,\nNew Hostel, or via the Union Rack) or come\nup to the Press Room a week on Sunday.\nli WtA to 1ht EdtfbL\nDear Sir,\nI decided last Friday to be a host at the\nR.C.S Freshers' dinner. The atmosphere was\nless bawdy than when I was a guest in 1958;\nthe wine was pleasant and far more suitable\nthan beer and the speeches were all quite\ngood, though I was a bit disappointed that\nthe Hon. Sec. did not seem to know any\njokes that were not risque. I was glad to see\nthat there were no exhortations 'to join in\nMorphy Day. I have never been able to understand those exalted members of I.C. who\nseem to consider such childish activities as\nfighting by a river, removing someone's trouser's, singing filthy songs or anything to\ndo with mascots as an essential component\nof the \"spirit\" of I.C. And as for those utterly meaningless chants beginning with such\nwords as \"Kangella\" or \"Boomalaka\", the it purpose is quite lost to me. It is chiefly among supporters of such activities that the\nideas that I.C. is superior to any other col-leg e, that U.L. U. is a place scarcely worthy\nof a mention, and that we are practically a University on our own, are rife. And how\nridiculous they are, we are little more than\nan overgrown technical college, where the\ngovernment has decided to train as many\nscientists as it can, almost isolated from the\nmore-thinking members of University life\n(e.g. at L.S.E.) and also from the majority\nof women students. I strongly advise all fresher s to go over to U.L. U. where they will\nget a chance to get the most out of their\nspare time, or at any rate to join in actively\nin the I.C. societies; but why they should\nbe expected to litter the passive River\nThames with struggling students, I cannot\nunderstand, can anyone?\nYours faithfully,\nJOHN D. WHITE\nDear Sir,\nAfter much consideration, I find the columns of Felix are the only place in which\nI can air my views on a purely academic\nmatter. I refer to the farc i al state of affairs\nwhich exists at present in the\" Physics Department, whereby a student cannot receive\nhis degree until he has satisfied the language\nrequirements in two languages, chosen from\nFrench, German and Russian, Surely a degree in Physics should be awarded on the\nstudent's proficiency in Physics, not modern\nlanguages.\nLet us suppose a student obtains the equivalent of a first or second class honours de-g ree, but has not passed his language test.\nUntil he does so, he will, technically, have\nno degree and, what is more to the point,\nno grant for postgraduate study or research.\nWhilst I admit it is highly dt sir able to have\nthe ability to translate a scientific text. I maintain that it is positively ludicrous to bar\n'a student from his degree because he cannot\npass a language translation test. If he fails\nafter three attempts, say, the language rule\nshould be waived. Better still, why not abolish it? The University of Manchester took\nthis progressive step two years ago and is\nstill producing good scientists.\nI myself am in the happy pos lii on oj having fulfilled the language requirements, but\nI feel deeply sy pathetic to those less for tun ate.\nIt will be interesting to see if any member of staff this and has sufficient sense\nof justice to take up the matter.\nYours sincerely,\nj. PORTER, PHYSICS 3\n[EXPEDITIONS \u2014 SUMMER1961] IC had three expeditions in the field last\nsummer \u2014 to Malta, Arctic Norway, and\nto Jan Mayen.\nAlthough the expedition to Jan Mayen\nsuffered a severe set-back, a small party went\nout later and were able to complete some\nof the gla cio logical work. It appears that all\nthe glaciers on the island are now advancing\nand the results fully confirm those obtain eu in 1959.\nAlso above the Arctic Circle,, four surveyors spent their vacation on the Oksfjordjokul icecap in the far north of Norway. Seldom visited before, the glaciers were found\nto have retreated only a short distance during the last sixty years. One of the glaciers\nstill calves into the sea \u2014 the only one in\nNorway to do so. A lot of interesting work\ncould still be done in the area.\nOn a warmer note, the Underwater Club\norganised a diving expedition to Malta. Here\neight divers relaxed in the waters of the Mediterranean carrying out Underwater Archaeology surveys. The area was mapped and a selection of classical pottery brought up from\na wreck (200 feet down) of the 2nd century\nB.C. All three expeditions were approved by the\nExploration Board and the Royal Geographical Society. The proposed expedition to the\nKarakoram has been called off for this year.\nProposals for f expeditions for the summer\nof 1962 will be considered by the Exploration Board towards the end of this term.\nThe closing date for applicants will be posted later.\nDear Sir,\nIn order to clear up a certain amount of\nconfusion regarding the \"Entertainments\nCommittee's choice of Sunday\" for the Guy\nFawkes Celebrations at Harlington, I should\nlike to point out that the purpose\nCelebrations is primarily to provide an alternative Source of entertainment for those\nstudents who would otherwise make their\nown in the vicinity of Trafalgar Square.

MORPHY DAY: BEST FOR YEARS\nThis year's Morphy Day, held on November 1st, was an outstanding success and the\nbest for many years. With roughly five hundred students on the towpath, some really\nfood-humour ed, non-destructive ragging took\nplace just about continuously from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. This is the sort of rag that has\nnot been seen at this College for several\nyears. On the water R.C.S. won the Morphy\nCup and Guilds the Lowry, while the towpath battle was also won by Guilds, mainly\nthrough better o gran is ation, for the numbers were just about equal.\nPreparations for the battle began very early\non Wednesday morning with the Guilds and\nR.C.S. Executives collecting rotten fruit,\nflour, paper bags, a six-foot diameter punch-ball (to fight over) and half-a pint of green\nink which was smeared on the hands of all\nthe Guildsmen taking part to avoid confusion in the heat of battle. Two parties of\nroughly 250 students each, suitably dressed\nfor the occasion, left Guilds and R.CS. at\n1.15 p.m. and travelled down to Putney by\nthe District Line on the traditional party\nticket for 49. Guilds had the disgusting experience of discovering a King's student on\nthe three carriages the v took over and had\nto eject him forcibly at Earl's Court.\nWhile R.C.S. were marching across Putney Bridge and Guilds were approaching\nfrom the opposite direction (they alighted at\nEast Putney), the six-foot punch-ball previously mentioned was inflated at a local gar-age, an operation taking twenty minutes and\nseverely straining the air supply. It was then\nbowled through and over the traffic down\nto the boat house, where the mobile mascots\nwere lined up. All three vehicles were beautifully prepared and were a credit to their col-'e ges. Well done the polishing crews.\nMeanwhile the mobs had arrived and\nformed up on the towpath a little to the west\nof Beverly Brook, and they watched the Presidents going through the ritual starting pro-ce dure. Lawrie Austin (Guilds) beat McPherson in the drink'ng race and thus qualified for first slosh with the twelve-inch diameter genuine Mooney lemon meringue pies\nAll near enough to see said that Law\nrie made a good job of it rubbing\nthe remains of the pie well into McPherson's hair and in reply Finlay made\nan upward sweeping swipe that drove a good\nproportion of lemon mer in gut up Lawrie's nose- These pleasantries over, the ball was\nrolled onto the centre-spot, and under cover\nof a heavy barrage of earth clods, flour bags\nand rotten fruit the two sides joined battle.\nThings were a little uncoordinated at first\nwith the result that the ball moved sideways of\nthe towpath, across the mud and into the river,\nleaving the combatants rather at a loose end\nwhile the ball was retrieved. The public-spirited gentlemen who swam after it included\nBill Macmillan. Dan Elwyn Jones and Pete\nYoung, the R.C.S. Vice-President who was\nsoaked already, having been deprived of his\ntrousers'and thrown into the river within thirty seconds of battle commencing. Having nothing to do for the time being, those left on\nthe bank proceeded to remove each other's trousers. Guilds doing most, if not all, the\nremoving.\nThey were distracted from this by the Lowry race, Guilds going by with a good lead on\nMines and R.C.S., and the crews were cheered\nheartily from the bank. The ball was returned eventually and the fight commenced\nagain. This time the Guilds pack had got\na grip of the technique necessary and under\ninstructions from their President at the rear\nthey worked together really well, wheeling\nwhen appropriate and slowly forcing the ball\nback to the R. CS. line, with occasional truces\nto dig out the unfortunates who were being\ntrampled into the mud. Finally, despite Miss\nDorothy English's spirited cheer-leading from\nthe side-lines, R.C.S were forced back to Beverly Brook and Guilds declared the winners.\nGuilds then had the choice of being presented\nwith Theta or the Spanner (which was\nof course in R.CS. possession) and they\nchose the latter R.C.S. dug it up from\nthe towpath where it had been all the\ntime while Guildsmen were chasing the\nlength of England for it, and Lawrie Austin led his men in are sound in e Boomalacka, waving the Spanner, now\npainted in purple and cream, above his head.\nAnother natural break now occurred while\nthey waited for the Morphv race to start, and\nsome desultory scuffling took place in die\nmud. Guilds again doing most of the trouser-removing and several sopping wet R.C.S men\nwalked back to the boat house to change The\nMorphy crews went by at last. R.C.S. having a clear advantage over Guilds and after\ngiving them vociferous encouragement the\nbattle-stained and now united mob returned\nto the boat house before moving off in a Ions\ncolumn that eventually stretched the full\nlength of Putney Bridge. By the time the\ncrews returned to the boat house there were\nonly -a few spectators to clap them in and\na couple of reporters from the national press\nwere still trying to remove flour and earth\nfrom their clothing. No doubt in trying to\ncapture the atmosphere they had caught\nsome of the barrage as well.\nThe return journey provided considerable\nsport R.C.S had lost their party ticket tit\nwas in the Vice-president's trousers and nobody knew where they ware) so Guilds generously allowed them to travel on their ticket They crossed Putney Bridge in single\nfile and crossed the road, the traffic courteously waiting during this prolonged opera t ion, and had a couple of brief sit-downs in\nthe road before taking over a train at Putney Bridge Station. The leaders astutely realised that the law would be at South Kensington (it was in fact) and therefore decided to travel to High Street Kensington.\nFrom High Street they moved on to the Albert Memorial where community hymn-sing-ing was enjoyed by all, and then a trouser less Mike Barron led an assault on Albert him-continued on page 2\n\n"

    "content": "There has been much controversy during\nthe past weeks in the columns of both Felix and Sennet over the disbanding of the\nI.C. CN.D. Group. The only common feature of these various writings has been their\ncomplete ignorance. It seems about time that\nthe basic facts were published.\nA motion was submitted in writing to the\nSecretary of I.C.U. calling for the abolition of the C. N.D. Group on the grounds of:\ni. Repeated breaking of I.C.U. rules,\nfi. Supporting the Committee of 100 which\nflouted the law,\niii. Failing to fulfil the concept of an\nI.C.U. Society.\nUnder the first head it was agreed that the\nGroup had broken nearly every Union rule,\nincluding carrying a banner with the name\nof the College on it. However, the same rule\nhad not been broken twice and disciplinary\naction rather than abolition seemed logical.\nUnder the second head it was stated that although (individual members supported civil\ndisobedience the society as a whole did not.\nIt would therefore seem apparent that the\nsociety was abolished under the third head\nof not being a genuine Union Society.\nIt was suggested that Council should not\nhave taken this decision but should have\nleft it to the S. CC As the S. C.C. is merely\na sub-committee of Council and all its decisions have to be ratified by Council, this\nargument is rather fatuous The other cry\nwas that the Chairman of I.C.C. N.D. should\nhave been informed and invited to the meet-ing. In fact the Chairman of the I.C.C. N.D. Group was told verbally that the motion was\ncoming up. In view of the seriousness of the\nmotion it would have been sensible and\ncourteous to inform the Chairman of the\nS. C.C. and the I.C.C. N.D. Group.\nAt the first Council Meeting of this session a motion was put by the S. C.C. asking\nthat Council reconsider its earlier decision.\nAs a reconsideration would imply lac k of confidence in the previous decision it was\npointed out that some new information was\nneeded. As no new information was for com ing the procedural motion \"that the motion\nbe not put\" was ca ried. The Chairman-elect\nof the ex-l.C.C. N.D. Group was present but\nproduced no information at all either new\nor old.\nIn order to clear up any misconceptions\nit must be understood that these decisions\nby Council are not disciplinary, but were\ntaken because the C N.D Group as it was\nconstituted did not justify its existance as\na Union Society. If the C. N.D. Group wish\nto be re-incarnated then they must draw up\na new constitution which will establish them\nas a society and merely a recruiting organ-is ation. SIR ARTHUR AC LAND PRIZE, 1962\nThis prize is awarded annually for essays\non general topics or scientific topics treated\nin a non-specialised way. A total of 25 gn s. is available for prizes to be distributed as the\nexaminers think fit. The competition is open\nonly to undergraduates and the closing date\nfor entries is January 16th,1962. Full details\nare available at the Registry.\nCommemoration Day was held on Thursday, October 26th, this year, and the Special\nVisitor was Lord Hailsham, the Minister for\nScience. In his report the Rector emphasised\nthe growth and vitality of the College. Of\nthe four great building! projects which are\nwell advanced, the Electrical Engineering\nblock should be finished by the Spring, and\nby the end of the year fresh demolition will\nprovide space for furthur buildings, including the new Biochemistry block. A Sports\nCentre is to be built in Prince's Gardens as\npart of the major residential and social development there, and new Parasitology laboratories have been opened at the College\nField Station at Silwood. The Rector concluded his report by saying that the College\nfailure rate continued to fall, especially among the women students, among whom the\nproportion of first and upper seconds is\nhigher than among the men.\nIn a long an d very polished address, with\na delivery reminiscent of Churchill, Lord\nHailsham made very few actual points and\ncommitted himself to no definite policy. Typical of his speech was this paragraph: \"But\nnow is research to be financed! Who is to\ncall the tune! And if the tune is to be called\nby the spirit of research itself, the logos\nas Plato puts it, carrying us along like the\nwind, what conceivable motive will be his\nwho pays the piper!\" However, the address\nwas entirely in character, for Lord Hailsham\nDue to a lack of experienced personnel,\npartly resulting from tragedies this summer,\nthe proposed expedition to the Karakoram\nMountains in 1962 has been abandoned.\nHowever, it is felt that there is\nenough experience in the College to\nor gain sea surveying and gla cio lag ical expedition to East Greenlad. The gla ci ology will be an extension of the work\ncarried out in Jan Mayen in recent\nyears and it is hoped that it will lead to observations in East Greenland and Jan Mayen in years to come. The surveying will go\nhand in hand with the gla ci ology and will\nprovide detailed coverage of an area where\nexisting maps are incomplete.\nWe envisage a party of ten, comprised ot:\nis by profession a politician and a lawyer,\nand it was very much a politician's speech.\nA musical divertimento was provided by\na small orchestra from R.C.M. and the singing was led by the l.C Choir. The ushers\nseemed to be drawn exclusively from the\nranks .of the Rugby Club, and looked unusually dignified in their gowns.\nThe Student Orator, I.C. Secretary Martin\n4 Glaciologists\n4 Surveyors/Climbers\n2 Botanists or 2 Geologists.\nExperience in gla ci ology and surveying ir\n-not essential, but people with knowledge of\nworking on ice covered terrain are to be pre-fer red. All those interested are in v| ed to\ncontact the undersigned through the Union\nRack. When apply ng, brief details of age\nexperience and interests should be given.\nIt must be emphasised that the expedition\nis only in the preliminary stages of planning\nand that those who go will be given a lot of\nhard work \u2014 plus a wonderful experience.\nARTHUR SMITH, JOHNS HEARD EAST GREENLAND "

C.S. won the Morphy Cup on Wednesday l st November for the second time in\nthree years, by the convincing margin of 2\nlengths over City and Guilds. At the star in\nthe first three minutes of the race, the cohesion and power of the experienced R.C.S. crew enabled it to take a comfortable lead,\nand at the milepost it led the Guilds crew\nby \\ \\ lengths with the Mines a further J lengths be bj in dt The distances between the\nthree crews gradually increased, and by Beverly Brook R.C.S., now striking 31 and rowing with a comfortable stride, led Guilds by\nnearly 2 lengths with Mines now trailing by\n1$ lengths. Content with their lead, the\nR.C.S crew virtually coasted home to a2 length victory over the now desperate but tiring Guildsmen, whilst the Mines crew\ndropped further behind to finish 3 lengths\nbehind Guilds. All three crews raced well\nand had Guilds not been handicapped by\nlack of training outings they might well have\nmade the RC.S. crew fight harder for their\nwin.\nThe Lowry crews were started promptly\nand Guilds, striking 37, took an immediate\nlead of | lengths over Mines and R.C.S. After 1 minute. Guilds had increased their\nlead to 1 length over Mines, with R.C.S.. now trailing by a further \\ length. At Beverly Brook the Mines crew had reduced the\nGuikJsmen's lead to i length and maintained\nThe season has opened with tremendous\nenthusiasm being shown by all members,\nlargely because of the one month sailing, pay\nlater plan.\nIn the points racing, the first \" B\" points\nwas won by Penny Howard, with Mike Stickland and Peter Hitchcock 3rd and 4th.\" A\" points was won by I.C. with Stevie Vines\nfirst Eric Twiname, a fresher, second and\nDavid Pentz 4th. The second \" A\" points was\nwon by Eric Twiname with David Pentz well\nplaced. The Commodore having decided that\ntwo many I. C.hel s men were appearing L\\ the front of the races removed one with a violent luff.a lead of a canvas over R.C.S. It was only in\nthe last few hundred yards that a desperate\neffort by the R.C.S. crew enabled them to pass\nthe Miners, but by this time Guilds, rowing\nwell together and with great determination,\nhad made sure of the race by \\ \\ lengths. The\nMines crew, which contained four novice\ncars men, eventually finished only \\ length\nbehind R.C.S, a very fine effort This was\na better race than the Morphy, although the\nresult was never in doubt after the first quarter of a mile.\nBoth races showed a wealth of promising\ntalent for the I.C. Boat Club to draw upon\n/his year and the club expects to do\nwell in its sphere of cone c tion later\non. The exacting job of selecting crews\nhas now begun and this year's first VIII\nshould be at least as good as last year's The first big event is not until the Head of\nthe River Race in March, although numerous other fixtures must be met and overcome on the way. The policy of the I. C.B.C. is to built a keen and fit series of crews that\nwill acquit themselves well in the Summer\nRegatta Season and this was stressed in the\nafter Dinner speeches on Wednesday even-ing. The Dinner was its usual riotous success,\nand emphasised the fact that the Boat Club\noffers a degree of social entertainment in addition to its normal activities.\nIn the three cornered match with U.C. and\nSouthampton, I.C. came second, even though\none member of the team left his boat in\nmid stream.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nThe second team match played at Peterstam on October 26th proved to be a decided victory for our opponents, Shoreditch.\nwho won 30-76.\nThe following Saturday the Club, somewhat weakened by the University match against Cambridge, put out two teams against\nGoldsmiths' Q.M. C. at the latter's home\ncourse at Dytchleys. The match proved an\nove twh el ming victory for I.C. \u2014- the final\nscore being 1. I.C.\"A\"18 points, 2. I. C.\"B\"38 points, 3. Goldsmiths 41 points. 4. Q.M. C.42 points.\nIWed. l st Nov. brought the second U.L. League I match of the season held at Hadley\nWood, Barnet United Hospital's course. The\ncourse was over completely unknown ground.\nThe race was won by Mike Heck (L.S.E,) and Pete Littlewood (Barts) with our first,\nman John Collins, third. John Cleator and\nJim Bernard also had a good race coming\n7th and 8th in spite of going off course. Despite I.C. being much weakened by injuries\nwe managed to win convincingly. 1. I.C.252,2. Kings 210, 3. Barts 209|, 4. U.C.162,5.L. S.E.1191. This now puts IC. in an extremely strong position at the top of the\nLeague.\nThe following Sat. 4th Nov. I.C. sent two\nteams to the Woodbury Road Relay at St\nLukes, Exeter. This was a new fixture quite\nsimilar to our own Hyde Park Relay being\nover a tough hilly 6 x2J miles. 23 teams entered being mainly from West of England\ncolleges and clubs with quite a contingent\nof U.L. teams. Pete Roy gave bur first team\na good start by handing over in 6th position-Ian Linkeleter, a fast improving runner, then\ntook us through to 4th. The next leg saw\nU.L.' s new star Farringdon, a fresher, take\nU.C. through from 7th to the lead while Jeff\nGreenleaf dropped into 2nd place. Jim Bernard took us back into 4th place which Paul\nClifton held in the next leg. By this time\nBristol University and Devonport were well\nin the lead battling it out with U.C. still\nwell ahead of I.C. John Collins in a superb\nrun brought us out of this situation with the\nthird faster lap of the day to give the I.C. team third place.\nIt is pleasing to note that some realy promising fresher s are coming to the fore as they\nwow accustomed to the extra distance, spec-tel mention should made of Chris Evans,\nJo Fitzimmonds and John Pereira.\nBASKET BALL\nThe College club continued on its winning\nway when entertained by Battersea College\nat Stepney. During the first half both sides\ntried to dominate the play, but the IMPS\nmanaged to press home slight superiority, and\nat half time held a2412 pts. In the second\nhalf the IMPS proved themselves the much\nfitter side, and capable of playing open attractive \"ball\". The final score was 86-30.\nAgainst the Metropolitan Police in the London League, we played terribly; nothing more\nwill be said with the exception that John\nRupf, our \"tame rebel\" from Kansas, has\nproved himself the finest asset the club has.\nhaving maintained consistent form in all four\nmatches (P.S.

This is now waiting to be\ncollected in the Union cloakroom-L HOCKEY CLUB1 st XI STILL UNBEATEN* The 1st XI have now played six games\nwithout defeat. Since the last report Dulwich II-XI, UC and Epsom have all been de-feat ed. We were perhaps fortunate to beat\nDulwich and UC. as the forward line didn't really \"link\" in either match. However, they\ntook their chances well and the defence performed admirably. In the Epsom match he\nforwards at last found their form and with\nthe defence once again emerging unbeaten\nwe had our best match of the season- This\nform was particularly heartening as this was\nthe 1st round of the UL cup when we once\nagain meet King's College. The team for this\nmatch is: Sham, Peters, /Sinclair, Skinner,\nJorvit, Anketell, Phillips, King, Carter, Panesar and Clarke. The result of the cup match\nis in the stop press. Should we be successful\non Wednesday our main rivals for the cup\nwill be the winners of the U Cv. LSE match,\nbut it is dangerous to make any predictions\nat this stage.\nThe second team beat Dulwich and drew\nwith Epsom, while the 3rd team lost at Dulwich a j jd beat Epsom. The fourth team however lost both matches and are finding it\ndifficult to combine together as the team\nchanges from week to week. On the whole\nthe club have enjoyed a successful start to\nthe season.

The return to College on ex-IC captain, Roger\nHarford, strengthens a swimming team for\nwhich high hopes are held in this year'sUL championships. For the first time in memory,\nthe outlook is more favourable for swimming than for water polo, but three teams are\nbeing fielded regularly and adequate reserve\nstrength is available.\nOn the first Friday club evening, the second team had a close win over a UC-I swimming team (37i to 36|), Godfrey and Cliff\nDavies winning individual events. The UC team was far superior in the polo winning\nby 5 goals to 1. The new IC first team playing its first match as a team, beat Barclays\nBank 3-1- Jones was impressive as a safe-keeper whilst Harford, Davis and Tedd combined well.\nAn IC team, depleted by the withdrawal\nof UL players, managed to draw a swimming fx ture against Cardiff University, Hennessy and Peggs being winners of their individual event. The home side fielded a strong polo team including a Welsh International and won a hard game (8-4), although\nIC had them down to 5-4 at half time.\nThe highlights of this term's program is\nthe IC I'nter coils gia te Carnival at UL U Pool on Friday evening, December 8th. The\nPresident's race .always raises a laugh and\nit's possible that the true form of certain\nICWA swimmers will be revealed for the\nfirst time.\nThe big question is\u201e whether Guilds' four\nyear stranglehold on the water polo cup can\nbe broken. This doubtful but it's no secret\nIC BEATS OXFORD UNIVERSITY(43) On Wed. 1st November, the IC Judo Club\npaid a visit to Oxford for their first match\nof the term. The contests were conducted\nwith the dignity associated with the older\nUniversity their Dojo being inside an old\nchurch dimly lit with delightful chandeliers!\nIn the first contest M. Potterill fought hard\nbut was eventually beaten on the ground by\nthe Oxford man. P. Williams drew the next\ncontest after a strenuous battle. The first TC\nwin came after John Milson quickly threw his\nopponent with kc+soto-gari. Unfortunately\nwe received a set back in the next two con-tests, Clive Cohen just losing by a was ari( half-point) and John Downing met the Oxford Goliath but was unable to repeat David's performance.\nAt this point we were losing by three contests to one, but Mike Wame quickly improved the position, first gaining was ari with an O soto-gari throw and immediately\nfollowing up with a kes agata me hold down\nfor the full point Roger Simons continued\nthe improvement first with tai-o toshi and\nthen ke saga tama. This brought us level with\nOxford on contests for the last contest between the captains of the teams. Our hopes\nwere i temporarily dashed as John Bowles\nsoon lost a was ari, but then took the advice\nof the Duke and set about to rectify matters.\nHe levelled the score with tai-o toshi and then\nwent on to win with kami-shi oga tame hold\ndown.
