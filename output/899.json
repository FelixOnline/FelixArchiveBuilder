The most\nvotes were cast for the post of President,\nwith 921 in total, of which55 were spoilt.\nSecond was Deputy President, with 850\nvotes. Third and fourth were Hon Sec\n(Events) and Felix Editor respectively,\nwith 832 and 821 votes apiece.\nThe results were; Zoe Hellinger for the\npost of President, Jonathan Griffiths for\nDeputy President and Steve Farrant for\nHon Sec (Events). The post of Felix Editor\nbeing won by Adam Harrington.\nMiss Hellinger won the race for\nPresident with408 votes, her nearest\nrival being Michael Newman with 183\nvotes. Deputy President was much closer,\nwith 494 votes for Jonathan Griffiths, and\n356 for New Election, as was Hon Sec\n(Events), to a lesser degree, with 504\nvotes for Steve Farrant, and 328 for New\nElection. The other convincing success\nwas for Felix Editor, with 614 votes for\nAdam Harrington, and 207 for New\nElection.\nZoe Hellinger was the only candidate to\nFrom the left: Jonathan Griffiths, Zoe Hellinger, and Steve Farrant.\ngain the support of the St Mary's voters,\nwith 135 votes vs a total of 38 viable\npapers for the other candidates. All the\nother candidates were out- numbered\nnearly two to one by new election in the\npapers received from the medical\nhospital.\nEditorial\nAround15% of the eligible voters at\nImperial actually completed at least one\npaper, as opposed to over 19% last year.\nYet in a recent survey conducted by\nmembers of the Felix staff over 8 0 % of\nstudents questioned expressed negative\nviews towards the Union.\nSo, they're over. The whole sabbatical\nelection caboodle is finished. Writing an\neditorial is all about giving my view on a subject. So here goes...\nIt sucks. Fifteen percent of you voted. If\nsomeone came up to you and asked you what you thought of the Union, what\nwould you say? I know from actually\nasking people that very few would say 'It\ndoes a storming job', or something along\nthose lines. Nearly everybody at this\ncollege complains about the Union: 'It\ndoesn't do enough'. 'I think it's a load of\nrubbish..'. 'What do they do?'. 'It doesn't involve enough students'. 'Who are they\nand what do they do?'. 'It's shit... it's uncaring and doesn't have the students\ninterests at heart'.\nThese are actual quotes from students\nhere, ie YOU. Yet, if you feel this way,\nask yourself: Did you read the\nmanifestoes in Felix? Did you bother to\nlook at the candidates posters? Did you bother to read their hand-outs? Did you\nbother to go along to the Hustings? Did you bother to vote? In short, did you bother?\nEach of those would have taken\nbetween thirty seconds and ten minutes\nof your time. How many of you can say\nyes to more than half? Judging by the\nvoting figures, I'd say more than 8 5 % of\nyou didn't. You didn't bother. But of\nthose 8 5 % , how many of you would\ncomplain if someone asked you about the\nUnion? Be honest. You don't have to tell\nanybody, just ask yourself. Then, next\ntime you feel like complaining about the\nUnion, whether to a friend or to Felix,\nask yourself if you voted. Ask yourself if\nyou tried to do anything. Ask yourself if\nyou got involved. Ask yourself if you\nbothered.\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of I he Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed at\nthe Imperial College Union Print Unit. Prince Consort\nRoad.
