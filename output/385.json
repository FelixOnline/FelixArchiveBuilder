    "content": "t Fi LIX Michael Williams\nPress Distortion during the NUS.\nAnnual Conference'.\nTHROUGHOUT the five-day confer-ern ce, reports appeared every morning in most of the national newspapers. Personally speaking I found it most disturbing\nto find that many of the reports (and in particular those appearing in the Tele graph, the Mirror, the Express and the\nMail) lacked any kind of real perspective\nconcerning the fundamental issues being\ndebated and the wide ranging spectrum\nof student opinion which was being presented . The distorted scenarios being\nchurned out by the Press( with the exception of the Morning Star and to some extent the Guardian) were disappointing to\nsay the least.\nThe most vulgar example occured\nwhen Charles Clarke, the National Treasurer, was elected to the NUS Presidency. At the Press conference which immediately followed, one of the first things\nwhich the national Press asked was\n\"Are you a Communist?\"\n\"No, I am a member of the Labour\nParty\" came the reply. \"But are you a marxist?\"\n\"Yes\" said Charles quite simply .\nLater on the new President est irn a ted that he was, politically speaking, to.the\nleft of Government minister Tony Bean, and that if there were further cuts in Government spending on education, then student militancy on the campus might well increase . It would appear that that was\nall the Press wanted to hear for the following morning, most of the nationals\ntalked sensationally about the NUS being\nin the hands of a left-wing extremist who\npromised a stepping-up of student militancy. There was practically zero reporting on the policies and issues which had\nbeen aired at the Press conference.\nThis kind of distortion was exactly\nthat which had been predicted by Mr\nFrancis Beckett, the NUS Press Officer,\nat the Student Journalist Conference held\nat Sheffield Polytechnic on April 2nd/3 rd: \"Newspapers do not openly tell us\nwhat to think about issues. They do\nsomething much more questionable: they\nselect what they think the issues are.\nNewspapers have the terrible power of\nbeing able to define the parameters of\nrespectable debate .The omission of just\none issue from a discussion can often\nmean that the debate's conclusion wilt\nbe* predictable.\"\nAfter seeing the distorted press coverage given to this conference, I am\ninclined to agree. As you will see, this issue contains\nan inserted advertisement from End sleigh Insurance. It is advisable to read it before\ndeciding to throw it away for although you\nmay already have some kind of insurance,\nEnd sleigh are quickly becoming extremely\ncompetitive in the student market. There\nare statistics- to prove it!\nThe winner of last week's \u00a33 Prize Vapation Crossword, is B. M.A.R oz ali,a Mechanical Engineering postgraduate.\nFinishing the crossword must have been\nquite an achievement since two clues had\naccidentally been missed out.\nI.K7 TK& S Horrible Hippies\n7 Saunders Road,\nSheffield, S2 5EQ..23 rd March, 1975.\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to the item\nheaded 'Horrible Hippies' on\np.? of FELIX No.383 dated\nMarch 13th,I have the postcard before me as I write and\nI can assure you it gives every\nappear n ce of being a genuine\ncommunication. The fact that\nthe writer gave neither her full\nname or address says ali that\nneeds to be said about her.\nAlso, she cannot even get cur\nnames right .The card is addressed to \"The 'Misses' Harrison and Ward\", although the\nother long-haired member of\nour team is called Higgins and\nwe have no-one called Harrison .\nThe ironic thing is that\napart from two of us having\nlong hair we were one of the\nstraightest-looking teams to\nappear for a long time! Three\nof us were fully equipped with\nsuits, collars and ties, and\nthe fourth (the one who \"does-n't even possess a shirt\")\nwas wearing a perfectly decent\nsweater.\nAs to how the text of this\ncommunication came to be\nknown to FELIX, I think the\nfact that a very good friend of\nmine attends IJC. and that I wrote to her recently quoting\nthe contents of the postcard\nmay have something to do with\nit.\nEEC\nDept. of Physics20 th April1975 Dear Sir,\nIt is good to see \" FELIX\" taking an active interest in the\nEEC Referendum (Editorial,\nApril 18), and no doubt there\nwill be much controversy on the subject in college over the\nnext few weeks. In particular\nthere will be poster campaigns,\nwhich brings me to the point\nof this letter. Posters at IC don't stay up very long anyway,\nbut it was noticeable that pro.\nEEC posters put up last term\ndisappeared, or were defaced,\nvery quickly indeed. Perhaps\nat this early point in the\ncampaign the President could\nmake a statement about the\n\" ground rules\" concerning\npolitical posters, and confirm\nwhether removal of rival\nposters is or is not a disciplinary offence.\nYours faithfully\nTony Jones, Physics 2,\nYour team gave us a very\nexciting game and ran us very\nclose, with the result in doubt\nright up to the end. However,\nwhen all is said and done, one\ninescapable fact remains.\nWE WON!!\nYours faithfully,\nRay Ward\n(Member of Hull\nUniversity Challenge team.)\nFELIX\n\u00a9 1975\nNEWSPAPER OF IC UNION\nEditor: Michael J.

L. NO LICENCE FOR IC RADIO\n(Continued from front page)\nIC Radio prior to this, but they\nhad opted for the second system\nbecause they were of the opinion that it would not give so\nmuch radio interference. However, it would appear that IC\nRadio intend to comply with\nthe suggestion put to them.It\nis understood that the \" leaky, coaxial cable\" system might\nprove to be the cheaper of the\ntwo.\nA spokesman for IC Radio\ncommented: \"We are extremely\ndiss appointed that the Home\nOffice did not inform us sooner.\nNevertheless, we shall be\nlooking into the matter\".\nFurther details regarding\nthis new development will be\navailable at the campus Radio\nAGM on Monday, 28th April,1975.

Despite the\nheavens remaining open all day they took the trophy with\nrecord scores and for good\nmeasure by a record margin of\n27 shots . Of particular note\nwas Ed Clutton who also took\na gross score prize. His play\nleft many observers awestruck\nand few would believe that\nsuch mature power play could\ncome from a Maths fresher.\nThe Daily Telegraph correspondent aptly described him\nas 'a long-hitting golf\nmachine'. The roles played\nby Bill Calderwood and John\nMendonca were hardly supporting and their scores left them\nclose to winning individual\nprizes.\nThe only side capable of\nkeeping the winning margin\nfrom being much wider than\n27 shots was none other than\nour second team of Bob Allan, Rich Brown, and Nigel Foster. No other side was in sight. Naturally we were all delighted with this result,\nparticularly since most of us\nhad left our home comforts in\norder to venture down to\nsodden Walton Heath. All the\nopposing teams had entered\nteams of four of which one\nwould not count in both\nmorning and afternoon (this\nallows for someone in the\nside having an off-day). With\ntypical boldness the IC\ncommittee only placed three\nin each team in the certain\nknowledge that none of our\nboys would let us down.

    "content": "10 FELIX\nNUS Annual Conference\n(Continued from page 9.)\nhighlighted the loss of national sovereign it y ana the serious restriction of economic\nfreedom which would ensue. Laws and taxes\nacted by the EEC Commission cannot\nenacted by the EEC Commission cannot be\nchanged or repealed by the Parliament at\nWestminster. One interesting point brought out\nwas that students in Norway played an\nimportant role in opposing the EEC during\ntheir referendum. Another was that the\nreferendum is weighted in such a way as to\nencourage voting in favour of continuous\nBritish membership of the EEC. The argument concerning the \" anti democratic' ' nature of the EEC was deftly\nextended into the area of big- business and\nthe anti-working class British educational\nsystem both of which the EEC would give\nsustenance. The 're negotiations' of Wilson\nwere branded as 'a sham*.\nAnd yet another NUS campaign is to take\nwing. Yet again links are to be sought with\nTrade Unions.\nOut of the eight amendments, only one\n(again from the Broad Left) was accepted.\nAmendments 7 and 8 were guillotined by the\ntime limit on the debate (they were both pro-Europe); amendment 6 condemned referenda\nin general and was thrown out; amendment 4\nwas tabled by NO LS and tried to inject too\nmuch dogma into the proceedings (it was\ntherefore rejected); amendment 3 called for\nthe NUS to remain neutral throughout the\nReferendum campaign (this was torn to\nshreds); amendments 2 and 1 called for a'YES' vote and were rejected; amendment 5\ncalled for a \"no sharing of 'NO' platforms\nwith racists or fascists\" line to be taken\nwhen campaigning for withdrawal and this\nwas accepted.\nOnce again, the campaign is to be \"broadly\nbased .''\nThe IC Union Delegation all ABSTAINED from voting on the EEC motion.\nDebate on Grants and Cuts. Thursday, 8.22p.m. lasted well over 3 hours\nAS IN much of the other motions, much of\nthe debating during this session was sectarian.\nThe substantive motion, which was thirteen\npages long, was proposed by the Broad Left.\nThe first amendment (only three-and-a half\npages long) was predictably a \"delete all and\ninsert\" one from the International Socialists.\nAfter this first amendment was squashed there\nfollowed a total of EIGHTEEN more amend-ment s, only two of which were accepted.\nThe main motion itself emphasised the need\nfor a continuing campaign over the discriminatory and inadequate grant system as well as\nthe cutbacks in educational expenditure and it\ncondemned the \"belt-tightening sympathies\naroused by the Social Contract.'' Several\nimportant points were noted \u00bb The Minister for\nEducation, Mr Prentice, has decided to reduce\nthe number of places in teacher training\ncolleges to 60,000 by 1981. Ome point made\nwhich, I understand, is very relevant to RSM is\nthat a student grant is paid for 32 weeks yet\nmany students are expected to study during the\nholidays. Therefore many students are \" full time students on a part-time grants\". Whilst\nvacation study grants exist, they are discretionary awards and can be very difficult to obtain.\nA call was later made for grants to be extended\nto cover the two short vacations. The governmental annual grant review was criticised since\nit considered only the level of grants and not\nthe basic structure of the grants system.\nApparently some students unions have achieved\nsome measure of success in the fight a gd in st the erosion of their grants by refectory and hall\nfee increases through the use of tactics such\nas refectory boycotts, rent strikes etc.\nOnce again the blame for the education cuts\nis put on the shoulders of the right-wing\ndominated Labour Cabinet which, it would\nappear, by eco nom ising on the education sector\nis attempting to help out big business. Means\ntesting received its perfunctory hammering .\nA call was made for colleges to incur a deficit\nrather than pass on price increases in refectories and halls of residence, LEA's and the DES are to be asked to take full responsibility for\nday nurseries and to finance them.\nIt seems as though there will be no more\n'Weeks of Action'. Instead, the NUS will try to\nconcentrate simply on 'Days of Action'. There\nwill be several of these during the first term of\nthe next academic session aimed at educating\nstudents as to the rationale behind the cuts\nand their effects.\nThe general demands which the NUS will be\nmaking include the democrat is ation of all\ninstitutions of higher and further education,\nthe implementation of the NUS grants claim, an\nend to cuts in teacher training, no increases in\ncatering prices and hall fees more frequently\nthan annually, equal fees for ALL overseas\nstudents.\nThe tactics which the motion calls for are\npredominantly organisational ones. Links are\nto be forged with Trade Unions and consultative\nlias on committees set up. Once again the\nident if i ably Broad Left tactic of \"good\ncommunications\" is prevalent. Campaigns and\nprotests are to be initiated with informative\nback-up publicity. Briefing documents are to be\nprepared and circulated to Trade Unions and\nconstituent organisations. All this goes to\nsupport the view of one of my Press colleagues\nthat there exists an old Broad Left adage which\nstates \"We must take the campaign forward and\nbroaden it\". The Trot sky is t groups were clearly not\nsatisfied with this Broad Left motion. They\nargued that much of what was being proposed\nhad been tried before with \"bugger all\nsuccess\". The International Socialists lor\nexample wanted the Executive to concentrate\non the development of mass disruptive action\nrather than \"pussy fooling about getting\nnowhere\". The IS amendment was consistently\ncouched in terms of criticism of the Executive\nand possibly for that reason alone it was\nrejected.\nOnly two amendments were carried: one\nrelated to the closure of Furzedown College,\nthe other to the exploitation of nursery nurses\nas cheap labour.\nAs this was the last major debate of the\nconference, a delegate from Reading took it\nupon himself to exploit the impatient mood of\nthe conference (the debate had already lasted\nwell over two hours). In proposing amendment\neighteen, he managed to use all the words\nwhich, during the course of the conference, had\nbecome meaningless clich es. Words such as\n\"struggle\", \" crisis'','' slump'' all received\nhysterical cheers and laughter. The amendment\ncalled for the President-elect to present John\nRandall and Steve Parry with a box of 'Hacks'\ncough sweets as a token of appreciation. The\nspeaker received a standing ovation with\nhysterical cheering. Conference then broke into\n''For he's a jolly good fellow\". The amendment\nwas nevertheless defeated however.\nThe IC Union Delagation all voted FOR the\nthe motion on Grants.\nEmergency Motions Debates Friday, 19.32a.m.( lasted two hours).\nSINCE THERE had been a total of\nseventeen emergency motions tabled for\ndiscussion an STV ballot had been held the\nnight previously to determine the order of\npriority in which the motions would be taken.\nThe first priority was the ABORTION BILL MOTION .\nThe motion condemned the James White\nAbortion Bill (which is intended to amend the\n1967 Abortion Act) as an instrument which\nwould undoubtedly reduce legal abortions\nand called for \"free abortion on demand from\nthe NHS.\" There is to be a campaign to fight\nthe White Bill which will en clude the distribution of a booklet entitled *A Woman's Right to Choose.'\nAll but one of the IC Union Delegation voted\nfor the Abortion Bill motion; Nick Payne\nabstained.\nThe second priority was the LANCASTER DISPUTE MOTION. This motion clearly\noutlined the situation which the students at\nLancaster University find themselves in. The\nroot of the pr bbl em is historical in that the\nUniversity authorities have refused to recognise the students union as a body with the\nright to negotiate on behalf of its members. The\nauthorities appear to be taking a tough line in\n\u2022the hopes that if they win then a precedent\nfor other colleges ana universities to take a similar line will be set. The motion called for\nlots of support, campaigning etc.\nThe IC Union Delegation all voted FOR the\nLancaster Dispute motion.\nThe third priority was the VIETNAM MOTION. This motion condemned the Daily\nMail and American sponsored airlifts of\nVietnamese orphans and the stand adopted by\nthe media concerning the situation in IndoChina. The motion pointed out that the\nInternational Red Cross support this view. The\nThe motion called for an end to all US military\nand political involvement in Vietnam, the\nrecognition of the Provisional Revolutionary\nGovernment. Resolutions are to be sent to Mr\nWilson and the US Embassy, as well as a message of support to the PR G. The IC Union Delegation all voted FOR the\nmotion on Vietnam.\nThe fourth priority was the CASH GRANTS MOTION. This motion noted the success of\nSt . Mary's College of Education in submitting\na workable cash grant scheme to the DES which,\nin a complete change of attitude, implemented\nthe motion called for this tactic to be extended\nand supported and was passed overwhelmingly.\nThe rC Union Delegation all voted FOR the\nCash Grants Motion .\nAil the other emergency motions were\nguillotined including one which was very tongue\nin cheek: it called for the NUS to mount a national campaign of solidarity with the people\nof Tottenham \" in their struggle against the\nreactionary clique of the Football League\nleadership.\" The motion would have called\nupon the NUS Executive to organise a refer en dum, \"binding on the Football League\" of all\nthe people of Tottenham on the question: 'Do\nyou think Spurs should remain in the 1st Division?' .\nREVIEWS\nRECORDS Jack Llewellyn\nTangerine Dream: Alpha Centauri (Super)\nTHIS IS one of Tangerine Dream's earlier conceptions( released in this\ncountry for the first time by Polydor), characterised by the absence of mellotrons. Whilst there are perceptible\ncrudities in the production (such as\nImbalance of the various parts), the\nscore is un mistake ably T.D., who were\nthen a raw fusion of musical Initiatives\nsoon to mature and produce such eni que classics as \"Phaedra \" and most recently\n\"Rubycon\".\nTangerine Dream create a unique kind\nof \" cosmic atmosphere\" with their music\n- only Pink Floyd at their most imaginative come anywhere near this particular\narea of musical sound. Whereas so many\nother musicians will search for gimmicky\nlyrics, a commercial tune ( \u2014 the lost\nchord?), Tangerine Dream explore the\nuncharted regions of musical surrealism\nby juxtaposing differently synth esl sed textures which are decorated with\nreverberating tonal clusters. The effect\nis stunning. Dionne Warwick\u00ae:\n(Warner Bros.)\nThen Came You\nTHE MAGICAL velvet lustre which belongs to the voice of Dionne Warwicke\nglows with a mature warmth in this, her\nlatest album. The presentation is much the same as it has been in the past: a backdrop of\norchestral depth characterised by a strong\npiano score against which the vocal line\nwinds its vibrant way. Nearly all the\nmelodies have been penned by the old man\nof soul, arranger/composer Jerry Ragovoy\nwho insures that his final product has a high sheen to it.\nThe best cuts to my taste are \"Who\nKnows\" and \"We'll Bum Our Bridges\nBehind Us\"; the former because of the\nfundamental strength in the simple triple\ntime signature and the latter because of\nits excellent lyrics. An obvious must for DW fans and a damn fine soul album into the bargain. Tangerine Dream: Rubycon (Virgin)\nWispy textures of white noise merge\nwith a synthesised background harmonic\ncluster supported by a mellotron textural\nbase and the latest Tangerine Dream\nalbum pulsates into life. Side one is a gem: after blindly\ngroping into a cloudy dreamland with\nsoftly floating concord s echoing in phase,\nthe music transcends the mood to become\na tense rhythmic phrase which survives endless changes of texture until, finally spent, it staggers and fades.\nSide two is equally innovative, if for\ndifferent reason. After a section reminiscent an air raid, a strong unitary rhythm\ndevelops. Then in succession it moves\non to dupl e, triple, quadruple, quintuple,\nsep tuple, back to quadruple and then to\ncomplex triple time signatures.( After\nthat I under stan ably get lost). As in side one, the tension finally fades as the\nbecomes that of an uneasy soli quy. Tangerine Dream's music is music to\nlisten to in private - it reaches within one and conjures up many images. No\nwords can do justice to this record: you\njust have to buy it to appreciate it.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX S THIS YEAR'S NUS Easter conference was held for the first time at Llandudno (in preference to Margate) du ring the period April 7th11 th. Here we present the highlights of this gruelling five-day spectacle designed to\nmirror student opinion nationally. MIKE WILLIAMS reports.\nThe new Exec\nThe new National Executive of NUS( with the exception of the Welsh and\nScottish area chairmen, who are elected\nelsewhere) is as follows:-President: Charles Clarke( Cambridge U., Broad Left).\nDep.P res; Alastair Stewart ( Bristol U., Broad Left).\nTreasurer: Hugh L anning( Birmingham\nPoly, Independent).\nSecretary: Sue Slipman (Inst.of Education, Broad Left).\nVP res{ Areas): John Webster (Architec-tura lAsso c., Broad Left).\nV.P res.( Services): Pete Ashby( Warwick\nU., Broad Left).\nV. Pres.(Education): Trev Phillips( Imper-i al College, Broad Left).\nV. Pres.(Welare): J ez Lloyd( Liverpool U., Broad Left). Exec. Officers: Pete Gillard( Leeds U., Int. Socialists). Rex Osborn (Inst, of Education, Broad\nLeft).\nJacqui Webber (Jordonhill College, Broad\nLeft).\nExec. Comm. Members: Perry Cooper\n(South Bank Poly, Broad Left).\nVal Coul t as( Oxford Poly,( Int. Marxist\nGroup).\nFrancis Hayden ( Bristol U., Liberal). Chris Morgan (St. Andrew'sU., Broad\nLeft).\n4* t tte structure of the education system.\nThe mandates listed at the end of the motion\nare more organisational in their application\nthan militant. It shows the typical Broad Left\nstrategy of approaching problems little by\nlittle, building up a strong base of support\nenhanced by good inter-constituent organisational communication rather than running\nheadlong into stubborn confrontation which\nwould make things worse rather than better. It\nis this which is the essential root of the\nTrotskyist jibe of \"wish iwa shines s\" so often\ndirected at the Broad Left. My own personal\ncomment would be that if all the mandates\nlisted are fulfilled, and all the CJ D.'S cooperate then fine . But I fear that the mandates\nthemselves are extremely vulnerable to\nExecutive complacency (this is really why Al Stewart was censured over Surrey's rent strike)\nand constituent organisation apathy (and we all\nknow what that means). But with a large\nmajority of Broad Left amongst its members,\nI'm sure the NUS Executive can prove my\ncynicism wrong.\nThe IC Union Delegation all voted FOR the\nEducation motion .\nDebate on the EEC Thursday l lAO a jn.( lasted in total\nabout 2 hours 15 mins).\nTHE WHOLE question of the Common\nMarket struck me as approximately peculiar.\nThere was never any suggestion that the\nconference should debate whether Britain\nshould stay in or remain outside the EEC; the arguments centred on just how the NUS\ncould best campaign to get Britain out!\nIndeed, John, Randall's opening speech\nseemed to pre-emp t the very idea of an in/out\ndebate: \"But my question tonight is not\nconcerned with the choice between staying in\nand coming out of the Market. My question is\nhow do we campaign and how do we express\nbest our opposition to the Common Market.\"\nThe substantive motion (one of the\nshortest, only two-and-a third pages long)\n(Continued on page 10,)\nTHE ELECTION SLATES\nAPART FROM a few odd exceptions,\nthe NUS elections were strictly sectarian\nwith nearly sixty candidates standing for\nthe fifteen Executive posts on a specific\nplatform aligned with a particular political group. Whilst this tended to help the\ndelegates' analysis of the candidates,\nsectarian wrangling, bitching and blatant\nslang ing often disrupted the proceedings.\nAs far as I could make out, the left wing\ngroups differed from one another margin-ally in their respective analyses of is sues and principally in the respective\ntactics they wished to adopt in dealing\nwith the issues, some being more extreme\nthan others.\nStarting at the extreme left of the political spectrum we have the Worker's Revolutionary Party (WRP). A biased critique of the election slates offered by\nthe Broad Left sums it up succinctly: \"No NUS election would be the same\nwithout the WRP Cassandras yelling\nabout the imminent end of everything. It\nis comforting to know that despite our\nwarts, the WRP will 'unconditionally defend us all from the attacks of the capitalist state'.We can walk the streets of\nLlandudno in peace: we have nothing to\nfear.\nIn the elections for the top four posts,\nthe average number of votes cast for the\nWRP candidates was around seven out of\na total of about 700 .\nNext in succession is the Internationa l Marxist Group IMG) .Before the elections, the IMG attempted to form an\nalliance with other ultra-left groups but\nthey clearly failed. Categorised by many\n(along with WRP, NO LS and IS) under\nthe \"struggle, struggle - crisis, crisis\"\nheading, members of the IMG described\nthemselves as revolutionaries. They generally commanded less than fifty votes\nin each election, but did succeed in\nraising enough support to get Val Coultas\nelected as an Executive Committee Memb er. On to the National Organisation of\nLabour Students ( NO LS). This appears\nto be a relatively new group on the NUS scene. The Labour Party Executive did\nnot, in fact, endorse this slate due to\nthe apparently undemocratic way in which\ntheir candidates' nominations were con-tri ved. They placed great emphasis on\nmilitancy but little else. Each NO LS candidate advertised their slate at the\nhustings inevitably inviting contemptuous jeers. In the election of the top\nfour posts, the highest number of votes\nrecorded for aN OL S candidate was\nthirty-one.\nNext we come to the International\nSocialists( IS).\nThe IS were predictably the strongest\nchallengers to the Broad left's supremacy\nin the elections and so understandably\nthe IS/ BL friction was often manifested.\nThe section on the IS in the Broad Left' s widely-circulated critique of the election\nslates shows'just how seriously the BL took the IS challenge for power especially the bid for the presidency by Terry Povey,\na member of this year's NUS Executive. In the elections for the four top posts\nand the four vice-presidencies, IS came\nsecond in all but one of these.\nMoving on further we come to by far\nthe strongest group in the NUS today,\nthe Broad Left ( BL). Often smeared by\nother factions of the Left, members of\nthis alliance of Communists, Left Lab our and non-aligned Socialists were duly\nelected to eleven posts on the national\nexecutive.\nThe BL is generally considered to be\nthe moderate alternative to the other\nTrotskyist groups.But whilst being the\nobject of contempt (envy?) for all the\nother political groups, no-one could fail\nto be impressed by the amount of preparation which the BL put into its candid-at es' election campaigns. The personal-is ed 'vote!' stickers were novel and on\nthe whole, the BL candidates (including\nTrevor Phillips) proved themselves to be\nshrewd election strategists .\nFurther to the right are the Liberals. Their joint manifesto \"The Piccadilly\nLine\" was at first scoffed at as unimportant. It was the BL who betrayed their\nconcern about them when they devoted\nnearly three pages of their election slates\ncritique to criticising the Lib s( by far\nthe longest criticism of all). The flattery\nthereby accorded to the Liberals was not\nentirely without foundation because in\nthe vast majority of the elections, their\ncandidates tended to come fairly consistently third. Their presidential candidate,\nFrancis Hayden, managed to get elected\nas an Executive Committee Member.\nStill further to the right is the Radical Action Group (RAG). The slightest\nmention of RAG at the conference produced a tirade of jeers, so one can imagine the fate which befell their sole candidate for President, Andy V allen ce Owen . Together with emergence of the\nliberals and the presence of the Fe der ation of Conservative of Students ( FCS, who did not put up any official candidates themselves), RAG constituted the\ncore of what the left-wing groups called \"the right-wing backlash\". V allen ce Owen polled a mere seventy-three votes\nin the presidential election, but narrowly*\nmissed getting elected as an Executive Officer.\nOf the remaining un aligned candidates,\nonly one requires mention: Hugh Latining,\nwho stood as an Independent Socialist after having a bust-up with the IS. It\nappears that IS wanted L anning, already\na member of the Executive, to stand for a post other than Treasurer. He refused\nand was thus branded a career is t by IS.\nSupported by John Randall( who, when\nelected, stood as an Independent Social ist), L anning pushed ahead and even*\ntu ally succeeded in beating favourite\nJohn Carr (Broad Left) who is UL UP re sident this year.

    "content": "4 FELIX NUS ANNUAL THE NUS Annual Conference took place against a background of rising anxiety\nfrom the left-wing over the emergence of the right-wing personified by the presence of\nthe Radical Action Group, the Liberals and the bogey-men of the Federation of\nConservative Students. But in the end many of the election pundits were proved right\nwith the Broad Left sweeping into power claiming eleven of the fifteen Executive\npositions being contested.\nThe conference itself was, at times, a pain in the rear to listen to. The highlight\nof the proceedings was undoubtedly the elections where candidates slang ed each\nother incessantly and raced to see who is the most verbose political hack alive. The\nBroad Left speeches were undoubtedly the most theatrical; the WRP speeches were\nthe most entertaining with every other word \"struggle\" or \" slump\"; but the accolade\nfor the best speech of the conference must go to Liberal Richard AHanach who had\nthe conference in hysterics with his dead pan delivery and tongue in cheek remarks.\n\" The Broad Left\" he said \"are a bunch of hot-house plants.We Liberals can survive\nin harsher climates\"He got a standing ovation.\nJohn Randall's opening speech outlined the four main issue which were to be\ndiscussed viz., housing, grants, education and the EEC. Due to the limitations of\nspace, it is just those four motions plus the emergency motions which were not\nguillotined into obscurity which are covered in this report.\nIn his very last speech as the President of NUS, Randall paid tribute to the NUS\nstaff and made a few semi-prophetic remarks about the future. He warned the left-wing\nabout the emergence of the right-wing. He praised Hugh Lanning (now National\nTreasurer - elect) for breaking away from sectarian politics and going independent as\nhe himself had done two years ago. His parting shot was aimed at the Broad Left.\" They may think of themselves as God's gift to the Union, but heaven help us if they\never consider that the Union is God's gift to them!\" Clearly the epitaph to end all\nepitaphs.\nDebate on Housing\nWednesday, 10.30a jn.( lasted about 70\nminutes).\nTHE PURPOSE of the substantive motion\nin this debate was clearly to put the problem\nof student accommodation very much in a community perspective. In the words, of John\nRandall: \"When we speak of the needs of\nstudents in private accommodation we have a responsibility to speak too for all those who\nfind their homes in that sector.\"\nThe motion itself spoke of the chronic\nshortage of housing for all sections of the\npopulation; the fact that there were too many\nproperties, both private and council owned,\nstanding empty; the discrimination exercised\nby landlords against minority groups such as\ngays, blacks etc. The law is being strongly\ntightened up to combat squatting, occupations\nand picketing. People in Northern Ireland get\na much rougher deal than those living in\nBritain.\nDid you know that in Glasgow separated\n(or divorced) women are held responsible for\nhousing debts incurred by their (ex-) hus-bands?\nOn the halls of residence front, some\nUniversities are now budgeting for a loss in\nresidence accounts. The UGC are infact\nshowing signs of paying for some of these\ndeficits.\nSome students around the country have not\nbeen idle in highlighting the housing problem:\nstudents at Bristol managed to achieve a moratorium on all new office development\nplanning permissions; students at Portsmouth\nsucceeded in public ising the irony of office\nblocks standing empty whilst the community\nwas desperate for housing.\nAgain and again the point was stated that\nthe responsibility for housing lies squarely\non the shoulders of both local and national\ngovernment. Members of a community have the\nbasic right to a place to live and students are\nas much a part of that community as anyone\nelse.\nThe motion called for a massive public\nbuilding programme; the municipal is ation in\nthe long term of all privately owned rented\nhousing: the compulsory purchasing (at cost\nprice) of empty houses by local authorities.\nStudent unions are to be discouraged from\nbuying property since it is not their responsibility financially or otherwise.\nShock of all shocks, the main tactic which\nthe motion called for was YET ANOTHER campaign (\"broadly based,\" of course and\n\"involving the student membership'').\nAdditional tactics include militancy e.g. occupations and rent strikes. Links are to be\nsought with Trade Unions to get their\nsupport. Needless to say, this motion trotted\nout of the Broad Left kennel.\nThe first amendment was put up by the\nIMG with support from the IS. It predictably\ncalled for militant action in a more direct way\nand was defeated. The next amendment came\nfrom the NO LS. Some how they managed to\nwork in the line \"we must national is e all finance companies and the 200 top companies.\" This amendment was thrown out.\nThe substantive motion was passed\noverwhelmingly.\nAll but one of the IC Union Delegation voted\nfor the Housing motion; Bill Gerrard voted\nagainst the motion.\nThe Rhetorical Void\nThroughout the conference there was\ncertain jargon which cropped up time and\nagain. Here is a short list of the more recurrent words:\nCareerist: Someone determined to get\nelected to the NUS Executive in order to\nfurther his own political career.\nCaucus: Group of electioneers of one\nparticular political hue. Sometimes just\na clutch of people making a nuisance of\nthemselves.\nCrisis: The present economic one which\nhas been caused by the capitalists.\nComposite: To collate all the motions\non a specific topic submitted by the various constituent organisations and then\ncome up with one huge motion containing\nall the points made in the original\nmotions.\nHack: An incessant slogan is er( q.v.). Someone who is incapable of arguing a point properly and who constantly resorts\nto an emotive, sometimes theatrical delivery of a speech in order to win supp ort/ Posturing: Striking an idealistic attitude\nwhich one in reality is not committed to\nsupporting. Prior it is e: To place on a higher priority .\nSlogan is e: To memo rise all the emotive\nslogans flying around at the time and\nthen sprinkle, practically every one of\nthem into every speech. Slump: This year's new \" in\" word.\nFirst manifested in W RP speeches. Refers to the current economic crisis( q.v.). Struggle: The hack's( q.v.) best friend. This word was so over-used that it became meaningless and subsequently provoked much jeering at its mention.\nDebate on Education .\nWednesday 5.13pm.( lasted about 90mins) THE SUBSTANTIVE motion was eighteen\npages long and was consequently impossible to\ndigest in the time available before the debate\nbegan . The points it raised were extremely\nwide-ranging \u2014 so much so that it lacked any\ncohesion whatsoever. For every sane point\nthat the motion raised, there were twenty others\nwhich fell into one or more of the following\nheadings: idealistic claptrap; \u2022 dramatic over-statements; cross generalisations. It was clear\nthat very little back-up research had been done\nin order to add weight to some of the claims\nunder the \"conference notes\" heading . The\n\"Conference instructs\" section was a wondrous\nbubble of demanding, condemning, organising,\nmobil ising etc etc so typical of the Trotskyist\nmotions. It was naturally torn to shreds in\nfavour of the \"delete all and insert\" amendment\none (co-proposed by ICU) which bore the\ndistinguishing trade mark of the Broad Left:\nslickness .By simply avoiding extremist jargon,\nthe movers of this amendment gained a clear\nadvantage and in addition, the clear, cohesive\nway in which the document was presented must\nhave made this motion a winner all the way .\nThe amendment (later to become the\nsubstantive) said that the expansion of\neducation since the mid-'sixties has been\nmainly in the area of technological and job-orientated courses and that this expansion has\nbeen designed to produce even more graduates\ntailor-made to become part of the big-business\nmachinery and thus contribute to capitalism.\nThe system is a very strong one due to the\ninfiltration of ' 'business interest'' into the\narea of education through financing research\nand representation on college governing bodies .\nThis is not in the interests of students, and\nmoves have been made to try and combat the\nsystem. It goes on to criticise competitiveness\nin education (i<e. exams etc) stating it res tr ict s educational opportunities and reinforces the\ndivisions within our class society. The\n'democratic' angle was worked into the motion\nby its suggestion that all representatives on\ncollege governing bodies should be elected by\nthose whom they represent rather than arbitrarily\nappointed on the basis of supposed interest or\nexpertise. Fine sentiments indeed. It also\nappears that students who have been prepared\nto stand up and criticise their course cirri cula have played an important role in developing\nthe cirri cula. A very serious point raised was\nthat in certain cases, research has shown that\nexternally imposed examiners tend to allocate\nexam grades in unchanging proportions \u2014 a questionably remarkable consistency each\nyear. This followed on from general remarks\nwhich criticise the inconsistency of various\nforms of assessment which can be detrimental\nto a student's academic perspective. Schools\ntoo come under fire as being in general more\ninterested in achieving a high university\nentrance rate than in helping their school\nleave rs with careers advice etc .\nThe attitude expressed in the motion was\n\"that the merging of educational resources\nwith added financial resources could lay the\nfoundation for a flexible and expanding system\nof post-school education which could include:\nopportunities for day release and part-time\neducation, a great expansion in adult education,\nthe introduction of re-training and bridging\ncourses, as well as expansion within full-time\ncourses.\" i.e. Let's have greater flexibility\nand accessibility . (One failing of the motion is,\nhowever, that it omits to say where the \"added\nfinancial resources\" might come from). A GREAT DEAL OF OPINION WAS EXPRESSED TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE CONTENT OF MANY COURSES ARE BASED ON\nAND AIMED AT THE INTERESTS OF CAPITALISM. So in order to combat this, a call was made to fight for the democrat is ation of governing bodies, to challenge the most\nrestrictive aspects of assessment; and to step-up the production of rational criticisms of\ncourses . On a structural level, a call was made\nto sever all links between educational\ninstitutions and big business. The motion\nstrongly advocated constituent organisations\npublishing their won prospectuses which would\nhighlight academic courses, welfare provisions,\nteaching methods, assessment, social life and\nthe role of student unions (including NUS).\nSuch prs s pectus es would form \" an alternative\"\nto those given out by college authorities.\nIn succ in t summary, the motion lists the\nfour fundamental issues affecting post-school\ntoday (and proposes that the NUS should focus\nits attention on them);\n1 .the poor level of finance for education.\n2 .democracy in education\n3 .the content of education\nThe Delegation from IC Union:\nTrevor Phillips, Nick Payne, Bill Gerrard, Paul Watkins, Chris Ko uro uni otis.

It's Big T!AT THE recent NUS Annual Conference at Llandudno,\nTrevor Phillips, the current\nICU President, was elected as\none of the four vice-presidents\nof NUS. Trevor, who beat off his nearest rival for the post by a substantial majority, will take\nup the job on August l st; it\nwill thus run concurrently with\nhis UL U Presidency. NO LICENCE\nFOR IC RADIO\nIT WAS revealed last Tuesday that the Home Office will not be granting IC Radio a licence.\nAlthough this is a temporary setback, it is nevertheless a big disappointment to the IC Radio\nteam who have been awaiting the Home Office's reply to their request for a licence for several\nmonths.\nMore Trouble at Lancaster \u2014\nFive Students Expelled FIVE STUDENTS, including the Union President, Dick Soper,\nhave been expelled from Lancaster University for their part in the 11-day occupation of the campus administrative block last\nmonth.\nOf the thirty-three students\noriginally charged, only three\nwere cleared by the disciplinary tribunal set up to adjudicate\ntheir cases. Five others were\nsuspended for a year, another\nfifteen students were fined\nbetween \u00a315 and \u00a330, two were\nreprimanded, and a further\nthree students given one year\nsuspended sentences .\nThe students involved are\nseeking legal advice and will be appealing to the three-iman\nappeals and equity committee.\nThose failing in their appeal\nhave the right of a second\nhearing by ProVice Chancellor Professor Austin Woolrych.\nLancaster students are\nangry at the severity of the\ntribunal's verdict and at a meeting held on Wednesday\nnight decided to stage an academic strike to culminate\nwith the NUS-sponsored\nNational Demonstration in Lancaster on Wednesday 30th April,1975. ICU Council have passed a resolution supporting the\nLancaster students and will be asked at the next Council meeting to make available\nresources to send students from\nIC to the National demonstration in Lancaster.

Well-known as the director of the immensely\nsuccessful satirical western \"Blazing Saddles\". Mr\nBrooks is in this country to promote his latest film\n\" Young Frankenstein\". He had the STOIC Studio\nin fits of laughter with his gags and antics. When\nasked why Young Frankenstein was filmed in black\nand white, he replied \"Somebody stole our crayons.\"\nPresent in the studio when the interview was being recorded were reporters from the Kensington\nPost and LBC Radio. They were continually asking how STOIC had managed to arrange it all and scoop\nthe BBC who interviewed Mel Brooks the following\nday, STOIC just smiled benignly.\nThe programme can be seen on STOIC next\nThursday at 1pm in the Union, J CR and Southside. It\nwill also be showing on ILEA Channel 7 at 3.15pm the same day.\n(Photo by Neville Miles).\nThe refusal, which surprised\nmany, was the result of a thorough investigation of the\nsystem IC Radio proposed to\nuse. Their findings suggested\nthat the system of several\nseparate transmitters, ( initially one each on Weeks, Be it and\nSouthside), each of which would feed a number of small induction\nloop aerials would cause too\nmuch radio interference on local residents' sets. The signal from this source would be\nproportional to the seventh\npower of the distance away\nfrom the source. A recommendation to IC Radio to use a system employing a\" leaky, coaxial cable\" as a suitable alternative has\nbeen made by the Home Office.\nThis system would give rise to\na cylindrical signal.

The end of last term saw a new Union Exec installed at 14,\nCromwell Place( which,\ncase any of you hadn't realised\nis the \" hangout\" of 200\n\" young ladies\"). In all, there\nare ten Exec, members \u2014 all of whom play an imp r tant part\nin the running of the Institute\nincluding being a vital link\nbetween I.C. and the rest of\nthe College.

What do you\nexpect anyway \u2014 miracles?\nO.K. then, miracles you will get!\nArticle seen in the local\nnewspaper reads as follows:\nIn the wilds of South Kensington there have been\nreports of strange things going\non. A new discovery has been\nmade in the celibate atmosphere of the world-famous\n\"Imperial College of Science\nand Technology\", after endless\nresearch and much heated\nargument. It has been decided\nto call the new discovery \"the\nIF girl\".\nIs it another revolution \u2014\nor is it just another story of\n\" boy meets girl\"? Don't Miss next week's thrilling\ninstalment!\nDEFINING PG ROLES\nALL POSTGRADUATES are In an ambiguous position but\nsome more so than others. This was the kind of conclusion to\nemerge from one of several workshop sessions at a recent NUS sponsored conference on post-graduate education held In Southampton. Delegates attempted to classify that diverse collection of\npeople holding one degree and\nworking for another in poly-technic s, universities or\nindependent research Institutions.\nRichard Upton\nThe first step was to\nidentify two end points of a continuum character ising postgraduate activity. At one pole\nlie the taught courses which\nrepresent an extension of\nundergraduate activity often,\nthough not inevitably, being\nfocused on vocational training\nrah ter than advanced education.\nAt the other extreme are the\nactivities of those registered\nfor higher degrees and engaged\nentirely on research on a particular problem. Some\nwithin this latter group may\nhave a large element of\ndiscretion in the choice and\nexecution of the work they dor\nOthers have little or no say\nin the selection of research\nproblems or the direction of\nthe work they undertake.\nMany (but not all) research\nassistants share this second\nposition with a proportion of\nthose on post-graduate\nstudentships, particularly those\noperating in scientific and technological areas. Reports\nfrom. conference delegates,\nhammered home the point that\nthere is no necessary connection\nbetween research assistant type funding and lack of control\non the one hand or research\nstudentship type funding and\nhigh autonomy one the other.\nThere was clearly some\nambiguity in the minds of many\ndelegates on the advantages\nand problems that might accrue\nif a higher proportion of research\npost graduates were to be\nfunded on an employed basis. While some were keen to remove\nthe charitable connotations of\nthe grant system, others felt\nthat employment would tend to\nreduce the research workers'\ncontrol over the project in hand.\nThis issue (among others)\ncould usefully be debated\namong IC Postgraduates at a forthcoming meeting of ICP GG( look out for details). Clearly the issues involved are not\nstraightforward since most\npost-graduates,especially those\nwho bear that label for more\nthan one year, are engaged in a complex amalgam of research\ncontribution, technique ac quis i tion and broad education. Let thoughtful discussion begin\n20tl jg> tube nt Bra ma j fast foal Steve Grove\n(Collegiate Theatre, Royal Court and Young Vic, April 6th12 th.) CONTRARY TO expectations, the Sunday Times National\nStudent Drama Festival is alive and well, and may be living in\nEdinburgh next year. While most people were under the impression\nthat the 20th festival was to be the last, Harold Evans, the Sunday\nTimes Editor, has said that he will do all he can to ensure that\nthe newspaper's sponsorship\ncontinues. A second sponsor is said to be \" waiting in the\nwings\", and will certainly be\nnecessary next year, when a similar festival will probably\ncost its backers \u00a320,000.\nFor many people, particularly those who attended\nlast year's festival at Cardiff,\nthe events of April6 th to 12th were rah ter disappointing.\nAlthough the general standard\nof selected productions was suitably impressive, there was\nlittle to captivate or enthrall\nthe audiences. Since selection\nfor the festival is based\nsimply upon \"dramatic effect-ive ness\", there can be no\nguarantee of a balanced\nprogramme; this year saw a preponderance of white faces\nand bare stages. What little\nnaturalism there was varied\ntremendously In quality; at one\nend of the spectrum lay a tired\nand shallow production of\n\"The Lion in Winter\", which only reached respectability\nthrough the capable performance\nof Nevin Harris as Henry II,\nwhile at the other end was, for\nme, one of the week's high-lights, namely a faultless\npresentation of Athol Fugard's \"People are Living There\" by\nBristol University Drama Dept.\nTheatre of the absurd was well represented by Keele' s polished performance of \" Le Piege de Med use\" by Erik\nSatie, and \"The Chairs\"\nproduced by Aberystwyth, who\ntransformed lone sco tottering\nancients into agile, whirling dancers.\nThe Festival got off to a slow start (in an unheated\nCollegiate Theatre) with an adequate but uninspiring performance from Bangor of\nBeckett' s \"Waiting For\nGodot\". It was not until the\nWednesday that cheers were\nheard in the theatre for the\nDrama Studio's brilliant mime-fantasy \"Prufrock\", based\n(very loosely) on T.S. Eliot' s poem. This was an Inspired\ncollage of scenes: Prufrock at\nhome, at the cinema, in a restaurant etc, each one\ndelicately yet precisely\nexecuted by a very profession-al company (incidentally\nfeaturing Vanessa, daughter of\nour very own Prof. Ford!)\nThe elusive (and virtually\nindefinable) \"Festival atmosphere \"never really established\nitself unit l the end of the\nweek, when the final performance of Wall Hall's \"Oh! Mr\nAsquith\" (a play about Suffragettes in a Music Hall setting) was assisted by a vocal audience who continued\nwith the show long after the\nactors had removed their make-up. This was followed by the\nBristol Revunions, which contained more original ideas\nin 50 minutes than in a decade\nof Smoking Concerts.\nStudent writing was thin on\nthe ground this year, much of\nthe new work being adaptations.\nMost noteworthy were two\nplays be Joe Richards (admittedly a more mature student)\nand \"God, Herbert, Donne and\nThe Devil\" by 19-year-old\nMichael Boyd, who described\nhis work as a nasty blasphemous, glib little comedy.\nActually it was a rather\npleasant and very enjoyable\nsketch about what might happen\nif the Devil went on strike. As a whole the Festival suffered from its tenuous\nnature; with nine plays at the Royal Court and Young Vic there was little sense of a Festival Centre. There were\nalso too many productions . . 3 7\nplays in 6 days puts a strain\non even the most fanatical of\ntheatre-goers.\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX\nPREC3 P3CE\nTHE SUMMER TERM is, as always,\nthe term of reflection, boozing, serious\nstudy, boozing, examinations, boozing,\nyoung love, yet more boozy and frantic\nlast-minute revision. An unearthly hush\ndescends upon the College, and worried\nundergraduates, laden with books and\npapers scuffle around muttering \" Must do some work now.\" For the Union, it is a time of consolidation and preparation; there are loose\nends to be cleared up, projects to be\ncompleted, discussions to be concluded.\nBriefings must be prepared for our\nsuccessors; hopefully, so that they are '\nin a better position at the start of their\nterms that we were, and don't have to\nspend half the year on bureaucracy; putting things in order; finding out how things\nwork; (then having to change them,\nanyway).\n\"(the Governing Body's decisions\non allocation of finance) ...are\nguaranteed to wring anguished howls\nof distress from students and staff\nalike...\"\nEveryone anxiously awaits the results\nof the Governing Body's decisions on\nallocation of finance. These are guaranteed\nto wring anguished howls of distress\nfrom students and staff alike; despite the\n\u00a3465m. UGC grant to universities for\n1975-6, the Government has again decided\nto chop the education budget by \u00a376m this time. Yet more evidence ot disastrous Government policy on public\nexpenditure.\nThere is good news and bad news on\nHall and House rents . The good news is\nthat the Student Residence Committee\napproved the negotiated deal of a75p rise in Halls, with no change in House\nrents. In the present circumstances, I regard this as favourable, compared to\nthe position when we started talks. At that time we were being asked to accept\nrises of \u00a32.00 for both Halls and Houses!\nThe bad news is that the agreement\nstands only for the Autumn term, on the\nunderstanding that a review would take\nplace only if the rate of inflation was\nsuch that rents could not possibly be\nmaintained at the new level. There\nappears to be a tacit agreement amongst\nVice Chancellors that they will increase\nrents in accordance with UGC self-balancing rules, rather than in keeping\nwith student grants.\n\"...perhaps the vice-chancellors\nshould stop victim ising students...\nand begin to use their much-vaunted\nstrength...in getting a decent grant\nfor their students.\"\n/( seems to me that this is a trend\nguaranteed to produce frequent (and\nsteep) rent rises, and with it, the\n\"spectre\" of yet more rent strikes;\nperhaps the vice-chancel lor s should\nstop victim ising students, as at Lancaster, and begin to use their much-vaunted\nstrength by getting the UGC to repeal\nthe unworkable sell-balancing rules, or\nin getting a decent grant tor their students\nI will be writing about the actual\ncampaigns brought forward from Llandudno\nnext week. The report of the I CUde lega tion will be presented at the next U GM, on Thursday May 1st( MAYDAY!), with\nrec commendations on it, for that U GM to\nadopt. Watch for Exec News.\nThe recent silence of the national\nPress as regards student affairs has\nbeen quite deafening. Before the conference the Daily Telegraph & Daily Express\nwere falling over themselves to attack\nthe NUS and to hail the heroes of the\n\"right-wing revival\". Where are they now?\n\"This makes the position of the\nmedia on students quite clear: attack\nthem when jou can - otherwise never\nsay a good word about them.\"\nPerhaps there is little for the\n\" Express\" and \" Smelly graph\" to attack.\nCharles Clarke, the new President, was, to the surprise of all the pundits, only\n29 votes out of 700 short of a first-round\nvictory, demonstrating his wide support.\nThe major issues discussed were Grants\nand Cuts, Housing, Education and the\nEEC and the Lancaster dispute, all of\ndemonstrably critical importance and\nconcern to students; thus the conference\ncould not be accused of irrelevance. The policy passed was, in general, good, and\nthe position of the Ultra-Left and Right\nTrevor Phillips\nwere overwhelmingly rejected, particularly\non the Education motion.\nPerhaps what hurt the Press most was\nthat the heroes that they had built out of\nRAG coordinator, Andy Val lance-Owen,\nand the Liberal, Francis Hayden, proved\nto be equally shallow, incompetent, and\ninadequate. Hayden crept on to the\nExecutive through the combined votes of\nthe Federation of Conservative Students,\nLiberals, RAG and some of the Ultraleft\u2014hardly a distinguished array of\nsupporters. Neither of these two worthies\ntook any part in the policy debates on\nthe bread-and-butter issues; they only\ntook part in elections. It seems that if\nthey want the support and respect ot\nstudents they must deliver coherent\nalternative policies on housing, etc.,\nrather than simply carving out careers\nfor themselves.\nThis makes the position ot the media\non students quite clear: attack them when\nyou can \u2014 otherwise never say a good\nword about them.\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT of yet another\nrise in the tuition fees of overseas students\nin universities and further education in\ncolleges comes as no surprise to most\npeople. Events of recent months, particularly fee rises imposed by local education\nauthorities, and a growing controversy\nover the number and status of the 80,000\noverseas students in Britain made it almost\nInevitable that such action would be taken\nquite soon. Mr Prentice, the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science, announcing the\nincreases for F.E. Colleges on March 18th, said fees for courses below degree level\nwould increase by around \u00a350 and that\nfees for other courses would go up by some\n20 per cent .These increases apply for all students, of course, but since students on\ngrants have their fees paid by their LEA, it Is particularly the overseas student who\nwill be hit, since most overseas students\npay their own fees.\nThe rise is only one of several in\ndifferent sectors of post-school education;\nperhaps the most notable of the others is the Increase in Open University tuition\nfees. All the fee increases are part of the\ncontinuing trend to cut back on government\nexpenditure on education. The results of\nthis policy have been alarming, and in clude the closure of several colleges,\nforced mergers, and the dropping of courses\nthroughout the country as well as an overall lowering of student target numbers, and\na drastic contraction in the supply of\nteachers.\nThese cuts have in general fallen on\nthose sectors and students least able to\nafford it, as in the case of overseas\nstudents. They have also meant a severe\nreduction in educational opportunity for\nalready disadvantaged sections of the\ncommunity, working people, women,\nimmigrants, and overseas students. It is, of course, no coincidence, that these are\nthe sections least able to resist such an attack effectively.\nThe increase to overseas students represents a sizable sum. All but a few thousand\noverseas students in receipt of overseas\nDevelopment Ministry bursa ries will be\nforced to pay it. Mr Prentice admitted that\nit would mean hardship for some students,\nbu tsa id tha t un i vers it ies and LEA's shou Id exercise discretion in these cases . The Chairman of the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals promptly pointed\nout, however, that was hardly reasonable,\nas no extra funds were being provided for\nthis purpose. This could result in a situ ation where many overseas students are\nforced to drop out of their courses for\nlack of funds \u2014 thus incurring an appalling\nwaste of the student's time, talent and\nresources.\nThis is the latest development in a recent series of moves which will\nquestion the right of overseas students to\nstudy in Britain, under the same conditions\nas 'home students'. These events include\npress articles, the setting up of a joint\nCVC P/UG C working party, speeches, and\nevidence to parliamentary committees\ncalling for a reduction in the number of\noverseas students (particularly postgraduates) in Britain. Possibly the most\nsignificant event is the likely capitulation\nof Bradford University Senate, (which has\nheld out against differential and disc rima tory fees for overseas students for eight\nyears), to \" economic pressures\". The NUS strongly opposes the differential fees, and is preparing to step up its\ncampaign to repeal them, in conjunction\nwith the Co-ordinating Committee of\nOverseas Students Organisation, particularly during the summer term and at the\nstart of the Autumn.\nIt is ironic, however, that the fees\nincrease may succeed in achieving the\nopposite of its aims. The financial saving\nis unlikely to be great, as the increase\nmay cause students to drop out, and is\nclearly a disincentive to recruitment .\nFurthermore, the aid to development\nrepresented by trained and qualified\npersonnel may be nullified by restricting\nentry to those overseas students able to\n. pay \u2014 the wealthy and government-sponsored. Thus prohibitive fees may\nactually negate one of the major benefits\nof having overseas students in Britain.\n\n"
