    "content": "No Salvation off or returned in a matter of days. Rob\nNorthey, Refectories Manager, said that\n\" it's been one of the hardest things I 've\never done.\"\nOf the stock purchased, 40 gallons\nof cream was returned and Imperial College Union bought some of the remaining stock for the Snack Bar. The remainder of the food was used by re plan ning the menus offered to the delegates.\nOut of the 67 staff that were to cover\nthe event 47 were laid off. All these were\ntemporaries booked for the week. None\nof the 14 permanent refectory staff were\neffected and 6 temps were kept on.\nThe Refectories catered for around\n2000 people a day instead of the expected 5-6000 originally planned for.\nThis number increased towards the end\nof the week as delegates moved away\nfrom using the catering facilities at\nWembley. The Salvation Army agreed\nto underwrite the losses as long as the\nRefectories made every effort to sell excess stock.\nMultiple Thefts\nIn the first three weeks in July the Salvation Army held a joint confer ance between Imperial and Wembley. The Refectories planned catering'for the Salvation\nArmy confer ance, held in the first three\nweeks of July, fell into diss array. Around\n2900 registered delegates from all over\nthe world attended the conference\ntogether with an English contingent of\nup to25000 on some days. Jointly held\nat Imperial College and Wembley Conference Centre, the expected attendance\nfor meals at the College Refectories fell\ndrastically short of the numbers that had\nbeen prepared for. Some of the food had\nto be sold off or returned and most of\nthe temporary staff booked for the week\nwere laid off.\nThe confusion was caused by the\nSalvation Army's organization of meal\ntickets for the event. The common practice of issuing tickets redeemable only\nat the conference venues was not used.\nBecause of the problems imposed by a split site and the large fluctuation of\ndelegate numbers, Luncheon Vouchers\nwere issued instead. This enabled conference attenders to purchase food from\nmany outlets in London.\nAfter 18 months of organisation\nsome of the large stocks had to be sold\nIn a series of thefts over the summer\nperiod to date the Union Building has\nsuffered a number of losses.\nThe Union Bar was hit with a total\nof \u00a338 being taken from the till. A camera belonging to the Bar Manager\nwas moved by the thief but not finally\ntaken.\nAn office rented out to International\nEnrichment,pic had a panel forced out\nof it's door allowing a cash box to be\nremoved containing \u00a3300. The burgle r did not manage to make off with any of\nthe larger items contained in the office\nas the hole in the door was too small.\nThe door has since been repaired but\nmore secure measures are being taken\nto safeguard this area in the future.\nTread marks similar to those found\non the soles of Martial Arts shoes were\ndiscovered on the forced panel, but it is\nnot known whether this was the method\nof removal.\nThe STOIC studios lost one of their\nvideo cameras during a daring raid\nwhich appears to have taken place while\nmembers of STOIC were present. The\nstudio is split into two rooms; a filming\narea and an edit suite. Society members\nwere working in the edit suite at the\ntime it is suspected that the theft took\nplace.\nDead\nPigeon\nA dead pigeon was found in a water tank\non the west side of Beit Quad at the\nbeginning of August. The body was\nalready partly decomposed and the matter was dealt with by the estates section\nwho repaired the covering doors. The\ntank was drained and disinfected.\nIt is thought that the doors were\ndamaged in the January storms. No\nhealth threat was posed as the water\ntank did not feed any drinking supplies.\n\n"

    "content": "Cell net Impact onIC On the 3rd August Cellnet, one of the\nportable telephone co one c ting com-p any s begin using a ground station based at Imperial. The deal organised by\nPaul Docx of the Impact group means\nan income for the college of \u00a325,000 a year.\nThe C02 and Nitrogen recovery\nplant in the basement of Physics has\nbeen re-organised to make space for\nthe operation and Aerials have been\nplaced on the roof of the building.\nInitially many of the research groups\nin the Physics department feared the\nconsequences of operating the transmission aerials due to the sensitive nature\nof their experiments. A number of tests\nwere carried out to ensure that no\ndisruption occured to research.\nDuring the initial tests some in-ter fer ance was observed in the Solid\nState Experimental department. The\nfollow up tests sorted out these pro-ble ms. Omni-directional aerials placed\non the roof to begin with are now not\ngoing to used in less the express permission of the college is first sought, commented Mr Docx.\nSome people had also been expressed concern on the health and safety\naspect of these aerials because of their\nclose proximity to the weather station.\nDuring a meeting between Cellnet, Impact, a Health and Safety Officer from\ncollege and a research student from\nPhysics, it was established that no\ndanger was present. The matter is now\nir rel event as these particular aerials\nwere not to be used.\nThe inter fer ance problems were\nsolved by using directional aerials facing away from the building. The Physics\ndepartment still has problems running\nsome experiments during transmissions\nfrom the embassies on Queens Gate.\nUnrregulated frequencies are used by\nsome of the embassies but no legal\nmeasures can be taken as the buildings\nconstitute for ie gn territory.\nMr Docx said that the decision to accept a deal with Cellnet was taken after\nmuch consideration. It was \" better\nwithin and controlled rather than\nwithout and uncontrollable.\" he said,\nafter he explained that other possible\nsites around the college area would have\nmeant the college being in the path of\ntransmissions.\nAsbestos Attack Crisis\nDesmond Heatherington who worked in\nthe Chemistry department for around\nfive years is lying in hospital suffering\nfrom Asbestosis. His condition, which\n'mushrooms' after nine to ten years was\ndiagnosed three months ago.\nMr Heatherington worked as a fitter\nin the department, often dealing with the\nheat exchanger s in the basement. He\neventually left the college five years ago\ndue to back trouble. During his service\nAndy Knight was sacked from the Union\nBar staff last Wednesday following his\nfailure to lock up the front door of the\nbar on the previous night.\nThe incident followed earlier\nin-action when he did not secure the\nsafe after closing up. At that time are prem and was issued and it was stated\nthat further action or in-action which\nwith the department he often complained about the spread of asbestos rubble\nand dust that occured during de scaling of the exchanger s. The contractors were\nrep remanded for the mess caused during there work but no further action was\ntaken.\nAnother employee of the depart-ment, Mr Alfie Winston, died three years\nago, after suffering for a long time from\nrespiratory problems.\ncould lead to fina cia l loss would result\nin instant dismissal.\nThe problem of several losses from\nthe Union due to thefts has highlighted\nthe situation. The Union President refused to comment on the occur ance as it\nwas a personnel matter.\nThe Union Office was in turmoil on\nWednesday this week. The main power\ncircuit for the front office was off due to\na tripped fuse box.\nAlthough a key was available that\nfitted the lock and turned it would not\nfully open the fuse box. None of the\ncomputers, tills or photocopier could be\noperated. Said Mr Shanley, the Union\nPresident, \"it's a nightmare, I'm just\nwaiting for Freddy to appear from Elm\nStreet!\".\nComplications ensued when- the\nphotocopier engineers appeared to service the machine. An extension lead had\nto be pulled through from the back office and when they were looking at the\ncopier they discovered that several parts\nwere completely missing.\nOn that point, high technology\ndoesn't seem to be the Unions forte this\nweek. On passing the passport photo\nmachine, two service engineers were\nseen to be in action. Acting much like\ngynecologists, one turned to the other\nand said \"let's face it, it's fucked inn it\". Assistant Sacked\n\n"

    "content": "ec Friday 17th August\nIssue 874\nNewHall in Ealing The site of the new hall in South Ealing which will provide 405 new\nstudent places. Originally required to be available for some students\nfrom the beginning of October, the first residents will now be moving in at the end of this year.\nA new development, situated in South Ealing, has been bought by Imperial. At a cost I of around SI 1 Million in total the site will eventually provide 405 student places that are\nmuch needed. Funding for the enterprise will come from the sale of Montpellier Hall.\nIt is expected that this sale will raise between &7M and S10M at current market values.\nThe finance deal has yet to be finalised but will involve an effective cash and either mor- UPji\nt gage or lease back arrangement. The funds from the sale of Montpellier are also intended JffV\nto allow money to be used for 'planned improvements and additions to other College\nproperty.'. The sale of Montpellier Hall means the loss of dedicated ac coma dati on/ '\u2022J**.' for Postgraduates. Plans to re-house them in the Old Hostel, Beit, have met with jtf r \u00a3*.i?> concerns from within Sherfield. The worry is about the reaction of Postgraduates to\nthe new, less adequate ac coma dati on represented by Beit. Also there is a problem from noise coming from the Union Building, particularly during term time.\nThe deal comes at a time when the cost of local ac coma dati on available tO/t students is escalating beyond their means. Especially with the loss of benefits\nwith the introduction of the Poll Tax. A number of the leases on other college residences are also coming up for renewal and it is unlikely that the\nCollege will be able to afford new leases, even if the options are available.\n\n"

The entry procedure used by the thief was similar to\nthat of the break - in at the Union office\non the 28th January and it is believed\nthat the two cases are related. In both\nincidences beading from around a window was removed and the glass taken\nout.\nA good set of prints have been taken\nfrom the glass and the Police are confident of finding the culprit.

The theft was\ndiscovered on Monday 2nd July, but it\nis possible that the crime was\nperpetrated up to two weeks earlier.\nMr Geoff Reeves, Chief Security Officer, said that the safe had been opened with the key. The suspect obviously\nhad a good knowledge of the working\npractices of the department, as the\ncrucibles are only used, on average,\nevery two weeks.\nThe crucibles, used for reaction\nSacked\nLaurens Alexander, the Bookstore\nManager, was sacked on Saturday 28th July, after only five and a half days of\nemployment. His dismissal was due to\n'unacceptable conduct' which included\nturning up late to work.\nAt the start of his appointment Mr\nAlexander took out a \u00a3200 advance and\nChemical Engineering and Honorary\nSecretary, Murray Williamson, gained a22 in Mechanical Engineering.\nChris Stapleton, Felix Editor, failed\nto pass his final year in Aeronautics and\ntesting due to their inert properties, have\na scape value of \u00a310,000. Insurance on\nthe safe will cover the loss. Procedures\nfor obtaining the safe key are being looked at.\nThe Police have been issuing\nstatements to metal dealers requesting\nthem to be on the look out for any\nsuspicious exchanges of platinum.
