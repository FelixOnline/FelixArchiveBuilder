    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY7 TH FEBRUARY COLUMNS 11\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nTony Blair had a rather uncomfortable interview last Monday. He was\ninterviewed by Daphne Barak, little\nknown over here, but a celebrity television personality on the other side of\nthe pond. His problems stemmed\nfrom the immense similarity between\nBlair and Clinton, and the accusation\nthat Blair had been cribbing ideas on\npolicy and presentation from the\nAmerican President. It seems that he\nwas being led into the trap, for when\nhe was asked what he thought of\ndescriptions of himself as \"the\nEnglish Clinton\" he replied that there\nwere \"obvious similarities\" between\nthem. \"I think that American politics\nand British politics are very different,\nbut some of the things are the same\nthat we're trying to do - putting edu-cation, welfare [and] tougher policy\non crime high on the agenda and\nbeing very determined to make sure\nthat our countries are outward-look-ing.\" He also denied being advised\nby George Stephanopoulos but\nemphasised again his close relations\nwith the Democrats.\nSince the debacle in 1992 when the\nConservatives sent strategists and\nadvisers to help the Republicans\n(many Tories were shocked by such\nobviously crass behaviour) the new\nClinton administration has had\ndecidedly cool relations with Britain,\nonly warming in the last 18 months.\nClinton is known to want to punish\nthe Conservatives for their past\nbehaviour and has quietly supported\nLabour during the past few years.\nThe two men gave a show of closeness at Blair's visit to the White\nHouse last April when it was pointed\nout they are both Oxford-educated\nlawyers who married lawyers, with\neach pushing their respective parties\ntowards the centre-ground. Since\nClinton's re-election, Labour officials have been privately hinting that\nsenior Clinton advisers such as\nGeorge Stephanopoulos may agree\nto help in the Labour campaign, in\nfact many of them have been keeping\nin close contact with the administration in recent years. This enthusiasm\ndoes not seem to be shared however,\nas many White House insiders\nbelieve that the relationship between\nthe two leaders is not as close as\nLabour would like to think. This has\nmade Blair's humbling American\ninterview even more humiliating: it\nwould be difficult for the President to\nhave a great deal of respect for someone who is so desperately trying to be\nlike him.\nThe interviewer, Daphne Barak, had\nbeen scathing about the Labour\nleader, saying that she knew as little\nabout Blair after the interview as she\ndid before. \"Clinton is more than just\na hair-do. What ever his mistakes, at\nleast he has charisma. When I asked\nTony Blair what he wanted to do, he\nkept saying he wanted change, but he\ndidn't seem to know what to change.\nThere doesn't seem to be a message\nthere. He may be any average politician but I don't see him as a leader.\"\nThe same CBS programme emphasised other examples of Labour's imitation of the Democrats, describing him as \"Tony Blinton\". NBC got\nin on the act too, screening a cynical\ninterview of him to coincide with\nCBS.\nAlthough there is some substance to\nthese accusations from the American\nmedia - Tony Blair cut his teeth on\nhis plagiarism skills with Tory policies - Blair is probably more a victim\nof the Brit-bashing our American\nfriends like to perform occasionally.\nJohn Major has certainly had his fair\nshare with unflattering comparisons\nwith Margaret Thatcher and the usual\nabuse from the strong IrishAmerican lobby. It is probably better\nfor Blair to make these mistakes\nnow, for a failed attempt to suck up\nto the Americans doesn't look good\non any Prime Ministerial curriculum\nvitae.\n\n"

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 7TH FEBRUARY\nStudent Votes\nEnd in sight for\nAUT pay dispute\nPHOTO: ALDOUS\nFry up for the end is nigh! An offical picket at last Autumn's one day\nstrike providing breakfast relief for the demonstrators.\ncontinued from front page\nTrainer, maintains that despite this\nmany students are under the impression that they would receive a Council Tax bill if they did register.\nA second reason offered as to why\nalmost 2 million young people\nneglected to vote in the last general\nelection is apathy. Students who live\nin a world free from council tax and\nincome tax feel detached from the\nrest of the voting population.\nFrom birth until now, the particular flavour of political party in power\nhas never really affected them. The\nfact that they are now entitled to vote\nseems irrelevant when they are\nlocked away inside large academic\ninstitutions. However, students\nshould not feel like a tiny minority -all the political parties accept that\nstudent votes will be crucial in the\ngeneral election. The applies particularly to constituencies where the sitting MP has a slim majority and a large student pop ul a it on. Both the\nConservative and Labour parties\nhave identified twelve or more seats\nwhere their MPs could be ousted by\nthe student vote. In fact, Health\nSecretary Stephen Dorrell was\nreportedly so concerned about the\nstudent vote in his seat of\nLoughborough, despite a majority of\nalmost 11,000, that he switched to\nthe safer Charnwood. Luckily for\nincoming Kensington and Chelsea\ncandidate, Alan Clark, the\nConservative majority of over\n30,000 is likely to swamp any vote\nby Imperial College students.\nThe recent 'Rock The Vote' cam-pa ign, supported by the NUS and\nvarious celebrities, was aimed to\nencourage students to vote. The NUS\nis careful to be non-partisan, claiming that they \"are not worried who\nstudents vote for, as long as they\nexercise their right to vote\".\nEstimates suggest that around\n250,000 extra students have registered as a result.\nThe final reason is the growing\ndoubt expressed by some students in\n'the system'. Many students who are\npolitically orientated, and would like\nto vote, feel that none of the major\nparties appear to represent students to\ntheir satisfaction. With this in mind,\nthey would prefer to abstain rather\nthan make a choice which represents\na compromise. MATTHEW BENNETT\nThe end may be in sight for the long-running pay dispute between the\nUniversities and Colleges Employers\nAssociation and eight trade unions,\nled by the Association of University\nTeachers, which threatened to disrupt exam and admissions procedures for universities in the United\nKingdom later this year.\nThe dispute started in June 1996\nwith an offer of a pay rise to university teaching staff of 1.5%. This was\nrejected and in protest various boycotts initiated, including a boycott of\nthe Teaching Quality Assessment\nexercise. When no agreement was\nreached, the AUT and seven other\nunions organised a joint strike which\ntook place in November last year,\nclosing many universities completely\nand shutting down many departments at IC.\nEarlier this month, AUT members\nwere balloted on whether they\nshould take further action. The move\nwould have meant that exams would\nnot be marked and admissions procedures would be delayed, both of\nwhich were seen as very serious\nthreats to the running of institutions.\nThe ballot came back with a massive\nmajority of over 75% voting to escalate the disruption to universities.\nUnion officials met with the\nemployers on 30th January who\noffered a new pay deal of 2.9% for\nthe next two years. After this meet-ing, the first since June 1996, the\nAUT committee voted to advise\nmembers to accept the new pay\narrangement. A ballot has been sent\nout to union members on whether to\naccept the offer. If the vote comes\nback 'yes' then all action against universities will be ended, and the pay\noffer formally accepted. If the vote is\nreturned with a majority of members\nvoting against the offer, then the\naction against universities will continue and possibly be stepped up.\nOne major concession to the\nunions has been the support from the\nuniversities Vice Chancellors and\nPrinciples for the formation of an\nindependent Pay Review Body that\nwould settle future pay disputes at a national level. This has been avoided\nby universities for some time, and\nwas the major concession in the talks\nlast Thursday, as the pay offer did\nnot change substantially.\nImperial was always able to pay\nstaff more, and had indeed budgeted\nfor a pay rise of around 4% for its\nstaff, but its hands were tied by the\nNational bargaining rules. Some\nother universities or colleges may\nfind it harder to increase the pay of\nexisting staff, but some of the pressure was alleviated with an increase\nof funding for higher education in the\nNovember budget. Many had\nthought that there would be a cut in\nfunding, which was why the first pay\noffer was so low.\n\"\n^\n^\n^ '\n^\nL^ \u2014\nLM jr**^^ J^'' l of^^^ M^^i ft,' 'Hjfc'' -^\nJ L'\"^f*\"^T^^ ff^ ^%t^\"^T^\"^T^\"^^^\"^ t1\"^^^\"^^^^ Tt* ^^r\"\"^1^\"^^^\"^1^^ ft~ '^1^\nAre You Interested in\nbeing Seriously Involved\nin how the College Halls\nare Run Next Year??!\nGotttact the Warden a \u00a3 t ke eMail 4fau one w teA e& ted ui\nt tAx U abi auM Zdf, j psi an ap^Jjxxdioti\nto. baa (le-AfLfb!!\n9if tUA, jj eel that t f&u, have, tk ede A i/ ie ami px dew ti al then make\n<i uAe qm t/i completed ap^xL oat ix m Uteceiuedluj, 1 Matek 1997 at\nt ke latent. 2)OH 't delay, avid let\nthe oy p^x^ itA^^t^,<p& AA,you hy,!!\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY7 TH FEBRUARY I shall deal with the very important\nbusiness first. Due to a technical\nerror last week, the thrust of my final\npoint about Southside became a tad\ngarbled. The piece as written implies\nthat I am advocating the consumption of cream beers, such as Caffreys.\nNothing could be further from the\ntruth. These insidious creations are\nthe bodily fluids of Beelzebub him-self. Wouldn't touch them with a barge pole, mate. I was, of course,\nreferring to the unsurpassed range of\nproper real ales on offer. I thought I better make that clear, lest anyone\nthink I have taken leave of my senses (no sniggering at the back, thank\nyou).\nIt would seem that the Library is the\ncentre of attention once again for all\nthe wrong reasons. First we had the\nwater leak that knocked out the electrical supply to Sherfield. My dear\nfriend Keith Reynolds, Head of Fire\nand Security, said that this presented\nno danger. No Danger? Did not the\nloss of power and subsequent battery\nexhaustion mean that the Chemistry\nexplosion was not indicated in\nSherfield? This is not the first time\nthat his comments looks unnerving.\nA reassurance from Mr Reynolds\nusually leads me to assume the foetus\nposition under a stout table and pray\nfor salvation. The other problem concerns the closure. This has understandably irritated our biological\nfriends, coming as it does in their\nrevision period. On a personal level,\nmy degree of sympathy for them is\nslightly reduced by the racket I had to\n2 \u00a3 in \u00a3 Simon Baker\nsummer caused\nnot by the\nbuilders but said\nstudents; regular\nreaders will\nremember that\nthis prompted the\nmobile phone\nban.\nNevertheless,\nthey have a valid\npoint.

The\nwhole project timing has been a shambles. While it would be naive to\nexpect no inconvenience, the major\nworks could have been organised a little better. Exam dates are, give or\ntake a day or two, written in stone. It\nis not therefore unreasonable to\nexpect the boys and girls at Schal and\nCollege Estates to take them into\naccount.\nIf the project had started a mere\nmonth earlier this would have coincided with\nChristmas, a slack period for\nthe library.\nSurely one of the\n200-plus people\nin Estates could\nhave realised this\n(I deliberately\ninclude all of\nthem, not just the\nmanagement). Of\nSchal Project\nMismanagement,\nI suppose this is\npar for the\ncourse.

I would love\nto know what their management fee\nis for all this, but suspect that no one\nIt was nice to see that the Europe\ndebate has become fractionally less\nhazy, with speeches from Robin\nCook, espousing EMU, and John\nMajor going as far in the opposite\ndirection as Ken Clarke will allow\nhim. Make no mistake, the man who\ndecides EU policy in the Cabinet is\nnot the Prime Minister.\nIf the debate continues, the public\nwill at last have some sort of choice\non what could be the most important\ndecision taken since the War. It also\nthrows the Conservatives a lifeline.\nEvery poll conducted indicates widespread public opposition to closer\nunion, both here and abroad. Though\nmost should be taken with a large\npinch of the white stuff, the trend is\nclear.

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY7 TH FEBRUARY FELIX SPORT\nGrubby Miners on strike as The Slags\nheap on the humiliation\nFOOTBALL\nWith the seconds glorious run of two\nwins stopped dead in its tracks by St\nMary's on Wednesday, the signs\nlooked ominous for our heroes. The\nopposition were the league leaders,\nRoyal School of Mines, who had\nwon nine out of ten thus far; two of\nour centre-halves were out due to\nexam stress; and our goalkeeper crisis was still unresolved. Everything\npointed to a drubbing, but there are\nno easy matches against \"The Slags.\"\nOur most pressing problem was\nthe lack of goalie (especially as RS M had sporting ly sent home a spare\nkeeper to prevent him playing for us)\nand so volunteers were asked for.\nWith even the mighty Robo balking\nat this challenge, there was only one\nman brave enough to don the gloves\nof destiny for what was surely to be a siege of the IC goal. That man was\nAndy - about the shortest player\nthere and someone who had never\nplayed in goal. Truly this was a day\nwhen he would have to dig deep and\nshow the world his mettle.\nThe first twenty minutes confirmed that this was going to be a tough match. Our midfield was being\npulled apart by the slick passing and\nmovement of RSM. Solid defending\nfrom German and captain Steve\ncould only stem the flow so much\nand the grubby miners managed several shots on goal. Each time,\nthough, with the ball whistling\nthrough the air on an seemingly\nunstoppable course for the back of\nour net, from out of nowhere flew a blur of blue to intercept and disarm\nthe missile. Andy was a revelation in\ngoal - \"inspired\" doesn't really do his\nperformance credit. With an uncanny\nknack of perfect positioning and\nBostick gloves, a few extra inches in\nheight and he could be playing for\nEngland.\nEven with Andy's heroics, we\nwere hard pushed to play a constructive part in the game. With the wind\nagainst us and the playing uphill\nthere was a real sense that holding on\nuntil half time would be an achieve-ment. This was not to be, however,\nas the miners broke and scored to go\nin leading at half time.\nThe second half started and suddenly we looked like a different\nteam. RS M were still playing the ball\naround well, but now so were we.\nGood use of the full-backs Phil and\nLoz to bring the ball out from short\ngoal kicks gave our play a cultured\nair that even the league leaders\ncouldn't match. The equalise r came\nfrom a corner. Throughout the match\nthe antics of the miner's 'keeper had\nus wondering how bad the one that\nhad been sent home was, but from\nthis one he excelled himself - standing watching in the middle of the\ngoal as the ball sailed over his head\nto be smashed in at the far post by the\nmighty Robo.\nThe momentum of our play was\ntaken away as RS M were awarded a very dubious penalty for one of their\nplayers lying on the floor and kicking\nthe mighty Robo. The spot-kick was\nduly scored, but not by the player\nwho placed the ball. Despite this illegality the referee let the goal stand\nand we were struggling again. More\ncat-like heroics from Andy couldn't stop a third goal, and it looked like it\nwas all over.\nLuckily it seemed that we had\ntaken good notice of the article in the\nkit bag mag about coming from\nbehind, and the passes started to be\nstrung together. The miners seemed\nto be on strike as we piled forward,\nevery member of the IC team wanting the ball to run with at their beleaguered defence. Felix's mid-season\nrenaissance continued as he skinned\nthe left back time and again and even\nDave looked quite good as \"The\nSlags\" rallied for one of their gutsiest\nperformances to date.\nIn the end RSM were more pounded into submission than pulled apart\nby slick passing, as we were twice\nquickest in a packed penalty area.\nFirst Martin scored his obligatory\ngoal as their donkey of a keeper\ndropped the ball at his feet, and then\nHajo managed to keep his head as all\nabout him defenders were losing\ntheirs' (German is getting more and\nmore aggressive) to lob the ball from\nLoz's square pass.\nThe game ended with IC the moral\nvictors, despite the points being\nshared.\nIC lis 3 - 3 RS M Is\nEarly celebrations (and downright\narrogance) fail to halt Fencers charge\nFENCING\nImperial College Men's and\nWomen's First Drinking team won\nagain. Unfortunately, the women,\nafter seeing the men thrash the shit\nout of Nottingham, failed to match\nthem for total domination of the\ngame. What are we talking about?\nWhy, fencing of course.\nThe Men's team consisted of our\nteam captain, Master of Weapons\nCrazy Legs, Ray, Sebastian, Geezer,\nBabyface and Animal. Fights were\ndropped by Crazy Legs and Ray,\nleaving the score 7-2 to IC. Next\ncame the foil, with wins for Crazy\nLegs, Ray and Babyface. 7-2 again.\nBy this time the overall match was\nwell won, so certain members of the\nteam started getting a tiny bit merry\nbefore the match was over. Which\nfool decided to put a bar in a sports\ncentre? However, the e pee was still\nwon in a stunning final match win by\nCrazy Legs (again!).\nThe Women's team were Fire,\nEarth and Air (the men's team got\nthrough enough liquid to amply\nmake up for the absence of water).\nWith all three women fencing both\ne pee and foil, they put a good showing against a very strong opposition,\nto win six of their fights.\nThe next match for the men (who\npresent an excellent chance of winning the BUS A team event) is\nagainst Manchester or Bradford, and\nwith luck a full team will turn out as\neach round will be harder - so be\ntheir Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n(the foil twins).\nRESULTS\nMEN'S FOOTBALL IC I35 QMW I IC II 3 - 3 RSM I IC III 1 - 3 King's II\nIC IV 3 - 2 QMWC V IC V03 King'sV WOMEN'S FOOTBALL IC 1 - 1 St George's Medical School\nIC 0 - 3 LSE\nFENCING IC Men 19 - 8 Nottingham I IC Women 6-12 Nottingham\nWOMEN'S HOCKEY IC I10 Wolverhampton\nMEN'S HOCKEY IC II 1 - 17 Loughbourgh\nIC III 0 - 6 Nottingham\nSNOOKER IC A169 Warwick A ICB 13 -7 Warwick B "

    "content": "10 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 7TH FEBRUARY\nThe Saints are Down\nSimon Wistow looks into\na resurgence of cult activity on campus\nIn Felix 10711 wrote an article about\nthe presence of the London Church\nof Christ on campus. Apparently\nthey weren't very happy about the\nway I portrayed them. They also filed\na complaint against the BBC saying\nthat a recent program had defamed it.\nThe complaint was not upheld. But\nwhy do cults target Imperial\nCollege? Tacky as it may seem it\nmay have a lot to do with the 3:1\nmale to female ratio. Beer is expensive in Kensington and with precious\nfew females around the boys from\nIC, especially those away from home\nand under pressure from our notoriously hard courses become susceptible to the techniques used by the\nmind control cults.\nIt would appear that, once again,\nImperial College has been targeted\nby a cult. The Foundation for Human\nUnderstanding has recently\napproached students on Campus.\nArmed with the Cult's prospectus the\nChaplaincy contacted a specialist\norganisation for advice on how best\nto deal with the situation.\nThe A4 pamphlet handed out by\nthe F HU reads more like a Sunday\nSupplement advert than a manifesto\non faith. The first page boldly poses\nthe question \"Roman Catholicismjust another Cult\" and cites the example of the Right Reverend Roderick\nWright. It goes on to ask \"Does not\nthe deceit of these religious hypocrites again question the possibility\nof a greater two thousand year long\nhoax\". It continues in the same vein\nbefore switching to the artificial\nnature of celibacy, stating the 'gift'\nof copulation.\nPretty tame stuff so far. However a box on the front page warns\n\"the Foundation for Human\nUnderstanding teaches an observation exercise which permits you to\nbecome objective towards your pro b lem and allows your heartaches, bad\nhabits, fears and anxieties, to\nbecome completely eliminated from\nyour life without effort on your part.\nUntil you commit this practice to\nyour daily life some of what you read\non the following pages may be shocking or upsetting to you. But if you will\nread calmly and with open mind, you\nmay discover the key to the peace of\nmind for which you have been\nsearching all your life.\"\nIt might as well say that it also\nhelps you lose weight FAST, gets\nyou ripped by Christmas and shows\nyou how to bring a woman to orgasm\nevery time and have her ache for\nmore.\nMore gems in this surprisingly\nfunny publication include the wonderfully informative \"Understanding\nSexuality\". In this YOU can discover\nthe reasons why:\u2022Women are attracted to abusive\nmen\n\u2022Men use sex to degrade women\n\u2022People become homosexuals\n\u2022The reasons for marital infidelity\n\u2022Men and women change roles\n\u2022Men feel guilty after sex\nWith great trepidation I turned the\npage and read through the rest of the\nbrochure. The champion of the FHU,\nRoy Masters gives a lengthy dissertation on the conjuncture between\nScience and Religion. He points out\nthe similarity between not being able\nto travel faster than the speed of light\nand flesh and blood not being able to\nenter the Kingdom of God. The\n\"incomparably articulate\" Masters\narticle is randomly interspersed with\nadverts for Christianity today which\nurges you to purchase this \"unique\napplication of biblical Christianity to\npresent day conditions\" for a paltry\n\u00a37 a month or the special price of \u00a355\nfor one year.\nIn a move which is sure to make\ndie hard scientists slap their forehead\nwith a Homer Simpson like \"Doh\"\nour Roy EXCLUSIVELY reveals the\nexistence of the smallest particle in\nthe Universe: the org it ron. Unfortunately for scientists, they will\nnever be able to see it because \"it is\nunlikely that any electron microscope will ever be able to see it\nbecause it is so tiny as to be virtually\nundetectable; in fact it is so tiny, it\npractically doesn't exist at all.\" He\nalso shows how \"matter is simply\npress uri sed 'crystallised' pre-time\nforce flowing now in what has\nbecome a river of time\".\nAlthough all this may seem funny, there is a more serious side. As far as anybody except the cults\nthemselves are concerned, cults are bad news. A cult is defined as :\nTheological usage: (positive meaning) a style of worship and its associated rituals. This is the historical meaning of the word.\nSociological usage: (neutral meaning) a small religious group that exists in a state of tension with\nthe predominant religion. Hindus might be considered a cult in North America; Christianity might\nbe considered a cult in India.\nGeneral religious usage: (neutral meaning) a small, recently created religious group that is not a variant of an established religion. Often, it is headed by a single charismatic leader.\nEvangelical Christian usage: (negative meaning) most Evangelicals would define as a cult any\nChristian religious group which does not accept the historical Christian doctrines (accepting Jesus\nas Lord and Saviour, virgin birth, the Trinity, salvation through beliefs, etc.). The implication is that\nthe cult's theology is invalid. They might consider the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day\nSaints (the Mormons). Unification Church and Jehovah's Witnesses to be cults. But they would not\nclassify Wicca as such, because it is not Christian. The earliest use of this meaning of the word\n\"Cult\" is believed to be a1938 book \"The Chaos of the Cults\" by W.B. Ecrdmans.\nFundamentalist Christian usage: (negative meaning) Some Fundamentalists would accept the\nEvangelical definition of cult defined above. Others might brand any religious group (Christian or\notherwise) which deviates from historical Christian belief as a cult. This definition would include\nthe Mormon Church, Wicca, mainline and liberal Christian denominations, and all of the other religions of the world. Over 70% of humanity would belong to cults, by this definition.\nPopular, media usage: (very negative meaning) a small, evil religious group, often with a single\ncharismatic leader, which engages in brainwashing and other mind control techniques. Often used\nas a synonym for mind control cult or for doomsday cult. The earliest use of this meaning of the\nword is believed to have been in a1965 book by Walter Martin \"The Kingdom of the Cults\" (revised\nand expanded in 1985).\nHypnosis - inducing a state of high suggest i bil it y by hypnosis, often thinly disguised as relaxation\nor meditation\nPeer Group Pressure - Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to\nbelong\nLove Bombing - Creating a sense of family and belonging through hugging, kissing, touching and\nflattery\nRejection of Old Values - Accelerating acceptance of new life-style by constantly denouncing former values and beliefs\nRemoval of privacy - Achieving loss of ability to evaluate logically by preventing private con-temp la tion. Time Sense Deprivation - Destroying ability to evaluate information, personal reactions, and body\nfunctions in relation to passage of time by removing all clocks and watches\nDis-inhibition - Encouraging child-like obedience by orchestrating child-like behaviour\nUncompromising Rules - Inducing regression and disorientation by soliciting agreement to seemingly simple rules which regulate mealtimes, bathroom breaks and use of medications.\nVerbal Abuse - Desensitising through bombardment with foul and abusive language.\nDress Codes - Removing individuality by demanding conformity to the group dress code.\nChanting and Singing - Eliminating non-cult ideas through group repetition of mind-narrowing\nchants or phrases.\nConfession - Encouraging the destruction of individual ego through confession of personal weaknesses and innermost feelings or doubts.\nFinger Pointing - Creating a false sense of righteousness by pointing to the shortcomings of the outside world and other cults.\nFlaunting Hierarchy - Promoting acceptance of cult authority by promising advancement, power\nand salvation.\nControlled Approval - Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and pun\ni shing similar actions.\nGames - Inducing dependence on the group by introducing games with obscure rules.\nNo Questions - Accomplishing automatic acceptance of beliefs by discouraging questions.\nGuilt - Reinforcing the need for salvation by exaggerating the sins of former lifestyles\nFear - Maintaining loyalty and obedience to the group by threatening soul, life or limb to the slight\nest \"negative\" thought, word or deed.\nReplacement of Relationships - Destroying pre-cult families by arranging cult marriages and \"fam\ni lies\". The chaplaincy has, as yet, been unable to do anything and are waiting for more information before\nacting. If you are approached by these people or any other cult then please contact the Chaplaincy\non Ext 49600.\n\n"

    "content": "6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 7TH FEBRUARY\nAlan Clark, the new MP for K&C? NEWS TEAM Thanks to the drunken antics of sitting MP Nicholas Scott, the\nKensington and Chelsea\nConservative Association have been\nforced to select a new candidate for\nthe imminent General Election.\nFaced with a maximum of three\nmonths in which to build up support\nand popularity, this clearly is a tough\njob for any replacement - although\nSir Nicholas' large majority in 1992\nprovides a huge safety-net.\nConsequently, they have selected\nAlan Clark, a candidate whose very\nname brings instant recognition\namongst the voters of SW7.\nMr Clark, infamous former\nCabinet Minister and ardent\nThatcherite, retired at the last ele c tion, despising the successors to\nMargearet Thatcher (whom he\ndescribed as \"the most attractive\nwoman in politics\"). However, having failed to secure a peerage, and\nseeing the prosecution case in the\nArms to Iraq inquiry (in which he\nwas heavily implicated) collapse, he\nhas been chaffing at the bit to return\nto the Commons. He unsuccessfully\nlaunched a bid to become the official\ncandidate for the Newbury by-ele c tion in 1993, and has recently been\nscouting for possible seats for the\nforthcoming election - all without\nsuccess.\nHaving finally found himself a candidature (and, considering the\nsize of the majority which he\ndefends, a virtually assured place in\nthe next parliament) he promises to\nkeep the spotlight on Kensington &\nChelsea. His reputation, as an woman is er and impetuous radical kept\nhim in the glare of publicity throughout the late eighties, and was well\nfounded. His affairs were legendary,\nincluding one weekend when he slept\nwith a high-court judge's wife and\nhis daughter. His wife even admits to\nhis having taken his girlfriend\nChristina on their honeymoon.\nAlan Clark's career as a minister\nwas no less colourful. Whilst a junior\nminister at the Department of\nEmployment in 1985, he described\nthe Third World in somewhat un-PC\nterm \"Bongo-Bongo land\". His time\nEyes right. Alan Clark contemplating the future now he has secured\nthe Conservative nomination for\nKensington & Cheksea.\nas Minister of Trade, from 1986 -1989, included the Arms to Iraq dealings with Matrix Churchill, whom he\nadvised to emphasise the general\nuses of machine tools, rather than\ntheir specific uses in Iraq. Even the\nnormally quiet role of Minister of\nState for Defence took on a whole\nnew life under Clark, thanks largely\nto his dislike of NATO as a whole,\nhis ardent nationalism, and the outbreak of the Gulf War.\nHowever, Clark's appointment is\nalso indicative of the current shift to\nthe right in the Tory party, with\nClark's politics far more reactionary\nthan those of the more reserved Scott.\nSir Nicholas was a confessed\nEurophile, lying on his party's more\nliberal left-wing, whereas Alan Clark\nhas been described as a \"radical reactionary British nationalist\", and has\nspoken out in favour of protectionism\nand industrial intervention. He comes\nfrom a background to match these\nbeliefs: his homes include Saltwood\nCastle and a chalet in the Alps, he has\na passion for fast cars, and to pay his\ntax bill he was forced to sell one of\nhis Turner's. Although he is unlikely to find a place in the next government, his politics vary wildly, and his exploits\nmake him a friend of any tabloid edi-tor, Mr Clark does however have at\nleast one thing in common with\nNicky Scott - he already has two convictions for driving offences.\nCommittee\n2 8 th February19!

During the\nevaluation of the Bookstore tenders,\nthe Centre was asked to specify\nunder what conditions any of the bidders could access the campus net-work. The response was that anyone\nof them could have a connection to\nthe campus network, but would then\nhave to guarantee, in writing, not to\ntry to access or use the JANET net-work. These are the terms under\nwhich, for example, STA the travel\nagents are allowed to use the campus\nnetwork. If Waterstone's wish to use\nthe Internet for commercial purposes\nfrom the College campus, then they\nwill need to obtain a commercial\nconnection from an Internet Service\nProvider.\nYours sincerely,\nRJHynds\nGet a Result....\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to let you and all the\nstudents know that the Library considered very seriously how it could\nalleviate the hardship to be caused by\nthe closure, for part of the day, during the next two weeks. We have\nalso received the letter from the\nBiology students and wholly sym pathis e with them - after all, the library\nstaff have been exposed to noise,\ndust, dirt, flooding, accidents and\ninconvenience since last Summer.\nWe have always insisted that we\nmust keep the Library open, but now\nthe construction work demands that\nwe close for certain periods. We cannot but accept this demand.\nHowever, I can now tell you that\nlibrary staff have volunteered for\nSunday work to keep the Library\nopen on the 9th of February (the\nSunday before the exams) and the\n16th of February (the mid Sunday of\nthe closure period) . We shall be\nopen between 9.30am and 5.30pm. Only the basic Library Desks will be\nstaffed but all the reading areas will\nbe open. We would also like to\nencourage users to make use of the\nextra borrowing allowance, but ask\nthem to return books as soon as possible so that others might use them.\nFinally, we welcome the students\nraising their concern about the building work. This will help us to fight\nagainst further disruptions. As for\ndisasters - we would like to avoid\nthem as much as you!\nYours sincerely,\nMagda Czigany Director of\nLibrary Services\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions are not\nnecessarily those of the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1079\nis Tuesday 11th February.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@ic.ac.uk\nFELIX needs: news reporters\nfeature writers\nsports reporters\nillustrators\ntheatre reviewers\nfilm reviewers\npuzzle compilers\ncome in and see us in the corner of be it quad. ATiT7T TV Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\n\"...THOSE\nPESKY MEDICS\"\n'Medics secure independence' is a grand headline for a stirring story of\ntriumph in the face of adversity. The\nmedical students of St Mary's and\nCharing Cross medical schools have\nsucceeded in ring-fencing up to\n\u00a380,000 a year for the students'\nunion of the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine.\nUnfortnately this is, and will be in\nthe future, to the detriment of\nImperial College students as a whole. Yet again St Mary's students\nhave managed to force the agenda to\nmeet their own selfish interests and\nin the process have deprived other\nstudents of funds for their activities.\nThe new medical school students\nunion, as they envision it, will bring\nmuch duplication of the services and\nclubs provided and funded by\nImperial College Union. ICU and\nthe College have been neatly sidestepped by a room full of baying\nmedical students and left in a much\nweaker postion to face future\ndemands by those students.\nIf it was simply a case of giving\nhere where the College had taken\naway elsewhere, then some remuneration for the loss of social space\nin the new bio-medical science\nbuilding might be justified.\nHowever, this possibly legitimate\nallocation of funds and the ne go it at ions surrounding it have bypassed\nthe College's stated medium of providing student services, ICU, and\nhave therefore prior it is ed one section of students over another.\nDuplication of the services provided by ICU is unnecessary and a waste of resources when money is\nalready scarce. Duplication of the\nclubs and societies by the union is\nagain, apart from sporting clubs\nsuch as rugby and hockey that are\nalready devolved to the Constituent\nCollege Unions, a wasteful and divisive use of funds. Nobody would\ndeny the medical student's right to\nan identity, particularly one reinforced by sporting merit and\nach civ cm cnt, but however vocal\nthey may be, these students must be\ntreated the same as other students at\nImperial College.\nThe new ICSMSU will be a CCU\nof equal standing to the other three,\nslightly smaller than C&G and the\nRCS and bigger than the RSM.\nThese CCUs run clubs similar to\nthose that St Mary's and Charing\nCross currently operate with a fifth\nof the sub vent ion. Additonally, these\nCCUs are funded through ICU thus\nensuring that the College's financial\nregulations are followed and allowing proper accounting of these funds\nto be maintained within the context\nof the student body as a whole.\nI would question whether the\nmedical students really have gained\nin the long run by sneak i ly extracting this concession from College.\nThere is certainly a short term gain,\nfor both ICSMSU and the College,\nbut this move will only serve to help\nalienate these medical students from\nthe rest of the College, which must\nbe detrimental to the substance of\nthis institution.\nUltimately, I can only say well\ndone. Well done to St Mary's for\nsecuring their 'independence'. Well\ndone to the College for ensuring\nfuture division on the campus.\nOPERATIC SOCIETY\nWhile I'm here, I feel that I ought to\nmention the excellent performance\nof 'Sweet Charity' by OpSoc I enjoyed this week. I would recommend it for an evening's enjoyment.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY7 TH FEBRUARY SPORT 15\nIC Birds draw with midgets in the\nBattle of the Babes\nICFB overcame their hangovers on\nSunday morning to turn out against a petite, begrudging St George's team\nat Harrington. Let down badly by\ntheir Old Boy referee, they were off\nto a poor start as the opposition\ncoach reluctantly took to the field.\nDespite finding themselves one bird\nand one goal down early on, spirits\nsoared amongst the IC players as\nthey bounded, yelling through the\nmidfield. An energetic but fruitless\nperiod followed: Hege, Steph and\nEleanor kept control in defence and\ndetermined midfield worded hard,\nbut luckless strikers Maryam and\nJuliet \"Baby\" were thwarted by the\ncharging dwarves. Captain Young??\nfought back in best Scots\n\"Braveheart\" style and left plenty of\nmarks on defenders, if not on goal. It\ntool opportunistic Mary's medic\nHyena to exploit the dopey George's goalie early in the second half and\nrouse the IC girls to greater efforts.\nSmooth play from Tracey \"Coach\"\nWilliams and Ioanna, and all-round\ncoverage from Helen saw IC with\nmost of the possess eon but few\nchances on goal. Frenzied last-ditch\nbursts from St George's midfield\nstretched some desperate defending\nbut the score remained even and a freezing Bente got little chance to\ndisplay her goal keeping skill. IC celebrated their point with a ball-sign-ing session on the way home\nICWFC 1 - 1 St George's Medical\nSchool\nFourth team not perfect - shock\nDespite winning, IC fourths cannot\nbe happy with this performance\nwhich, to be honest, was dire (rear!)\nIt was perhaps our worst performance of the season but at least three\npoints were achieved to maintain our\nplace at the top of our division. If we\ncan play this badly yet still win, what\nwill we achieve if we play well?\nAn own goal by Sion following\npoor play be 'keeper Stu meant we\nwent one down. A scramble in the\nQM box lead to another og but this\ntime an equalise r for IC. Perhaps the\nturning point occurred when the QM striker missed an open net from five\nyards. This was un sporting ly cheered\nby the 'keeper to such an extent that\nthe said striker totally lost his confidence for the rest of the game.\nPete scored from a well worked\nthree-man move but yet again sloppy\ndefending brought QM level. Just as\ntime was running out David moved\nforward from defence and placed a twenty-five yard chip into the top\ncorner to win the points for IC.\nDespite the score, the game had\nbeen frankly poor from the team\npoint of view. The defending was\nabysmal, the goalie was unwilling to\nclaim any ball outside the six yard\nbox, wasteful finishing from the\nstrikers and worse from the midfield.\nEven in this mire of mediocrity, Sion\nmanaged to stand out with an own\ngoal and a penalty blasted over the\nbar.\nLet's hope that it will be Winsday\nin BUSA.\nIC fourths 3 - 2 QMWC\nSport in brief\nSNOOKER\nLast Sunday Imperial played a friendly against BUS A championship hosts Warwick. After consecutive wins against Cardiff,\nSouthampton and Bristol, IC were\nlooking to keep up their red-hot\nform. For the A team Jon led the\nway, winning 5-0 and finishing one\nframe with a60 clearance. Wins followed from Simon and Alex, contributing to a final 16-9 win.\nFor the B team Spike whitewashed\nhis opponents 5-0 and with a41 victory for Russell they cruised to a137 win. With only a couple of weeks\nto go before the Nationals, IC are in\ngood shape for the biggest tournament of the year.\nRIFLE AND PISTOL\nSHOOTING\nMore competitors are still needed\nfor the Courtman Shield rifle match\n(March 1st) however, as otherwise\nRCS are in sever danger of whitewashing all the other CCU's. Furthermore, anyone is invited to\ntake part in the Bell Target air rifle\nshoot (an old Black Country t radi tion) on Wednesday 12th February.\nEnquires can be made at the range\non Wednesdays and Saturdays about\nother forthcoming attractions.\nFinally, we have a home match\nagainst Cambridge on Saturday as a warm-up for the Nationals, where we\nhope to make it into the medals after\nlast years fourth place.\nTHE LATEST SCORE Felix's regular \"external\" sports column by the ever talented and good-looking Dave Robinson.\nEarlier this week UEFA decided to\nback Germany as the European bid\nfor the World Cup in 2006.\nAlthough it is FIFA that decides it is\nlikely that they will be heavily influenced by the decision. The only\nother nation even interested is Brazil\nand the World Cup has been over the\nAtlantic since 1982. This all means\nthat the most successful bid from\nEurope will probably win. The ruling authority seems to think it can\ndecide who this will be.\nEngland has the most money, best\nstadiums and also the most sporting\nplayers and crowds. The FA could\neasily strengthen our already substantial bid. Firstly they could alter\nit to one from the United Kingdom,\nthis would give it the cosmopolitan\nair that they seem to want and not\ncommit it to one country. Fixtures\ncould be played at the new Hampden\nPark and Cardiff Arms Park\nStadiums even if Wales and\nScotland didn't qualify. The Welsh\nand Scottish authorities aren't exactly going to object since they have no\nchance of ever staging anything\nexcept from Rugby. Secondly they\ncould state exactly how much cash is\navailable and bugger the\nBundesbank backwards, the\nLotteries' coffers are overflowing\nand it has to go somewhere. Instead\nof letting Graham Kelly huff, they\nshould be busily pointing out the\nprogress of this countries game, the\nsuccess of Euro' 96 and the present\ndominance of our sides in Europe.\nWe could reveal secret plans to allocate more tickets to our 'guests'\nfrom abroad, plans for hospitality of\naway fans and guarantees of cheap\nseats at every game. I doubt UEFA\nwill change their mind since the\nchairman of the decision committee\nand the chief secretary are both\nstrangely German, but hopefully\nFIFA will see sense.\nOn the domestic scene, it is pleasing to see that Newcastle and\nLiverpool have yet again been relegated to also-ran s unable to win any-thing, the only likely title challenge\nwill come from Arsenal as the Red\nDevils romp to a third double.\nStockport are a pretty solid bet for\nthe cup, seeing how Middlesborough\nstruggled against Hednesford it is\nnot beyond them to get to the final\nand surprise everyone by staking a place in Europe. The treatment\ngiven to this trophy is ludicrous, for\nall but the big four it is the most\ndirect and easiest way into Europe\nand a first round tie with some\nplucky Swedish part-timers, yet no\none seems to care till the quarter\nfinals.\nWhile our cricketers would\nimprove their record by coming\nhome, our Rugby team seem to be on\ntheir way to a crushing Grand Slam.\nAlthough initially uncertain our\nnational side is going in the right\ndirection, the killer instinct present\nin destroying Scotland has been\nsadly missing recently. They are\nexpected to take the triple crown and\nthe only true test will be against the\nFrench. My only uncertainty would\nbe over the captaincy, Jack Rowell\nmust now relegate one of his best\ntwo centres to the bench every game.\nHowever who can complain if we\ncontinue to win so well ?\nIC fifths beaten by peasants\nOn Saturday, IC fifths, down to ten\nplayers thanks to third team captain\nPereira's lack of organisation, were\ndefeated by King's fifths - who must\nsurely be the ugliest team in the\nleague.\nThe first half was even, despite\nFlossy's inch-perfect through-pass to\nthe opposition centre forward, but\nthe second half was pretty much oneway traffic, resulting in an unfortunate loss to an unfortunate team.\nCredit must go to Kublai, twenty-one last Sunday, playing up front by\nhimself for much of the game, and to\nSteve, Dan, Gine and Mike who all\nworked hard.\nIC fifths 0 - 3 King's fifths\nAn apology:\nSorry to the members of the ski team\nwho's names where erroneously\nspelt in the report which a pper a red in\nthe last issue.\nThe triumphant skiers' are actually:\nDaniel Figueras-Nieto\nNick Hubsher\nXavier Grosliere.\n\n"

The MP spoke for an hour to a meeting of the society, covering topics such as the battle for the leadership of the Conservative Party and the Tory divisions on Europe.\nInternet purchasing facilities to hit IC\nVAS KORBA SAKA pilot run for purchasing equipment\nover the internet is soon to arrive for\nImperial College members. The main\nintention of the service is to replace\norders for college equipment to third\nparty suppliers.\nAt the moment, there is only information concerning the purchase of\npersonal computers. However, this is\nhoped to be expanded to include sta-tio nery, gas cylinders and chemical\nsupplies, as well as printing and photocopying services all available over\nthe internet. Full purchasing facilities\nare expected to be available after\nadequate security procedures have\nbeen implemented. Co-or dina tors of\nthe pilot state the advantages of the\nservice to be speedier response for\norders, cost savings for the college\nby the reduction of paperwork and\neasy access to the latest catalogue of\nproducts over the internet.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr James\nBayley, Procurement Systems\nOfficer, said that there would be no\nsecurity risks involved in transactions across the internet, since Secure\nSocket Layers (SSL) and encryption\ntechniques would be used, and the\nfacilities would only be available\nfrom within the Imperial College\ncomputing network\nCurrently, only the Union\nBookshop on the Sherfield walkway\nand the Kodak centre in the Electrical\nEngineering Department can receive\norders over the internet.\nMedics'\nindependence\ncontinued from front page\nthe Easter vocation, when rooms\nthere are not going to be rent out.\nThe issue of top-up fees was also\nbrought up. Professor Swanson\nassured all those present that the\nCollege has no plan to introduce\nsuch charges in the near future. He\nwarned, however, there is the possibility that all institutions may be\ninstructed to do so by the govern-ment. The earliest this can happen\nwill be in 1998, after the new\nintakes have been informed of this\nin the new prospectus. However, no\npresent students of the College will\nbe affected. The suggestion that the\nCollege might start bringing in top-up fees just to keep itself on par with\nthe rest of the so called \"Ivy\nLeague\" universities such as UCL,\nand LSE was strongly refuted by\nProfessor Swanson, who said that\nthey would only be forced to do so\nunder financial pressure.\nThe medics' concern about their\nfuture was reflected by their high\nattendance at the session, which was\ngenerally felt to be productive. They\nwere pleased to learn that the sub-vent ion of their future student union\nhas been secured and the independence of their clubs and societies\nguaranteed.\nBoth aspects are seen as crucial in\nmaintaining the sense of identity\namong the medics after the merger.\nThe willingness of Professor\nSwanson to discuss matters further\nwas welcome by all those who were\npresent.\nHE FCE cuts funding to low rated departments ALOK J HA The Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England has decided on\nthe weightings it will use for the distribution of funds to universities and\ncolleges for the coming year. A big\ndifference this year will be that none\nof the \u00a3680m will be going to departments rated at 1 or 2 in he recent\nResearch Assessment Exercise.\nThe decision to cut the low-rated\ndepartments out of the funding formula was made when the two bodies\nthat used to fund higher education,\nthe University Funding Council and\nthe Polytechnics Funding Council\nwere merged to form HEFCE a few\nyears ago. HEFCE originally continued to fund departments rated at 1 or\n2 so that they could improve their rating in time for the funding water-shed. A spokesman from HEFCE\nsaid that any other way of doing\nthings would have been 'unfair' on\nthe old polytechnics which may not\nhave had research departments of\nparticularly high standards when\nthey became universities. An additional fund was set up for this pur-pose, the Development Research\n(Dev-R), although this is now being\nphased out.\nWhen asked whether not providing money to low-rated departments\nwould leave them stranded and therefore not able to become a 'good'\ndepartment, the HEFCE press of fi cer, Philip Walker, stressed the need\nto be selective about its decisions due\nto their limited budget. He said that\nthere was no point in spreading\nmoney thinly over all the universities\nbut instead to concentrate it on the\nones that carried out the best research\nsince that was the best way to benefit\nsociety. This view is echoed by Dr.\nRodney Eastwood, finance planning\nofficer at Imperial College, which\nwas amongst the top-scoring colleges\nin the country. He said there was \"no\npoint in giving money to second best\nresearch\" and that it would be better\nspent at \"international\" departments\nsuch as the ones at IC. As a result of\nthe last RAE, Imperial would not be\naffected by HEFCE's decision.\nThe reaction from universities\nwhich didn't do score so well last\nyear has been critical, as expected.\nAlthough they cannot get much\nmoney from HEFCE, they are looking to a replacement for the Dev-R, the exact details of which have not\nyet been worked out according to\nPhilip Walker. The Times Higher\nEducation Supplement quoted\nresponses from some of these universities, among them the University of\nLuton and the University of Central\nLancashire. They thought that the\nmove by HEFCE was 'grossly\nunfair' and generally condemned the\naction.\nHEFCE have floated the possibility that there may be new areas of\nresearch to tak re in to account in the\nfuture, but that would be considered\nnearer the time. It is possible that the\nnew universities which may be\nundertaking the 'new areas' of\nresearch could then get more fund-ing. Until then, the future of their\nresearch funding is not entirely cer-tain.\n\n"

Centre pages Just who runs this place?\nPaul Squires looks at the\nCollege hierarchy to see\nwhats under its stone, p7 Medics secure\nindependence\nKENT YIP\nMedical students at St Mary's Hospital Medical School were celebrating this week after securing the\nfuture students' union's financial\nindependence. During a question and\nanswer session for medical students\nlast Monday, Professor Alan\nSwanson, Deputy Rector of Imperial\nCollege, said that he saw no reason\nwhy the Student Union of the future\nImperial College School of Medicine\nwould not be funded separately from\nthe main Union after the merger.\nFurther backing came from their\nDean Professor John Caldwell, who\nhas written to Professor Swanson to\nurge him to have his promise officially noted.\nWhilst at present the student\nunions of RSM, RCS and C&G are\nfunded by Imperial College Union,\nthat of St Mary's receives its sub ven tion directly from the College. There\nhas been fear that this practice may\nbe abandoned after 1998, when the\npre-clinical undergraduates will be\ntaught in South Kensington. Such a move would have presented a severe\nfinancial blow to the future ICSM\nSU, who might receive only \u00a315,000\nfrom ICU. Currently, the combined\nsub vent ion of the two medics'\nunions, St Mary's and CXWMS's, stands at \u00a380,000.\nAt the meeting, Professor\nSwanson also stated that the College\nwould not object to the medics entering their own teams in future BUSA\ncompetitions, and this would be a matter for the students concerned to\nsort out. The question as to whether\nthe College would continue to fund\nthe teams elicited the reply that no\nchanges to the present system of\nfunding would be introduced. It was\npointed out, however, that when\nmaking decisions on such matters\none should consider how to get the\nbest level of competition.\nQuestions concerning the shape to\nbe taken by the crest of the future\nmedical school, which will appear on\nthe jersey of the various sport teams,\nwere also posed. Again, it was\npromised by Professor Swanson that\nthe College would back whatever the\nmedics from the four constituent\nmedical schools agree on.\nAfter the merger, first year medics\nwill be housed in halls of residence\nover at South Kensington. This has\nled to fears that Wilson House,\nwhich has always been a hall for\nmedical students, will be opened up\nto students from other disciplines,\nand result in final year clinical students loosing their priority when\napplying for rooms there. Professor\nSwanson assured the medics that all\nclinical finalists will still be given\npriority at Wilson House.\nWhen asked to clarify the recent\nsuggestions that residents of Wilson\nHouse may have their parking rights\noutside the house removed,\nProfessor Swanson said that he was\nnot aware of any such plan. He\nagreed that it would be unreasonable\nto remove the parking rights of clinical students, who have to undertake\ntheir training in many different locations around and outside London\nthroughout the duration of their\ncourse. Professor Swanson also said\nthat he saw no reason why residents\nof Wilson House should not be\nallowed to keep their belongings in\ntheir rooms for a nominal fee during\ncontinued on page two\nCollege\nIn Something for the\nWeekend: a chance to\nget on TV, the bugs\ninside your stomach\nand the Vadic Society\nMi m1 PHOTO: ALDOUS\nOld and new.

Despite eligibility they\nappear not to wish to go to the ballots\nfor three main reasons.\nThe first is that they fear that by\nregistering with their local council\nthey will become liable to pay\nCouncil Tax and cause further strain\non already stretched grants and\nloans. Normally students are exempt\nfrom paying the tax but conflict arises for those who share a house or flat\nwith someone receiving income sup-port, such as unemployed recent\ngraduates.

The company currently supplies nearly a quarter of all medical\nresearch funding in the UK The company blames the poor\nresearch facilities at some universities as reasons for the switch and particularly the research environments.\nA spokesman for the company\nexplained that UK universities \"lack\nthe en vi rome nt where you could get\nfull results.\"\nHe went on to place GlaxoWellcome as \"an intern atonal organisation in an international industry.\"\nThus, he concluded, GlaxoWellcome needed world-class\nresearch facilities. \"We have to find\nour research science and technology\nin the best centres. Where we would\nhope that this would be in the United\nKingdom, it is not a foregone con clu sion\" he said.\nWhile it seems that many smaller\nuniversities may lose out, staff at\nImperial College do not think that\ndepartments here will be affected by\nGlaxo Wellcome's actions. Dr David\nChapman, Finance Administrator for\nthe Biochemistry Department, commented \"I don't think this will affect\nus as we have always had very close\nrel a tons with Glaxo-Wellcome, and a lot of our students have placements\nwith them. They were also a significant contributor to the \u00a32.1 million\ncry o electron microscope that is to be\ninstalled here. We work to follow the\nCollege's mission statement, and be\na centre not just of national, but\ninternational excellence.\"\nThe sabbatical election season got\noff to a slow start this week with only\ntwo nominations being posted by the\ntime Felix went to press. Papers for\nnominations for the sabbatical elections went up outside the Union\nOffice in the Beit Quad Union\nBuilding on Monday morning and\nwill remain up until 5.00pm Friday\nevening.\nSo far the only posts that have\nreceived nominations are Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) and\nFelix Editor. 4th year mechanical\nengineer Duncan Tindall is fully\nsigned up for the former, while third\nyear physicist Jeremy Thomson is\nstanding for the latter. To be e legible to stand, a candidate must be a full\nmember of Imperial College Union,\nwhich all students at IC are, supported by twenty second ers and must\nfind someone brave enough to propose them.\nThe other two positions open for\nelection are President and Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies).\nPotentially, there is a fifth sabbatical recently established to cover the\nmedical merger. Unlike the first four,\nthis post is funded from external\nsources, such as the St Mary's old\nboys association, as is not elected by\ncampus wide ballot. It is thought that\nthis year may see the first sabbatical\ntaken by a medical student.\nSummer\nTravel\nBursaries\nwho are going places\nAre you planning to travel this summer?\nIf you are a University student not yet\nin your final year. Shell may want to\ngive you \u00a3300, to help you on\nyour way.\nInterviews will be held\nin late April or May.\nWhy not complete j an application form 1\nwhich can be\nobtained from your\nH college?\n| The deadline for sending in application\nforms is 29th March.\nShell International Limited,\nRecruitment Division,\nShell Centre,\nLondon,\nSE1 7NA.
