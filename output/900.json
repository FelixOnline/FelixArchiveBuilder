    "content": "|9\u00bb\nOPINION\nGideon Lichfield, Chairman of IC Jewish Society, talks about\nexhibitions, opinions, and...\nWasted Emotion\nFrom March5 to 7, the Jewish Society\nheld an exhibition in the J CR about\nIsrael's position in the Middle East,\nentitled 'There is another way'.\n' How does this justify the Israeli\ntreatment of the 'Palestinians?' called out\none person as he left the exhibition. He apparently just wanted to make this stab\nand get out without waiting for the\nanswer, which was that the display didn't mention the treatment of the\nPalestinians\u2014that wasn't what it was\nthat many people saw in our exhibition,\nwhich is why we had deliberations about\nputting it up.\nA more balanced exhibition would have\nincluded material showing another\nfacet\u2014the Palestinians' legitimate rights to\nself-determination, which various\noccupying powers have denied them in\nthe past, and the diverse problems still\nfacing them. The difficulty in portraying\nso many entangled issues, is to give a 'balanced' perspective in a small space.\nThat, then, is my opinion. But I could\nabout. Why not? I hear you ask.\n\"And they shall beat their swords into\nplowshares, and their spears into\npruning hooks: nation shall not lift up\nsword against nation, neither shall\nthey learn war any more.\"\nThe majority of people are pretty\nuninformed about the Israel-Palestine\ndebate. Those of us who are interested\nparties, the Zionists (I can't say Jews,\nbecause some Jews are not Zionists) and\nthe Palestinians, should be educating\neveryone else. There has been a fair\namount of 'education' this year, with last\nterm's Friends of Palestine stall in the\nJCR and articles in Felix by a variety of\npeople. Some of this material has been\nreasonable and well-argued. Some has\nbeen rampantly anti-Zionist and even\nanti-Semitic. But I can't say that our\nexhibition, which was provided by the\nUnion of Israeli Students of this country,\nwas a balanced and objective counter to\nthe bias, because it wasn't. We justify\nputting it up nonetheless, because it\nbrought up some inescapable facts\u2014facts\nin the light of which some of Israel's more distasteful actions become\nunderstandable, even if you don't support\nthem. It also highlighted the peace treaty\nbetween Egypt and Israel as an example\nof what can be achieved through\nnegotiation.\nBut did it do enough? This form of\n'education', where the general public is\nleft to sort out what truth they can form\na barrage of information from both sides,\nis very common and, in my opinion, very\nwasteful. There is a tendency by pro-Palestinian groups to give the impression\nthat Israel and Zionism are the source for\nalmost all the Palestinians' problems,\nthough in both the past and the present\ntheir sufferings have also been due to\nmistreatment by other Middle Eastern\ncountries and to their own internal\nconflicts. This practice is as dangerous as\nthat of portraying Israel as a gem in a sea\nof iniquity. This last is the very message\nequally well have argued that nobody\nvoicing support for the Palestinians has\ntried to present a fair picture which also\nshows the problems that Israel has had to\nface, so why should we? That is a view\nheld by many people who have\nexperienced the worst realities of anti-Zionism and anti-Semetism and have had\nto fight back. Imperial College, however,\nis not exactly a hotbed of political activity\nand therefore we should be able to\ndiscuss these issues more calmly.\nWhen certain people express views or\ninterpret history in away I, as a Zionist,\nfind unacceptable, it is sometimes done\nwe can agree on.\nThere are a few such patches of\ncommon ground, by and large: mutual\nrecognition, self-determination and the\nright to an independent state for both\npeoples. Each side spends too much energy at the moment trying to persuade\nthe public that it is right. The energy\nshould go into dialogue. We are just\ngroups of students with different opinions;\nwe are not experiencing the real thing in\nthe Middle East, so there is even less\nreason for us to hurl public abuse at each\nothers' ideologies. This dialogue should\nnot even be with any expectations or\ngoals, just talking to see where the\ncommon ground lies. From the brief\nexperience I 've had I know that it is like\ntiptoeing through a minefield, and similarly nerve-racking, to follow the\nthread of agreement and understanding\nwithout blowing up in a series of\naccusations. This kind of talking is hard\nwork, but it would leave everyone else\nfree to go and read some history books\nand draw their own conclusions.\nYou may ask what this friendly chatting\nintends to achieve. The answer is that\neven if there are no concrete results, it is\nbetter than animosity, and it probably\nreduces the chances of a coronary in\nlater life for all concerned. Just because\ndifferent bits of the rest of the world are\nshouting at each other, doesn't mean that\nthe corridors of IC should be echoing\nwith recrimination.\nIt is said that where there are two\nJews, there are three opinions. If you spoke to any Jewish Society members at\nthe exhibition, you may have come away\nwith this impression. The exhibition was\nIT\nwithout any malice intended at all, but\nsimply because they sincerely believe\nwhat they are saying. During the three\ndays of the exhibition I spoke to many\ndifferent Arab students. We would often\nreach an issue on which we could not,\nand never will, agree, such as how to\ndefine the violence perpetrated by the\nPLO: terrorism or 'legitimate' guerilla\nwarfare? With those people who were not\nworked up into a frenzy of indignation at\nthe contents of the display, it was\npossible to achieve a kind of mutual\nunderstanding: it's fruitless to try and convert each other to our views on this\nissue, let's steer round it on to something\nintended, if nothing else, to jolt people\ninto asking questions and to act as a reminder that the Jewish Society exists\nand has thai ngs to say. We are a diverse\nbunch and our views span a wide range.\nYou have been reading one opinion,\nwritten by one Jew. Now, if you care at\nall about what happens in the Middle\nEast, go and find some more opinions,\nfrom as many different people as possible.\nYou will discover a bloodstained tapestry\nof stories, you will realise why it is so\ndifficult, nay, impossible, to reach a consensus and you will, I hope, come to\nthe conclusion that the past is a very\nrocky foundation indeed.\n24\n\n"

    "content": "Quigley\nDown\nUnder\nOn Extended Wings\nSince Magnum PI finished, the\nname Tom Selleck has not been\nassociated with particularly good or\nsuccessful films, unless the tag Three Men\nand a... was attached. I doubt that this\nfilm is going to do much to change this\nsituation, but, as westerns go, this ain't bad.\nRecent attempts to resurrect this genre\nhave sat at two extremes, with the\nextremely cerebral guilt driven Dances\nwith Wolves at one end, and the all flash\nand bang Young Guns at the other.\nQuigley Down Under sits squarely in the\nmiddle, having transferred itself to\nAustralia to allow a return to the more\ntraditional action/adventure/romance\nformat of the older westerns.\nQuigley has been hired by an English\nlandowner, purportedly to shoot dingoes.\nSo he deports himself to Australia, picks\nup a mad woman( Laura sex, lies and\nvideotape San Giacomo), and is told that\nhe is to shoot Aborigines. Naturally\nenough he refuses, and is thus beaten to\na pulp, chucked in the desert (complete\nwith pertly beautiful mad woman),\nrescued by Aborigines, and appointed as\ntheir unofficial protector. When the nasty\nEnglish landowner (Alan Rickman, loving\nevery moment, and acting everyone else\noff the screen) starts killing abos, Quigley\ngoes out for revenge...\nSelleck is heroic and, frankly, very\ntedious. San Giacomo is frankly, sexy,\nand manages to make something\ninteresting out of a very strange, and\nimperfectly developed, character.\nRickman is villainous, evil, and, frankly,\nRSC. Australia is beautiful, and the Abos,\nfrankly, mysterious. The film? Worth seeing solely for Rickman. (1 won't comment on San Giacomo to avoid\naccusations of sexism...)\nPendragon\n\u2022Book\n\u2014 Comic/ Graphic\nby Diane Ackerman\nWekwomtek\u2014p leu! The poet\u2014she flies.\nIf you've ever wanted to fly, to just\nbe in the sky, to see the world in its\nbed covers from above. Here's your\nchance. Let your mind and its\nimagination be passengers in a plane with\nDiane Ackerman. Let them see what she\nshows you and then you will know what\nit is to fly! She will show you what it's like to live a life 'On Extended Wings',\n'...what it was like to be this smitten with\nflight, this new to its dangers, this far\nshort of mastery, this deeply in love with\na Universe in which things can fly.'\nWherever you sit reading in this\nenclosing city, you'll feel space and\nremember an awe at a world beyond\ncities, cars and enclosure. You'll feel the\nsun, and its inconvenience, when in your\neyes. Why? Because Ackerman brings to\nher descriptions a raw excitement and a poetically trained mind. Easily forgiven is\nAwakenings\nWhat is it like to miss out 20 years\nof your life? Could you wake-up\nyears after you fell asleep, and still\nstay sane? Now imagine award containing many post-e ncep hal it ic patients; survivors of 'sleeping disease'.\nThey have been left in their trances,\nlooked after in the 'chronic care facility'\nof Bainbridge Hospital. This is the initial\nscene in Awakenings, a film based on a true story.\nDr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams)\narrives on the scene. Innocent, idealistic,\nreclusive, he has difficulty adapting from\nhis previous research to the realities of\ndealing with mental patients. Because of\nhis background, his approach is radically\ndifferent to all the other doctors. Whereas\nthey are happy merely looking after the\nlong-term mental patients, he wonders\nwhy nothing is being done to find a solution for their problems.\nSayer sets about correlating data, and\nfinds a group of patients with the same\nsymptoms, and he sets about finding a cure. He obtains permission to try a new\ndrug on one of the patients; Leonard\nLowe (Robert de Niro). After a short\nwhile, he shows dramatic improvement,\nwaking from his 'slumber', to normality.\nDue to the success of this test case, Dr.\nSayer is given permission to try the cure\non all other patients with similar\nsymptoms. He has a similar success with\neach.\nThis is my only grumble with an\notherwise excellent film. The change-over\nfrom comatose d vegetable to lucid\nconsciousness is all too sudden. In 'oh, so\nAmerican style', they all wake up and\nsuddenly all is sweetness and light. This\ndoesn't last too long, and the film soon\ngets into its more realistic stride again.\nthe occasional, oversensitive ramble;\nbecause in view of the honesty of her\nwriting, she appears to honestly believe\nwhat she has written.\nEssentially On Extended Wings is an\nenthusiastic account of Ackerman's time\nspent learning to fly and of the people\nshe meets. It is also in memory of a close\nfriend who rehabilitates her love of flying\nand the sky, after it had come close to\nbeing murdered. It is for Martin Van der\nLinde, Ackerman described their common belief as '...the world is a fairground open\nonly for one season, and you must enter\nit hungry and full of awe, eager for the\nrides that will thrill and teach you,\nthough some may be dangerous.'\nOn Extended Wings radiates this belief,\nleaving you looking wide-eyed and\nlongingly at the sky, feeling 'By God, how\nI want to fly.'\nUndala Alam.\nThe catch phrase of the film comes into\nplay; 'There is no such thing as a simple\nmiracle'.\nOne by one, things start going wrong.\nSome of the patients get disillusioned; 'I feel old and I feel swindled\u2014that's how I feel'. Side effects of the drug also come\ninto play; it causes severe paranoia. After\nthis things go severely downhill, and the\ndrug is no longer considered viable.\nDespite the fact that many sad things\nhappen in Awakenings, it is a happy film.\nIt is about the strength of the human\nspirit, about the motivation of a doctor,\nand about real life. Something makes me\nthink that the film world is looking up.\nThis is a beautiful film that is tangible,\nnot a distant abstract film. It's there, it's real, it's alive.\nStef.\n\n"

At midday on Sunday\n17th March, the demonstration came from\nbeyond Hyde Park toward the Iraqi\nEmbassy, in Queens Gate.\nThe march was halted in front of the\nRoyal School of Mines, as police feared\ntrouble if the protestors were allowed to\nreach the embassy. The crowd, consisting\nmainly of Iraqi families inclusive of\nchildren, stayed peaceful, chanting\nslogans along the lines of ' Down, down\nwith Saddam' and 'Out with the Butcher'.\nLater, the placards were collected, and\nthe crowd disbanded without apparent\ntrouble.\nThe protest followed another which took place on Queens Gate earlier in the\nweek, on Monday 11th March, involving\nabout 200 people. This demonstration was\nsimilarly trouble-free\nFuture In\nDanger?\nRector\nDecides\nThe isolation of Imperial College from the\nUniversity of London could increase if\none of College's current ideas is to go\nahead. The plan is one to d is affiliate from\nthe University of London Careers\nAdvisory Servive (ULCAS), replacing it\nwith an entirely IC based one.\nBoth Andre Skapski, Chairman of the\nCareers Advisory Commission, and\nBenjamin Turner, ICU Deputy President,\nare taking action to prevent the move,\nbut it appears that they may be too late.\nBelieving it to be an academic matter,\nthey think that it should be discussed and\ndecided at the next Board of Studies\nmeeting, in May. The Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, insists that the matter is purely\nmanagerial, and so can be decided by\nhimself in consultation with the College's Managing Director, Mr Angus Fraser,\nwithout seeking the opinion of the\nacademic body.\nThe Rector claims that the advantages\nlie in simplification of the management\nstructure along with increased\naccountability of careers staff. Russ\nClarke, IC's chief careers adviser from\nUL CAS, is viewing the problem from\nanother angle. He believes that the\ncareers service provided to students\nwould suffer, mostly in the scope of\ncareer opportunities covered, but also\nfrom the removal of the large information\ngathering network currently available. He\nadded that the careers service was\nespecially needed now due to the\nrecession.\nAlthough fears that this is the beginning\nof a complete split from the University of\nLondon were not specifically denied by\nthe Rector, he commented that he saw\nUL as having certain uses, saying that he\nwould like to share some of the smaller\ncourses with other colleges in the future.\nIt seems that there is much confusion\nover this matter, not only whether IC\nshould split from UL CAS, but also over\nwho has the authority to decide.\n2\n\n"

This\nalbum, al tough in texture completely\ndifferent, does seem to have hit a musical\ncul-de-sac. Whilst all their other albums\nhave been completely independent\ngrowing from each other, Out Of Time\ndraws heavily from past, note ably Murmur and Document, but it can't get\nout of its predecessor's shadow.\nLet's face it. If you are reading this the\nchances are you have/ will buy the\nalbum. Trouble is I'm just a little fucked\noff with R.E.M. at the moment, so this is\ntotally subjective.

Lets face\nit he can't exactly sing, can he?\nThe only side we'll listen to often is 2 B( the last one). This contains a mammoth four tracks including In yer face and\nCubik.

They\nwouldn't have allowed the packaging,\nthere would have been too much pressure about which songs to include,\nthe lyrical content and overall\npresentation. Doing it this way, we can\nthen go to a major and show we're\ncapable of getting it all together before\nthey've had to take a risk with us. Also\nwe're lucky in that we have an 'in-house'\ndesigner (Morgan) so we can have a decent packaging job done. Presentation\nis all important.\nIS: So you are interested in long term\ncommercial success?\nUK: Oh most definitely. We don't want to\nbe a cult band forever. That's all very\nwell for a while, but we don't want to be\n40 playing Ronnie Scott's and worrying\nabout how to pay the mortgage.\nIS: What do you do for work?\nUK: We don't.

The lead track Carry Me\nAway is tepid sub-funk with that j ingly guitar bit half-inched from Prince's Kiss,\nthe bass not very loud at all and, well,\nthe song never really leaves the\nlaunchpad. Your Flag in my Face sounds\nexactly like something off Side 2 of The\nSmiths' Hatful of Hollow with a bit of\nfunk added, whilst the singer sounds like\na cross between Morrissey at 33xh and\nJames Maker from Raymonde.

The journey is in fact an\nemotional one,'In a world spinning out of\ncontrol, it's easy to lose your way...'. The\nfilm concerns the desire of an American teenager to find some kind of foundation,\na base for his life. His parents and society\nhave let him down, so what is he to do?\nRebellion seems to be the answer.\nThe film is made by the English\ndirector Hugh Hudson (who also directed\nChariots of Fire and Grey stoke, the\nTarzan film) and stars Donald Sutherland\nas the therapist Dr Charles Loftis, and\nthat well known 'rebel' Adam Horovitz\nfrom the Beastie Boys, as the\nrebel/delinquent Tim Doolan. The film is\nset in the middle-class suburbs of Los\nAngeles, where the houses are 'nice' the\nparents are 'nice' and the kids too are\n'nice'. Unfortunately the truth is that\nunderneath the nice i ties is a vacuum (and\nnot the sinister corruption of the\nLynchian middle America!).\nTim Doolan's parents are unable to\n'cope' with their child, or rather do not\nreally feel responsible for him. So they\nthrow him in a private mental institution\nfor kids (something which is apparently\nBlood Oath\nWhy is this film called Blood Oath ?\nAll the right ingredients are\npresent: George Takei (Mr Sulu),\n900 Anzacs (dead), a small and otherwise\nunheard-of island which is the centre of a huge territorial battle (read Falkland Isles)\nand a lead man who you've never heard\nof, but was in that thing on TV a while\nback (Bryan Brown). All this and Jason\nDonovan (crap) too.\nDisposing of these in order of\nintroduction: George Takei is very\ndisappointing, failing to say 'Phasers\nlocked on target' even once, nor is there\na 'Warp Factor five, sir' even for his\ndevoted fans. Distressingly, George here\nbayonetted soldiers found on Amb on. During the trial, attention is focussed on\nthe clash of Eastern and Western cultures,\nparticularly by examining two young\nsoldiers, one on either side. This is where\nJason 'Spunky' Donovan comes in, in a profoundly negligible role (four words).\nThe one thing this is not, is a war\nmovie, nor is it a straight-forward\ncourtroom drama. Several themes (justice\nand retribution, East-West clash, abuse of\npower, and the innocence of individuals)\nare playing in parallel without tangling in\neach other. The creators of this film\nobviously set out to expose a story which the world needs to know about, and to\nputs on a convincing and interesting\nperformance in a true-life role as the\nJapanese baron/commander who ordered\nthe execution and general nastiness in the\nPOW camp on Amb on Island during\nWorld War II. During his command of the\ncamp, 1100 Australian POWs entered the\ncamp. Only 300 came out.\nBryan Brown's job (you must remember\nhim, he was in that thing about the\nspecial effects man) is to prosecute the\nJapanese officers in charge of the camp\nfor the war crimes they have\nundoubtedly committed, proved by the\nstatements of the Australians and the\nmass graves of decapitated and\nthis extent have succeeded in making a movie which holds the attention, without\nthe unnecessary superimposition of the\nusual neon 'This is a true story' nonsense.\nAlthough an attractive(ish) nurse shows\nup in the film and gradually becomes a closer and closer ally of the leading man,\nthere is an astounding and very welcome\nabsence of a gratuitous love story.\nAll told this is a rather good film, more\nthought-provoking and consequently\nprobably less successful than most. You may actually remember this in six\nmonths.\nWhy is this film called Blood Oath ?\nThe Erasing Drying Turtle Vaseline\nbecoming more and more acceptable in\nAmerica). All Tim wants is to be able to\ncommunicate to his parents, to be\nunderstood. The film isn't actually too\ndissimilar from Rebel Without a Cause. I can understand that the film doesn't have\na James Dean to push it along, but what\nis harder to accept is the saccharine\nnature of the film\u2014it falls into the trap of\nbeing 'nice' enough for what the\nfilmmakers must consider to be mass\nconsumption. The director never really\ngets a clear focus on any particular\naspect in the film, instead choosing to\nsuperficially depict Tim's angst, or looking\nbriefly at his father's need to demonstrate\nhis love but being totally incapable of\ndoing so. We even get a brief glimpse of\nDr Loftis' alcoholic problem without any\nreal developments. In the end the film\njust makes a few weak points, without\nleaving any lasting impressions.\nI.H.

No, hang on, that's wrong.\nErmm..in the company of such reprobates\nas are listed below : Do you really want\nto share your jellied eels with the\nfollowing?\n\u2022 Jason Donovan\n\u2022 Bernard Manning\n\u2022 Bernard Matthews\n\u2022 Bernard Bresslaw\n\u2022 Ken Dodd (IS INNOCENT -it's official)\n\u2022 Keith Harris (and Orville, may he rot in\na gibbet for all eternity (with Colonel\nSanders for company)).\n\u2022 Robert Maxwell( oo er,a bit of satire,\nour name's The Amazing Flying Gerbil\nMachine, goodnight)\nBy this point only those of you who still\nthink the Poll Tax is a neat idea will still\nbe with us. This is not sufficient grounds\nfor being rich, however. Judging by the\ncomprehensive list above there is also a50% chance that you are called Bernard\nand a100% chance of being a complete\ng it( except Bob Maxwell; we can't afford\nthe lawyers).\nHell-bent as you are on the pursuit of\nriches, we feel that we should put you\nright on a few fallacies commonly held\nby the public.\nThings the rich don't do:\n\u2022 Spread butter with a fish-knife\n\u2022 Pass port to the right\n\u2022 Live in Cardboard City, SW1\n\u2022 Shop regularly at Cascade in Oxford St.\n(the shop with the legs)\n\u2022 Use Sex Reactor machines outside\nnewsagents.\n\u2022 Fish for lunch in rubbish bins\n\u2022 Wear their underpants for a five week\nstretch\n\u2022 Orgasm watching Treasure Hunt (what\ndo you mean nobody does this anyway?)\n\u2022 Wear open-toed sandals and lecture on\nOpen University.\n\u2022 Argue over prices in Tandy.\nIf you do any of the latter then you are\nMr (or Mrs) Sad and you should lock\nyourself in a strong metal box until Xmas\nwhen everyone is the mood to forgive all\nand sundry, save Derek Beatty. It's also\nimportant not to believe you are rich\nwhen in fact you may simply have some\ntaste.\nAt this point it's probably best to\nundergo a few surgical modifications; get\na good accent put in (Middle European or\nMiddle Eastern are recommended for the\nbeginner; Burkina Fasese is not), lose\nyour chin and if possible a large part of\nyour brain. (If you are Bernard Manning\ngain at least twenty stone and don't bother with the part of your cerebellum\nthat's left).\nOkay, we hear you say (do you come\nfrom Venus?) so I 've done all this and\nknow what not to do. What do I do?\nYou seem like a real smasher (super\nsmash in' lovely, listen to Tony) so we'll\nspill the beans and swing the cat. We followed some rich looking plebs for a week or so (honest officer, we're press)\nand this is an average day for the\nterminally well-to-do and posh no bs: \u2022 Shop at Harrods on your American Express Platinum Card.\n\u2022 Failing Harrods, go in search of an\nantique Persian Carpet at an auction.\n\u2022 Go horse-racing.\n\u2022 Go horse-racing after some inoffensive\nanimal under the guise of pest control.\n\u2022 Spit on the homeless.\n\u2022 Make well observed comments on 'an\nhonest day's work'\n\u2022 Spend silly money on the kind of things\nyou get in crackers only they aren't made\nof plastic.\n\u2022 Do things just like normal people, like\nbuying aeroplanes and popping in to see\nImelda on their way to their country\nplace in the West Indies.\n\u2022 Buy a newspaper (see Bob\nMaxwell-off-thanks-for-asking)\n\u2022 Have someone go to the lavatory for\nyou. (Crap gag, we know).\nOkay. So failing actually having loads of\ndo sh dropping willy n illy hither and yon,\nhow easy is it to FAKE being rich on as tude grant (ie. not very much at all) ? In\nthe interest of journalistic truth and\nbeauty TA FGM Inc. have researched this\nmuch neglected topic.\n1) Going to Harrods. This bit is actually\nquite easy. In fact it's a piece of piss.\nHowever, actually simulating oil fed tendencies once there is very hard,\nparticularly if you resemble an excited\nMuppet (cf. Flying Gerbil) or the lost\nfourth member of The Jam (cf. Amazing Machine). Harrods is stuffed with staff\nwho manage to be obsequious and\ncondescending without knowing what\neither of them mean. When one (NB it is\nessential to refer to yourself as 'one' in\nThe Amazing Machine meets the\nlunch at the hard rock cafe.\nswank joints rather than 'Flying Gerbil Of\nFleet Street!') examines the gold dustbins\n(\u00a3450, a real snip) and the enamelled\nswimming pools laughingly referred to as\nbaths (between \u00a32500 for a standard\nmodel and \u00a335000 with optional\nwo/manservant) it is necessary to remark\nhow five day's stubble is in fact terribly\n'in' in Milan.\n2) Go to an auction. This involves\nbravery on a grandiose scale as you\ncontend with the doorman of the Savoy\nwho seems oddly unconvinced of your\nidentity as you explain that you look\ntaller on screen. Giving your name as\n'Emilio Estevez' is also frowned upon.\nThe doorman will then give you the\nrunaround by telling you to go to the\nWaldorf. At the Waldorf it is only possible\nto remain inconspicuous as you enter the\nGrand Ballroom by retreating under a tablecloth and shuffling slowly for an exit.\nThe fifty gently gyrating geriatrics on the\nfloor are admirably restrained in their\ncomplete failure to notice you, but trying\nto steal the cutlery will only earn you a quick and easy departure.\nOnce at the auction you are expected\nto wander all over the carpets during\nwhat is termed the 'viewing'. This in fact\noffers the other bidders a chance to eye\nyou with distaste as you become aware\nthat you may just possibly have\noverdressed for the occasion. If\nnecessary, get your partner to take\ndiversionary action (fainting, dying,\nhaving a baby or all three) while you sit\nin a corner and look disreputable. At no\npoint make ANY gags about bombs\nwhatsoever. Once the bidding begins\neveryone sits stiller than glass in a desperate attempt to avoid the\nYoung Guns' and Jason Donovan for\nauctioneer's gaze. While he exhorts you\nto feel the quality and buy buy buy it is\nvital not to lose your head in the wild\nexcitement and seize a fifteen by twenty\nhand woven Kashgai rug for less than the\ncost of a second-hand racehorse.\n3) Go horse-racing. A bit of a no-no,\nwe're afraid. Although it may seem\nsimple to do this, many obstacles intrude,\nnot least the simple fact that nobody\nknows what you do. How do you get into\na racecourse? Do you pay? Where do you\ngo once inside? What's the point?\nAnother blow is that even Aristotle\nOnassis will not lend you his prize\ncourser for an afternoon. Unless you have\na couple of mates in pantomime it is very\nhard to experience the joy and sorrow of\nwatching your very own filly tear down\nthe turf. (Even if you do it doesn't get\nmuch easier).\n4) Go fox-hunting. We would have tried\nthis except we're not bastards and it's hell\ngetting the blood out.\n5) Being offensive purely .because you\ncan afford a law suit or the cost of an\nefficient hit man to clean up any\nmis demean our. Try this at your peril,\nkiddies, because being a smelly old poo-head doesn't make many friends in this\nday and age. If you can ignore the\nmassed throngs of homeless with their\ncardboard Barratt Homes and faces that\nonly days without food can buy and not\nfeel guilt or pity then you're a better/worse man than I or he.\nNote, that to maximise your insult\npotential it is necessary to both ignore\nany aspect of value other than wealth\nand also to rub the price differential in as\nmuch as possible. Comments such as 'You\ncouldn't give me the price of a cup of MY tea' and 'The only reason you're poor is\nthat you spend too much of your time\nthinking of others' are prime examples of\noffensive potential. With true filthy\nrichness comes a pure narrow-mindedness\nthat can range from 'get up off their\narse s' to 'probably on drugs and have\nAIDS anyway' in a quantum leap that\nwould leave Einstein a dribbling potato\n(as opposed to a festering stiff y).6)A Night At The Opera. This has\nnothing to do with being rich. It's a Marx Brothers film.\n7) Similarly, any attempt to Horse\nFeathers, Duck Soup or Monkey Business\nwill do little for your financial ego.\n8) We like the Marx Brothers (except\nfor Karl, who wasn't funny).\n9) Wear Designer clothes. A few\nhundred 'hard earned' on a feather duster\nand a crimp lene swimming costume that\ncan be worn on a single occasion, get\nyou into 'Headliners' in the Mail on\nSunday magazine and embarrass your\nchildren in years to come. Be daring,\nwild, outrageous and exciting like Cher,\nGrace Jones, Bette Midler and Barbara\nCartland. Unfortunately this is extremely\nhard to do even if you utilise the services\nof The Student Loan Company, Ltd. since\na Vivienne Westwood G string was\nrecently auctioned at Christie's in\nexchange for a small Third World country\nand half of the Hope Diamond. Designer\nclothes are also only practical if you are\nbuilt like an arthritic giraffe, preferably\nwith crutches. Anne Summers, despite\nthose deceptively shot catalogues, is not\ndesigner wear. Neither are those plastic\npolicemen's helmets. Deely bopper s are\ncompletely out. However, if you include\nall three together the ensemble IS. To\ntruly capital is e on the benefits of looking\ndesigned at low cost, buy up the\nwardrobe of a defunct 70'sTV series\n(Starsky And Hutch being a classic\nexample) for the price of a bag of crisps\nand look arrogant.\n10) Art. The more people can guess\nwhat a work is, the less worthwhile your\nhaving it. As such, a cheap way of\nsimulating this effect is to steal your\nyoungest relative's portfolio (Early Period)\nin the knowledge that whatever the\nsubject (Mummy, Daddy, Spaceship) it will\nresemble a bowl of tie-dyed muesli.\nShould you ever be drawn into a conversation on your masterworks, reel\noff some Spanish names and some\nScottish ones. Refer to 'small galleries' in\nHolborn a lot and your listener should be\nsatisfied.\n(Incidentally, the same principle can be\napplied to our reviews.)\nWe've only touched upon the aspects of\nopulence which are open to discussion.\nSince Felix is a family newspaper we feel\nthat any description of the more decadent\nside of wealth should be confined to a few handy catchphrases which you can\nemploy to good effect by simply inserting\nthem into a lull in conversation :\nSwapping... Victoria Principal... flake...\nmore than three in there... any more?...\nwhipped cream... Andrew( Lloyd\nWebber's) new one... Cher and that\ndreadful man... donkey... sex... nasal\ndecay... flogging a dead horse (or donkey\nif appropriate)... I 've got piles... I'm rolling\nin it... Keith Harris and Orville (only to be\nused in very open discussions; random\nuse costs lives)... masking tape... four\npercent... five percent... amazing...\nflying... gerbil... machine... Bernard...\nPertwee's production of 'Die Kroppe'...\nEmilio Estevez... de ely bopper s... a trilobite... heterosexual intercourse (social,\nbut only for those 'one drink too many'\ntype conversations)... Isn't it funny how\npopular the name Bernard's become all of\na sudden?... Hello, my darlings... Smash\nthe system! Anarchy Now!... Don't worry,\nit won't bite...\nThe Amazing Flying .Gerbil Machine.\nIt's easy to blend in, even at\nthe Waldorf! But it is all too\neasy to fall into the decadent\ndrug culture of the very rich.\n\n"

    "content": "The Trials of China continued\ncaked door and boarded. The seat\nnumbers made little sense, so I found\nmyself a nice window seat and refused to\nmove. Once in the country we picked up\na little too much speed as we bounced\nand bruised our way south.\nFoiled by the trains again, 1 flew to\nChongqing, (a flight which was cancelled\nonce because the control tower was on\nfire) and combined a trip through the\ngorges of the muddy red Yangste River\nwith ascents of two more Buddhist\nMountains.\n'1 found a chair and sat on deck reading\nand writing post cards as the steep green\nfertile terraces of the Yangtse's levees\npassed slowly by. Small rickety longboats\nplied the brown waters and little people\ntoiled on the banks like ump a lump as beside a chocolate river. In the late\nafternoon we moored alongside\nShibaozhai, a12 storey pagoda tacked\nonto the side of an oblong slab of\nsandstone protruding from the muddy\nflood plains. A steep flight of stairs took\nyou up a dark narrow damp alleyway\nand back to the 18th century. A little\ncobbled street lined with butchers and\ntraders snaked off in both directions. With excited chattering and pointing, I was\nguided to the right up another narrow\npassage lined with ancient men selling\nsmoked and decaying eggs... The view\nfrom the top of the pagoda was worth\nthe climb. The river snaked off to the\neast with the evening sun ringing brightly\nfrom the ripples. To the south lay grey\nclay roofs nestled in lush green terraced\npaddy fields.'\nThe majority of the trip along the\nYangtse is past low-lying flood plains, but\nfor a short stretch two days from\nChongqing you pass steep, vertical, ship-crushing cliffs straight out of Jason and\nthe Argonauts.\n'Back in the cabin I played another\ngame of Chinese chess. It was faster than\nthe last and just as I thought I'd lost my opponent gave up! I went back on deck\nand sat in the sun watching the vast slabs\nof rock dipping and folding into the\nswirling brown waters to emerge on the\nother side. Steeper and deeper gorges\nappeared in the haze ahead, darkening as\nwe passed beneath them.'\nShanghai is over six days* by boat from\nChongqing. Stopping to visit Huan Shan\nand Nanjing, it had taken me ten days.\nFive days before, I had slept on a sweaty,\ncockroach-ridden provincial station\nplatform in deepest Jiangxi province.\nToday I dined on banana splits in a chilly\nair-conditioned revolving restaurant\noverlooking a sprawling international\nharbour front. Shanghai had it all.\nIntriguing markets sold budget bonsai\ntrees, terrapins, turtles and the inevitable\ncrickets in cages. Bunches of water-filled\nplastic bags billowed with colourful,\nworried-looking ornamental fish. A music\nconservatory of international acclaim\nboasted flocks of child prodigies. Brahms\npiano concertos mingled with Shanghai's improvised jazz bands. But Shanghai's sights lie in the streets. Roads of 1920's architecture sprouting futuristic domes,\ntowers and spires above an insect oid rush-hour of two, three, and four wheel\nhybrid vehicles segregated from\npedestrian-clogged bike lanes. Parks are\nfilled by tai chi and martial arts are\nperformed in streets outside hotels.\nIn the south of China lies Guangxi\nprovince. I arrived by boat up the Pearl\nRiver from Canton. Famous for its karst\nlimestone scenery, it offers an ideal\nopportunity to reach Chinese village life,\nwhilst not straying far from banana\npancakes, pizzas and ice cream sundaes.\nSuch things are most welcome after the\nhundredth day of rice, egg and tomato.\nYangshuo offers such delicacies amongst\nthe shaggy camel hump hills. The Li river\nslithers between them and the pace of life\nis more gentle then in Guillin, the original\nkarst resort.\nThe Chinese flag boasts five yellow\nstars on a red background. These\nrepresent the fifty minority people which constitute the People's Republic of China.\nYunnan province to the west of Guangxi\nsupports many of these minority tribes.\nMost don't recognise the political borders\nand are synonymous with many of the\npeople from north Thailand.\nFrom Kun n ming, the capital of Yunnan, I took a train north, back to Chengdu to\njoin the Silk road and to trace it across\nthe Gobi, and Taklamakan deserts,\ntowards Pakistan.\nThe further west you travel in the\nChina, the less Chinese it becomes, until\nyou reach the special autonomous region\nof Xinjiang province with its Turkishspeaking population, with their mosques\nand veils and noodles.\nEven in three months, I didn't reach\nInner Mongolia, Yunnan's border lands,\nSichuan's Woo long Nature Reserve,\nXinjiang's borders or Tibet's high\nplateaus. After twelve weeks I was spat\nout over the Khunjerab pass, into the\ndisputed border territories of Northern\nPakistan (see 'Passage to Pakistan' article,\nFelix 896, 1 March1991). Out of the\nfrying pan and into the fire!\nTravelling on the cheap in 'the Middle\nKingdom' is hard work, but the rewards\nare clear. China is without doubt a country of extremes, a vast territory\npromising misty sacred mountains,\nimmense deserts, fertile plains, isolated\nbeaches and peaceful sleepy countryside,\nfilled with over 1.2 billion people with\nwhom to make contact. It can't be seen\nor done, it has to be experienced. If you\ngo, take your time and pack your\npatience. Don't treat it as an assault\ncourse. Go to watch and learn. You will\nnot change China, but it will certainly\nchange you.\n\n"

    "content": "ICU Islamic society present some of their views about the UN and the USA.\nPuppets or Patrons? OPINION\nThe war in the Gulf has affected us all,\nwhether it be from the rising price of\npetrol, the loss of life, or the economic\nand ecological consequences. Now that a cease-fire has taken place, we should\nexamine the issue for which this war was\nfought objectively and take a stand.\nAll western politicians have adopted an\nuncompromising stance against Saddam\nHussein and Iraq. The UN has issued 12\nresolutions condemning the action of the\nIraqi army since 2.8.90. We have been\nled to the war by the standoff between\nthe West and Iraq over Kuwait. There is\nan alternative view, namely Islam.\nHistorically the region of land which now\ncontains 46 different muslim countries,\nwas united with no false borders under a commonly implemented system which\nabove all guaranteed tranquility and\nsecurity for all who lived under it, muslim\nand non-muslim alike.\nWith the intellectual decline of the\ninhabitants of the Islamic state, the\norientalist s succeeded in dividing the state\nwith the seeds of nationalism, and over a period of a hundred years, eventually\ndestroyed it in 1924 under Mustafa Kamal\nAtaturk. After that Britain and France\ncarved up muslim land into small\ninsignificant states in accordance with the\nSykes-Picot agreement of 1916. From there onwards the region has been used\nby various nations to initiate conflicts of\npolitical and economic gains.\nWith regards to the latest problem in\nthe area, the American and indeed British\nobjectives have been clear as far back as\n1958.\n'...at all costs these oil-fields must be\nkept in western lands. The immediate\nproblem is whether it is good tactics to\noccupy Kuwait against the wishes of the\nruling family' Selwyn Lloyd( British\nForeign Secretary) 1958.\nAs far back as the 1970s, America has\nopenly stated that any move against her\noil interest would be met with force, even\nin using the countries of the region to\nexecute military operations against a dissenting nation. Even Margaret\nThatcher admitted that the US troops\nwere on the way before being invited by\nSaudi Arabia. Talk of establishing a permanent presence in the region of\nAmerican and UN 'peacekeepers' is\nmerely an excuse to permanently police\nthe region on America's terms. If concern\nfor aggression is the motive for the\nAmerican response, why was the Israeli\ninvasion of Lebanon in 1982 'rewarded'\nwith a so-called security zone on\nLebanese soil? If concern for small nation\nsovereignty in the face of aggression is\nthe motive why did the world community\nstand still when the US invaded Panama\nlate in 1989 killing up to 7,000 in o cent civilians in the process? Why US\nhegemony in Grenada, Nicaragua, Tripoli\nin 1986, or as recently as 1990 in the\nPhilippines? Britain is not blameless; do\nwe not remember that Britain supported\nthe US veto of the UN Security council\nresolution condemning US action in\nPanama, support which has been given\non many other occasions.\nTo believe that international law and\nthe UN is impartial and just, is naive.\nSince 1970, 67 UN resolutions have been\nvetoed by America because it didn't comply with her interest in the regions\nconcerned.\nSurely it stands to reason if international\nlaw is to be impartial and just, then it\nshould logically apply in all circumstances\nwhether it is pro or anti, any of the five\npermanent members. However the reality\nis quite different, as is clear to see.\nFurthermore, despite all the 'bravado' of\ndefending democracy and freedom the\nUN itself is an un-democratic institution\nwhere ONLY five states have the right to\nveto!! It is nothing more than a dictatorship of five permanent members,\n'a democracy of dictatorship'.\nWhen South Africa invaded Namibia, no\nmilitary force was sent to liberate\nWe have no eternal\nallies, we have no\neternal enemies, our\ninterests are eternal\nand perpetual' Lord\nPalmer st on1848. Namibia from illegal occupation, no\nbombing missions were sent over\nJohannesburg to impose UN resolutions.\nOn the contrary, American officials called\nfor 'quiet diplomacy' which lasted twenty\nyears.\n'One million people killed, over 6 billion\ndollars damage caused by South Africa's aggression against Namibia and its\nneighbours.' (UN Economic Commission\non Africa.)\nEventually South Africa agreed for a partial withdrawal on the condition that\nthis was linked to a partial withdrawal by\nCuban forces. So much for non-linkage\nand not rewarding the aggressor.\nThe constant manipulation of public\nopinion in the media is perverting an\nobjective understanding of the world situation. The daily bombardment by the\nmedia and politicians alike of 'no linkage!'\nor 'Saddam's brutality' and the apparent\nacceptance by the masses in the west\nindicates an extremely shallow mentality.\nIf they are so concerned then what\nhappened to the barrage of in-depth\nPanorama programmes on 'Saddam's psychology'. Didn't they have the\nrelevant information three years ago\nwhen he gassed 5,000 people in Halabja,\nor was it not in their interest?\nFurthermore, why did Britain renew\ncredits to Iraq worth millions a few days\nafter the incident when Amnesty\nInternational released the news?\nWhy did America, Britain, Israel,\nGermany, and France break the\ninternational weapons embargo against\nIraq and Iran to supply them with\nweapons to kill each other?\nWhat happened to all this sweet talk of\n'human values'? Was it not America in\n1975 who sanctioned the invasion of East\nTimor by Indonesia resulting in the mass\ngenocide of 200,000 people (reported by\nAmnesty International). Commenting on\nthis, the then US ambassador to the UN(1975),a Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote\nin his memoirs:\n'The US wished things to turn out as\nthey did and worked to bring this about'\nThe UN is but a useful tool of its\npermanent members. If we examine its\norigins we find that the so-called\ninternational law was established back in\n1761 in response to the Islamic law\n(Sharia) of the Islamic state of the time.\nThe international law which formed the\nbasis for the League of Nations and then\nthe UN had its roots in Christian family\nlaw, and was pieced together in Prussia\n(today Germany). International law is\nnothing more than a response to a particular situation a few hundred years\nago. It has no rational basis, unlike\nIslamic law.\nDo we believe that the cause of human\nrights in the world are enhanced by\nplacing a boycott against 17 million\npeople in Iraq and Kuwait? Whatever\nhappened to the right for food and\nclothing?\nThe policy of Britain and America is to\nbuild up their political agents with\nequipment to be used against the people,\nand who will serve their interest.\nDouglas Hurd said last November: 'the\nattack on Kuwait is an attack on the new\nworld order'. In response, James Baker\nsaid: 'No one will be allowed to tamper\nwith the new world order, and we are\ndetermined to use force against that.'\nIsn't it time that you too spent some\ntime to study the alternatives to\nAmerica's new world order. Why are the\ncommentators so afraid of increasing\nIslamic awareness among the people of\nthe region? Why does America literally\njump at the opportunity to discipline the\nerrant puppet? And most telling of all why do you not question the real motives\nbehind the most destructive attack upon\nthe country in the history of mankind?\nCan you really believe in and endorse a way of life built solely upon economic\nbenefit?\n\n"

    "content": "Toxic!\nRight, for those of you who don't know very much about the comic\nindustry, a little bit of background:\nFor many years the stalwart of the British\ncomics industry has been 2000AD.A huge number of the British artists and\nwriters who've since gone on to bigger\nthings and critical acclaim started off\nwriting or drawing strips for it.\nA few months ago several of these guys\ngot together and decided that it would be\na really cool idea to start their own\ncompany. So they did. They also got hold\nof lots more of the talented British\ncreators, and persuaded them to work for\nthem. Then they thought they'd better\nproduce a comic.\nThus was born TOXIC!, an A4, full\ncolour weekly. But what about a review?\nWell, starting with the cover: It's gross.\nBut in an endearing kind of way. The\nmain artwork is a rather tasteful picture\nof a guy bearing more than passing\nresemblance to a nasty green dinosaur,\ncarrying a gun bearing the literate\ninscription 'Saur Ya Coming, Bronto\nBreath!'. In the background is the equally\ncivilised Marshal Law, politely noting that\nthe a fore mentioned, and jolly attractive\nchap should 'Consider yourself...\nEXTINCT!', which is hardly surprising\nconsidering that the Marshal has just\nblown a two foot wide hole the blok e's chest.\nInside there are four strips, three of\nwhich are the first parts of series, the last\npainted by the fast-becoming-legendary\nSimon Bisley, which is excellent. Of the\nother three, Mufo Maniac is the weakest.\nThe Marshal Law story is, typically, very\ngood, although not as brilliant as it has\nbeen in the past, but it looks like it'll be\ngetting better. The best of them is\nAccident Man, with some excellent visual\nhumour.\nTOXIC! is being pushed as a new stand comic, that is, not just for 'comic fans'.\nApocalypse want it to be sold in news-agents, and are trying to appeal to the\n'general pubic'. This obviously puts it into\ncom pet ion with 2000AD, and indeed it\npushes the boundaries of even my sense\nof coincidence that 2000AD has just gone\ntotally full colour (TOXIC! is full colour\nthroughout). However, TOXIC! appears to\nbe aimed at a more adult audience than\n2000AD, even given the latter's recent\nmatur is ation( is that a real word?)(Not\naccording to my dictionary... Reviews\nEd.).\nIn conclusion, the first issue is generally\ngood, and with the arrival of Dan Abnett\n(of Felix interview fame) as editor it\nshould improve. To sum up, it's worth a quid (and it only costs 99p!), but it tends\nto be slightly more sick than neccessary\nin places and it's potential has not been\nrealised. With time it should be, and\nsome of the up and coming strips sound\nexcellent. With the amount of talent\nbehind it, it should be a big success. I liked it. But then I'm a real sicko\nanyway...\nAlien Sex Fiend\nNight Sun\ni From the opening notes of the\nscore you can tell that this is an\n'arty' sort of film. The credits\nappear (in Italian) with a small subtitle\ntelling the audience who subtitled the\nfilm.\nThe film opens showing a small boy in\n19th century costume standing under a blossoming tree with his hand held out.\nThe camera pans around the impressive\nrocky mountainous landscape and returns\n360 degrees to the boy, who still has his\nhand held out. Eventually a blossom falls\ninto his hand, and he leans against the\ntree, thanking God for this wondrous gift.\nThis rather tacky beginning is necessary\nto set the character of the film, but is by\nno means representative. Next scene; the\nboy has grown into a handsome young\nman, Sergio Giuramondo (Julian Sands),\nquite un surprisingly a bit of a lady's man.\nThe king arranges for him to be married\nto an ex-mistress of his, Christina\n(Nastassja Kinski). Before the wedding,\nChristina confesses to Sergio, that she has\n'loved before'. Not able to bear the\nshame, he does not even stay to hear her\nout, running from the room.\nAfter this, he cannot face the world he\nknows, so he becomes a monk. Not even\nthis provides enough solitude for the\ntroubled Sergio, he becomes a hermit,\nforcing ever increasing hardships upon\nhimself in an effort to find his soul. Many hear of this handsome hermit living on\nthe hill. One woman, bored and in search\nof a little sport decides to try and seduce\nhim. He barely manages to keep his self-control, mainly by staring out of the\nwindow, praying, and inflicting pain on\nhimself (He chops off one of his fingers).\nThe woman leaves his hut, a changed\nperson, and from this his reputation as a saint spreads.\nAs more people visit Sergio, they bring\ngifts. Eventually,his shack gets\nredecorated, and all that he has struggled\nto avoid finds him again. The site of\nhermitage becomes a pilgrimage for all\nand sundry, and his sainthood is\ncommercialised. Among his visitors is a young girl, Matilda, a thinly masked\nanalogy to the devil.\nThe girl seems quite harmless and has\ncome to have her aversion to daylight\ncured by the 'miracle worker'. By using\nfairly direct methods, Matilda manages to\nseduce Sergio, and he once again must\nleave, having totally lost his grip on the\nquest for the truth. OK, so I 've given\naway most of the plot. This doesn't matter. The acting is superb, and the\natmosphere is enough to carry you with\nthe characters for the length of the film.\nIt is never fast, but always has pace\nenough to hold the attention.\nAt last, a film that leaves you thinking.\nIf you are sick of Rocky 72 or 'Three\nmen and a carbon based life-form' then\nthis is for you; it's a bit out of the\nordinary and it's beautiful.

Maybe this is I.C. mentality -male:female ratio creating a different\natmosphere than at other universities -but this is quite disturbing. Every time\nthere is an Ents Event these people are\ndetermined to get in without paying. Not\nonly is this unfair to the people who have\npaid, but, in recent weeks, it has also\nbeen unnecessary as the event has been\nfree - or reduced entry price - earlier\nin the evening, for entertainment which is\nexe pti on ally good value anyway.\nMy belief is that the problem lies with\nindividuals believing it is 'hard' or\n'macho' to try to get in free each week.\nBollocks.\nThe people you are harming are\nultimately yourselves. If the Ents\nCommitee refuse to put up with the\nverbal and physical abuse thrown at them\nevery week, it is likely that they will stop\nvolunteering to help run events -something that is done for enjoyment\nsupposedly. This is becoming quite likely.\nIf this is the case then Ents Events will\nstop and, probably more importantly to\n\"he Alcohol-Worshippping Morons out\nthere, no more bar extensions. Is it too\nmuch to ask that the Ents Commitee be\nallowed to enjoy an event too?\nIn addition, the event on Friday was\nsold-out. When an event reaches full\ncapacity - a figure decided before the\nevent, based on safe fire limits - then\nthe person responsible for the event (i.e. me) has to ensure no more people are\nallowed into the building/event. The\nlimits are not negotiable, and, once the\nmaximum no. of tickets has been sold,\nno-one else gets in, even if people leave,\nas these people can return during the\nevent. Hopefully now, the stupid people\nwho caused trouble on Friday night will\nunderstand this, and if they want to, will\nget to the event earlier.\nThere are a few options to alleviate the\nproblem, including refusing admission\nafter 11pm and stopping bar extensions.\nThe options will have been discussed by\nthe time you read this.\nI feel sorry for the majority of people\nwho come to events, don't cause any\ntrouble and really enjoy themselves. It is\nunfair that their entertainment is spoiled\nby the minority of pissed-up people who\nhave such a problem with the egos that\nthey need to cause as much trouble as\npossible on the door.\nThese people are Sad Bastards and\nmake I.C. what it is. The violent tactics\nemployed by certain individuals should\nnot be allowed to continue. It should be\nstopped now, before it's too late.\nThanks to everyone who had a good\ntime on Friday and didn't cause hassle.\nRemember to bring your Union Cards this\nFriday. Many thanks to all those who\nhelped out.\nBJ (Ents Chairman)\non behalf of the entire Ents Commitee\nUseless w hinging Dear Sir,\nAs a result of recent mental illness I feel almost obliged to defer the second\nyear of my mathematics degree.\nIn the course of beginning to resolve\nmy, considerable, debts, I decided (finally)\nto obtain my ICU and ULU cards, to\nwhich I am entitled.\nAs a registered student of IC Mr B Turner cannot in law prevent me from\nobtaining these cards (which are, as we\nknow, very useful).\nI have been to registry and confirmed\nthe facts of the matter and believe you\nme; the next time I personally hear that\nMr Turner has been so shoddy in his\nbehaviour to an IC student, I will, through\nULU do my best to get that bureaucrat\ndropped on from a considerable height.\nName withheld by request.\nJust to clear this up: Having defer ed your second year you are no longer a registered student, thus you are not\nentitled to your ICU and ULU cards.\nRegistry told you that y pu were as\nthey had not, at that time, been\ninformed of your withdrawal. When\nyou approached Mr Turner he offered\nto give you the cards, valid up until\nthe date at which you were going to\nwithdraw, but you refused his offer.\nThere are a lot of things wrong with\nthis Union, but they aren't helped by\npointless w hinging.

    "content": "Richard Crouch and Chris Stapleton investigate...\nIdeal Kitchens\nThe Kitchens of Distinction are a criminally overlooked band, possibly\nbecause they're difficult to categorise:\nthey don't sound quite like anyone else.\nTheir songs abound with strange\nmelodies, interwoven textures, a yearning, forlorn hope, flashes of irony.\nThe second album, Strange Free World, is\nout this week and it's a cracker. If you've\nnever heard them, try the current single\nDrive That Fast.\nDan from Kitchens of Distinction lives\nin Tooting Broadway. We met him there\nin a quiet pub; Dan got the drinks in,\nthen talked freely about being a professional kitchen. We kept the drinks\ncoming and threw in the occasional\nquestion...\nI'm Dan, I play drums, Julian plays guitar\nand Patrick plays bass, sings and writes\n9 9 % of the lyrics. It's just us three and\nlots of effects pedals.\nThe thing about the history of the band\nis that it's ultimately so boring that we lie\nabout it all the time. We fucked around a while as a hobby, never thinking that\nwe'd do anything any good, and then\nsometime in 1987 we made a little 7\"\nrecord; it was really atrocious, but it got\nus some gigs in London. So we've been\naround since about 1987, but I only gave\nup my job in 1989, I 've only been a professional kitchen for about two years.\nThe other boys gave up theirs before me,\n1 was the last one to jump over the cliff\ninto the Rock Abyss! It was a pretty\nheavy thing to do really. But it was\nalright. When I left my job I thought\n'Fucking brilliant\u2014it's the best thing I 've\never done!'. And it is.\nWe've been really lucky, but we're not\none of those bands that gets on the front\ncover of a music paper and then is very\nfamous. It doesn't matter. Just as long as\nyour latest record is better than the last\none you did, that's the most important\nthing. And we're all really happy doing\nwhat we're doing, because each record\nthat we've do en HAS been better than\nthe last one. People try and make you\nbigger than you actually are\u2014that's what\nhappens with bands eventually. The core\nof the band is music and all around it are\npeople saying, 'Ooh, I really hope you're\ngoing to be big, I really hope you'll do\nthis and that,' and the record company is\nsaying 'You've got to sell this amount of\nrecords,' and you've got press like NME and Melody Maker who want you to be a certain kind of band, but essentially it's all about music, and if we weren't happy\ndoing what we're doing we wouldn't do\nit. - \u00ab\u2022*\u2022 \"\nFelix: So you do it for purely artistic\nreasons?\nAnd to make a living from it! We are at\nthe moment. We get most of our money\nfrom gigs. We get a small advance from\nOne Little Indian (KOD's record label), a royalty advance to live on every year,\nbut it's just enough to live on, that's all.\nThe thing is, um, we don't sell a lot of\nrecords, so we're not going to make\nmoney from selling records. Well, we\nhaven't yet, anyway. But it's alright. I'm much happier. I used to earn a lot more\nmoney when I was working, but it was a bunch of shit.\nFelix: what do you think now when\nyou ask yourself 'What am I going to\nbe doing in five years?'\nWell I don't ask myself that anymore\u2014\nI 've become a complete existentialist, just\nliving for the day. I can't think more than\na month/two months ahead, and I'm happy because I always was like that,\ngetting pushed into thinking about\nmoving, changing job, it's just society,\nthat's all, and we're lucky enough to be\nin this little playground called 'music'\nwhere we're doing a job that we like\ndoing. In fact it's not even a job\u2014the only\ntime we've considered it being a job was\njust before we got a manager. We had\nstarted freaking out because we're no\ngood as managers; dealing with record\ncompanies, all the rubbish that goes\naround a band became too much and\nthat's when we started thinking 'It's a job\nnow, so let's get a manager and get back\nto basics which is playing music.\nFelix: You seem to have a low opinion\nof the music press.\nOh yeah, definitely. Because music isn't about words, is it? Words can't describe\nmusic really. The music press is all about\nwhat bands are doing what, are they\nbigger than so-and-so, where were they\nseen, what did they say, all this sort of\nshit which has got fuck all to do with\nmusic!! One of America's saving graces, is\nthat it's got a massive college radio\ncircuit which means that your records,\neven if you're a little pid d ly band and\nyou don't matter over here, will get\nplayed in America, and getting the\nrecords played is what it's all about as far\nas I'm concerned. We find it really\ndifficult to get played over here on the\nradio. We can get some press but that\nmeans bugger all! That's my pet hate,\nactually. I mean, I like a lot of the\njournalists that we've met\u2014about half of\nthose we met are nice and they're the\nsort that like bands, but when you get\nonto the higher level and you're nearing\neditor status, they've just got BIG EGOS and they're on some kind of trip about,\noh, I can do something for this band...I'm just not into that at all.\nFelix: Is the rest of the band as\nidealistic as you are?\nYeah, definitely. The others are probably\na little bit more respectful about the\npress. That's no bad thing. But I haven't had a lot to prove me wrong, really. I mean we've got a small country and\nwe've got so many magazines and papers\ncoming out about indie music and yet it's not on the radio! That imbalance is\npathetic! For that sort of coverage of\nindie music there should be indie radio\nstations playing indie music all day, but\nthere isn't, there's just a few shows every\nweek.\nFelix: How do you approach\nsongwriting?\nMusic comes first\u2014once we've got some\nbasic ideas we usually go into a room\nand play. We'll have some songs that\nwe've got going already so we have\nsomething concrete to play on, and then\nwe'll have some more experimental stuff\nand occasionally something happens, but\nthe lyrics always come last.\nAt the moment we've got this Kitchens\nsound, and that's really good. It's not\nbased on anybody else. Julian's got a whole head ful of melodies, and then\nPatrick adds a discordant melody and\nthere's all these things going on...some of\nthe music is so dense you have to work\nto pull out all the different parts of it. It's like\u2014have you seen Spinal Tap? We're\nvery lucky to have two visionaries in the\nband: Julian's fire and Patrick's ice and\nI'm somewhere inbetween, like lukewarm\nwater.\nBelow: Richard Crouch (left) with\nDan, the drummer, in a Tooting\nBroadway public house.\n21\n\n"

    "content": "The Friends of Palestine Society give their view of the Jewish\nSociety exhibition.\nThe Many Sided Coin OPINION\nThe exhibition staged in the J CR on 19,\n20 and 21 February 1991 by the Jewish\nSociety has caused distress and concern\namong many students because of its\nderogatory tone and implications about\nseveral Middle-Eastern leaders, and in\nparticular Yasser Arafat, chairman of the\nPLO and President of the State of\nPalestine. I was asked by several overseas\nsociety representatives to put together the\nfollowing comments and corrections,\nwhich I shall limit to only two points.\nFirst, the issues of terrorism. The\ndesigners of the exhibition falsely\nattribute 'terrorism' to the PLO and to its\nmain constituent element Fatah, which is\nMr Arafat's own factions. They contend\nthat the PLO is a terrorist organisation,\nand that its elected leader, Mr Arafat, is\nalso a terrorist. Such derogatory\nstatements about the PLO chairman\nArafat and his faction Fatah are without\nfoundation because the so-called\nPalestinian terrorism is nothing more than\nthe struggle for liberation of Palestine,\nmuch like the struggle for the liberation\nof Kuwait, and in particular, of the areas\nof Palestine which were reserved by the\nUN for the Arab State in 1947, and which Israel has usurped. It goes without saying\nthat these areas include and exceed the\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip. The\nPalestinian struggle for the liberation is\njustified by a number of UN resolutions,\nby the UN Charter and by international\nlaw. It is obvious that to describe the\nstruggle of the Palestinians against Israel's usurpation of their ancestral homeland as\nterrorism is tantamount to distortion of\nthe facts and to misleading opinion.\nThe originators of the exhibition appear\nto forget that real terrorism in Palestine\nwas initiated and is still continued by\nZionist Jews and by the State of Israel. As examples that are in no way exhaustive,\nit is sufficient to cite the campaign of\nviolence and terror directed by Jewish\nterrorists at British and Palestinians alike,\nsuch as the bombing of the King David\nHotel at Jerusalem on July 22 1946,\nwhich was the seat of the government,\nkilling 91 of its senior officials; the\ncapture and hanging of British officers,\nthe dynamiting of homes over the heads\nof their occupants in Arab residential\nquarters; bombings of Arab market\nplaces, and the notorious and heinous\noutrage committed on April91948 involving the Irgun (a Zionist terrorist\norganisation led by Menachem Begin); the\nmassacre of 250 men, women and\nchildren at Deir Yassin, 'without any\nmilitary reason or provocation of any\nkind' as reported by Jacques De Reynier,\nthe Chief Delegate of the International\nRed Cross at the time.\nIsraeli terrorism was not limited to acts\nthat took place during the British\nmandate but continued during and after\nthe war of 1948 by the deportation of\none million Palestinians, the destruction\nof several hundred Arab villages, the\nbrutal repression of the uprising since\n1987 in the West Bank and Gaza District,\nO.S. C. Statement\nFor three consecutive days, from 19 to 21\nFebruary 1991, IC Jewish Society hosted\na controversial exhibition in the JCR. The\nsociety made no secret of the fact that\nthe exhibition was designed by Israelis in\nTel-Aviv and occupied Jerusalem, and\nactually released their names (Messrs Y Hofshi and I Brosh). Because of its strong\npolitical statements and allegations, the\ndisplay angered a very large number of\nstudents. Clearly provocations of this\nnature threaten the concord between\nstudents of different origins and\nbackgrounds at Imperial.\nIt is quite unacceptable, especially in\ndifficult times filled with political\nuncertainty, for a society to ignite a\" political argument that has no place in\nthe College. All other societies, especially\nthose whose members are directly\naffected by the recent conflict, have kept\nquiet on purpose in order to preserve the\ngentle and peaceful student relations. In\nthe past there has been a strong\ncommitment by all clubs and societies to\nabide by their constitutions, and with\nrespect and consideration for other clubs\nand societies, we all wish that it will\nremain so. However, the exhibition\nstaged a display of opinions highly critical\nof all Middle-Eastern countries and their\nregimes, openly describing them as\nmurderous, barbaric and other such\noffending comments. Paragraph 2 of the\nconstitution of the Jewish Society states:\n'The object of the society is to promote\nan appreciation of matters of Jewish and\nIsraeli interest.'. There is a fine line\nbetween promoting an appreciation of\nsomeone's interests, and alienating and\nhurting members of this college.\nIt is for all the above reasons that the\nOverseas Student Committee unanimously\ncondemns such behaviour, especially that\nit has itself always promoted and upheld\nan understanding and cordial relationship\nbetween overseas and home students.\nThe Overseas Student Committee.\nthe shooting of close to one thousand\nPalestinians, including 159 children below\n16, many of whom were less than ten\nyears old, who fought the occupation\nwith stones and finally the massacre of 21\nunarmed Palestinians on October 8 1990\nin the area of the Haram Al-Sharif at\nJerusalem, for which Israel was\ncondemned by the UN Security Council.\nFurthermore, the political defamation of\nthe PLO is accompanied by a flagrant and\nshameful defamation of Mr Arafat\npersonally. The leader of six million\npeople for over 25 years was referred to\nin cynical and foul language fit for use\nonly by those who will lower themselves\nto it.\nThe Executive Committee,\nFriends of Palestine Society.\nADS\n3 piece suite (3 seat sofa, 2\nseat sofa, armchair &\nfootstool) Moss Green, Good\nCondition\n\u00a3500\nalso:\n10 speed Raleigh Pursuit\nRacer\nMale 22\"' \u00a370.\nPhone: Dan0715864103 or Elec Eng pigeonhole \u2014 DUG LOST\nYellow Folder (A4)\ncontaining lecture notes probably\nlost in Southside on Tuesday 12th March.

    "content": "LETTERS\nMore facts and figures To join or\nDear Editor,\nIn response to Yasmin Saudi's article\nentitled 'Facts and Figures', I would like\nto correct some of Miss Saudi's figures\nthemselves.\n'The UN General Assembly set a partition plan for Palestine in October\n1947 to create two states, one for the\nJews and one for the Arabs', and to alot\nthe Jewish State 56.6% of the land of\nPalestine of which 90% was Arab owned\nand 50% Palestinian Arab populated.\nWell 81% of the land of Palestine was\nalready in Arab hands. Britain had set up\nthe Kingdom of Trans Jordan on most of\nthe land of Palestine. The 56.6% of the\nremaining 20% allot ed to be a Jewish\nState was for the most part hostile desert\nand coastal sand dunes. 90% was not\nArab owned. British government statistics\nmaintain that prior to the state, 8.6% of\nthe land area now known as Israel was\nowned by Jews; 3.3% by Arabs who\nremained there; 16.5% by Arabs who'd left the country. More than 70% was\n' owned by the Government. Under\nInternational law, ownership passed to\nIsrael in 1948. (Survey of Palestine, 1946,\nBritish Mandate Government p.257). Thre was never a50% population of\nPalestinian Arabs in the territory\nallocated to Israel, though there was a massive population increase; the infant\nmortality amongst Moslems was recorded\nto have fallen from 19.6% in 1922 to 14%\nin 1939, the non-Jewish population soared\nby 75.2% as Jewish revitalisation of the\narea brought in thousands of Arab\nimmigrants from Syria and Egypt during\nthe mandate, Britain simultaneously\nlimiting Jewish immigration in the\nnotorious 'white papers' 1921, 1929 and\n1939. Arab increase was largest in areas\nof intensive Jewish development\u2014Jaija\n216%, Jaffa 134% and Jerusalem 90%\n(contrasted with 42% in Shechem (Nablus)\n40% in Jenin) (...statistics taken from the\nPalestine Royai Commission Report 1937\np279). The Arab immigration was undoubtedly\nhigher, as above statistics are for those\n'Palestinians' who immigrated with all the\nrequired formalities, as opposed to those\nwho crossed into Palestine quietly.\nUNRWA ultimately defined a Palestinian\nRefugee as a needy person whose normal\nresidence was Palestine for a minimum of\ntwo years preceding the outbreak of the\nconflict of 1948. Britain was of course\nrestricting Jewish immigration to 10,000 a year for five years.\n'The independence of Israel was not the\nindependence of the indigenous people of\nPalestine' how indigenous were the\nPalestinian Arabs? If we talk about\nexpulsions, surely we should differentiate\nbetween those Arabs who left temporarily\nto make room for the liberating armies of\nEgypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq, and the\nhundreds of thousands of Jews who were\nexpelled from the Arab countries.\n'White democracy does riot constitute\nan integral part of most Arab regimes, it\nis not absent. Egypt has licensed parties...'\nI know there is a measure of freedom of\nspeech in Egypt.

He\nkilled 20,000 Palestinians in 'Black\nSeptember' and many other people since\n(if Jassir Arafat is so interested in\npromoting the welfare of Palestine why\nhas he been so supportive of their worst\nenemy?).\n'It should have been specified that the\nonly states linked to terrorism are Syria,\nLibya and Iraq'.\u2014well that's Miss Saudi's words not mine. I could argue but why\nsplit hairs?\n'Violence and upheaval have been\nworsened by the impact of Israel', I think\nthe opposite is true. The only thing the\nArab states can get united about is the\nannihilation of Israel!\nAs to the rest of the article, let's just\nsay that a claim by Arafat that the\nNational Charter (which calls for the total\nelimination of Palestine as its objective,\nwith armed struggle as the only means of\nattaining the objective) is lapsed, although\nin the formal verse (illegible\u2014TS) it is still\noperative may be acceptable to Yasmin\nSaudi, but to the people of Israel, who\nremember Fatah at tro cities such as the\n'Metullah Kindergarten massacre, and\nwho have seen PLO terrorist attacks\nattempted by Fatah since the famous\n1989 declaration, are rather more\nsceptical.\nIf progress will be made in solving the\nPalestinian Problem, the Palestinians will\nneed to find a better representative than\nthe PLO.\nThey can only offer Israel peace and\nsecurity in exchange for land.

It\nshould have been held at lunchtime,\nwhen 'average' students are in the JCR,\nnot just candidate-groupies, whose mental\nagility only stretches as far as designing\nand testing paper aeroplanes during\nspeeches, and sabbaticals heckling.\nThere were, for instance, no questions\nabout the total failure by the present\nsabbaticals to publicise either the opening\nor closing of nominations, the hustings or\nthe ballot times. And this college, with\nsuch excellent printing facilities on site. A spot in FELIX (if there was one) is simply\nnot enough\u2014not even someone as\n'interested' as myself manages to procure\na copy every week. Instead, it has been\nleft to the candidates to advertise this,\none of the most fundamental events of\nthe Union calendar. Does the Union have\na Publicity Officer? If so, what does s/ he\ndo?\nAnother very grating point is that of\n'dealing with issues that relate to\nstudents'\u2014a much over-used clich e on\nThursday night. I would like to know\nprecisely how the new Union President\n(or the old one, come to that) intends to\nfight such important 'relevant' legislation\nas the deregulation of Student Unions,\nfurther deterioration of the grant system\nand increased dependence on loans, the\nabolition of Housing Benefits and the\nexpensive and futile chasing of students\nfor poll tax, without national backing...i.e. membership of the National Union of\nStudents. How one college, prestigious\nthough it is (or was), believes it can\ninfluence the government on its' own is\nbeyond me. Only with colleges united\nnationwide do students stand any chance\nof bargaining power regarding the above\nissues.\nBesides, as Paul Shanley admitted to\nme last year, this Union receives\ninformation and guidance from NUS\nLondon via ULU, so why shouldn't we\npay for it? Many poorer colleges across\nLondon manage it somehow. On asking\nsaid President whether he thought this\nsomewhat hypocritical, he simply\nshrugged. The mind boggles as to what\nexcuse next years' lot will come up with.\nWhat amazes me most is that I'm supposed to be leaning towards\n30\nnot to join?\nThatcherite right, being 'older' and in the\nManagement School. However, this place\nmakes me look positively radical, a raving lefty even. Quite stunning. If I'd known what sort of a shambles this place\nwas in, I would have stood for President\nmyself\u2014the Union could do with a decent\nmanager, judging by the shape it's in at\nthe moment\u2014but then, I didn't even get\nto hear about the opening of the\nnominations. No sign of any posters in\nmy department, anyhow.\nYour average IC student is apathetic\nand probably drink-orientated...like many\nthousands all over the country. Your\naverage post-grad is very busy under a great deal of work pressure. This Union\nstands no chance of attracting either with\nits present sloppy, non-committal,\nlacklustre attitude.\nYours,\nGaynor de Wit, MSc Management,\nThe Management School.\nP.S. Just in case you think I'm one of\nthose armchair complainers, I was\nPublicity Officer and Societies Chair (and\neven ran for President!) at my old\nStudents' Union at an engineering,\nscience and business-based college like IC,\nfull of apathetic students like IC, but at\nleast we got a decent turn out of\n'switched on' students for most Union\nevents through use of effective\nposters/campaigns/flysheet s. IC is not a member of the NUS due to\nthe result of a college-wide\nreferendum, which decided that IC\nshould d is affiliate from the NUS.\nThere have since been further\nreferendums to decide whether we\nshould remain d is affiliated.

Some replies...\n1. Andy 'Logical' Cooksley (896). Don't think about going into Law. To quote\nMonty Python, his letter \"....is interesting\nfrom the point of view of a professional\nlogician as it contains a number of\nfallacies.\"\nI believe your first point states that the\npremise that the bible is fiction is as bad\nas saying that it isn't. Whether or not it is\nfiction I will come to later; but it is\nirrelevant to the point that I was trying to\nmake. The summary of what I was saying\n(which you should have been able to\ndeduce given only one brain cell) was\nthat a majority of the population of the\nworld do not believe that the bible is\nreliable factual evidence and therefore\none cannot base an argument on it.\nSimilarly it would be no use explaining to\na barbarian with a broken Polaroid that it\nhas run out of film if he believes that it\nhas inside it a miniature artistic demon:\nyou would have to prove it to him first,\nby opening it. Of course you cannot\neasily prove the bible, and Christians\noften reply that 'God told me its true.'\nSecondly, I suggest you look up the\nwords premiss and conclusion. You could\neasily say 'Let's assume there is life after\ndeath then....' as indeed I already have in\na previous letter. But let's look at the\nnext statement: 'according to St Paul's letter to the Corinthians there is life after\ndeath.' Let's look at the two premisses: 1)\nSt Paul really wrote it. 2) St Paul was an\nauthority on the subject (he hadn't been\ndead after all). The phrase 'there is life\nafter death' has suddenly become a conclusion! Which is, in fact, the opposite\nof a premiss. So yes, you are right,\nCooksley, I would not allow it. Suddenly\nno good. It is no good because the two\npremisses are themselves deduced from\nthe premiss that the bible is true. Which\nit isn't. It amazes me that someone can sound\nso smug and self- righteous ('Hmmm,\nnovel logic.') and yet be so utterly\nincorrect! We finally have you, not on\nsome debatable point about the bible, but\non the hard fact that your letter is\nlogically, un arguable y wrong. Its\nBULLSHIT. Not only is it illogical, but you\nattempted to prove that I am illogical!! Ha\nha ha!! It is this kind of blind faith that is\ntypical of Christians.\n2. Bible, fact or fiction. Before\nconsidering the bible, lets take a look at\nDavid Gemmel's new book. It's entitled\n'The Lion of Macedonia', and is set in\nancient Greece. It details events and\nbattles that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\nAround these it details the lives and\ninteractions of various characters, some\nLETTERS\nLogic (?)\nof whom also existed. According to the\nChristian logic, because we can prove\nthat the battles etc actually happened we\ncan happily say that the book is a work\nof fact. That because the book gives\naccurate dates and places, then obviously\nthe characters actually SAID the things in\nthe book. This is the what Giles and the\nChristian hierarchy would have us believe\nabout the bible.\nYes Giles, there are many events\ndetailed in the bible that actually\nhappened. There is much evidence to\nsuggest that a meteorite hit the earth and\ncaused several days of darkness, just as\ndetailed in the bible. But according to the\nbible it happened because we crucified\nJesus. According to the bible, Moses went\ninto the hills and God carved the ten\ncommandments for him to bring back.\nWhat ACTUALLY happened was that\nMoses went off alone and came back with\nthe ten commandments which he SAID\nGod carved. I certainly believe that Moses\nexisted, but it in no way proves that God\ndoes.\nBut, I hear you cry, Jesus was\nproclaimed prophet long' before the\nmeteorite hit, so the other signs must\nhave been true, thus God made the\nmeteorite hit earth. Bollocks. We forget\nthat every hundred or, so years someone\nis born and is proclaimed prophet or son-of-god for his radical views of society. But\nonly when, by coincidence, some major\nevent like a meteorite, do people take\nthis seriously enough to record the story\nand eventually base a religion around it.\nAlso, at this point we notice that a significant number of people obviously\ntold a different story to their children as\nthe vast majority of people in the MiddleEast became Muslims. The events all\nhappened in the Middle-East and\npresumably all the people who are now\nMuslims are descendants of the people\nwho witnessed the events of the bible.\nHowever the main fault of the\nChristian's argument is that it also applies\nto the Koran and the texts of Buddhism\nand Hinduism. They do not seem to\nrealise that, by their own faulty logic,\ntheir god is only one of many, and that\nmost other religions are valid. So Giles,\neither your argument is utter bullshit, or\nthe Koran and Gemmel's book are also\nnon-fiction. Who's walking on thin air\nnow, you smug g it? And what's this about 'Jesus may or\nmay not have walked on water,\ndepending on what you believe' ? Either\nhe did, because the bible said so, or you\nhave to admit that the whole of the bible\ncontains fallacies.\nYours,\nAthena\n31\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nAbout 42 years ago a few guys got\ntogether in the Union Bar and decided\nthat as Phoenix concerned itself solely\nwith the more artistic nature of the\nwritten word, something else was needed.\nThus Felix was born.\n900 issues later, he's still alive and well,\nunlike Phoenix, which despite the rather\nspectacular nature of it's namesakes death\nrites, appears to be slowly fading away.\nHowever, not everything has changed: In\nthe very first issue of Felix there was a letter discussing the problems caused at\nsome of the 'hops' that the Union had\nrecently started, which leads me rather\nnicely on to...\nThe eternal nature of the idiot\nWhy is it? Us guys and gals are\nsupposedly amongst the most intelligent\npeople in the country, so why do some of\nus act like subhumans\nJust as an example, take last Fridays\nEnts gig in the union lounge. There was a bar extension until midnight, two bands,\nand a disco until 1.00 am. There were\ntwo constraints to entry: Firstly you had\nto pay, SI before 9.45pm, and \u00a32\nthereafter. The second was, as usual, the\nfire regulations. Only a certain number of\npeople are allowed to be in the union\nbuilding at any one time. This is a law,\nand is not negotiable.\nNow forgive me if I 've missed\nsomething, but all this sounds pretty\nreasonable to me. A quid is hardly a large amount to pay, and fire reg s are\nfire reg s. That's just the way things are.\nSo why is it that some people have to\ntry to get in for free, or try to get in after\nthe building's full? What am I missing?\nWhy does it seem stupid to me?\nI don't believe anyone could give me a convincing argument why they can't pay\na quid. As for the fire regulations, if they\ndidn't spend all night in southside (the\nmoney from which goes into the already\nswollen coffers of college), but came over\nto the Union Bar (cheaper, and the\nmoney from which goes to the Union,\nand thus back to us, the students) before\n11.30 pm, then they'd get in (and if they\nmanaged to make it before 9.45 they\nwouldn't even have to pay\" so much).\nBut instead, certain people decide that\nit would be a jolly sensible and whizz o idea to hassle and threaten the (unpaid)\nEnts staff, the (overworked) bar staff,\nsmash windows, and physically, break\ndown a door that had only just received\na new bolt, to replace the one broken last\ntime it was smashed down.\nThen providing they get in, they * ' \"\nproceed to drink those vital extra couple\nof pints (on top of the numerous ones\nthey've already drunk). Then they cause\ntrouble, look for fights, and hassle any\nfemale that they take a fancy to.\nWell, it seems sensible to me, after all,\ntheir mates must think they're really\nhard.\nJobs. Big Jobbies\nImperial, in common with most colleges\nand universities, have a careers service.\nOur careers service is affiliated to the\nUniversity of London Careers Advisory\nService (ULCAS), and thus has access to\nall of its resources (quite a few).\n'So what?' thinks you, the devoted\nreader. Well, the upper management of\nCollege (ie His Rectorness, Angus Fraser,\nthe managing director of college, and\nPeter Mee, College registrar) have\ndecided that our careers service should\nd is affiliate from ULCAS.\n'So what?' you may still think. Well,\nBen Turner, ICU Deputy President, has\nbeen doing his homework, and decided\nthat this isn'ta very good idea. Russ\nClark, the head of IC Careers Service,\nShiona llewellyn, an ULCAS careers\nadvisor, Brian Steptoe, the director of\nULCAS, and Mike Gavin, the chairman of\nthe Association of Graduate Careers\nAdvisory Service's credential committee,\nall agree with him.\nThe main objection to d is affiliation revolves around the advisors themselves.\nAt present they are trained by ULCAS,\nand have a very broad knowledge, and\nare thus able to advise in depth on a wide number of very different career\ntypes. If the careers services became\nd is affiliated the future employees would\nbe responsible to Peter Mee, and\nultimately to Angus Fraser. This could\nlead to graduates being encouraged to\nremain in their disciplines (thus lowering\nthe range of advice available). This is\nknown as a direct labour policy, and it\ncould lead to problems with AGCAS, who\nare not happy about this type of advice,\nit is absolutely vital that IC's careers\nservice remains a part of AGCAS, as this\nallows us access to the AGCAS Central\nServices Unit, which gives us advice,\ninformation, back-up, and professional\naccreditation of our careers service.\nSo, now we come to the fun part. His\nRectorness and goons have already\ndecided that we are going to d is affiliate. Before Christmas Peter Mee told Brian\nSteptoe that IC was d is affiliating( before\nany consultation that I know of). At the\nend of last term a meeting of the Careers\nAdvisors Committee was called, to discuss\n'Imperials intention to d is affiliate'( Peter\nMee's words again). They intend to make\nthe changes before the next Governing\nBody meeting, and before the next Board\nof Studies meeting.\nAccording to Paul Shanley, ICU\nPresident The only people I have spoken\nto who are agreed in principle with the\nscheme are the Rector, Angus Fraser, and\nPeter Mee.' On the 8th of March a meeting of the IC careers advisors\ncommittee decided that there was '...a strong consensus in the committee in\nfavour of option 2'. Option 2 (one of\nmany) was 'Stay in ULCAS, but bargain\nhard for a better deal'. Andrzej Skapski,\nthe chairman of the committee, has\npresented this paper to His Rectorness et\nal, but they have apparently ignored it. In\nthe opinion of Ben Turner and Paul\nShanley there has been little or no\nconsultation at any level. Angus Fraser\nwas unaware that we are unable to\nfunction independently at the moment\nwithout a start-up investment, which\nPeter Mee should have told him, so it\nappears that they haven't even consulted\namongst themselves. Clever, isn't it?\nThe reasons they have given are two-fold: Firstly they claim that it will be\ncheaper for College. This has been\nproved incorrect by Ben Turner, with\nhelp from several of the people he's spoken to. On top of this the costing\nthey've done is incorrect, as it ignores the\ninitial start-up costs to cover the loss of\nthe ULCAS facilities, especially the library\nat Gordon Square.\nSecondly, managerial accountability: At\npresent the careers staff answer to the\nUL, not IC. This can't be changed at\npresent, but in reality it makes little\ndifference. His Rectorness claims it does\nbecause he thinks there are too many\ncompanies and vacancies being advertised\noutside the field of acid emi a. So in real\nterms what He's talking about wanting to\nhave more control over the careers\nservice so that HE can decide what jobs\nare advertised, and thus what career\nopportunities are available through the IC\ncareers service. So, do you want HIM\ndeciding what kind of job you should do?\nCredits\nTypesetting and Printing: Rose and\nAndy\nNews Editor: Stef Smith\nArts Editor: Adam\nBooks Editor: Michael\nMusic Editor: John\nPhoto Editor: Richard\nFeatures Editor: Roland\nFront Cover: Stef Smith\nThe Gang: Nigel, Jonti, James, Ian, Our\nSpecial Correspondent, Liu Jian Guo,\nAdam H, Toby, Chris Riley, all the\nreviewers, etc, etc...\nThe Collators: Firstly thanks to all the\npeople who helped during the last issue.\nA list may appear in the next issue.\nSecondly (!), thanks must go to Morgana\nSystems of Milton Keynes for machine\ncollating this issue at an early hour of this\nmorning.\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed at\nthe Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB( Tel 071-225 8672).\nEditor: Andrew Butcher, Manager: Chris Stapleton,\nBusiness Manager: Jeremy Burnell.

    "content": "Football\nic2 nds Over the past two weeks the IC 2nds Juggernaut has accelerated rapidly and its\nmomentum is now ir resist able. After thrashing SOP 6-2, MX UCH were\ndestroyed 5-1. Two goals a piece for MAb do and S Barry plus another from A Jalan left the opposition shell-shocked.\nQM C were next to try their luck in a showpiece double-header. N Leonard\nscoring the fastest goal, MAb do the best\nindividual goal and S Barry another\ninevitable goal of the season so far left\nQM C30 down and out. A consolation\ngoal could only give the captain a nervous second half.\nFive minutes after the end of the first\ngame QM C came back for a second\nhelping of a nihil ation from the seconds.\n5-0 this time, goals from M Abdo, guest B Wood,S Barry and M Plurruner gave IC a four goal lead. N Leonard, the IC captain,\nthen stepped up to score the classiest and\nfinal goal of the day. Showing\nuncompromising (unknown?) skill, he\nfooled the QM C defence, and the 2nds, by\nchipping, curling and floating the ball past\nthe QM C keeper. However, his\ncelebration Samba showed he could do\nwith some more dance lessons. (Tart!)\nThree days later UC II were beaten 2-0\nwith a double strike from MAb do to seal\na hard fought victory.\nU DMS II on hearing of IC's invincibility\ndecided to stay in bed and conceded the\npoints.\nIC II's last home game of the season\nsaw the defeat of an upstart Kings II 5-2.\nTwo from S Barry and a glorious hattrick\nfrom M Plummer earned IC two points,\nand won IC 2nds, comprehensively, the\nUL U Y award of Champion Reserves. The\nvictory also set up a showdown with St\nGeorges, for the league, in the final game\nnext Saturday. Where they will find out\nthat nobody mixes it with IC 2nds and\nkeeps a clean sheet.\nFinally the captain has a few words for\nthe 2nds which he was too pissed to\nremember at the club dinner.\n'You're the best, it's official and I salute\nyou.'\nSailing Snooker\nArag g let a gg le bunch of sailors (five from\n.IC and four from London) arrived at the\nExeter Union disco late on Friday night\nand set about getting in a few beers and\ntrying to find our hosts, both proved\nhi h gly amusing past times.\nSaturday morning was cloudy with a gentle breeze. Imperial were starting the\nday as clear outsiders but determined to\nhave a good time, so it wasn't surprising\nthat, despite snapping at their heels all\nthe way, we lost both legs of the first\nmatch against Oxford. Next, however we\nsailed London and obtained a rousing\nvictory winning1,2,6 in the first leg and\n1, 3, 5 in the second).\nAfter lunch we had two very close\nraces against Plymouth, but an excellent\nstart in the first gave us the edge and\nalthough narrowly beaten in the second\nwe won the match on points. Our final\nmatch on Saturday was against Bristol\nand two very noisy races were sailed. In\nthe first a poor start left a lot of work to\ndo, but Imperial refused to be intimidated\nby Bristol's loud protests and won on\n'greens' (point penalties given to the\nopposition). The second race again\ninvolved a lot of shouting but IC was able\nto take advantage of Bristol's lack of\nconcentration to pip them at the post.\nA very merry evening was spent\nconsuming copious quantities of food (and\nsome drink as well) laid on by Exeter at\na pub, as well as social ising with the\nlocals until well into the morning (some\nof us anyway).\nSunday morning brought a miserable\nlooking day but a good stiff breeze. IC\nlost disappointingly to Exeter I( coming 4,\n5, 6 in the first race and 4th with two\ncapsizes in the second). Later Exeter II\nmade good use of picking the fastest\nboats and two poor starts by IC to win despite Imperial fighting to the end.\nImperial made it into the semi-finals\nwhere they were unfortunately unable to\novercome their shock at being there and\nlost to Oxford the eventual winners. So IC\nheaded home, stopping only to appease\ntheir raging hunger, after a great\nweekend's racing.\nLast week saw the annual Inter-Varsity\nSnooker Tournament take place in Bath\nwith IC being represented by two teams.\nThe A team got off to a good start by\nwinning all their group matches with\nrelative ease to proceed to the last 16. J Burnett (capt) led the way with his usual\ndemolition job of the opposition, ably\nsupported by J Devoys, S Contogoulas, S Gallagher and A Khan bringing up the\nrear.\nThe next round saw the team go 4-0\ndown against East Anglia A before\nmaking an excellent comeback to win 6-5\nwith J Burnett winning a memorable\nsudden-death play-off against EA's number one player.\nThe quarter final match was against\nQueens, Belfast A who had just beaten\nlast year's winners 5-0. The whole team\nplayed very solidly with A Khan compiling a50 break clearance in his\ngame. Unfortunately the A's lost the\nmatch 6-5 on literally the last ball of the\nmatch and were knocked out of the\ntournament.\nThe B team f aired less well mainly due\nto being grouped with a couple of very\ngood A teams. The team consisted of B Drinkwater (capt), N Danson, H Shah, D Ramshaw and A Michie. Most of the\nplayers managed to win a couple of good\ngames but overall they were rather\nunlucky in the fact that they lost quite a few matches by only a few points.\nClubs/Sports editor wanted\napply at me Felix office, northwest corner of Beit Quad\n\n"

But all Chinese towns are the\nsame, wide, concrete lined boulevards,\nwith sixties-style street lighting, and\ncharacter less buildings. Treat the\noverland travel as part of the trip, not an\ninconvenience. China lies between the\ntowns; the real country is in the villages.\nIt is not easy to reach these, and\nfrequently long and exhausting bus or\ntrain journeys are required. Two villages\nwhich are perhaps easier to reach than\nmost are sleepy Yangshuo amongst\nGuanxi's karst scenery in the south, and\nthe oasis town of Turfan, Xinjiang\nprovince in the west.\nFew Chinese would enjoy the sort of\npace that many foreigners set themselves.\nIt is easy to become run down. You should allow one day in four for logistics\nand ticket bookings. Some provinces fall\ninto natural pairs, such as Yunnan and\nSichuan, Gansu and Xinjiang, Tibet and\nQinghai. There are themes you can\nfollow, like sailing through China,\nconcentrating on border regions or\nminority areas, visiting Buddhist\nmountains (like E mei Shan and Huan Shan), or following the Silk Road.\nIt is possible to cross overland from\nPakistan on the Karakoram highway, or\nfrom Nepal on the Friendship Highway,\nhowever the access of these roads\nchanges from year to year. The most\ncommon route to China is on an\novernight ferry from Hong Kong. Flights\nfrom London to HongKong are over\n\u00a3300. You can fly directly to Beijing a little cheaper.\nI took the Trans-Siberian railway from\nMoscow to Beijing, (see article 'Bottom\nBunk to Beijing', Felix 896, 1 March1991). After a week in Beijing of chasing\nmoney-changers and black market train\ntickets, I gave up and flew to Xian, home\nof the Terracotta Army. An unforgettable hard-seat train journey\ntook me to Chengdu, which I used as a base for excursions to Leshan and E mei Shan. A memorable bus journey of\nunpredictable length provides a unique\ninsight into roadside village life.\nThe bone-shaking bus with broken\nwindows and bald tyres was resting in\nbay four. 'A better way to travel' was\ntattooed ominously in blood red paint\nalong the battered body work. I joined\nthe swarm of peasants round the mud15 "

    "content": "The Trials of China\nWhat strikes you immediately in China\nare the bicycles - all old-fashioned brand-new black 'Roadsters' swarming in tides.\nThe Chinese have very few private cars.\nBicycles are used for transporting\neverything from pigs in panniers to three-piece suites on rear carriers. In Shanghai\nI saw eight TV sets on one bike. When you start talking fowl, the numbers reach\nthe hundreds - with beaks, bills and\ncombs trailing on the ground and hitting\nspokes.\nTransport through China comes in a variety of forms, with all the conventional\nthird world characteristics. Other active\nmuseum pieces are the colossal black and\nred steam trains still manufactured in\nDatong. They rattle and clatter congo\nfashion through the cultivated market\ngarden country.\nThere are three classes of train ticket.\nThe cheapest ticket, the 'hard-seat' is in\nfact padded but it's hard on the stamina.\nA certain advert for cruelty to animals\ndescribes the journey of lambs being\ntransported across Europe. 'Imagine being\nlocked in a train carriage for thirty-six\nhours. You' d have nothing to eat and\ndrink. Before long you'd be collapsing\nfrom exhaustion. Now imagine the train is\ntravelling at 100 mph but there is\nnowhere to sit and nothing to hold on to.\nYou' d be thrown about, crushed and\ntrampled. If you are frail or weak you\nmay not survive. Now imagine there are\n600 people crammed in there with you.\nThat's more than five times rush hour\ncrowds.'\nWith the exception of the speed and\nfood, this could describe a Chinese hard-seat train journey. The carriage from\nXian to Chengdu had 167 seats and over\n300 people stood, spat, squawked,\ncoughed, ate, littered and smoked in the\naisles. The lights stayed on all night. I wrote in my diary:\n'After twelve hours, eighty of those\nstanding had slumped into crumpled\nheaps on the floor of the aisle, oblivious\nto the sputum, cigarettes, chewed chicken\nand fish bones, sunflower seeds and\nmelon carcasses. I attempted to reach the\ntoilet, woke thirty people, got halfway\nalong the carriage and gave up. I tried to\nsleep. Another man sank from his feet in\nthe aisle and slumped against me. We propped each other up rocking from left\nto right for the next five hours. I lost\nsight of the end of the carriage as the\nsmoking, choking atmosphere\naccumulated. A little boy opposite\nchewed a boiled egg for twenty minutes\nand then spat it over me.'\nHard-sleepers are the best value for\nmoney. The bunks are three high, the\nhighest is about two metres off the floor\nand reachable only by acrobats. The\nlower bunk is communal by day and\nconsequently fills with crumbs and\ncigarette ash. The best to go for is the\nmiddle bunk, but you rarely have a choice. As a foreigner you never get\noffered hard-sleepers when you buy your\nticket. The key is to take your life in\nyour hands and to buy a hard-seat ticket\nin the hope of up grading it to a hard-sleeper once on the train. When you\nboard the train you must find the\ncontroller, who usually resides in carriage\nnine. It helps if you have the words 'hard-seat change to hard-sleeper' written down\nin Mandarin.\nSoft-sleepers are for high ranking party\nofficials, and the cream of China's 'classless' society. They are equipped with\nwood panelling, potted plants, lace\ncurtains, 'teacup sets, carpets and fully\noperational air conditioning.\nof the rack. They remain standing,\npushing and squatting, oblivious to the\ndemands that they sit down and fasten\ntheir seatbelts. The 'plane bounces in and\nskids uncontrollably along the runway.\nThe most preferable form, by far, of\ntransport in China is the boat.\nUnfortunately, most rivers run east-west\nand so you are restricted to routes along\nthe Yangtse from Chongqing to Shanghai,\nor from Canton to Wu zhou up the Pearl\nRiver.\nTo do any sort of travelling you need\nto understand the money. There are two\nkinds of money in China: people's money\nor 'RMB', pronounced rem-em-bee and\ntourist money, ' FEC, standing for foreign\nexchange certificates. This system has\nBuses, like anywhere in Asia, are cheap\nand long past retiring age. Since buses\nstop everywhere you get to see bits of\nthe countryside you wouldn't see on the\ntrains.\nFrom Beijing there are flights in every\nconceivable direction. China Airways\n(CAAC) have an unenviable safety record,\nand lose more planes each year than any\nother airline. The only emergency\ninstructions come garbled through the\nloudspeakers in Mandarin as you rush full\nthrottle along the runway. If you collect\nenough in-flight magazines you can\nfathom out where the exits are. Air conditioning comes in the form of a paper fan which you flap, nervously\nwishing you were in a hard-seat on a train. About ten minutes into the air and\nalong comes the in-flight meal - a packet\nof nuts and an ice cream.\nTwo hours later, they announce that we\nwill be landing shortly. Everyone stands\nup and begins to yank their bundles out\nonly been created in the last decade in\nan attempt to exploit tourists as much as\npossible. The creation of FEC has caused\na black market. Where ever you travel in\nChina you encounter the 'Money\nChangers' - a curious breed of parasitic\npeople who eke out a living on the\nstreets trading R MB for FEC. In the bank,\nrates are 1:1, but on the street in 1988 it\nwas almost 2:1. In the summer of 1990\nthe rate had dropped to 1.25:1. This\nmeans that every 100 FEC you get for\nyour travellers cheques is worth 125 R MB on the street. Confused? You will be.\nThe currency is called the 'Yuan'. There\nare ten 'Mao' to the Yuan and ten 'Fen'\nto the Mao. This means there are 100\nFen to the yuan. The yuan is also called\nthe 'Quy' (pronounced cu-wu-eye) and the\nMao is also called the Jiao.\nIn theory all foreigners have to buy\neverything in FEC. However, you can\npurchase false work cards which say you\nteach English in Beijing for example.\n14\n\n"

    "content": "The Slow Moving Snail on the trail of reality...\nBooks for Revolution\nI write this for you to read. It is a means\nof communicating, just like music, art,\nadvertising and scientific journals. But\nwhat can be read into what is\ncommunicated and why? What can we\nfind out by taking apart the pieces of a message? Can breaking the hidden 'codes'\nitself be a subversive activity, not only\nthreatening the stability of society but\nalso our sense of reality?\nFoucault's Pendulum is set in the world\nof academic publishing, in a time frame\nof at least four moments. The main\ncharacter waits in a museum dedicated to\nthe history of science, waiting for the\nanswer to an enigma that unfolds in long\nflashbacks, whilst the pendulum swings.\nThe enigma is wrapped in history, as told\nthrough the meaning of numbers and\nstories. A game begins, elaborating an\nultimate story. With the disappearance of\na character, the involvement of an\nun explain ably inquisitive detective and a mysterious sage who acts as if he has\nlived forever, their innocent game maybe\nbecoming more than just a story. For\nwhere does reality begin...?\nThis book is a scientist's nightmare,\nlosing their tightly gripped security\nblanket of an objective reality - losing it\nin a world that they use to weave that\nblanket, the history of science. Structured\ninto many short chapters, this long book\nconstructs, on a foundation of increasing\nsuspense, a mystery of magic, knowledge\nand power. For the transformation of\nsitting in a chair into an adventure just\nadd one ingredient, Umberto Eco's book.\nIf you have not yet read Eco's first bestseller The Name of the Rose then read it.\nThe Professor of Public Understanding of\nScience, John Durant, uses its plot to\nreview a new book, Alan Gross's 'The\nRhetoric of Science'. The concept of a book and its ad vocation of a particular\nstyle of expression or analysis - in 'The\nName of the Rose' it is comedy - as a threat to the established power is an\nevocative image. It has often been used\nin marketing books, or religions.\nThe art of selling statements as\nknowledge is the theme of Gross's book.\nThreatening the world of objectivity,\nclaiming that truth is socially constructed.\nDurant defends truth in his review, being\n'almost embarrassed at having to spell it\nout'. Yet there are exciting attempts to\nexplain the history of ideas without\nreference to their truth value. Shapin and\nSchaffer have published a book that\nexamines the foundation of the Royal\nSociety and its attempts to establish\nexperiment as the proper foundation of\nnew knowledge. A battle between the\nphilosophers and the experiment a lists, seeking social and political stability via a knowledge that itself was stable in its\ncertainty. Leviathan and the Air Pump\nlooks at the relationship between Hobbes\nand Boyle in the seventeenth century.\nShapin and Schaffer sell their idea well.\nThis attempt to socio log ize the history\nof science has itself been interpreted as a fight on political grounds, the sociologists\nbeing seen as left-wing radicals\nundermining the objectivity of history!\nWhen Wells was a student here he was\nso bored in lectures and practicals that he\nwould visit the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum to forget the world of science\nstudies. A new exhibition and associated\nbook was launched there just last month.\nThey are called The Art of Selling Songs\nand analyse the historical development\nand contemporary trends in marketing\nmusic. Intertwining technological changes\nwith the skill of transforming musical\nthemes into printed symbols. Explaining\nwhat goes into the design of the\nwrapping for this commodity. The book is\nbeautifully illustrated, with over eighty\ncolour prints and ninety black and white.\nThis is the first attempt to analyse the\nhistory of marketing music. Students can\nbuy copies at the reduced price of \u00a39:95,\norder via Book Reviews, Felix Office\n(normal price \u00a314:95). \"\nAt Imperial the historians of science are\nbreaking-new ground in their research\ninto the portrayal of science in public\njournals and newspapers. Also they are\nexamining the iconography of popular is t books, in their selling of ideas. This\ncollege has some wonderful hidden\ncorners where you can find the cracking\nof the authority of stereotyped science.\n'...we put ourselves in a position to realise that it is ourselves and not reality that is responsible for what we know.

Approximately a month ago\nI phoned W.E. A. to inquire about the up\ncoming R.E.M. promotional visit- given in the music press. I was told that in fact\nthe article in Melody Maker was incorrect\nand that R.E.M. were not coming to\nEngland at all.\nSeveral weeks later, 13.3.91, R.E.M. were playing a live set on Radio 1. The following morin gI phoned W.E. A and\nasked, seeing as their plans had changed,\nwas there any chance of a press\nconference, or maybe an interview (ever\nthe optimist). I was told that all press was conducted the day before, and that there\nwas no chance of any more promotion. I was given the name of a woman who was handling R.E.M.' s visit and as a departing sentence I was told, 'Oh, and\nby the way, they (R.E.M.) are playing two\nsecret gigs at the Borderline, one tonight\nand the other tomorrow.' I phoned the\nwoman who told me that there was no\nchance of an interview, no chance of a press conference and no guest list.\nThe Borderline was engaged all day, and\nso I decided to go there to see if I could\npurchase tickets (5.30 pm). I' was told that\nall tickets for both gigs were sold out\nthree weeks ago. I waited several hours\nto see if I could get in. It became\napparent as the ticket holders arrived that\nonly record company officials, musicians\nand people in the know who had access\nto them.

Despite a rather\nstilted stage presence, Soul Family\nSensation produced a powerful, and most\nimportantly, dance able sound. The female\nvocalist was completely spot on. However, the male vocalist sounded like\nhe should have been in another n guitar\nband, and if you think on, the two just\ndon't mix. Oh, and the keyboard players\nneed to try some of those 'Wacky Mars\nBars' (see other review!!) before they do\nanything good.

Deftly\navoiding the Mancland scene (they hail\nfrom Colne, 30 miles away), not wearing\nbaggy stripped shirts, swinging jeans or\npudding bowls they have produced an\nalbum more grow able than Jack's beanstalk. From the passionate pop of\n'Apple Green' and 'Which way should I Jump?' to the more moody numbers on side two they show a maturity that one would normally expect from a bands\nthird or fourth offering. Any band that\nuses guitars will inevitably be compared\nto REM and U2 and, considering their\nroots, all the shaggy bands as well. They\nmix all the best elements together,\nleaving all the chaff and taking the\nkernels.

Slowdive\nproduce a wonderful sound from within\nthemselves, like dew in the cool morning,\nwashing away the grey ness of the night.\nThis review is utter bollocks but the\nband's good anyway.\nHarry Cross\nRide Today Forever\nRide's fourth EP shows a slight mellowing\nin their style.

We got a boog y box, and Tim had an acoustic\nguitar and we sang live. We advertised it\nin Time Out as a gig, and all these people\ncame on the train until we eventually got\nthrown off by the police. We went on the\nplatform and people started giving us\nmoney!\nAll the time we were recording stuff\nand approaching record companies but\nnothing was coming of it. The big turning\npoint came when a station agency\nbecame interested,in us, and they got us\ngigs. We supported everyone from The\nGypsy Kings down to Sigue Sigue Sputnik.\nWe supported absolutely everybody, and\nwe got better as well. Lots of people\nstarted to come and see us play live.\nEventually we signed to Virgin, foolishly,\nand the rest is history really.\nWhat happened to the first album?\nIt was released'89. We were signed to a subsidiary of Virgin called Head and we\nreleased our first single, called Piece of\nYou\u2014a house y, pop track. They really\nbelieved in it. They thought it was going\nto be really big, and so did we, but it\nwasn't. It tickled the top 100, at\nsomething like 79, and then dropped\nstraight out of the charts.\nAt the time it was considered to be a house track: you can see how long ago it\nwas as radio 1 were only having one\nhouse track play listed per week. So we\nwere fucked. We didn't get any support\nfrom the radio and after that we were\nstuck. Virgin just got cold feet. We\nbelieved at the time that they knew what\nthey were talking about, but they didn't. The main thing we learnt from that is\nnever, ever compromise on the music.\nWould you re-record them?\nWe still do some of them now, but they\nbelong to Virgin unfortunately. We do\nthem live but its a real piss-off 'cause\nsome of them are really good songs. So\nwe've learnt never to compromise.\nWhen was Hippychick recorded?\nIt was done 2 years ago.\nI first heard it on Happydaze, the\nGary Crowly project.\nYeah he was really good. It was so\nhelpful. The only thing we noticed about\nit was that there were no women on it,\nand no black artists. I'm quite proud of\nthe fact that we are on it.\nHave you experienced any racism in\nthe music industry?\nYeah. We've had people say to us, when we were trying to get a deal in the first\nplace, 'its white men who are doing what\nyou are doing'. You should leave it to\nthem to make indie music. You should be\nsinging like Chaka Khan, and he meant it.\nHe wasn't being nasty he just believed it.\nHe thought that what we were doing was\nnot right for two black women to do. I couldn't believe it\u2014but when he said that\nI went absolutely livid. I gave him a mouthful. I haven't forgotten it to this\nday.\nHow did you go down in America?\nWe were visiting radio stations and they\nhad copies of Hippychick with no vocals\nand were saying, 'go on then, sing'. After\none radio station we did, when we got\nback to the record company,-they\nthought it was a joke, but he (the DJ)\nwanted us to crumble. They've got such a big deal about people 'tracking' (singing\non records) over there.\nWhat do you think about Sinead ()'\nConnor, and the fuss surrounding\nher?\nWe actually went to the station that\nsmashed her records on air. We went\nthere and they didn't know us from\nAdam, all they knew was that we were\nEnglish, and the minute we walked in\nthey said, on air, 'What do you think of\nthat Sinead O' Connor? What do you\nthink of that fucking bitch?' I was\ncompletely flabbergasted. I said, 'err, well,\nI really like her records', and then after\nthey had done with s lagging her off, I asked him (the DJ) what it was all about\nand he said they will never play her\nrecords again and she was terrible. I really like her. I don't like her music, but\nI really admire her.\nNobody has really stood with her over\nwhat she's said have they?\nI think that's typical. You can compare it\nwith when people have asked us, 'Why\nwasn't Hippychick a hit?' and we said,\nwell, you didn't play it. People, later on,\nask why are we s lagging off people like\nRadio 1, but we're not, we're just telling\nthe truth. It's what happened, it's fact, but\npeople are complaining about it.\nWe've always had to fight. It's no\ndifferent now, just because we've had one\nhit single. It's good in that it happened\nwhen people were listening to us. That's probably why it upset so many people:\nwe were having a hit when most people\nwere too scared to say anything. We\nwere sat in the BBC and it was our first\nTop of the Pops. We'd just got in the\ncharts and we all decided if they said\n'take the sticker off the guitar' and 'don't wear the dresses' we'd go home - that\nwould have meant that hippy chick would\nnot have got to number eight.\nJust talking to Soho made us realise\nthat stardom hasn't gone to their\nheads. Commenting on future plans\nthey said:\nThey're pulling the album from the shops\nto re-promote it on the back of the new\nsingle, Love Generation. We are going to\ncarry on anyway, when we first recorded\nHippychick, released it, and it wasn'ta hit, we just carried on. That's what we'll\ndo. We can record at home anyway,\nwe've got the equipment to do it. The\nminute we go along with everyone else,\nit always goes wrong for us, but the\nminute we just do what we do, and don't give a damn, and stick to our principles,\nit goes right: which is the sentiment\nof Hippychick in fact. That's when\nthings go right for us.\n20\n\n"

I could have sworn that the Reapps back\nthen were getting hot under the collar\nabout 'huge rent increases' and 'exploiting\nFreshers'. They wrote letters and\ncompared figures and said ugly things\nlike 'most expensive student\naccommodation in Britain' and 'rent\nstrike'. 1 was even under the impression\nthat the highly organised authorities from\nacross the road responded.

    "content": "Comics. Where do you buy them, and what do you buy? Alien\nFEATURES The Good, the Bad,\nSo just supposing you've read some of the\ncomic stuff in the last few issues of Felix,\nand are thinking 'I'm an open minded,\ntasteful kind of person, and I'd like to find\nout more about this stuff...' (we live in\nhope, Alien Sex Fiend). What do you do?\nWell, the obvious thing would be to buy\nsome comics. Pretty clever idea, eh?\nThere's just one een sy we ens y problem:\nThere is a vast amount of comic material\nproduced, and not all of it is, shall we\nsay, very good. Also, there are relatively\nfew specialist comic shops. So firstly, let's deal with the shops...\nGOSH!\nGreat Russell Street, W l. Situated opposite the British Museum, this\nis one of the smaller and more friendly\nshops in central London. Upstairs houses\nthe standard selection of American imported comics, with a smallish, but\noften ridiculously cheap and quite\ncomplete, selection of back issues (I picked up a New Mutants No. 2 for \u00a31.50,\nPendragon). Downstairs is packed out\nwith other forms of strip, especially\nNewspaper cartoons along the lines of\nFootrot Flats, Calvin and Hobbes, and\nBloom County. The friendliness of the\nstaff (in contrast with the surly attitude of\nmany in Forbidden Planet) was enough to\nmake this my regular comic shop last\nyear.\nCOMIC SHOWCASE Neal Street, Covent Garden\nPrimarily orientated towards the\nmainstream DC/ Marvel selection, their\nNew Releases section is horribly laid out,\nmaking it difficult to find what you are\nlooking for. There is an average selection\nof back issues, at average prices, and a few Graphic Novels. But essentially there\nis nothing to make this shop stand out\nfrom all the others. Only really worth\nvisiting if you've been struggling to find\nsomething elsewhere.\nMEGA CITY\nInverness Street, Camden Town.\nThe key word here is Big. The most\nimpressive back issue selection I 've yet\nfound in London, and usually at very\nreasonable prices. Marvel, DC and\nindependents are separated into different\nsections, and once you know this, finding\nthe issues you want becomes simplicity\nitself. The New releases are also stocked,\nbut are displayed in a system I haven't quite worked out yet. There is an OK selection of merchandising, with a few Tshirts and posters, as well as a pretty\ngood selection of Graphic Novels.\nFANTASY INN\nCharing Cross Road (back of Leicester\nSquare)\nDown in the basement of the Book Inn.\nIt's cramped and packed with a lot of\nstuff you don't find elsewhere. The layout\nmeans it's hard to find things. If you can\nwork your way through the mess then\nthere are some good finds at reasonable\nprices. Some merchandising but not a lot.\nNice homely feel.\nPARADISE ALLEY Off Denmark Street in an alley next to\nAndy's Guitars\nSmall is the keyword here. It's a tiny\nback room of a place but the layout is\ngreat. All the comics are in easy to find\nalphabetic order (unless you want obscure\nindependents) and there is a huge sea of\nstacked merchandise ranging from Space\n1999 to Starskey and Hutch. The prices\nusually aren't silly and the range of stuff\nis wide. Not a place for new releases but\na good place for back issues.\nMEANWHILE Camden Town( near the tube station),\nIt's fairly small, very new, a few odd\nimports and a rather small selection. I didn't find it very useful but if you like\nmainstream or one offs then there is\nprobably something there.\nFORBIDDEN PLANET New Oxford Street, just east of\nTottenham Court Road Tube Station\nThe Forbidden Planet chain are probably\nthe best known specialist comic shops in\nthe country, and as such they have a large shop, and a large selection of titles.\nHowever, all is not sunshine and roses in\nhappy bunny land: The shop is somewhat\nconfusingly laid out, their back issue\nselection can be limited (probably due to\nthe amount of people who use it), and\ntheir prices are often a few pence higher.\nAlso, the new release section, while in\nalphabetical order, is in a very\ninconvenient place. To top it all off, it's generally very crowded, there can be\nlong queues, they don't supply the comics\nin protective plastic bags, and the staff\nare sometimes less than friendly.\nThis said, they do get new titles in\nquickly, and have a large selection of\nmerchandising and graphic novels. There\nis also a very good SF and Fantasy\nbookshop in the basement.\nTHE VIRGIN COMIC SHOP Upstairs in both Virgin Megastores,\nOxford Street\nNot a lot to be said, other than it's small,\nwith a limited selection (generally only\nthe big companies), but the staff are\nfriendly enough, and they do bag their\ncomics. The layout of the store takes a bit of time to get used to, as well. Alright.\nSo, now you know where you can buy\nthem, what should you buy? Good\nquestion. Obviously a lot depends on the\nindividual. After all, as with any art form,\nare very much a matter of taste. Both\nmyself and Pendragon tend towards the\nbest of the superhero genre, but comics\nare published covering a huge number of\nsubjects. If in doubt, you can always ask\nthe staff at shops, your mates, or just buy a copy and see. So, onto what we think\nare some of the better comics around,\nstarting with America...\nMARVEL US\nMarvel Comics, in general, remain the\nmost childish of the mainstream\nAmerican comics, rarely experimenting\nwith their characters in the way that DC often do. The blandness of characters\nsuch as Captain America, Quasar or Thor\nbears witness to this, and things don't look as if they are getting any better.\nThey have just released a comic called\nDarkHawk, where the hero gains his\npowers by 'mysteriously finding a suit'.\nHo Hum. Within this though, some good stuff can\nbe found, principally among their X or\nMutant books.\nThe Uncanny X Men\nFor many years this has been the\nundisputed champion of the comic-book\nmarket. Chris Claremont who has been\nwriting it for well over ten years, has\nshifted the focus away from the actual\nsuper-heroics, and concentrated on the\nrelationships and problems of the (ever-changing) team. For a while it has been\nhampered by a profusion of sub-plots\nwhich only surfaced every few years or\n8\nSex Fiend, Pendragon and the Amazing Machine tell all.\nand the Graphic\nso, but this is being done away with, as\nhot pencil ler Jim Lee helps plot the book,\nleading to a more streamlined form of\nstory telling. Recommended, although it\ntakes time to get into, so either give it\ntime, or find a friend who buys it.\nX Factor\nThe original X Men, reformed. For a while it was languishing in the hands of\nan over verbose script er, but has now\nbeen given a new pencil ler, and in the\nautumn a new writer (Peter David, who\nhas done so much to resurrect the Hulk).\nRumors are that they are going to\nbecome a government team. Looks like\nits going to be good...\nX Force\nDue to start in a couple of months. Rising\nfrom the ashes of New Mutants, Cable\nand his charges are introducing a new\nconcept to the Mutant books. They no\nlonger wait for the bad guys to come to\nthem. They're going out for their enemies\nblood... It is still relatively unusual to\nhave a Marvel character that kills, so an\nentire team of them should be interesting.\nThe creative team behind the book is\nstrong, but will they wimp out? We hope\nnot.\nExcalibur\nThe only British mutant team, again it\nhas lost its direction over the last year.\nAround issue 40 though, British\nwriter/Artist Alan Davis takes over, so it\nmight be worth a look again.\nWolverine\nGreat character in X Men, but in his own book he is hindered by Ok writing and\nlousy art. Still worth a look, as some of\nthe stories can be good.\nAmongst the non-mutant books, worth\nlooking out for are:\nThe Incredible Hulk\nNow totally different form the character\nyou might remember from TV, he is\nintelligent and has a very bad attitude.\nThere is some fascinating political\nmano eu ve ring going on, which has\nmanaged to totally change the direction\nof the book.\nSpiderMan\nProduced totally by the incredible artist\nTod McFarlane, this is the first new\nSpiderman book in a long time, and the\nfirst time McFarlane has scripted. Thus\nthis aspect can be weak, but the art and\ndialogue, along with the generally darker\nslant of the title makes up for it. This\nsaid, the scripting is getting better.\nAlso worth looking at are the other\nthree Spider Man Titles, especially\nAmazing Spiderman.\nDETECTIVE COMICS\nDC are the other big American company,\nand, indeed, were the first comics\ncompany. They have the three longest\nrunning characters in the comics field:\nBatman, SuperMan, and Wonder Woman. In general, while they do have less\nmature titles (SuperMan and Wonder\nWoman, to name two), their comics have\na far more adult outlook, and they are\nwilling to address issues that 'super-hero'\ncomics traditionally avoid. This is\ncombined with a more orderly world, and\nfewer heroes, which leads to an overall\n'tightness' and consistency within the\ntitles, and far fewer continuity problems.\nBatman\nMy unashamedly favourite character, and\nthoroughly recommended as a good way\nto start in comics, or as something new if\nyou already read 'em. There are three\ntitles that feature Batman, and of the two\nthat follow his current adventures, this is\ncurrently the best. The creative team of\nGrant, Mitchell, and Breyfogle portray\nThe Batman as he should be, dark and\ndriven but still a man, not a cardboard\ncut-out. The art is also excellent, with a slightly stylised feel. Recommended\nhighly.\nDetective Comics\nThe other comic following The Batmans\ncurrent adventures, and the weaker of\nthe two. The art is of a dated, almost\n70's style, and the character is ation not\nnearly as strong as in Batman. Still head-and-shoulders above a lot of Marvel stuff,\nand worthwhile buying so as better to\nunderstand 'Batman' (it's only 65pa month).\nIf*!\nLegends of the Dark Knight\nThe third regular title featuring The\nBatman, and something of a new idea.\nDifferent Artist/Writer teams produce five\nissue stories, which can be set anywhere\nin the history of Bats, whether past,\npresent, or future. So far (it's up to issue\n17) there has been one incredible story,\none good story, one fair story, and the\ncurrent one, despite a weak start, is\ngetting better. Buy it, especially issues 11\nto 15, which are one of the best\nintroductions to the Batman character.\nGreen Arrow A radical departure from most comics,\nand Using a previously established\ncharacter as well, this title exp le mpl if ies the best of DC. A very mature comic,\ndealing with real people, and examining\nthe real world through them. The first\ntwo years of the strip were concerned\nwith an investigation by the writers of\nthe role of the victim in modern crime,\nvia Green Arrow's adventures. If you\nwant to see what can be done within the\nframework of a superhero comic, or just\ndon't believe that they can address\nserious, real life issues, then buy this, and\nhave your opinions changed.\nAlso recommended from DC are\nSandman and Doom Patrol.\nBRITISH COMICS\nSome of the most talented people in\nmodern comics are British, although\nseveral of them now work for American\nCompanies. Of the stuff that's actually\npublished over here, the three best are...\nKnights Of Pendragon\nGood. One of the best monthly comics\nproduced at the moment. An eco-thriller\nwith mystical overtones, rooting deep into\nour Celtic and Arthurian heritage. The\nscript is brilliant, with occasional\nhumorous one-liners. The art takes time\nto get used to, but is generally good,\nalbeit variable, but the colouring is, well,\nsexy. Provided the writers manage to\nkeep up the originality and tension, it'll\ncontinue to be essential reading. Buy it,\nand all the back issues (it's only on\nnumber 10, so there aren't too many).\n2000AD THE stalwart of the British comics\nindustry, and home of the infamous Judge\nDredd. Recently turned all- colour, it is\nusually entertaining, and sometimes\ninspired. The only problem is that the\nstories can be of variable quality, but as\nthis is due to them publishing stuff by\nnew people, it's excusable. Vast amounts\nof the old stuff is available in collections,\nand many are well worth buying. Also\nreprints material monthly in Best of\n2000AD Monthly. An easy way to get into\ncomics, and worth a try.\nTOXIC!\nSee review on page 10.\n9\n\n"

And an under-strength team at that. They\nwere consequently reinforced by dozens\nor so Wolverines (Gulo Luseus to you\nLatin freaks out there), members of the\nsite team.\nAnd so to the match\u2014eight games,\nwinner at the end takes the pathetically\nsmall cup back to the trophy cabinet.\nThings were looking good for Imperial at\nthe half-way stage\u2014two matches drawn,\nand two won. The Gulo's on the other\nside were looking increasingly pissed off\nand Societies\nClint Eastwood strides forth\nwith losing, and started getting upset.\nEspecially after losing game four in five\nminutes flat.\nOver the next three games, they got\ntheir act together, and with some\ninteresting marshalling, won two games,\nsetting up a grand finale. Two-all, and\none to play. By then, Oxford had lost all\nheart and decided on mass, suicidal\ncharge. Suicidal it was, leaving some\ntwenty-odd Imperial players closing on all\ndirections on a bunch of increasingly\ndesperate Gulo's. Their numbers declined\nsignificantly with the onset of several\n'walls of paint' hurtling in their direction\n(the product more of suspect aim than\nenthusiasm), leaving Leo 'That's not a love bite, I was hit by a paintball' HumeWright to snatch the flag.\nOther achievements of the day include\nthe de bagging and infliction of an internal\nJacuzzi to the prat from Oxford who tried\nto spray us with water during the photo,\nand the collection of other 'trophies' by\nAdam, Matt and Gareth\u2014the Latent\nCriminal Pack.\nCheers and thanks to all those who\nparticipated in the ritual shredding of\nOxford\u2014despite their impromptu\nreinforcements. A rematch has been\nplanned\u2014at their suggestion\u2014is there no\nend to masochism in this world?\nRifle & Pistol\nAs far as competition goes this has been\na pretty uneventful year for us. We\nchallenged over a dozen other university\nteams but only two agreed'to shoot\nagainst us. Personally I think that the\nothers were too scared to face us because\nwe are so totally brilliant. This is\nespecially true of those ponce s at Oxford\nwho we will definitely beat for the Howe\nCup in May.\nThe pistol team has had two matches\nso far, both against our old adversaries\nCambridge. The first match was Police\nPistol which we won 1594 to 1474 and\nthe second was Service Pistol B which we\nwon 289 to 202. Hardly anybody on\neither team had shot either competition\ntype before and so it was educational as\nwell as fun. That's what I like about\nCambridge\u2014we always beat them and\nthey always come back for more. The\nrifle team has fared less well. They were\nonly able to arrange one match, against\nLondon Hospital who w re rumoured to be\nso good we thought we'd get completely\nhammered. On the day, however it\nturned out to be extremely close, so close\nin fact that all we needed was for the last\nman to shoot 92 or above for us to win( and up to this point no one in the team\nhad shot less than 92). In fact the last\nman scored 67 and we were beaten 537\nto 561 but it was a good match anyway.\nA quiet year so far but next year, we'll\ntake on the world.\nACC Exec elections after Easter. Any sports club members interested in\nstanding find out what it's about from\nyour captains. Captains please tell your\nmembers.\nAll ACC clubs should have had new\nelections before May 1. Club articles for\nUnion Handbook IN NOW. Your loss if\nyou don't write one. All colours to be in\nby first week of term.\nThe President's XI are\nlooking for beer teams to\nplay in the forthcoming\nseason.\nAny group interested in\nfielding some competition\nshould contact Paul\nShanley on 3501 or in the\nUnion Office.\n27\n\n"

It does not\ndo the job it should do...it should be a proper academic bookshop...I'd have it\nfranchised to Dillons.\nAt the time the changes were made,\nthey said the new ordering system they\nwere going to have, would guarantee that\na book you ordered would be there\nwithin five days...the problem that I 've\nalways had with that bookshop is that it's never had the books I 've wanted.\n\u2022 Oh\u2014absolutely.\n\u2022 I never go to the M DH 'cause it's shit. I get my snacks from the JCR...the\nSOUTHSIDE SHOP is dead handy.\nI eat at BELUSHIS\u2014it's pretty good\nvalue. I drink at SOUTHSIDE\u2014it's good\nfun meeting some American to tty. \u2022 Of course I do.\n\u2022 The M DH is a bit expensive...it's alright\u2014the food's good.\nThe UNION SNACK BAR'S quite\ngood...the sandwiches are really fresh\u2014\nthey put the fillings in as you want them.\nThey're really good\u2014worth the money.\nI haven't eaten in the J CR. BELUSHI S' is alright apart from pizzas which are\nquite expensive. The baked potatoes are\nquite good value for money. I 've heard\nthat MUSTAPHA' S is pretty gross.\nThe SOUTHSIDE SHOP is really\ngood...a little expensive but you'd expect\nthat\u2014they could have concessions if\nthey're trying to provide a service for\nstudents, rather than having a profitable\nbusiness. They need to sell more fresh\nfruit and ve g and things like washing\npowder as well.\n\u2022 If I didn't believe in the Easter Bunny I wouldn't get all my eggs on Easter\nDay...I'm liberally minded...give me a few\nyears and I might grow up a bit.\nRoger:\n\u2022 In general the shops are very good as\nare the eating places. The only\ncomplaints I have are that there aren't enough carrots on the menu and the\nBookshop doesn't have Watership Down on video.\nI'm glad to say that the barbaric\npractice of eating rabbit seems to have\ndied out at Imperial.\n\u2022 I think therefore I am.\nDan:\n\u2022 I don't go to MUSTAPHA S at all\u2014it's just pointless. It's never open when I'm about\u2014it's better to go BELUSHI S because you're down in the bar already.\nThe food's not bad...the best you can get\nfor that sort of price.\nThe M DH is alright, but the food's not\nthat good\u2014I only go there when I have\nto.\nThe UNION SNACK BAR is OK, but\nthey've totally cocked up the sandwich\nbar\u2014they're all pre-made and so dry.\nThey used to be made to order. The one\nI had today\u2014I could only eat half of it,\nthe rest was like the inside of a tree. The\nhot food is fine.\nI 've never used the SOUTHSIDE SHOP. \u2022 Depends on if she's an Easter Bunny\nGirl or not.\n\n"
