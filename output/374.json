    "content": "10 FEIIX\nJames Wilkinson Stardust \u2014 Hay Connolly\nTHIS IS THE BOOK of the film sequel\nto the original film 'That'll Be the Day'.\nThose of you who Saw 'That'll Be The\nDay' will remember it chronicled the\nadventures of Jim Maclaine from his\nchucking in school and dropping out, to\ndropping back in, getting married and\ndropping back out again. In the middle he\nmeets and makes friends with Mfke\nMennery who works on a fairground.\nWhen 'Stardust' opens it is 1963, and\nJim has grown his hair, grown up and\nbecome a singer with a rock and roll\nband called the Stray Cats. Performing to\n0 K C0AD3 BOOKS\nbored audiences in seedy clubs, they\nlive on dreams of becoming as famous as\nthe Beatles or the Rolling Stones.\nA combination of luck, ruthlessness\nand a lot of hard hustling on the part of\nMike Mennery, who Jim brings in as the\ngroup's road manager, makes the Stray\nCats rock and roll superstars. However,\njust when they have achieved their dream,\nit starts to go sour.\nThis book may not be a masterpiece of\nEnglish Literature, but it seems to me that\nit's honest about the way things were and,\nI suppose, still are. Definately an\ninteresting book!\nHie\nMike McGear - McGear (Polydor).\nFlicking down the track listings shows\nan opener of apparent taste, Mr. F's 'Sea\nBreezes', which could be quite interesting.\nThere's a dramatic launch, decapitated\nvocals et-all, but the style's not there.\nThe track eventually dies into rag gae and\nthe classics( shame). The intention of the\nalbum seems to be for Paul McCartney to\nlend bru v Mike McGear a helping hand at\nreplenishing the Piggy Bank by writing\nnine of the ten available diffie s, producing\nthe vinyl, and going for the hat rick by\nthrowing in the wife or synthesizer. Mind\nyou, they end up sounding like a set of\nhalf-hearted studio demo tapes, complete\nwith funny noises. The beat is at best\nrudimentary (courtesy Gerry Conway!?).\nSome light breaks through the beer\nfumes in the form of the single 'Leave It' \u2014\nan eminently catchy 3 minutes, but then\nit's back to the monkeys-and-children-only business and all the fooling around\nin the world won't disguise the mediocrity\nof the venture. It's all been done better a million times before, Miguel!. Quite comparable to, say, Little Jimmy Osmosis\nsings Paul Rodgers.\nSide two lifts and separates for a while, providing straight, uncomplicated\npop tunes moog ed about by the Lovely\nLinda \u2014 maybe the unaccepted remnants\nfrom the 'Band on the Run' stockpile of\ntunes (business is business, already).\nIt's a well-produced disc but undemanding\nof both listener and performer and as such\nlacks any kind of immediacy or spark.\nIf Paul McCartney could do to alcoholic beverages what he is evidently capable of,\nand admirably suited to, with regards\npopular music (i.e. distill every essence\nand bouquet available into one easily palatable product) he wouldn't need to\nmake another record and the Scots would\nstart swimming in their water instead of\nbottling it. Basically an essay in\nFraternity.\nThe Glums (BBC)\nThe BBC strikes in glorious mono with\ncomedy from the 12th century, when humour\nwas obviously something vastly different\nfrom the modern concept - no subtlety,\nin u endo, or even a little parody \u2014 the\nradio audience must have been some really\nerudite molluscs to latch onto this stuff.\nThe album appears \u00bbto come from some'\nBBC radio show titled imaginatively 'The\nGlums', featuring Dick Bentley, June\nWhitfield, and Jimmy ' l was-born-with-these-whiskers-you-know' Edwards. Yet\nanother sign of it's age is the expertly\ncanned laughter. I mean nothing nowadays\nis,expertly done.\nCould provide some neat openings for\naural sado-masochists.\nJeff Lewis\nSlade: Slade in Flame (Polydor)\nYET ANOTHER undoubted smasher oo hit for Slade. This album is the original\nsoundtrack from the forthcoming film\n'Flame' in which the band makes its\nacting debut; as far as the film is con-cern ed, it couldn't have asked for better\npre-publicity. Considering that Slade's last album Old, New, Borrowed and Blue\ngrabbed a gold disc before its official\nrelease date then clearly the film producer,\nthe record company and, inevitably so, the\nbook publisher are out to make pots and\npots of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's from this highly commercial\nenterprise.\nAll the tracks, with one exception, are\nwhat one has come to expect from Slade:\nraunchy, kick-'em-in-the-guts type rock.\n'Lay It Down' and 'So Far So Good' are\ndefinitely reminiscent of the Beatles\naround '64-'65.\nThe one exception in the whole album\nis the very first cut, 'How Does It Feel?'\nwhich, to my mind, is the best that they\nhave ever produced. It possesses a confident air of musical maturity which\nillustrates the fact that the band is\ncapable of more than just thrashing around\nunder the auspices of their 'NOIZ BOI Z' tag.\nFamily: Best of Family (Reprise).\nTRAGEDY undoubtedly struck the\nworld of British Pop when Family decided\nto break-up in October 1973 for, in contrast to some of their plastic i zed, money-grabbing contemporaries, they were one of\nthe few groups who were always searching\nfor new ideas. It is an undeniable fact\nthat no two tracks, from this album at\nleast, are even remotely alike as regards\nlyrics, melody and presentation. This compendium, then, serves as a tribute to\ntheir sheer innovative prowess.\nThe cuts span the last five of the\nband's seven years' existence. Their four\nmajor singles - 'No' Mule's Fool' (1969),\n'The Weaver's Answer' (1970), 'In MyOwn\nTime' (1971), and 'Burlesque' (1972) -are naturally included together with their\nall-time classic 'My Friend the Sun',\nwhich, with its lyrical strength and\ndelicate harmony never ceases to amaze\nme.\nThis album will appeal to anyone\ninterested in serious rock (as opposed to\nthe 'hard' type) and also to supporters\nof Leicester City FC, in whose colours\nsome of the band appear on the sleeve.\n\n"

This is just a thought, a rough\nidea. How about it, Trev ?\nAs far as I can see without a sabbatical FELT X Editor, how can we print the\nBluebook during the summer? How are we\ngoing to fully utilise the printing facilities\nwhich College has made available to us?\nWho can take care of all the outside jobs\nwhich need technical checking before they\ncan be run on the offset-litho? Consider\nwhat will happen when the printing unit\nincluding the var i typist, moves over to\nCollege Block( probably within the next\nyear).\nFELIX copy will be taken from the\nFELIX office to the var i typist then back\nto the office for pasting np then back to\nCollege Block to be printed and then the\npaper will be shifted back to the office for\nfolding and collating. For a sabbatical it will be tortuous, for an on sabbatical,, it will be impossible.' So essentially then without a sab-bat ical Deputy President/Treasurer, I feel\nthat there are workable, non-sabbatical\nalternatives. Without a sabbatical FELIX Editor, FELIX will die.

Dear Trevor,\nThe executive has spent a great deal of time this year\ndiscussing the status of the\npost-graduate affairs officer.\nAfter several sessions on this\ntopic the view agreed by all was that we had here a topic\nwhich could reasonably be\nexpected to attract a good\nattendance at aUG M. The\nexecutive further agreed that a good and well prepared debate\non the subject should be sought.\nTo these ends we agreed to\npostpone the issue of the PG Affairs Officer becoming a member of the executive until\nthere had been time for the\ngeneral student body to be\ninformed that this was being\nproposed. When everyone had\nhad a chance to air their views,\nthe matter was to be advertised\nwidely, and put to aUG M. Straying from this line of\nreasoning for a moment, may I say that I understood that the\nexecutive was supposed to work\ntogether and above all 'communicate with each other'\n(your words, not mine).\nYou may understand, sir, that\nI am therefore not a little\nannoyed at the presentation of a motion to add the PGA O to the\nexecutive, at last night'sU GM. The inclusion of the motion\nwas not publicised. Even the\nexecutive was not told of its\ninclusion \u2014 and at our lunchtime meeting we did ask you\nwhat was being discussed. How can you expect a good\ndebate when only one side\nknows when the debate is to\nbe?\nYour conduct as chairman\nduring that debate also left\nmuch to be desired; especially your comments just prior to the\nvote, which had a very definite\neffect on a small assembly.\nIn summary, sir, may I respectfully point out that I, and I believe I am not alone\namongst the executive in this\nview, do not believe that you,\nor the Honorary Secretary, have\nkept good faith with the rest of\nthe executive over this matter.\nI have stated before that I do not consider 'bitching\nsessions' in FELIX to be a good thing for the union as a whole. However, I consider it\nnecessary to bring this particular matter to the attention of\nthe student body as a whole,\nif only to ensure that some\npeople know that this motion\nis being discussed. Yours, most sincerely,\nRon Kill.

LIPSCOMBE\nThey said it could never\nhappen. No one man could possibly play two games so\nwell, but one man has and that\nman is B. Pants, the captain of\nIC Rugby. Finding the weather\nconditions incompatible with\ngrass-court games he turned to\nasphalt and by a piece of\nincredible diplomacy managed to\narrange a netball match against\nICWA.\nAnd so it was that on a damp\nSunday afternoon seven IC Rugby men and seven ICWA\nNetball women arrived at the\nUnion. The venue for this\nsporting showpiece was the\nL instead Hall ground and the\nIC team chose to change in the\nhall itself for convenience.\nAfter a five minute warm-up in room 213, B. Pants led out the\nRugby team onto the court to\nfind the opposition already out\u2014\na mean bunch to be sure. Led by Freda Jones they included in\nthe side no less a player than\nFred a' I scored 40 goals in one\nmatch' Tell em. The other five\nplayers were Fred a Harris, Fred a Barter, Freda J o,F red a Betteee, and Fred a Jones' friend, Fred a. Faced with such\nnotorious opposition Frank\nPants had assembled a team of\nhis toughest men, Frank Sutton,\nFrank Beddoes, Frank Robins, Frank Lipscomb e, Frank\nShakesheff, and even Frank\nHughes! The match was refereed by\nthe ladies team since they were\nthe only ones who knew the\nrules except Frank Pants( who\nwas to play so well) of course.\nPants decided to play well down wind for the first quarter\n(a shrewd move indeed) and the\ngame was under way. ICWA\nstarted with an orthodox formation with Fred a Tell em as\ngoal shooter. Frank Sutton was\nordered to mark her and it was\nsoon clear that this would be a bruising encounter. Hughes and\nLipscomb e led the IC attack\nand as the game flowed from end\nto end there were many scoring\nchances for either side. Needl ess to say these were well taken by Fred a Tell em and\nsquandered by the inept M and\nL \u2014 clearly the ball should\nhave been smaller or the net\nbigger. Pants was general ling the midfield well but even he\ncould not compensate for the\nlack of skill up front. Fred a was everywhere, shadowed\nclosely by Frank. The end of\nthe.first quarter came with ICWA\n. in the lead. Pants' team were\non the rack. There would have!\nto be changes. Frank reverted;\nto goal defence leaving Frank\nfree to move to wing attack.\nThis displaced Frank who was\naccomodate d by switching Frank\nto goal shooter from win^ defence and putting Frank at\nwing attack. This left Frank who was told to take Frank's old position at wing defence.\nPants was unchanged. The\nICWA team also made changes.\nThe second quarter started.\nThe new look IC team shaped\nup well Frank Frog was slightly\nmore successful in attack\n(which was not saying much).\nClose marking persisted, Lipscomb e' treading all over\nBetteee whom he claimed he\ncould not see. Half time came\nwith ICWA still in front. It was\nnow that master tactician Frank\nHughes stepped forward and\nsuggested that the IC team\nshould employ a man to man\nmarking technique \u2014 what a revelation. Inspired by this\nradical thinking there was\nanother suggestion that the ball should be put thro' the net.\nClearly things were going to be\ndifferent in the second half.\nMSF went to goal shooter, and\nthe game was underway. The IC team employing their new tactics\nslowly narrowed the gap. Pants\nt ave a virtus o performance,\nis tri but ing the ball to left and\nright with great dexterity. Frank\nBeddoes made some blustering\nright wing runs despite close attention from Jo and from his crosses MSF was able to slot\nin the goals. Fred a was worried.\nShe ordered muscle tactics and\nin the face of this physical assault Pants' team began to\ncrack, although he himself\ncontinued to play well. By now a large crowd had\ngathered for the final exciting quarter. Ken Weale and his dog\nFrank (?) were there too. As dark descended the battle was\nfought out, scoring taking place\nat both ends. With only seconds\nleft the score was 20-20. IC\nmoved the ball quickly \u2014 Frank to Frank to Frank and then back\nto Frank again. He passed to\nFrank who slipped a beautiful\nshot to Frank who then leapt\nhigh and potted the ball \u2014 the\nwinner! Gasps from the crowd,\nIC had won! But no! Away at the\nother end Fred a Tell em was\nwaving her arms, the goal was\ndisallowed for full time had\njust been blown. The teams\nclapped each other off the field\na couple of times. An honourable\ndraw was the result, but what a match! The game was enjoyed\nby all. Everyone arrived at the\nICWA Lounge later on for a feast of tea and sandwiches and\nFrank Dennis presented Fred a Jones with the 'Mar of the\nMatch' award \u2014 a bottle of\nBabycham.\nTeams: ICWA: Suzanne Harris,\nAnita Tellem, Liz Barter, Betty,\nJo, Mary Jones and Mary's Friend.\nIC: Dennis Shakesheff, Bruce\nBradley, Keith Lipscombe,\nPaul Robins, Ryan Beddoes,\nRay Hughes, Rich Sutton.\n\n"

Dewey\nFELIX Office, ,\n14th January, 1975\nDear Mr. Dewey,\nWith regard to your letter\nprinted in this issue, of FELIX, we had not fully discussed your\nlast epi-st le( the original letter\nof over 2,000 words) hence your\nclaims of credit for any\nimprovements since then are\nrather premature. In any case the ambiguity of your letter\nrenders any such claims invalid. Also, you say in all your\ncommunications to date that\nyou are a senior member of\nSennet, our so called sister paper. We contacted Jeremy\nClift, the sabbatical Editor of\nSennet on this point and it\nseems that this claim is also premature and (quote) 'merely a matter of opinion'.\nWe acknowledge your app-li cation for the post of\nAdvertising Manager. This matter is on the agenda of our\nnext FELIX Editorial Board\nmeeting to be held on Monday,\n20th January. We also note the\nattempt in your application to\nnarrow the field down to one\nperson. If we took only those\npeople with experience, there\nwould be no FELIX staff at all with the exception of the Editor. In your letter you go so far\nas to suggest that the\nEditorial Board do not edit\narticles 'in any acceptable\nmanner'. Bearing in mind your\nprofessed ability in this field,\nwe have printed your letter as\nwe received it. On the point of\nnews articles, it is our opinion\nthat all news items concerning\nstudents wherever they may be\nare relevant and are of pertinent\ninterest to other students. Why\ndo news stories, about FE colleges have to be necessarily more relevant to IC students\nthan those on refectory prices, rents and victim is at ions? There being no bounds to\nthe size of your criticisms, you\nmove 011 to attack the lay-out\nin FELIX. We can only give you\nthe opinions of others who are\nperhaps more experienced in\nthis field, viz:\u2014 Jeremy Clift( Editor of Sennet): 'really\nrather good'; our former litho-operator, Ky r le Gillespie, onetime Editor of 'Office Weekly'\n(a post held for twenty years):\n'really good, indeed quite\nexcellent': Dave Segar, sales\nrepresentative of AddressographMulti graph Ltd: 'very good\nindeed'; and finally Mr. Carter,\nsales representative in the\nVarityper division of the same\ncompany: 'first class'.\nIt never has been our policy to place bans on articles or\nphotography by persons other\nthan the FELIX staff and\nespecially not yours. In fact we\ndraw your attention to the fact\nthat your photographs were\nused for the STOIC centre\nspread (FELIX, Issue No. 368),\nso what in the hell are you\ntalking, about? Letrasetting is\nNOT the major task that soaks\nup all our energy when producing a FELIX. If there were\never such a case as you mention\n(\"none of us can remember such\na case) then we take this\nopportunity to inform you that\nyou are sadly behind the times\nin your thinking. Incidently,\nyour own efforts (when you were\non the FELIX staff) in this\nfield were notably abominable\n(see FELIX, Issue No. 361).\nIn conclusion, we should\nlike to express our curiosity\nthat you should see fit to d is tribute your original letter to all members of the ICU Pub li cations Board, the Presidents of\nthe Constituent College Unions, the Editors of the Constituent\nCol'e ge Newspapers, the\nSecretary to the Editorial Board of Sennet, Mike Williams,\nthe Executive Editor of Sennet\n(Jeremy Clift), Anne Nolan( the\ncollege Press& Publications Officer), Valerie Beer (the\ncollege Offset-litho unit super-MOTORCYCLE\nCOLUMN\nRupert Harper\" NOW THAT I am finally\nback at college I thought that\nit was about time that I did\nsomething about my task as\nsecretary of the Motor Cycle section of the. C&G Motor\nClub. For those who do not\nknow what happened, I broke\nmy thigh bone in a car crash,\nthe obvious moral is to ride\nmotor cycles as they seem to\nbe safer! My aim this year is to\ntry and get us some facilities for keeping, and more important,\nrepairing and rebuilding\nmachines belonging to the\nmembers. I have already taken\nsteps in this direction, and I think Dr.Besant is very\ninterested in the section and its\nactivities, and we may be able\nto look to him for assistance, having a member of staff to\nhelp will be very useful,\nespecially being in the same\ndepartment as Professor Ford,\nwho is President of the Motor\nClub. Now, about this Honda we\nare going to race, I think it is\na very good idea BUT, I would\nneed a lot of persuading to pay\n\u00a350 for a, CP. 72, even more the\n\u00a3200 this blok e is asking for it,\nor the \u00a3600 it is supposed to be\nworth, and I do not consider it\nwill really benefit all the\nmembers. And as a council\nmember I feel that it would be a waste of Union money. I would\nfar rather spend the money\nequipping a good workshop,\nwhich is what I feel we need.\nLastly I can not really see UFC giving us that amount of money\nanyway so I will direct my\nenergies towards a more modest\nsum.\nit seems to me that the\nsection offers little to its'\nmembers, this probably accounts\nfor the fact that there are only\nten members, no facility\ninvolving club funds can be\nused by non-members, but don't let that stop you from coming\nvisor), and to the Hon. Secretary\nof ICU ostensibly for ICU Council records (though this is clearly out of the question) and\nyet you did not send copies to\nthe individual members of the\nFELIX Editorial Board, who\nwere the main targets of your\ncriticisms.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT RUGBY\nRefreshed from three weeks\nof constant booze and turkey\nintake over the Christmas\nvacation, Bruce Bradley's Brave Bandits disembarked at\nCatterham Barracks to meet the\nwell known Welsh Guards XV. A soldier on the gate, instantly\nrecognising our style, decided\nto promptly march us to the\nbarber's shop. However, having\nbeen warned of the army's tricks, and told under no circumstances to sign anything, he\nhad^ o settle for showing us to\nthe gymnasium.\nTo the boos and cries of\n'foreigners' from the masses of\nWelsh privates dotted around\nthe field, IC at last took the\nfield. After being told to put the\nfield back play eventually\ncommenced. The first twenty\nminutes saw little of interest\nuntil De nz il Frog was scythed\nat the knees by a falling body\nand earned a wonderful oscar\nwith a touching 'death throes'\nperformance on the touch line. Ten minutes later a chance\npenalty allowed the Guards to\ntake a30 lead at half-time.\nIn the second half both the\npack and backs began to play\nwith more confidence with good\nclean ball coming from\nB. Austin's sound hooking. It\nwas from the base of a scrum\nthat Ray Teethless broke and\ndived over for a deserved try\nto put IC 6-3 ahead. Play\ncontinued without incident until\nthe Guard's second row started\nbashing his head against a brick wall, i.e. Keith hippo, and\nwas consequently sent off for\nallowing S. Booth to hit him\nback. Ten minutes later a monstrous penalty kick by the\nGuards levelled the score,\nwhich then remained at 6-6. It\nwas a well deserved result and\na promising start to the new\nterm.\nTeam: Denzil F.. Z. Apper,\nJ. Bear, B. Ringme, C. Otter, L.L. Norman Less, B.T. Rousers,\nB. Morris, T. Enence. 10.000.\nM.A luring, Joshua Jones,\nD. Dick, N.T. Q. Bruce Bradley\nIC 1st XV played their first\ngame against a University team\nthis season on Saturday 11th January, and were so determined\nto do well that only two thirds of\nthe side got pissed the night\nbefore.\nThe match started at a furious pace and IC soon pinned\ndown the Reading side in their\nhalf. A penalty to IC was well kicked by B. Finney, playing in\nhis new position of fly half.\nReading immediately redressed\nthe balance by kicking an easy\npenalty from in front of the\nposts but IC were undaunted.\nFurther IC pressure brought\nanother penalty which Finney duly converted but this lead\nwas to be somewhat short-lived.\nThe Reading left wing broke\nfour tackles and ran in under\nthe posts for a converted try\nwhich gave them a96 lead at\nthis stage.\nIC were not to be outdone,\nhowever, and before half-time\ntwo excellent tries were scored\nby them. Cress well crashed over\nfrom half a yard after an excellent run by Booth and Finney\nbroke through near the posts\nafter a dummy with Stern who\nreceived the attention of three\nReading players \u2014 all to no\navail. Finney go a led his own\ntry. Reading had scored yet\nanother penalty during this\nperiod to half time, and the\nscore then was 16-12 to IC.\nThe second half opened at\nno less hot a pace and although\nthe play was end to end throughout the half proved atri mph for both defences. Several IC\nscoring chances were unfortunately squandered by lack of support at the last moment\nbut this did not detract from a good second half performance.\nReading scored another two\npenalties to IC's one (by\nFinney, of course) giving a final\nscore of 19-18 to IC.\nThe after match frivolities\nwere well started by the introduction of an eight pint jug( full of beer) for a cost of a mere 8 Op. Reading Union\nenjoyed a repertoire of songs\npreviously unheard of by them\nand the Bobs Stern and Austin had an 'alarming' time and so\ndecided not to roll out the\nbarrel.\nTeam: D. Shakesheff, A. Williams,\nR. Slern, J. Gilbert, M. Cotter,\nB. Finney, R. Hughes, B. Bradley,\nR. Austin, D. Hart, K. Lipscombe,\nS. Booth, R. Cresswell, T. Smith,\nP. Robbins.\nLast Saturday, being the first Saturday of this term saw the\nreappearance of*IC's Extra1 st XV on the rugby field. The occasion was an away fixture at Reading University against their\n2nd XV. Three games had been arranged for this particular Saturday,\nbut due to a number of late\n' crossings off, one o' clock saw another fiasco, when there\nwas only enough players to\nfield two complete teams, and\na number of A team players\nwere drafted into the Extras. Position selection was decided\nin the dressing room, which decided that Neil Hick ing should play hooker, a decision with which he did not completely agree.\nWhen we reached the pitch, we saw fifteen men in all kinds\nof attire who, we found out some\nminutes later, were to be our\nopposition. The game was\nunderway and from the distance\nthe Reading pack were driven\nback at the first scrum, it\nseemed a mere formality that IC would notch up another victory.\nBut, alas, at this stage we\nwere unaware of the latent\nspeed of the Reading backs, which was to prove so decisive in the final analysis. In fact,\nafter winning the early heated\nexchanges, the Reading backs\nhad their first opportunity to\nstretch their legs, and our\ndefence was split. Only good\ncover by two of the back row\n(no names!) and the half backs\nprevented a score. But Rea'ding\nscored some minutes later,\nfrom the hard running of their\nhacks. No blame could be put\non our backs, they just didn't have Reading matched for speed,\nthe try, however was converted\nand another followed shortly,\nwhich was not converted,\nleaving a half time score in\nReading's favour of 10-0.\nThe second was now ours\nfor the taking. We had the slope\nin our favour along with the\nfairly strong wind on our backs. From the kick off, a clean catch by Marik Sergot, a wedge,\na player offside and within\nseconds Reading had scored\nagain. The wind had been blown\nout of our sails and when the\nreferee allowed a try a little later on, which had been\ntouched down by Alun Davies before, it seemed our task was\nimpossible. At this stage the\nteam for once started to ' click' and we were pressing hard near\n'heir line for a long while,\nduring which we did everything\nbut score. Chris Whiteley made\nsome excellent breaks through\nthe muddle and was ably\nsupported by Rob Doyle, and\nMarik Sergot, both playing well but were both stopped only\ninches short on several occ-as ions. A penalty move\ninvolving Rob and Marik, in the\nsame vein, was also effective\nbut good cover tackling by\nReading again foiled us.\nWe were now fully committed\nto attack and capital ising on\nthis situation, Reading once\nmore made a fast break and\nscored again. We did, however,\ncontinue our intense pressure\nfor the remainder of the game\nand a try was certain. This, however, only came after some\nhard and good work in the\ncentre by Mike Gibson. He made the initial break down the\nright hand side, which was\ncarried on by the forwards in\nsupport and the ball moved\nacross the width of the field\nand Male Ranson scored in the\ncomer. Only minutes now\nremained and the score was not\nto change over that period,\nleaving the score at 26-4 in Reading's Cavour.\nTeam: A. Davies; M. Ranson,\nM. Gibson, C. Whiteley, S. Ladle;\nG. Clement, R. Tresize; M. Sergot,\nN. Hicking, C. Wrigley, A. Rice,\nR. Sutton, R. Doyle, R. Jones,\nI. Marwood.\nP. P.S.I did not really want to\nbe captain this week, washing all the sodden shirts, etc. But my job was not helped by the\nconsiderate person who filled\nmy kit bag with drain-pipe's,' what? All that with a sack full of shirts and having to pacify\nthe Reading police. No, my old man is not a dustman. Thank\nyou and Goodnight (a nice\nf eli citation).

    "content": "mix PRE C JP3 CE Trevor Phillips YES, IT is true. I am still alive, even\nif no literary gems have been flowing\nfrom my illustrious pen (it's a Christmas\npresent) in the last few weeks. It is\nunfortunate, and partly my own fault,\nthat the Union has not used its newspaper to the fullest advantage in the\npast term. In this term, perhaps, with the\naid of all concerned, we can be more\neffective in the crucial field of dialogue\nwith the Union membership. My own\ncontribution will be to promise a Precipice every week. Perhaps, in this way,\nI can communicate the present concerns\nof the Union bureaucracy/leadership.\nAs with every other section of the\npopulation, the first concern of the mass\nof students today is the effect of the\neconomic situation on our pockets and\nour conditions of work. We have campaigned for something like ten terms on\nthe question of student grants. We have\ngraduated from a position of simply\ncalling for higher rates, to a more\nsophisticated (and rather more publicly\nacceptable) campaign for changes in the\ngiants system, to eliminate the burden\nof means tests on our parents and\nspouses, and for an end to discretionary\nawards and other anomalies; in short, a fair grant for all students. This is a reasonable demand.\nHowever, in the past six months, in\nthe wake of the \u00a3250 million education\nbudget cut, instigated by the Tory party\nand maintained by the unspeakable Reg\nPrentice, we have seen a rapidly\ndeteriorating financial situation in the\ncolleges, resulting in the 2% cuts at IC\nlast term. This is a much more serious\nquestion than the rate of grant, (though\ninextricably linked to it). The treatment\n.at higher education by successive\ngovernments threatens the very existence\nof sections of higher education.\nIn our own area, we can already point\nto the imminent closure of one college of\neducation, Maria Assumpta, with which we have had excellent social relations\n(marf y of us survived on MA discos). A'1, over the country closures and mergers <\nare occur ing; some are commendable.\nOthers are being implemented simply to\nsame money, but the quality of education\nin those colleges in being destroyed.\nOf course, th\u00ab privileged sector, td,\nwhich we belong, is not going to go\nunder. It is those sectors which are\nheavily relied upon by less privileged\nand less influential members of the\ncommunity, that are bearing the brunt of\nthe attack. Adult education, technical\ncolleges, the further education sector,\nall essentially geared to working-class\nstudents, and in the vast majority of\ncases, their only realistic channel to\nhigher education, will be the first to go\nunder. The universities, still populated\nby the children of the middle class to the\nextent of some 72%, (statistics courtesy\nof the DES) will survive.\nThe grants system itself is inextricably linked to the cuts. Holding\ndown student grants whilst forcing\ncolleges to raise refectory prices and\nrents is the Government's second front.\nThis is the hidden cut in expenditure.\nWho suffers? The student, of course. It\nis, again, working-class sections of\nhigher education who get it in the neck the students on discretionary awards.\nIt was worthwhile reading Katie McKinnon' s 'IF Only' on the injustice of\ndiscretionary awards; whilst not agreeing\nwith all she wrote, it is absolutely\ncorrect that students on discretionary\nawards are e as i ly the worst off.\nHowever, in terms of both cuts and\ngrants, privileged though we may be, we\nare not getting away lightly. Financial cuts in departments have meant that\nlecturing posts are being left vacant,\nwhich means the loss of courses here\nand there. Technicians' posts unfilled\nmean fewer practicals and less diversity\nin experimental work. There is less\ndemonstrating work for postgraduates to\ndo, and less expensive material for\nresearch students to use. That much-vaunted 'quality of education' is\nbeginning to fall, with overworked and\nunderpaid staff, and less money for aids\nto teaching.\nThe threat of price rises in refectories\nis imminent in the next few weeks,\nbecause of the self-financing rules. Grants are not likely to follow this trend;\nthere is still a means test to contend\nwith. As the economic crisis hits parents\nharder, fewer will be able to meet the\nparental contribution to the grant. The\nvalue of the grant itself is being eroded\nat the staggering rate of over \u00a37.90 per\nmonth (figure for last November from the\nNUS Educational and Welfare Department).\nThe spouses' contribution has hit many\nmarried students very hard. The ludicrous\njustification for continued discrimination\nagainst married women (that it is primarily\nthe husband's responsibility to keep up\nthe household and wife; no such con-side ration_ applies in reverse) will not'\nsatisfy any woman affected by it.\nIt is absolutely cl aar that a campaign\nwhich attacks both the grants system,\nand the vicious cuts in education-spending must be mounted. This has,\ncorrectly, been called for by last term's NUS Conference in Margate. The Week of\nAction will be the final week of February,\nculminating in a National Demonstration\non February 28th. It is not a time for cynicism. The\nfacts are there for anyone to see. Anyone\ninterested in fighting against the deterioration of the education system, and\nthat includes primary and secondary\neducation, will form a common cause\nwith us in the Grants Campaign. Anyone\nwho is not, either doesn't really belong\nhere, or has failed to realise how\nimportant a decent education has been\nto him.\nIt is interesting to see that the\nNational Front is now '700% racialist' in\nthe words of their spokesman, by refusing\nmembership to people of mixed race and\nnon-European ancestry. It is clear that\nthe 'Hitler was right' brigade is in the\nascendancy (strangely enough\" Jews are\nnot yet excluded), i am only slightly disappointed that I cannot join. Those people who slated me for being\n'unfair' to a 'respectable' organisation\nlike the NF \u2014 how are they to be\ndefended now? Presumably if one voted\nfor them in an election, one would be\nvoting for a'700% racialist' establishment \u2014 universities, parliament, judiciary\nand so on. No-one is going to 'ban' them.\nI believe that this sort of organised\nracism and fascism is unlawful; and I hope that they are prosecuted.\nThose of you who saw a reference to\nmy close personal friendship with a dear\nold lady living on the Mall in last week's Sennet, don't be misled. There is no\ntruth in the rumour. I don't even like\nchampagne.\nHON S \u00a3 C Jacqui Gerrard Elections.\nThis is Election Term. At the next Union Meeting on 30th January at 1.00p.m. there is the election for the Easter NUS Conference.

If you don't know what the jobs involve, come\nand ask me, or hunt out the present holder of the post and ask\nhim.\nSCOPE\nThere is plenty of scope for all interests, so don't just s it there waiting for someone else to run your Union \u2014 come and\ngive a helping hand yourself.\nKeep up to date by reading notices on the Council noticeboard in the Lower Lounge Union.

Thus it would\nhave to be a case of 'one or the\nother', and not both a sabbatical\nFELIX Editor and sabbatical\nDeputy President.\nThis move could, if carried\nout, risk the continued existence of FELIX. When asked for\nhis opinion the present FELIX Editor, Mike Williams said:\n'If the Editorship were to\nbecome non-sabbatical the post\nwould become completely un-tenable, especially in view of\nthe fact that the printing unit\nwill probably be moving to\nCollege Block sometime during\nthe next year. Also the viability\nof Union publications such as\nthe 'Blue Book' which is\nproduced during the summer\nwould be at risk. As for the USK\nHandbook its future could look\nextremely bleak'.\nHowever, it must be pointed\nout that the idea is still in the\nembryo stage.\nSee Editorial (page 2).\nAT LAST WEEK'S U GM an in quo rate gathering of approximately'\nsixty members was startled to find itself voting on a constitutional\nchange.\nGuess\nwho's coming to Council? IT WAS AGREED by ,the\nImperial College Union Council last Monday to invite Mr. Carl Seaford, the Domestic.' Bursar to its next meeting. The reason\nbehind this is believed to be\ndue to the fact that the Domestic Bursar is the principal officer\nof the College in most contact\nwith the students. It is understood that he will address\nCouncil and then invite\nquestions.\nJust before the proposal that\nthe PG Affairs Officer should\nbecome a member of die executive, the President stated\nfrom the chair that he would\nallow only one speech for and one against the proposal.\nAlthough the chair was challenged on this point, the\nchallenge was defeated on the\nvote. The motion was thus voted\non after one speech for, one\nspeech against plus a summing\nup by the proposer (the first\nspeaker) and it was passed. Concern\nAt least one member of the\nexecutive is concerned at the\nmanner in which the debate was\nconducted (See letter on page 2)\nas well as the fact that no\npublicity had been given to\nthis motion beforehand.\nThe result was that the\nconstitutional change effectively\nwas 'rushed through'.\nINSIDE FELIX\nEditorial 2 Council Report 6\nLetters 2 Guilds Carnival 7\nRag 3 Stanley 8\nExecutive 4 Reviews 10\nCrossword 5 Leo Sayer 11\nProf. Bremstrahlung 5 Sport 12\n\n"

Dewey has\nour most acid critic,\nairs his views on\nremained\nHere he\nFELIX.\n528. L instead Hall.\nPrince's Gardens,\nSW7 1LU.12th Jan. 1975.\nDear Sir,\nOn the 2nd January I wrote\nto the Editor concerning the\nfaults in this year's FELIX. For publication purposes I have\nedited this letter down to something like a quarter of its\noriginal size; thus a lot of\nsuggestions made here, remain\nunjustified. ALL these suggestions have been justified in\nthe original letter. In the\nmeanwhile Mr. Williams has\nimplemented a few of my\nsuggestions, resulting in a better issue of FELIX( No.373).\nI would also like to point out\nthat I HAVE ONLY CRITICISED FELIX IN AREAS WHERE I COULD DO BETTER than the\npresent Editor, given the same\namount of time that he has had\non the job.\nIn the Christmas issue of\nFELIX the Editor asked readers\nto be more open in their criticism of FELIX. As a senior member\nof the Sennet staff, I can see\nmore easily than others the\nfaults in this year's FELIX. My first recommendations\nconcern advertising. In the\nChristmas issue, FELIX advertised for an Advertising Manager, 'No experience\nnecessary'. The last phrase\ncharacterises Mike Williams' ignorance and neglectful\nattitude towards advertising.\nA beginner would take time to\nlearn advertising methods,\nconsequently being of little use\nto FELIX before October. My\nproposal, though, is that ANY MOVE TOWARDS MAKING FELIX SELF SUPPORTING( without lowering editorial\nstandards) SHOULD BE WELCOMED. Any additional\nmoney is welcome income to a union who os e college grant is\nlikely to be cut this year.\nI believe that the Editor should be Advertising Manager.\nIn order to achieve self-financing, all FELIX staff\nwould be involved in advertising.\nAll staff (barring the Editor),\nwould be offered a10% CO MMISSION ON ALL THE ADVERTS THEY BOOK. My proposals are based on\nmy experience as Sennet's Assistant Advertising Manager.\nI believe1 am the best candidate\nfor the job of FELIX Advertising Continued on page 9\nThis week's page three girl\nis Anne Pickard who comes\nfrom Winchester and is currently\npursuing academic studies in\nCiv.

She was also totally\nunprepared for a ceremonial\nsplash in the swimming pool.\nPhoto by Roger Wilkinson.\nRAG WAKE\nIS HERE\nRAG WEEK'S gone, the last FELIX carried reports from most\n)f the events, and all that remains is the memory \u2014 Ahh! Anyway,\ntown to business.\nFirstly, next year's Rag (yes, forward planning folks); if\nanyone has any ideas about improving Rag Week (and let's face it,\nit could do with improving)\ndon't keep them to yourself,\nbut let your C CU VP know,\npreferably in writing. Then he\ncan pass your gem's onto me\nand something can get done.\nIf anyone is interested in\nactively preparing for\nyear, see me or your VP we'll need a new co-or d in at or soon, and we need an assistant\nRag Mag Editor now.\nSecondly, this year's Rag,\nand the events not covered by\nFELIX, one way or another.\nThe Rag and Drag Competition\nwas probably the best event in\nRag Week, closely pressed by\nMorphy Day. If you went, I hope you had a good time -and if you lost either a large\ncoat (herringbone pattern) or a pair of black patent-leather\nwoman's shoes, or both, let me\nknow and I can return them.\nThe Chariot Race was aMines dominated event, with RCS and\nGuilds producing little in the\nway of quality or quantity\n(Mech. Eng. I excepted). The\nrace was somewhat eclipsed by\nthe magnificent collection of\nRCS that day, and congratulations to all those\nconcerned in that effort. The\npub crawl was fiercely fought\nout between two couples, and\nto avoid argument, you can\ndecide for yourselves who won.\nBob Longman (Min. Tech I) drank a staggering 31 vodka s, and his partner Helen Natrass\n(Geo. II) 18 scotches and 2\nvodka s. Their chief rivals, Gary Brittain (Min. II) and\nLorna Hawthorne (IF would\nyou believe) drank 2 lagers\nand 23 vodka s, and 27 martinis\nrespectively. Decide who you\nthink won, write your answer on\na plain clothes policeman, and\neat it. Time-wise, the winners\nwere undoubtedly Keith Ahlers\n(Chem. Eng. II) and Janice Ford (Chem. Eng. II) who did\nthe circuit of nine pubs in\n55 minutes and consumed\n7 whiskeys,7 pints of bitter,\n2 pints of guinness, 5 du bonnets,3 advocaat s and got very ill in\nthe evening's frivolities.\nMorphy Day and Smoking\nConcert have been commented\non in a previous edition and\nrequire no further elaboration.\nThe IF Vicars and Tarts Party\nwent well, and with a little\nmore support could become,\ndare one say it, a real hell raising event (sorry!). Finally, the BarB Q. This was a new\nevent for Rag, and I must\napologise for the lack of meat,\nnext If you came, you were possibly\nas disgruntled as I was when\nwhat looked like two corgi s on\na stick appeared instead of a cow. However, this year has\nshown that the interest is there,\nand next year we will have\nlearnt from our mistakes.\nIn conclusion, may I thank\neveryone who helped out in\nRag Week; many people helped,\nbut particular thanks go from\nme to Dave, Pat, Martin and\nStella. Also many thanks to\nKieth, Garden Hall( Bob, Paul, Howard, et a I,),S CAB, RC C,Alan Jones, Flos and Rent-a Crowd. See Ya, John Downs,\nCarnival Co-or d in at or. The\nNATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK College Block would like to remind its\ncustomers that its hours of\nopening are\n09.30 to 15.00\nWe hope that this will avoid the confusion and\nd is app o in fine nt that has\narisen from time to time.\nAlbert's Plum(S.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nALL NIGHT RAVEUP . .\nGUILDS CARNIVAL Mad but \"superb\" Entertainment\nRi zSh a kir Last Saturday saw the major\nC\"&G rag event of this session. The basic idea behind this\nbeing to organise a musical extravaganza that would go on\nthrough the night into the\nfollowing day. Thus all the\nstudents involved in last term's fund raising (stunts of varying\ndegrees of eccentricity and\nsheer lunacy, that might cause\nalarm over students' sanity were\nperformed) could have twelve\nhours in which to practice their\nby now perfected skills. Seriously though, on a less\nsarcastic and frivolous note, it\nwas a well organised event for\nthe enjoyment and entertainment\nof all the people lucky enough\nto acquire tickets. A wide range\nof tastes were catered for and\nthe evening kicked off with\nSutherland Brothers and\nQuiver, who never seem to give\na mediocre performance on the\nstage. Their act and style has\nthe ability to set any audience\nalight and this was well\nutilised. Undoubtedly the star attraction (they certainly proved\ntheir worth) of the whole show\nwas Manfred Mann's Earth\nHand. There was no real flash\nof the old Manfred Mann gim-mick s, such as taking off his\ntrousers or dragging some of\nthe female population of the\nPaul Ekpenyong\n'City & Guilds President Manfred Mann's Earth Hand'\naudience on to the stage. This concert was a serious one iu which the musical talent of\neach member of the band were\ncoherently brought together to\nproduce what one can only\ndescribe as a truly incredible\nmusical experience to have\nbeen seen of this band to date.\nThe last band .of the show\nwere Boh Kerr' s Whoopee Band. Their task was essentially to\nmake sure that no one was\ngetting too bored at 2a.m. in the\nmorning. This they achieved\nwith a lighthearted and at times\nvery comical performance that\ntotally lacked, any talent\nmusically speaking. However,\nthis, hardly mattered since by\nthis time everybody had a. fair\namount of alcohol in their\nsystem. Anyhow. everyone\nappreciated their performance.\nFor those who managed to\narrive at the concert very early\nTim Rose provided a suitable\nbeginning to the night's show.\nThe musical part of the\nnight having come to an end,\nthe crowd which had by now\ngathered in the .ICR to observe\nthe comedians of ' Bob Kerr' s Whoopee Band' dispersed. The\nmore energetic moved to the\nDisco where they could expend\ntheir surplus energy. Where as\nthose not so athletically\ninclined either made their way\nto the bar (which was still open)\nor to the Great Hall where two\nfilms were being shown. These\nfilms were ' The Pill' and\n'There is a Girl in my Soup'.\nSeveral of the people were\ninterviewed during the latter\npart of the Carnival and the\ngeneral concensus of opinion\nwas that it had been enjoyable\nand was a pleasant experience.\nThe President of the Guilds Union, Jenny Jones, was also\napproached and she seemed\nwell pleased with the manner\nin which the events had pro-gres sed. She told us that they\nhad at least 'broken even'.\nmk4. 'Lead Guitarist of Manfred Mann's Earth Band 'Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band'\n\n"
