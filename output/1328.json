    "content": "Our parents had The Beatles, our grandparents had WWII. We have Neighbours!\nThe summer holidays have not stemmed the\ncreate juices down Australia way! How classic\nwas it when Izzy was all set to flee Erinsborough until Karl told her Darcy had amnesia.\nBut, then just her luck he recovers! What does\nshe do? She asks Paul Robinson if he knows any\ngood hitman.\nPaul, still on good form despite having been\ntricked into having his leg amputated, sets her\nup with a napkin sales man!\nBut, one should not talk Neighbours all day\nlong, especially to you new freshers who might\nstart thinking I\u2019m some sort of freak. The summer saw the tragic death of Richard Whiteley\naged 61. Loveable Whiteley was the host of\nanother student TV staple, Countdown. I\u2019ve\npersonally spent countless hours failing to solve\nthe count down conundrum, while I should have\nbeen revising for exams.\nWhiteley will forever have a place in my heart\nwith his fantastic collection of truly hideous ties.\nNormally such pathetic gags would get on my\ntits, but Whiteley\u2019s demeanour made him virtually impossible not like. I challenge you to find\nme someone who really didn\u2019t like Whiteley.\nWhen Whiteley died I imagined that it would\nbe the end of Countdown, this surely was a case\nof the star being bigger than the show. This\nMorning struggled on with out Richard & Judy,\nI doubt Countdown can do the same.\nDeadlines\nIts currently 4.50am the deadline for submitting\nthe completed Felix to the printers is less than\n7 hours away and there\u2019s a lot left to do. Why is\nit that I\u2019m always up all night the day before a\ndeadline. This reminds me of the my nightmare\nBSc research project. I stayed up for 51 hours\nstraight and then went straight out to buy a \u00a3300\nsuit for halls going down dinner, got hideously\ndrunk, threw up on it and allowed compromising photos to be taken. The one to the left is the\nonly one fit to print.\nThank You\nI would never have got Felix to this state with\nout all the help I\u2019ve had, please give yourselves\na pat on the back. Special thanks to Felix\u2019s\nnew Deputy Editor, Alexander Antonov who\nis also staying up all night. But, he has gone\none further \u2013 he\u2019s staying up all night in Paris!\nThanks also to Dave Edwards, last year\u2019s editor.\nDave really brought Felix around last year by\nchanging to this format. I\u2019m only just starting to\nrealise quite how much effort Dave put into Felix and I hope I will be able to match his sterling\nperformance.\nHopefully next week\u2019s Felix won\u2019t make me\nquite as physically ill as this one. You can help,\nplease contribute to your paper, Felix will better\nrepresent Imperial of more of us create it.\nI\n\u2019d like to firstly welcome all the new fresh-ers to Imperial College, have a great next\nfew years! Secondly I\u2019d like to say hello\nto all the second , third and fourth years,\nespecially anyone who was unfortunate\nenough to know me! I am now no longer at Imperial, which is a great shame because the three\nyears I spent there were the best of my life. I\nhope the years you all spend there will be just as\ngood. I also hope I can help you all enjoy them as\nmuch as I did.\nI intend to try and give you useful tips for Uni\nand also give you a view of what world is like\nafterwards, (it is very different). Over the year I\nintend to bring you such essential topics as 'The\nBike Gangs of Cambridge\u2019, \u2018Why Accountants\nare heroes' and 'Why we DO need a Neighbours\nOmnibus!'. First, however, a bit about me. While\nat Imperial I read biology for three years and\nnow I work for Deloitte, Touche and Tohmatsu (I\nguess in the interest of advertising standards I\nmust mention that there are other financial services firms) training to be a chartered accountant.\nThat brings me nicely to my first point; it doesn't\nmatter too much what degree you do you can still\npretty much work in any sector you like. Okay,\nso you can't really become a doctor unless you\ndo medicine (and I still wouldn't trust some of\nthe medics at Imperial) and you are unlike to be\nemployed to be a construction engineer if you do\nchemistry but for the most part a degree simply\nproves you have a brain, it shows to employers\nthat they can train you to be an asset to them.\nAnyway, I wouldn't worry about all that too\nmuch, after all for you freshers the day you have\nto get a job is at least three years away, but if\nyou feel like you don't know what you want to do\nright now, don't worry! You can use most degrees\nfor pretty much anything. Of course if you think\nthat you want to do something particular and it\nmeans changing degrees then go for it, there's no\npoint doing something for three years that you\ndon't want to do and you don't enjoy!\nThat brings me on to my second point, enjoy\nuni! People criticise Imperial; you might see the\nFelix editor wearing a T-shirt reading 'Gimpe-rial' (he is very proud of that!), and it is true to a\ndegree (no pun intended). Imperial does have a\nlot of geeks and also a lot of boys. For this reason\na lot of people say that the union sucks and they\nall go out in London and to other unions. It wasn't\nalways this way, in my first year (god, I sound\nold) the union was brilliant, we went there every\nWednesday and nearly every Friday. Go to other\nplaces as well, London is a wonderful place and\nhas all sorts of clubs and pubs but remember, if\nImperial's own students don't go to their Union\nthen it will be crap and empty and if they do go it\nwill be packed and brilliant.\nIn terms of girls, yes Imperial is 66% boys but\nsome subjects aren't. Biology and medicine are\nabout 50/50 and all of them hang out in SAF (so\nyou have them trapped in one place!) Looking\nback now, I wish I had made better friends with\nmore medics; the rivalry that exists between the\ncollege and the medics simply stops the rest of\nthe college having access to some very attractive\nand pleasant girls! Apart from medics, certain\nclubs and societies have lots of girls, riding club\nand dancesport spring to mind. Girls, you have\nnothing to worry about; guys are everywhere, if\nyou go to the Union you won't even have to try\nand yes, there are some hot guys in Imperial\n(even though I've left).\nUni is not just a place to study, especially in\nthe first year. I did two weeks very bad revision\nbefore my first year exams and I got three C's\nand a D and I was pleased! I passed and, frankly,\nin Biology the first year means nothing, it's worth\n5%! It varies for other degrees but never will\nit be worth more than about 10% so enjoy your\nfirst year; go out, have fun, turn up hungover\nfor lectures, steal traffic cones and signs, go to\nMaroush at four in the morning, make those 24\nhour staff at Sainsbury's earn their pay and, most\nimportantly, make good friends, they will stay\nwith you for life!\nI\nslam has become a sensitive subject.\nThat\u2019s rather unfortunate, because any\ncelebrity who claims an affiliation with the\nreligion will always be seen as a Muslim\nfirst and a human being second. And\njudged accordingly, usually by hardcore critics,\nwho probably spend their spare time nitpicking\npetty details in the Qu\u2019ran.\nNo sooner had tennis star Sania Mirza become\nthe first Indian woman to enter the world top 50,\nthe Sunni Ulema Board, an unfamiliar \u201cMuslim\u201d\norganisation in India, released a religious diktat\ndemanding that she cover up during matches.\nApparently, her skirts and T-shirts are \"un-Is-lamic\" and \"corrupting\".\nI have to stress that these are random Muslim\nclerics, who nobody\u2019s ever heard of before. I\u2019m\nnot sure if they just wanted some publicity or are,\nindeed, just stupid.\nRather than praising her achievements,\nthey\u2019ve been chastising her for not dressing\nmodestly. Of course, Muslim women are known\nfor their conservative dress sense, and whether\nor not they need veiling is a debate I leave for\nIslamic Soc.\nWhat worries me about the Sunni Ulema\nBoard is that they don\u2019t appear to know the\nmeaning of context. Context is the defining line\nbetween an extremist and a rational human\nbeing.\nShe\u2019s a tennis player, not a glamour model.\nShe\u2019s wearing what she feels comfortable playing\nin \u2013 and that\u2019s her prerogative. It\u2019s pure over-reaction, and for people who think women should\nbe protected from manly gazes, they went totally\nthe wrong way about it. All this media attention\nover what Sania Mirza wears \u2013 it does nothing\nbut from draw men to her more. Now they\u2019ll be\nlooking at bits they never even noticed before.\nClever. Real clever.\nThe majority of men, shock, horror, really did\njust watch Miss Mirza for the tennis before all of\nthis hoo-hah.\nMy second issue is their lack of faith in their\nown religion. So she isn't following her religion\nto the letter, who does? Just because one person\nrefuses to abide by the rules, doesn\u2019t mean\neveryone else will. Are they really convinced that\nIslam is so weak that it\u2019ll crumble because of\ngirl?\nWhen those four boys came to London and\nblew up our transport system, everyone was adamant that we should not consider them Muslim,\nfor their actions were not indicative of Islam as a\nreligion.\nSo why is Sania Mirza treated as though she\u2019s\nthe sole symbol of Islam? She\u2019s merely one girl\nwearing a skirt. It doesn\u2019t mean that the world\nwill now view Muslim women as evil exhibition-ists. If anything, she\u2019ll be idolised for her achieve-ments. She\u2019ll attain a support that, sadly, her own\ncommunity failed to give her.\nThe third strike by the \u201cboard\u201d was to say that\nshe\u2019s corrupting the \u201cinnocent\u201d minds of young\nwomen. That, is a disgustingly presumptuous\nstatement about all women. It implicitly states\nthat women are sheep. \"Oh dear, let me rip off my\nveil and run around in my birthday suit, inviting\nillicit sex, because that tennis player is showing\nher legs.\"\nFurthermore, these so called \u201cmen of faith\u201d\nhave absolutely no confidence in the women of\ntheir society. I'll let you all in on a little secret:\nwomen are not robots; we\u2019re perfectly capable of\nthinking for ourselves.\nI grew up on a road full of prostitutes, but that\nnever meant that I wanted to be one. People who\nare predisposed to brainwashing will get brainwashed \u2013 don\u2019t blame the poor catalyst. Those\nwho aren't? They watch and learn and make up\ntheir own minds. It's called being an individual.\nIn the big, bad world\nSkirts and T-shirts are \u2018un-Islamic\u2019?\nIain Heaton\nhe\nNeighbours\ngeneration\nAnushri Patel\n22\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 29 September 2005\n\u2018Good night\u2019\n\n"

Conversly the number\nof applicaticates to top universities\nfrom the state sector has increased.\nDespite government pressure to\nreach benchmark figures the state\nschool intake has fallen across 16 of\nthe 19 Russell group Universities.\nThe Russell group contains the\nUK\u2019s leading research-lead univer-sities, including including Imperial\nCollege.\nThetotalnumberofstudentswitha\nstate school background at Imperial\nhas dropped 3% to 59.6% last academic year. Oxford and Cambridge\nhave dropped by 1.6% and 0.7%, to\n53.8% and 56.9% respectively. With\ntargets of 75.2% and 75%, current\nfigures are significantly short of\nexpectations.\nSir Peter Lampl, a government\nadvisor on widening participation\nhas expressed concerns \u201c3,000 students from state schools who should\nbe going to top universities are\nnot\u201d.\nThis issue is compounded by the\nnews that Imperial College intends\nto increase the intake of overseas\nstudents. During the top-up fees\ndebate last year Sir Richard Sykes,\nRector of Imperial College, told\nFelix (1323) that the number of overseas would continue to increase.\nBut, he did state that meaures woud\nbe taken to encourage state school\napplicants.\nThere are arguments that the\nbenchmark figures are unrealistic\nas they are based on the new UCAS\npoints system. Whereas previous\nsystems have been based on A level\ngrades.\nThree straight \u2018A\u2019 grades at A level\nare equivalent to 360 UCAS points.\nState school numbers fall\nTanaka cafe open\nfor business?\nYu Lun Tang\nNews Editor\nNon-business school students have\nbeen been denied access to the cafe\narea of Tanaka Business School for\nsecurity reasons.\nOver the last 12 months, there\nhas been a persistent and recurring\nproblem with the theft of computers\nfrom the area. Susie Haywood, Public\nRelations Officer for the Business\nSchool told Felix that \u201cas the demand\nfor computers is continually growing,\nit has become increasingly difficult\nto replace stolen computers, there\nis no other alternative but to restrict\naccess to the cafe area.\u201d\nShe stressed that the restriction\nis only for security purposes and\nthere is no secret agenda. The move\nhas prompted fierce opposition from\nthe City & Guilds Union. The decision has been received as another\nattempt to distinguish the Business\nSchool from the rest of the college.\nContinued from page 1\nAlthough most students think its a\ngood idea for Imperial to award its\nown degrees, the ramifications are\nless clear. Most students believe that\nImperial is more popular than the\nUniversity of London and hence better recognised.\nA Senior union officer speaking to\nFelix said that leaving the University\nof London Union (ULU) would leave\nImperial without any influence on\nthe issues that might affect students\nnationwide, including an increase\nin the tuition fees for home stu-dents. This might result in Imperial\nCollege Union with little choice than\nto join the National Union of students\n(NUS) to get it\u2019s voice heard.\nUL pullout\nThe problem arises, becuase there\nare a wide range of qualifications\nthat can tally-up. Students who col-llect points in this way may not be\nas equipped for top universities as\nthose with three A grades.\nA spokesperson for Imperial\nCollege has suggested that it is\nnot the role of universities to lower\nentry requirements to increase\nsocial diversity as this would be\nunfair. \u201cThe problem lies much earlier in the system. Universities cannot be expected to address issues of\nschooling, peer pressure and family expectations that are the main\nbarriers to participation for many\nyoung people.\u201d\nThe statement also mentioned\nentrance to College solely depends\non academic merit regardless of\nbackground, though efforts have\nbeen made to accommodate those\nwho are from the poorest back-grounds, offering scholarships on a\nsliding scale according to the student\u2019s received fee support. \u201cWe run\na number of initiatives aimed at\nencouraging aspiration and achievement amongst young people who\nmay not otherwise consider higher\neducation and have well-established\nlinks with local schools, overseen by\nthe recently appointed Director of\nAccess.\u201d\n3\n2\n9\n1\n5\n6\n3\n6\n2\n1\n7\n4\n3\n6\n1\n2\n2\n5\n5\n9\n7\n8\n3\n7\n2\n6\n2\n5\n3\n7\nMore of them went to uni last year\n\n"

Stay Indoors\nStudies show that over 90% of social interaction takes place outside of your own bed-room. Don\u2019t let it happen to you.\n2. Join a Rubbish Society\nImperial has far too many clubs and socie-ties, covering all kinds of social fetish. As a\nstudent here, it\u2019s pretty much required that\nyou join at least one, so why not join the geekiest one you can. Freshers Fair is this week, so\ntake a look around and find the worst avail-able. Good things to look out for include\n\u2022Barely anybody else has signed up\n\u2022Their Table has a laptop on it\n\u2022Neckbeards\n\u2022Absence of girls\n\u2022Poor-quality confectionery. This is especially important.\n3. Enrol at Imperial\nSee, you\u2019re almost there already.\n4. Speak Like a Geek\nOn some rare occasions you may be forced\ninto conversation, and so you\u2019re going to need\nsome prepared topics to speak about, thus\nforcing the person who spoke to you to never\nwant to speak to you again. So remember\nthat there\u2019s nothing more interesting than\nhearing a strangers A-Levels, that spouting\nthe virtues of Linux is ever-so-popular and\nthat if all else fails you can always try to prove\njust how much smarter you are than them.\nNothing livens up a party like Integration,\nFluid Dynamics and talking about fucking\nrocks (RSM, shame on you).\nSporty\nDespite being viewed that way, Imperial\nisn\u2019t entirely made up of geeks. We also have\nsporty types who prefer physical exercise to\nworking their clicking hand. They can normally be found in the bar on a Wednesday\nevening, singing about their supposed sexual\nprowess and throwing up. Sounds fun, eh?\nWell it is, and if fun is your cup of tea, you\u2019ll\nwant to get involved. First of all though, you\u2019ll\nneed to decide which sport it is you want to\nplay. Please bear in mind that actual sporting\ntalent is almost entirely irrelevant here; Most\nteams are so rubbish / desperate for players\nthat they\u2019ll take anyone.\nFootball\nA gentleman\u2019s game, played by thugs (or\nmaybe that\u2019s Rugby), Football is the national\nsport and one of the biggest clubs at Imperial.\nThe main men\u2019s club has seven teams, which\nunfortunately is about six too many. Pace,\nControl and Awareness \u2013 All these things\nhave no place at IC FC, as all you need is a\ndrinking habit and an appreciation for boob.\nPerhaps our teams would be more successful\nif their minds weren\u2019t occupied with dreams\nof Championship Manager and Lucy Pinder.\nPreferably together.\nWomen\u2019s Rugby\nIf you\u2019re a girl (and you\u2019re probably not)\nyou could always try out for the ironically\nnamed IC Virgins. Just be sure to bring your\nboots, shorts, and diaphragm. I\u2019m completely\nunaware as to whether they\u2019re any good or\nnot, as their reputation is not quite a sporting one. Promiscuity and STDs are the key\nqualifications for any budding Virgin, as is the\nability to out-sing the boy\u2019s team. As any guy\nwill tell you, there\u2019s nothing more attractive\nthan a girl who can drink you under the table,\ntake you back to her room and it\u2019s bedpost so\nnotched it\u2019s falling to pieces, and proceed to\ngive you the worst case of crabs of your short\nyoung life. They\u2019re femininity personified.\nUltimate Frisbee\nObviously, these people wouldn\u2019t lower\nthemselves to Regular Frisbee, or \u2013 god forbid \u2013 to just playing for fun. No, they\u2019ve taken\na perfectly lame game and turned it into an\neven lamer \u2018sport\u2019. I don\u2019t quite understand\nhow anybody can win at throwing a yellow\npiece of plastic around, it seems like a game\nin which there can be only losers to be hon-est. And why is it \u2018Ultimate\u2019? It\u2019s just a little\ngame; there isn\u2019t Ultimate Hangman, Pro\nMousetrap and Extreme Hide and Seek, and\nthey\u2019re all far better wastes of time.\nSo what have we learned about Imperial?\nThat we\u2019re rubbish? True. That we should\nhave gone to Kings? Again, true. But where\nelse would you find such a diverse mix of idiot\nthan here? The next few years of your life\nwill be fun, but only if you actually bother to\nhave any. Go out, make friends, see London,\nget drunk (if you want), and you\u2019ll see why\ndespite the fact that all we ever do is complain about the place, we\u2019re all still here.\nfelix\nThursday 29 September 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk 11\nhoff\nZane Lowe: the guy from Radio 1 with the\ndodgy accent. What you may not know is that\nZane has been kicking around the studio\ncreating music for years and over the British\nsummer of 2004, Zane joined with Hamish\nClark and Andy Lovegrove to create The\nSound Inside under the name of Breaks CoOp, a New Zealand band highly acclaimed in\nits own country.\nWith the passing of summer, this is an\nalbum which will cast your mind automatically back to all those nostalgic summer\nmemories of sun, sand and reeeelaxing. It\u2019s\nrich in all things summer and comes practically sun-drenched. You would find it hard\nto believe that it was recorded in an inner-city London studio and not in a garden shed\noverlooking the unspoilt deserted beaches of\nNew Zealand.\nFrom first listen this album grabs you and\ngently and tenderly wraps you in its smooth,\nsultry and soulful sounds. A laxed beat and\nthe crooning vocals flow through on a diverse\nmix of ballads, acoustic instrumentals and\nsongs that don\u2019t leave you, even after you\nleave them. You could label this trip hop,\nearthy electronica and even at a push, folk\n(but let\u2019s not), though what this is is clever.\nStandout tracks, quite frankly all of them,\nbut if you have to raise some to a loftier peak,\nthen the first single The Otherside and the\nsecond track Wonder are the ones to put up\nthere.\nThe best way to listen to The Sound Inside\non these autumnal days is to find a sunbeam,\nput your face into the light and let the music\ndo the rest.\nAlbum reviews\nWelcome to Paradise\nThe Sound Inside\nby Breaks Co-Op\nEMI Records\nStarts beautifully, with a track that is more of\nan instrumental overture than a song, skipping between three or four different themes\nas it slowly builds up to a (slightly clich\u00e9,\nadmittedly) harder, chugging guitar climax.\nIt takes its time, but never becomes boring. Q\nMagazine, quoted on the front of the CD, had\nthis to say on the album: \u201cNonchalantly cool\ndebut...\u201d, and as the first song drew to a close\nI was hopeful that this quote was, for once,\ntelling the truth, and that I was about to hear\na wonder of an album that built on the tension\ndeveloped in the first five minutes.\nNow I wasn\u2019t exactly disappointed, since\nI quite like \u201860s NY rock, but several times\nI found myself wondering if the Velvet\nUnderground had released a new single. I\nfelt like I\u2019d been deceived by the beauty of the\nbuild up, as the rest of the album then unfolded into - very nicely put together, admittedly\n- easy indie rock.\nHaving said this, it is nice to see the British\ninfluence travelling over the pond. There are\novertones of the English Indie ideal peppered\nall through the tracks, and while I was hoping,\nperhaps, for something a little more challeng-ing, there wasn\u2019t a moment during the entire\nalbum when I felt like switching it off.\nBut strangely this is also one of my main\ncriticisms of the album as well. The reason I\nkept listening is because I was interested in\nwhat they might do next. There is little feeling\nof a single band at work. It\u2019s puzzling, since a\nquick glance at the sleeve notes reveals that\nall songs were written by the same fellow\n(one assumes the singer) \u2013 except the first\none, tellingly, which seems to have been a\ngroup effort. And yet he doesn\u2019t feel content\nwith a specific style. This is, I accept, usually to be applauded, but in this instance it\nleft me with the feeling I\u2019d just listened to a\ncompilation album put together by a NY indie\nlabel, showcasing the various signings they\nhave \u2013 all a similar style, but no coherence. If\nI haven\u2019t made myself clear, I have the exact\nopposite feeling about Radiohead (sorry to\nbring it up, and possibly show my age) who\nseem to have very different types of song, but\nretain an obvious style.\nAnd yet, as I sit here writing this, I have\ncasually lifted my hand and pressed the play\nbutton on my CD player. I haven\u2019t put in the\nCD that was in before, and, despite the fact\nthat I\u2019m running out of room on my mp3\nplayer, I\u2019m probably going to rip this on as\nsoon as this piece is finished.\nSo maybe they\u2019re a victim of the quality of\ntheir first track. If they\u2019d gone straight into\nthe second, I would probably have happily listened all the way through, nodding my head\nto the lovely retro rhythms. But, as it was,\nI spent the time hoping for a little bit more\nof that original magic. Perhaps they should\nwrite more as a band\u2026\nThe Antidote\nby Morcheeba\nEcho\nThe caf\u00e9 set have many different tastes, and\nso it is Morcheeba. With an emphasis on the\nvocal performance these songs sound like\nthey have been taken from a funky musical.\nFrom the first song, Wonders Never Cease,\nthe sultry voice of Daisy Martey invites you\non a journey. Sounding like a James Bond\ntheme, Everybody Loves a Loser is a change\nfrom their usual chill-out style. Sometimes\nthe statement and reply phrasing of the lyrics can become tiresome as in Living Hell,\nbut this album seduces and has you coming\nback for more. The use of brass in Lighten Up\ngives a warm lift and the chorus is one of the\nmost catchy this year.\nSome fans of the band will be disappointed\nby the change in direction but I think the new\nMorcheeba album is well worth a listen.\nFree\nMusic\nDo You Like Free Stuff?

The fifth year is not fun when\nit comes to getting my most exquisite nose down to the grindstone,\ndespite the increased responsibility\nshadowing at an outer London GP\npractice brings\u2026.\n..and added responsibility in an\naffluent area of London is certainly\na bonus when the catchment area\ncontains twenty-thousand tanned\nand built South African men under\nthe age of thirty-five.

Regretfully for me, the bleeding fanny put\na stop to my efforts, and I left New\nYork with a suitcase full of clothes,\nshoes, make-up and CD\u2019s and an\narray of cultural experience on a\nnon-sexual level.

Its decor was in\nneed of replacing and the furniture was falling apart.\nBut, it was still the best place\nto go for a drink on campus, and\nits going to be a sad year without\nit. College did suggest re-hous-ing Southside in Linstead hall,\nbut last year\u2019s Union President,\nMustafa Arif, thwarted this plan.\nIn doing so he also caused the\nclosure of all hall bars. So if your\nsitting around halls wondering\nwhy you can\u2019t get a cheap drink,\nyou know who to blame.\nThis issue might not have been\nquite as important if there were\nany suitable local alternatives. If\nyou haven\u2019t discovered the local\nprices yet, lets just say you\u2019ll be\nlucky to get a pint for under \u00a33.\nUNITE halls\nWhat happened in Liverpool hap-pened, but its in the past now.\nIts important that Freshers are\naware of the previous problems,\nbut these halls should be judged\non their future performance.\nPiccadilly court is a long way\nfrom College, but student accommodation in London is scarces\nat the best of times and this\nappears to be the optimal solu-tion. Southside had to come down\nand the new building promises to\nsurpass even Beit in luxury.\nBut, are luxurious halls what\nstudents want?

    "content": "Mortensen\u2019s History of Violence\nAnd we are\u2019nt talking about orcs here\nHistory of Violence\nDirector: David Cronenberg\nStarring: Viggo Mortensen, Maria\nBello, William Hurt.\nLength: 96 minutes\nCertificate: 18\nReleased:30 September 2005\nHHHII\nD\nirected by David\nCronenberg, A History\nof Violence is a film that\ncovers the \u201cinescapable situation\u201d theme\nthe director has dealt with before.\nStarring Viggo Mortensen (best\nknown as Strider from the Lord of\nthe Rings trilogy) as the go-lucky\nfamily guy Tom Stall, this is one of\nCronenberg\u2019s most accessible films\nyet.\nSettled happily in a small com-munity, Tom runs his own average-joe \u201cStalls\u201d diner, and is married\nhappily to very American wife Edie\n(Maria Bello), who together parent\ntheir son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and\ndaughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Tom\nleads a respectable life with a good\nstanding in the community.\nHowever, this peaceful present\nis shattered when Tom thwarts\nan attempted robbery at his diner,\nunwillingly allowing his past to catch\nup with him. The media praises\nhim as a hero, but his actual history\ncould not be further from this, and\nnow Tom, his family and his community have to discover the ugly truth\nthe hard way. An interesting, but\nimperfect, look at a person\u2019s History\nof Violence.\nThe film is well executed and\ndirected, but contains a few unnecessary scenes, especially in the\nintroduction where there are many\nLand of the \u2018senseless\u2019 dead\nZombies past their prime\nLand of the dead by George A.\nRomero is deader than the zombies it has in it. The story is sim-ple. Several years ago, dead people\nrose from their graves in search\nof human flesh. Like vampires, the\nzombies turn the live ones into zombies by biting them. The humans\nwho managed to escape the terrible\ncurse barricaded themselves in the\ncity, fending the zombies off with\nbarbed electric wire. What makes\nthings bizarre is the fact that there\nis still status division in such dire\ntimes. There are the rich ones who\nstay in the nice high-rise building\nand then there are the poor normal\npeople whose lives are limited to the\nbasement and the ground.\nEvery night, the humans organized raids into zombie-ville for food\nand medicinal supplies. All they had\nto do were to release fireworks in\nthe sky (which apparently stupefies the zombies), ransack the abandoned grocery stores and shoot any\nzombie that dares to cross their\npath. However, one of the \u2018smarter\u2019 zombies was infuriated by the\nhumans\u2019 intrusion into their world.\nHe led the zombies into the \u2018live\u2019\ncity, using guns and other \u2018life one\u2019\ntools against the humans. \u2018Zombies\nBite Back\u2019, you get the picture\u2026\nFrankly, you do not buy tickets for\n\u2018Land of the Dead\u2019 and expect an\nenlightening experience. However,\nit is not wrong to at least expect\nthe film to be entertaining. To be\nfair, Romero did introduce a new\nconcept of zombies. The zombies\nin this movie are smart and have\nthe capability to evolve (the hor-ror!). However, he didn\u2019t expand on\nthis aspect and focused his film on\nlengthy displays of gore. It\u2019s definitely not a film for the easily-dis-gusted because despite my frequent\nrun-ins with Quentin Tarantino pro-ductions, this is just gross.\nGranted, there were a few shocking scenes as expected in a film\nwith a \u2018horror\u2019 title. There were\nalso a few attempts at humour with\nvague references to George Bush.\nHowever, I think the director must\nhave been confused when he made\nthis film. The movie is neither a\n\u2018horror\u2019 film nor a comedy. The\nstoryline was simplistic and would\nhave reached the audience better as\na comedy but the scriptwriter tried\nto make the characters deeper than\nthey should have been. Hence, he\nruined the movie\u2019s potential to be a\ngood comedy.\nThe acting skills of the cast were\nwasted in this movie. Simon Baker\nis a talented actor and he should\nhave known better than to have\nincluded this movie in his portfolio.\nHe did a very good performance\nof a misunderstood and \u2018shut off\nfrom the world\u2019 hero but this character is simply misplaced in a movie\nof such lack of depth. Cholo (John\nLeguizamo) is the cowboy among\nthe team of raiders who is bent\non getting things his way. He\u2019s a\ngood-looking fellow and his character would have been better placed\nin a more thought-provoking film.\nThe only actor who doesn\u2019t deserve\nany honourable mention at all in this\nhorrible movie, is Kaufman (Dennis\nHopper). His acting was stilted and\njarred with the rest of the cast.\nPerhaps if he had been more menacing with his lines, the whole movie\nmight have been saved. However,\nLand of the Dead\nDirector: George A. Romero\nStarring: Simon Baker, Dennis\nHopper, John Leguizamo\nLength: 93 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nReleased:23 September 2005\nHIIII\nfilm.felix@iimperial.ac.uk\ndue to his stupid accent, the villain\nin this movie is simply more repulsive than hate-inspiring.\nIn a nutshell, \u2018Land of the dead\u2019\nis simply a waste of money. Readers\nshould avoid the movie like the\nplague unless of course, they are\nstrangely inspired by scenes of\nextreme disgust and mindless violence (that is worrying). The actors\nin the show must have had the fun\nof their lives messing around in all\nthat gore (like children in the mud-pen) but a fun-to-watch, this movie\nis definitely not.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\n\u201cfamily guy\u201d portrayals. However,\nfifteen minutes into the film, the\nplot tightens and the atmosphere\nthickens.\nFor those who have seen the trail-ers, A History of Violence is not as\naction packed as the trailers sug-gested. It dwells mainly in the characters reflections and relations, built\naround abrupt but dispersed gun\ntotting scenes. The action though,\nwhen it happens, is realistic, fast\npaced and brutal, with the audience\nbeing drawn into the intensity of the\nreal time gore scenes, left to piece\ntogether what they just witnessed in\nthe blink of an eye.\nCredit must go to Mortensen\nfor accurately playing a character\ncaught between two personalities\nand two lives. The viewer\u2019s sympa-thises clearly sense the hurt Tom\nis going through as he protects his\nfamily both from danger and from\nbeing hurt by the truth. Yet, at the\nsame time, the no-more-mister-tom-stall challenges this sympathy and\nsimultaneously questions the safety\nof the family.\nThe changing relations between\nthe characters as the plot develops\nare well played throughout, with raw\nemotions and gritty realism making the acting believable. For the\nwhole length of the film, Mortensen\noozes the \u201cnormality\u201d his character\nneeds to gain the audiences sympa-thy. Bello is fantastic as the wife in\ndoubt, and performs her role with a\ncertain vulnerability that gives her\ncharacter importance and appeal.\nIt must be said though that her\nscript is rather straightforward and\nnarrow.\nEd Harris also brilliantly stars in\nthe rather short lived role as Fogarty,\nthe man with the key to Tom\u2019s past,\nin a quirky and eerie role, suited to\nhis acting image and his make-up in\nfilm. William Hurt makes an unexpected appearance (one to watch\nout for) in a simultaneously hilarious but dangerous role.\nThe biggest failing with this film\nthough is, in my opinion, the way\nthe storyline is adapted to the film.\nAlthough the plot contains a few\ntwists, it is all somewhat predict-able, and the intro and the ending leave some refinement to be\ndesired. A little more attention to\ndetail and a tiny bit more unpredictability would have gone a long way\nto make an already very good film\ngreat. Other than that, A History\nof Violence is a recommended film,\nwith very engaging acting and a\nsatisfying plot.\nAmmar Waraich\nWhen the past comes a calling, pour him a cuppa...\n9\nfelix\nThursday 29 September 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\ufb01lm\nLand of the Dead - Simply a waste of money\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nhat makes us human?\nOur ability to form\ncomplex social struc-tures? Our use of lan-guage? Our concept\nof self? It is undeniable that, of the\nplethora of species that inhabit the\nEarth, humans are unique.\nWhile similarities with our closest\nrelative, the chimpanzee, are easy\nto spot, our furry friends are still\nvery much animals and not peo-ple. So the recent publication of the\ndraft sequence of the chimpanzee\ngenome stands to teach us much not\nonly about our closest evolutionary\nrelative, but also about ourselves\nand what it is that makes us who\nwe are.\nYet DNA sequencing is just the\nstart of the story. You can think of\nthe chimp genome as being a lot\nlike a new textbook; it needs to be\nread before anything can be learnt\nfrom it. The way in which scientists\nplan to \u2018read\u2019 the 2.8 billion pairs of\nDNA letters that make up the chimp\nblueprint is to compare it with the\nhuman genome sequence published\na few years ago. The aim is to gather\ninformation that will tell us about the\nimportant differences between these\ntwo species. So, while a quick flick\nthrough the genome has allowed\nscientists to glean a brief overview\nWhat makes us human?\nof how the two genomes differ, there\nis still a lot of work to be done.\nJust how similar our DNA is to\nthat of a chimp may come as a surprise to many when you look at just\nhow much we vary on the outside.\nConsider our large cranial capacity,\nthe fact that we walk on two legs,\nand our advanced brain development allowing the use of complex\nlanguage. Plus it is rare to find a\nhuman with quite as much hair as\na chimp! So when you consider the\nsomewhat clich\u00e9d fact that only 1.2%\nof our DNA sequence actually differs\nfrom that of our great ape cousin, it\nbecomes obvious that this small percentage of changes must have had a\nbig impact on our evolution.\nThis importance of a small subset of genes in our human-ness\nhas in fact been known for some\ntime following the observation that\nhumans share 88% of our genes\nwith rodents and 60% with chickens,\ndespite being little like either spe-cies. Because of the fairly recent\ndivergence of humans and chimpanzees from their last common ances-tor, we would expect the genomes\nof the two species to be much more\nsimilar than that seen with previously sequenced genomes such as\nthat of the rat as, in an evolutionary\nscheme of things, there hasn\u2019t been\nenough time for a huge number\nof changes to take place between\nhumans and chimps. So when scientists compare the sequences, they\nare not focusing on those regions\nthat are the same, but rather on the\ndifferences.\nThe real challenge is in determining which differences in our DNA\nare actually responsible for making\nhumans distinct from apes. Although\nKathryn Lougheed ponders whether the publication of the chimp genome brings us closer to the answer\nonly 1.2% of the genome differs\nbetween chimps and humans, when\nyou consider that there are around\n3 billion nucleotides in a genome,\nit works out that there are tens of\nmillions of differences between the\ntwo species. Some of the changes\nwill simply be silent mutations that\nhave occurred during the 5 million\nor so years since our evolution took\na different route to that of the chimp\nFelix Science is looking for regular and occasional contributors.\nIf you are interested in writing about science, get in touch by\ne-mailing science.felix@ic.ac.uk or come and visit us at Freshers\u2019\nFair. We also produce a termly magazine, I, Science, which has\nbeen shortlisted for this year\u2019s Guardian Student Media Awards.\nscience\nand won\u2019t actually have any effect on\nus. It is the mutations that change\nthe DNA code in such a way that the\nencoded protein is altered that are of\ninterest to scientists. Natural selection has chosen mutations based on\nthe advantage they offer over the\noriginal. The combined effects of all\nof these mutations over the millennia have made us as we are today. A\nsignificant number of protein changing mutations appear to be clustered\nin genes involved in reproduction\nand immunity; giving a good starting point for further investigation of\nwhat makes us human.\nDiscovering exactly how the evolution of humans has diverged from\nthat of our closest cousins is a big\ntask that will be greatly helped by the\nupcoming publication of the genome\nsequence from a number of other\nprimates, such as the orang-utan.\nComparing the genome sequences\nof several species will allow evolutionary biologists to determine\nwhich changes are unique to Man\nand may therefore play a role in\nmaking us human. Hopefully, as well\nas gathering a better understanding of Human evolution, the chimp\nsequence might help us understand\ndiseases, such as Aids, Malaria and\nAlzheimer\u2019s, which affect people but\nnot great apes.\n98.8% human?

    "content": "Sculpture\nAlison Lapper Pregnant\nby Marc Quinn\nTrafalgar Square\nUntil Spring 2007\nabilities, Ken Livingstone said at\nthe unveiling that Lapper deserved\nher place in the square because her\nlife \u201cis a struggle over much greater\ndifficulties than the men who are\ncelebrated here\u201d. Others have interpreted the sculpture as a symbol\nof the female in society. However,\none critic has already dismissed the\nsculpture as \u201crather ugly\u201d.\nStanding alongside the sombre\ndark figures of Nelson, Napier,\nHavelock and George IV, Alison\nLapper Pregnant is made of striking\nwhite marble, making it look almost\npainfully out of place, yet oddly defiant of the history surrounding it.\nThe contrast of styles between the\nnatural, smooth and flowing curves\nof the body and the harsh, stern and\nclassical style of the face is a little\nbizarre, and is accentuated by the\nlong neck, making it seem almost\nas if it is made of two separate\nsculptures.\nAs a strong female figure in a\nshowcase of the male domination of\nBritish history, the sculpture is long\noverdue. Although Lapper doesn\u2019t\nrepresent a figure of power in political history, the strength of will and\ndefiance of the norm shown in her\nA\nfter years of standing\nempty, the fourth plinth\nin Trafalgar Square was\nfinally filled this month\nwith a sculpture of disabled artist Alison Lapper. Created\nby the British sculptor Marc Quinn,\nAlison Lapper Pregnant is one of\ntwo works selected for the plinth,\nand is one of the most important\npublic art commissions in Britain in\nrecent years.\nThe statue is carved from Italian\nmarble, stands at 3.55 metres and\nweighs 13 tons. Ms Lapper sat for\nQuinn when she was eight months\npregnant, and the artist took 10\nmonths to produce the work, sculpting from a single piece of marble in\nItaly. He hopes that the work will\nadd femininity to the square.\nHeralded by many as inspirational\nand a tribute to modern society,\nmotherhood and overcoming dis-A woman in Trafalgar Square?\n\u201cFor me, Alison\nLapper Pregnant is\na monument to the\nfuture possibilities of\nthe human race, as\nwell as the resilience\nof the human spirit.\u201d\nThe National Portrait Gallery is the most\nwonderful gallery in London. Walking\nthrough its corridors you see iconic\nimages of anyone and everyone you can\nthink of, from the earliest paintings of\nthe British monarchy through to iconic\nworks of figures from modern society. It\nalso frequently puts on fantastic shows,\nincluding the upcoming Schweppes\nPhotographic Portrait Prize 2005, which\nstarts on 9 November.\nThe World\u2019s Most Photographed is an\nexhibition that leads the viewer through\nthe much-publicised lives of Queen\nVictoria, Gandhi, Hitler, Greta Garbo,\nAudrey Hepburn, James Dean, John F\nKennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley\nand Muhammad Ali. We see the ways in\nwhich they used and manipulated the\nmedium of photography in order to create the personas by which we know them\nbest. Each display shows a timeline of\nimages, from the famous and iconic to\nthose suppressed for showing the wrong\nside of their subject and those simply\nforgotten over time.\nThe exhibition examines the propaganda used by four contrasting political\nfigures; Queen Victoria, Gandhi, Hitler\nand John F Kennedy; in order to ensure\nthat they were regarded in the best\nlight possible. The differences are shown\nby the growing simplicity of the photographic style of the images of Gandhi\nreflect his increasing political influence\nover the repressed classes of India in\nthe 1930s and 40s. Just as interesting are\nthe images rejected for being unsuitable,\nparticularly a comical photo of Hitler in\nlederhosen.\nThe photographs displayed of Greta\nGarbo are particularly insightful into a\nlife surrounded by mystery. Although\na major Hollywood icon, Garbo strictly\ncontrolled her image in the press. After\nher withdrawal from the limelight in 1941,\nshe continued to be followed and photographed for a public still intrigued by her\nsecretive lifestyle. In later years she was\nstalked by photographer Ted Leyson,\nand the display of his slides shows her\naged face still defiant of the camera just\na few days before her death.\nOther highlights of the show include\nsome fabulously romantic shots taken by\nCecil Beaton of Audrey Hepburn during\nthe filming of My Fair Lady, three powerful shots of Muhammad Ali training\nunderwater, four photos of Elvis Presley\ndrinking in a strip-club, and a bizarre\nseries of photographs of James Dean\nclimbing in and out of caskets in a funeral parlour.\nThe exhibition was produced in collaboration with the BBC, who produced an\naccompanying series of documentaries\non the lives of each of the subjects.\nGlitz, glamour and iconic\n\ufb01gures captured on \ufb01lm\nArts arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPhotograph of Marilyn Monroe, just one of the exhibits of \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Potographed\u201d\nexhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.\nhe fourth plinth is \ufb01nally unveiled to a somewhat mixed reception\nface makes her as deserving of\nadmiration as those around her.\nThe plinth was originally designed\nfor a statue of William IV, but this\nwas never completed due to a lack\nof funds. Since no-one was able to\ndecide on a permanent fixture, Ken\nLivingstone has decided that the\nplinth should be used as for an ever-changing exhibition of artworks as\npart of a move to make Trafalgar\nSquare a cultural focal point of\nLondon. The statue will be on display until Spring 2007, when it will\nbe sold off and replaced by Thomas\nSchutte\u2019s Hotel for the Birds.

A natural limestone sofa had formed next to this\ndrop, which we took turns to rest\nupon while the other was hammering the rock.

This is a short\ndescription of a single ten-hour trip\namongst dozens that went on during\nthat time.\nOnce you start abseiling, all the\nunease drains away as autopilot\ntakes over; but if you do look down \u2013\nthere\u2019s simply nothing to see but the\nvertical wall disappearing into the\ndistance, the depths being simply\ntoo great for your light to penetrate.\nAfter some twenty meters down, you\ncome across a rather startling discovery \u2013 the enormous tennis-court\nof a ledge that you had been happily\nstanding on is nothing more than\na rock-bridge; a random assembly\nof boulders that fell from the roof\naeons ago and wedged themselves\ntogether halfway up the pitch.\nFurther down I came upon a junction in the ropes. The old rope starts\na trail that leads down vertically\nanother 600m, past two abandoned\ncampsites, before zooming North\nin undulations that takes it below\n& beyond the neighbouring mountain chain \u2013 three years of effort\nto explore its full extent.

We\nleave the rope in situ \u2013 a potential\npassage leads off higher up, but its\nnever certain whether future teams\nin future years will ever find the\nmotivation to come back \u2013 an inter-esting, but modest, branch line in\none of many cave systems on that\nmountain alone.

For those\nof you returning I am sure you are\nall looking forward to catching up\nwith team-mates to plot the downfall\nof those unfortunate enough to come\nup against the might of Imperial\u2019s\nsportsmen and women, aided by\neither rigorous training in our brand\nspanking new sports centre or just\nplenty of team bonding sessions in\nthe Union Bar. I will not fritter away\nmy inaugural column preaching to\nthe converted so for those of you\nwho are either new to Imperial or\nelected not to take part in organised sport last session I urge you to\nattend the freshers fair and sign up\nfor whatever sport interests you. In\naddition to shamelessly cheerleading for IC sports teams part of my\nremit as sports editor is to extol the\nvirtues of being a member of a club\nso here goes.\nFirst and foremost being a member of one of our numerous clubs\nis one of the best opportunities for\nmeeting new friends that college\nlife will present. In general due to\nsports people being better balanced\ndue to their wide range of interests\nthey are far more fun than the students who could be accused of taking their studies a little too seriously.\nBy all means work hard but ask\nyourself is getting straight A\u2019s really\n28\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 29 September 2005\nworth being transformed into an\nintroverted geek?

I mean do you really want\nyour friends back home to kit you\nout in a \u201cI went to Imperial College\nbut all I got was a fat arse\u201d t-shirt\nnext summer?\nThe other question some of you\nmay ask is \u201cam I good enough?\u201d\nThe answer is a resounding yes. All\nabilities are catered for from complete beginner up to outrageously\ntalented so no matter where you\nare on the sporting spectrum you\u2019ll\nsoon find your niche. One of the\nbenefits of union-subsidised sport\nis you have the chance to try things\nthat you may not have encountered\nbefore either due to the requirement for expensive equipment or\njust plain old regional unpopular-ity. Even if you only have a passing\ninterest in a sport most societies\nrun initial trial sessions so have a go\nand at the very least you\u2019ll be able to\nwalk away knowing for sure that it\nwasn\u2019t for you.\nSo go forth ladies and gentlemen\nand sign up for your chosen cause.\nWith any luck some of you may even\nfeel the urge to share news of your\nexploits through the pages of this\nesteemed journal.

I would have to\nfind him physically attractive (this doesn\u2019t\nmean he has to be the world\u2019s greatest\nlooker), he has to have a sense of humour,\nhe has to be able to talk about a wide\nbreadth of topics.

I\ndon\u2019t really like cheese \u2013 but for the heck of\nit \u2013 I would say Camembert.\nDescribe your ideal partner?\nMy ideal partner will have a youthful com-plexion, but the vigour and experience of a\nstrict upbringing and good schooling. She\nshall have child-bearing hips and a submissive manner and be no stranger to the kitchen\nand the bedroom. She shall be respectful\nand diligent and shall speak only whenst\ninstructed.\nWhich famous person would you say most\nresembles you?\nI am famous!\nWhat is your favorite type of cheese?\nBitto della Valtellina, a rare cheese, produced\nabove 4,000ft in Italian alpine pastures. It\u2019s\nmade from a blend of approximately 90%\ncow\u2019s milk and 10% goat\u2019s milk and aged up\nto one year. It has the most divine tangy and\nwonderful flavour, while its aroma is sweet\nand botanical. As the cows are grazed so\nhigh up, they don\u2019t produce much milk, so not\nmuch cheese either, making it really difficult\nto get hold of, but I have a supplier in London\nBridge who sorts me out.\n7.30pm\nMasala Zone\n147 Earls Court Road\nhe Date\nRich, 25\nAngela, 21\nAngela\u2019s Verdict\nWhat where your first thoughts when you\nsaw Rich?\nHe looked like a normal guy.\nDid you fancy him?\n(laughs)\nDid you enjoy yourself?\nYes, good fun and good conversation.\nWhat did you eat?\nLamb Rojan Josh, I don\u2019t normal enjoy\nIndian food, but, this was great.\nSo is Rich funny?\nYeah, very funny.\nWill you be seeing him again?\nWe haven\u2019t made arrangements yet, but\nhey, you never know.\nAnd, finally, the question everyone wants\nask, did you kiss?\nNo, I don\u2019t normally kiss on a first date.\nRich\u2019s Verdict\nWhat where your first thoughts when you\nsaw Angela?\nUmm, oh god, how to put it into words.

Luckily,\ngiven the delays to other building\nprojects, Imperial have an option for\na third year should building work\nbe delayed.\nThe UNITE housing group owned-halls,arelocatedsomedistancefrom\nImperial\u2019s main South Kensington\ncampus. Piccadilly Court, is on New\nCaledonian road, North London.\nThe other, Orient House, is located in the Imperial Wharf complex,\nChelsea.\nSome Imperial freshers are concerned that they may be subjected\nto the same \u201cappalling levels of\ncustomer service\u201d experienced by\nstudents in UNITE\u2019s Grand Central\nComplex in Liverpool.\nThe situation in Liverpool was so\ndramatic that the story featured in\nthe national press and on the front\npage of Liverpool Student (see page\n2).\nFelix was assured by UNITE\nthat \u201cthe problems UNITE faced\nin Liverpool are a thing of the past,\nnothing of the sort will happen at\nPiccadilly Court\u201d.\nVasa Curcin, warden of Piccadilly\nCourt told Felix he \u201cwas very pleased\nwith the new hall and was looking\nforward to working with UNITE to\nprovide the best hall experience\u201d.\nNo officers from Imperial College\nUnion made the trip to the opening\nof Piccadilly court on 31 August.\nSarah Khatib, Deputy President\n(education & welfare), told Felix she\n\u201cwasn\u2019t going because it was just\ntoo far away\u201d.\nFelix did make the, 43 minute door-to-door trek from College to the new\nhall. Although this is not a statistically valid estimate, it is likely that\nstudents will spend at least 1 hour 20\nminutes commuting everyday.\nThe hall is fitted out to a high\nstandard throughout with all mod-cons. The highlight of which is an\nabsolutely massive flat screen TV in\nthe common room.\nThe hall is arranged in the increasingly popular \u2018cluster room\u2019 forma-tion. This arrangement is similar to\nthat of the student accommodation\nshown on the popular soap opera\nHollyoaks. Each cluster flat contains four or six rooms behind their\nown front door. Every flat also has a\nopen plan kitchen and lounge with\nsatellite TV.\nDespite being so far away, the\nrent is comparable to Beit Quad.\nAlthough students in Picadilly court\nwill have to fork out for a very nec-cassary travelcard\nThe private rental costs are considerably more than our students\nare paying. College have failed to\nrespond to numerous requests from\nFelix enquiring as to the amount\nof subsidy Imperial are paying\nUNITE.\nStudents might not feel as safe\nin New Caledonian road as they\ndo in genteel South Kensington.\nThere were a total of 3,164 recorded\ncrimes in the borough of Islington in\nthe month of August 2005 compared\nto 2,445 in Kensington & Chelsea.\nRobbery and violence against the\nperson, crimes which particulary\naffect students, are also considerably more common in Islington.\nContinued on page 2\nFREE\nNo 1328\nhursday\n29 SEPTEMBER 2005\nhe student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nfelixonline.co.uk\nStudents\nUNITED in\nworry\nImperial to\npull out of\nUniversity\nof London?\nfelix\nContinued from page 1\nmore common in Islington. During\nthe same period there were 550 incidents of violence against the person\ncompared to 366 in Kensington.\nAlso, as Imperial continues to\nbecome a more multicultural environment it is worrying that racist attacks are more than twice as\nprevalent in Islington compare to\nKensington.\nThe crime issue was highlighted\nwhen during the editors brief tour\nof the area, he was offered illegal\ndrugs.\nStudents will also be neighbours\nto Holloway Prison, which houses\nsoem of the most high profile female\nprisoners in the country. Including\nMaxine Carr, the girlfriend of Ian\nHuntley notorious for the Soham\nschool girls murders.\nAlthough, most students are sure\nto be delighted with the facilities of\ntheir new hall. The distance from\nCollege and the Union are likely\nto cause some students considerable problems. One could imagine\nstudents from these halls finding\nit much harder to drag themselves\nout of bed for lectures compared to\nthose who can fall out of bed into\nlectures from Beit.\nSiddharth Singh\nIn May 2001 Imperial College\napplied to the Privy Council of the\nUniversity of London to have its\nown degree awarding powers. This\nlead to a review by a QAA committee\nset up by the council, which in turn\nassessed Imperial College\u2019s suitability by carrying out a review.\nA paper submitted by Andrew\nSmith Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare, 2002-03) to Imperial Union\nCouncil on 12 May 2003 discussed the\npossibility of setting a policy on the\nissue. The paper discussed issues\nsuch as the influence of UL and\nthe students attitude to receiving\ndegrees from Imperial College rather than UL. Sameena Misbahuddin,\nImperial College Union President\nsaid \u201cWe want student opinion on\nthis, we will take whatever the students want to College\u201d. She said that\nthe issue would be taken up in the\nnext meeting of Senate.\nThe issue has recently become\nmore important as other Univerisity\nof London colleges, including LSE,\nKings and UCL have also applied to\nhave similar powers and this could\nlead to a break up of the University\nof London. Kings College student\nnewspaper \u2018ROAR\u2019 has carried a\nstory on Imperial\u2019s degree awarding\npowers, citing that Imperial could\ntrigger the collapse of the university\nof London.\nSir Richard Sykes, the Rector of\nImperial College has said that no\ndecision has been made yet about\nusing the powers that have been\nawarded, and if any decision is made\nit would only affect students entering Imperial in 2007. An alternative\nplan of action could be a compromise where the college has a special\nunderstanding with the University\nof London, allowing Imperial to use\nits powers yet remain a part of the\nUL.\nContinued on page 2\nPiccadilly Court, Imperial\u2019s new hall \u2013 It\u2019s plush but it\u2019s a long way\nfrom College and a stone\u2019s throw from Holloway Prison.\nMiss Con\ufb01dentiality\nanswers all your\nquestions\npage 27\npage 8\nOur \ufb01lm critic\u2019s verdict on the latest\nAusten adaptation\n\n"

Sabbatical of\ufb01cers are often out of their of\ufb01ces\nworking for the students, but to help I will be setting aside\n\u201csurgery\u201d hours starting from 10th October - Monday,\nWednesday and Thursdays 12pm-1pm in the Union of\ufb01ces.\nAlternatively you can email the Sabbatical team on:\nSameena Misbahuddin - President\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nSimon Matthews - Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\ndpcs@imperial.ac.uk\nSarah Khatib - Deputy President (Education and Welfare)\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk\nTim Aplin - Deputy President (Finance and Services)\ndpfs@imperial.ac.uk\nLuis Hui - Deputy President (Graduate Students)\ndpgs@imperial.ac.uk\nDanny McGuinness - ICSMSU President\nThe delightful Mr Neate has given me the opportunity to have\na little column each week. I better start with an introduction. My\nname is Danny and I\u2019m the Medic President (controversial to\nbe given a column I know). As far as I know, a medic president\nhasn\u2019t done this before but I guess my job is to report what\u2019s been\ngoing on in the medic world and as a member of council and the\nunion executive I can probably throw that in every now and again. There will however\nbe no mention of donuts for votes.\nThe Medical School lies pretty dormant over the summer months which has given me\nplenty of opportunity to get on with some \u2018work\u2019. The college in it\u2019s drive to increase\nfunds at every available opportunity (some might say to put glass on the front of buildings instead of books in libraries and teachers in lecture theatres) has been hiring out\nthe SAFB on a daily basis to a range of conferences. My personal favourite was weight\nwatchers day, I felt exceptionally guilty munching on a panini whilst others were promoting the 21st century miracle cure that is slimfast.\nA summer of freshers\u2019 fortnight planning is beginning to become a reality with events \ufb01nalised and freshers\u2019 signing up like there\u2019s no tomorrow. The fear has kicked in but the\nenthusiasm of the new intake leads me to believe it\u2019s going to be a very special year.\nOver the course of the next few months I\u2019m looking forward to some good-hearted\nICSM vs IC rivalry and banter, varsity day being one of the undoubted highlights. We\u2019re\nall nice people (medics and non-medics) and it\u2019s only supposed to be a bit of a giggle\nwhen we poke fun at each other.\nAnyhow, here\u2019s to the next nine months for every part of the union and it\u2019s been a treat\nto say hello. Complaints about a medic having a column can be forwarded to the editor.\nTake care, Danny. x\nThe Information and Advice Centre is run by\nImperial College Union and is a free, Impartial\nand independent advice service for all imperial\ncollege students.\nThe Information and Advice Centre can help\nwith a multitude of problems big or small, it\ncan also help you if you just need someone\nto speak to you or if you would just like some\ninformation.\nAreas The Information and Advice Centre\ncovers include:\nAcademic Advice - Academic appeals,\nComplaints, Withdrawals and help with course\nproblems and transfers.\nMoney Advice \u2013 Assistance with loan, fees\nand grant queries, debt Advice, International\nstudent funding, assistance with applications\nto the Hardship fund, Postgraduate funding\ninformation.\nHousing Advice \u2013 Tenancy agreement checking service, Help getting unfairly held deposits\nback, assistance on getting your landlord to\ncarry out repairs, illegal evictions and harass-ment, information about your general housing\nrights.\nInternational student issues \u2013 How to get a\nnational insurance number, International students\u2019 funding, Local and general information\nfor international students.\nEmployment Rights Advice \u2013 National Insurance, Tax Refunds, national minimum wage,\nholiday and break entitlement.\nConsumer Rights Advice \u2013 Help with your\nconsumer rights, Internet buying, Illegal trad-ers.\nPersonal Safety \u2013 Tips and advice on personal\nsafety, Free but limited supply of attack alarms\nand lea\ufb02ets & publications that can help you.\nSexual Health \u2013 The advice service has a wide\nrange of lea\ufb02ets on sexual health and has a list\nof local sexual health clinics; the centre also\nhas a limited supply of condoms that are free\nfor students of Imperial.\nLegal Issues \u2013 Referral to local Legal centres.\nThe Information and Advice Centre also advocates for students in different situations, this\nincludes liasing with college on students\u2019 behalf\nand writing letters on behalf of students.\nIf you have any problems during your time here\nwhether with the college or externally, don\u2019t let\nyour concern turn into a crisis, Make the Information and Advice Centre your \ufb01rst port of call\nit is professionally run by our Student Adviser\nNigel Cooke and can really help you to solve\nany problem.\nThe Information and Advice Centre is located\nin the East Wing Basement of Beit Quad and\nworks on a drop in or appointment basis\nIf you wish to contact us please feel free:\nOpening hours: 10am-6pm Monday - Friday\nDrop in/Appointment\nPhone: 020 7594 8067\nE-Mail: advice@imperial.ac.uk\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into a crisis...\nWhat\u2019s happening at the ICSMSU?\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "fashion\nWelcome to my column of domestic bliss\nwhere I will introduce you to a range of recipes from the basic yet tasty to the downright\nsin-ful. My first year at Imperial introduced\nme to some pretty hopeless cooks and I hope\nsome of these recipes will help them make\nit through this year without overloading on\nMSG and Saccharine. It\u2019s easy to pick up\nready-made meals from the supermarket\nyet they are both pricey and unhealthy and\nshould only be reserved for emergencies.\nAsk any medic about the effect of excessive salt on your blood pressure and they\u2019ll\nbe happy to tell you negative feedback +\ntoo many acronyms on your timetable= bad\nnews for your ticker. Occasionally I\u2019ll have\na Phoebe rating (if she\u2019s not too busy with\nclarinet practice and gossiping about the latest dolls-house trend) or, failing that, I\u2019ll just\nhave to rate it myself.\nStudent basics\nOlive oil (for cooking): 1 litre \u00a32.62\nExtra virgin olive oil: 500 ml \u00a31.74\nPure vegetable oil: 1 litre \u00a30.43\nCoarse sea salt: 500g \u00a30.74\nBlack pepper mill: 100g \u00a31.59\nMixed herbs: 18g \u00a30.25\nGranulated sugar: 750g \u00a30.76\n12 Veg or chicken stock cubes: 71g \u00a30.69\nMild chilli powder: 50g \u00a30.89\nMild curry powder: 80g \u00a30.55\nWholegrain mustard: 280g \u00a30.43\nWhite wine vinegar: 350ml \u00a30.73\nMayonnaise: 500ml \u00a30.58\nValue plain flour: 1.5kg \u00a30.27\nSpaghetti: 2kg \u00a30.85\nPenne pasta: 1kg \u00a30.49\nBasmati rice: 1kg \u00a30.90\nValue chopped tomatoes: 400g \u00a30.17\nBulb of garlic: \u00a30.24\nOnion: 1 \u00a30.16\nAll together this comes to about \u00a315, when\nshopping at Tesco, so try to get mum and dad\nto pay for it before they drive off. Pick up good\nquality reduced meat for the freezer and try\nto cook for two or three to make life easier\nand share the load.\nTomato sauce for pasta\nToday I\u2019m going to start off simple with a\nrecipe for tomato sauce. Paired with pasta\nof any sort it will satisfy even the largest of\nappetites. Any unused sauce can be kept in\nthe fridge for a couple of days and can be\nsmeared on jacket potatoes or toast with\ncheese before grilling to make a pikey pizza.\nThe recipe is easily adaptable- you can chuck\nin olives, some cooked bacon or any herbs\nyou have. After the onion has browned you\ncan add chopped mushrooms or peppers\nand cook for about 5 mins until soft and then\nadd the tomatoes. Basically, do whatever you\nfancy. Loyd Grossman eat your heart out\u2026.\n1/2 an onion\n1 clove garlic\n1 tbsp olive oil\n1 tin chopped/ peeled tomatoes\n1 portion pasta (spaghetti or penne etc.)\npinch of salt + ground pepper (+pinch of\nsugar- optional)\nfresh or dried basil or oregano or chilli powder (optional)\ndollop of plain yoghurt or cream (optional)\ngrated cheese (optional)\n1. Cut the onion in half from root to tip. Chop\nfinely, slicing to the root but not through it\nand then across in the opposite direction.\nFinely chop the garlic clove. Heat the olive oil\nover a medium heat and then add the onion\nand garlic, stirring so it doesn\u2019t burn. You\nwant to soften them until the onion is golden\nand almost see-through- this should take\nabout 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put on a pan of\nwater to boil.\n2. When the onion is softened you can add any\nextras you want like peppers, mushrooms or\nolives and cook them until softened as well\nwhich will take another 5 minutes. Cooked\nchicken or ham could also be added. Then\nadd the tin of tomatoes\n3. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and\nany herbs like basil, oregano or thyme you\nmay have (fresh is better), adding chilli if you\nfancy it with a bite. A pinch of sugar if you\nhaven\u2019t added chilli goes down well. Leave\nthe sauce to simmer for about 10 minutes\nwhile the pasta cooks. At the end of cooking I usually stir in a spoonful of yoghurt or\ncream to make it creamier. A dollop of pesto\ncan also be used to add flavour. Mix sauce\nwith pasta and serve, saving any spare for\ntomorrow\u2019s lunch. Top with grated cheese\n(preferably Cathedral City cheddar)for extra\nPhoebe points.\nfelix\nThursday 29 September 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk 18\nfood\nDarlings! You live in South Kensington; King\u2019s\nRoad is but a hop, skip and jump away and\nyou dress like a student! For any self respecting fashionista, the student look of ill-fitting\njeans, shabby woolly jumper and puffy eyes\nfrom the night before, is just so pass\u00e9. I\u2019m\nhere to make us Imperial Geeks fashionable,\nand no, Geek Chic isn\u2019t in (Eugene!).\nI will systematically dissect (and that\u2019s \u201cdissect\u201d) the lastest trends into a simple algo-rithm. All you have to do is follow, et voila,\nImperial Chic!\nPom-poms\nbeware:\nKeep\nthem to a\nminimum\nas shown by\nBurberry\nProrsum on\nthe catwalk\nin New York.\nAlternatively try\na beatnik-style black\nand white\nstriped scarf\nfrom Topshop (\u00a312)\nSo, to start. All fashionistas know the Autumn\nlook contains pompoms, stripes and polka\ndots. With these key essentials you can mix\nand match to make the Victorian, Russian,\nBeatnik or Hourglass look which dominated\nthe catwalk. In my opinion, pompoms are just\nso bizarre that wearing them will make you\nlook like a complete slave to fashion. The key\nto being a trend setter is not to wear overtly\nhip items, but to wear a fashionable outfit\nteamed with the odd piece that\u2019s going to get\nyou noticed.\nMy favourite look of this season is inspired by\nEdie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol\u2019s muse. He also\nseems to have inspired Alexander McQueen\nand Christian Dior on the runways. Think\nbold black and white stripes, mohair sweaters dresses and black drainpipes, topped with\na baker-boy cap-it\u2019s the Beatnik Look. This\nlook may appeal to those of you who don\u2019t like\nfussy or uber neat. Think tousled hair, with\nlashings of eyeliner and smoky eye shadow.\nThe essence of the Beatnik Look was a rebellion against the pre-war conservatism, so to\nlook effortless, make the look effortless.\nThe Hourglass Look is one that will look great\non those with ample bosoms and of course,\nthe hourglass figure. Polka dot dresses are\ngoing to be a big thing this Autumn, so how\nabout investing in one for the Freshers\u2019 Ball?\nTopshop and Hennes do an affordable range\nfor those of you who have learnt from the\nperils of spending that Student Loan. But for\nthose of you who haven\u2019t, or have the Bank of\nMum and Dad, Roland Mouret and Alexander\nMcQueen (the man\u2019s too good!) had gorgeous\noutfits at their latest fashion shows. But be\nwarned, many people are suggest using a\nthick leather belt strapped tightly around the\nwaist to perfect the hourglass look. It looks\nvulgar and Marilyn would be turning in her\ngrave; keep it simple girls. A pair of killer\nheels and a simple tight-fitting dress with an\nessential great handbag, are all you need.\nGiorgio Armani does the\nmilitary look.\nSteer clear of\nPrimark\u2019s military jackets: a\nconsumer frenzy has resulted\nin buckle\noverload. Try\nM&S\u2019s new\nline (from \u00a330)\nLast, but certainly not least is the Russian\nLook. It\u2019s also called the Russe and has several elements taken from the embroidered\nclothing of Slavonic Peasants, the marching\nCossack, the aloofness of a Romanov Tsarina\nor mysterious Lara of Dr.Zhivago. Imperial\nRussia of yesteryear with its crisp military\nlines is contrasted against the traditional\nembroidered wool peasant-style inspired\nclothing of the Russian Steppes. However,\nhave you seen the new Tesco\u2019s advert with\nProkofiev playing in the background? Great\nadvert- shame about the clothes! Personally\nI feel that the floral prints and floaty shirts of\nthe summer were enough Peasant for me, so\nI feel that you should be thinking Pre-revolutionary Russia. Let them eat cake!\nFashionable freshers?\nDolly Delany\nFashion editor\nOoooh la la: Roland mouret perfected the\nhour-glass look on the autumn catwalk\nwith wasp- waisted models. Dieting is not\nessential but, for those with anything less\nthan a C-cup, chest- enhancing chicken\nfillets are a must.\nBack to basics\nHannah Theodorou\nFood editor\nPhoebe rating:\nTime: 20 minutes\nCost: 30p per portion\n(Loyd Grossman Tomato\nand Basil Sauce \u00a31.60)\nLoved it or loathed it?\nEmail your comments and\nsuggestions to\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

You know everyone says\nI\nIthat when you go to university\nI\nI\nyou can reinvent yourself. Well\nthat\u2019s exactly what I did. I\u2019m pretending to be this druggy muso.\nThe idea was to create this image\nthat would attract the girls, look at\nPete Dotherty and Kate Moss. The\nthing is I\u2019m not really like that at\nall, I\u2019m actually quite a shy geeky\nguy. I don\u2019t know what to do I\u2019ve\nkinda gone too far, and don\u2019t know\nhow to backtrack, everyone will\nthink I\u2019m a weirdo. Any ideas?\nMatt, 19\nDear Matt,\nOh dear, what have you got yourself into? Now you say you\u2019ve done\nsome dumb thing, just how dumb\nI\u2019m wondering? If you\u2019ve become\nsome hardcore druggie and are\nregretting it and want to get clean,\nthere\u2019s plenty of help available, the\nnational drugs helpline for one! Just\nremember when temptation strikes,\nits always best to just say no! Don\u2019t\nstress. Or if you ended up with a\nroom full of groupies and did something you regret? It\u2019s easily sorted,\nunless you now have a stalker, in\nwhich case I\u2019d advise a restraining\norder. If you\u2019ve not quite gone that\nfar and are just regretting the trans-formation? Well mate there\u2019s only\none option, turn back to who you\nare. Your first mistake was to reinvent yourself, the only time turning\ninto a stranger will attract girls is\nif your James Bond, and only Sean\nConnery can really pull that role off.\nThe best thing to do is to put it all\nbehind you and be who you\u2019re comfortable with. Blame it on the booze\nif you must! One of the best things\nabout uni is that it is a pick and mix\nof all sorts of people, and I\u2019m sure\nthat you\u2019ll find friends\u2019 amongst the\ngreat variety of different sweets.\nDon\u2019t worry about people finding\nyou weird, everyone\u2019s different, and\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you a chance\nand find out you\u2019re a great guy who\njust went slightly off the rails, but\nhey everyone\u2019s allowed a mistake,\ndon\u2019t punish yourself too much and\njust get back on the uni train!\nHey Miss Confidentiality,\nI\u2019ve got an itch, an itch down\nI\nIthere. I\u2019m scared it might be an\nI\nI\nSTI. What should I do?\nJ\nHey J,\nWell well well, look who\u2019s been\nmisbehaving! Umm, I\u2019m not really\nqualified to tell whether that itch\ndown under, is just because you\u2019ve\nbeen too busy during fresher to\nshower and so are just plain gross\nor whether you\u2019ve caught something from someone, no judgment I\npromise. I think the best thing is get\ndown to the GP\n, or the NHS walk in\ncentres and get some tests done. Or\nif you\u2019re feeling really open I\u2019d try\nchatting to some of the IC medics\naround. Now to be helpful I might\njust give you a few tips on what to\ndo in future, it doesn\u2019t take a genius,\nwhatever and whoever you do, try\nand stay clean, it\u2019ll defiantly help\nyou to attract members of the opposite sex, and secondly\u2026 use protec-tion, I hate to sound like your mum,\nbut still, it\u2019s you who\u2019s gonna suffer,\nthat and whoever else you\u2019ve been\nfooling around with, I\u2019d watch out\nfor angry ex partners banging down\nyour door!\nDear Miss C,\nI\u2019m a fresher, who came to uni being the envy of all her school mate\nwhen they heard about the boy to\ngirl ratio. Only I find myself severely disappointed. Where are all the\nhot guys hiding, or am a doomed to\nspend 3 years in geekland? What do\nyou suggest?\nCathy\nDear Cathy,\nWelcome to the real world? Didn\u2019t\nit seem slightly unrealistic that\nfate could hand you a 2-to-1 guy to\ngirl ratio and a roomful of fitness\nto take your pick from? Take those\nrose coloured glasses off sweetie,\nits time to face facts. Unfortunately\nyou\u2019re not the first to have these\nopinions and no you won\u2019t be the\nlast. Bear in mind IC is known more\nfor its brains than its brawn which\nisn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Hey\nit give you a chance to either practise your feminine charms, if you\nhaven\u2019t already got them perfected\nor make some really great mates\nwho are guys, giving you a chance\nto get closer to solving the mystery\nthat is the male mind. Give the guys\na chance, they aren\u2019t that bad and\nmaybe they just haven\u2019t shown off\ntheir true Adonis like qualities as\nthey lost that tan by spending all\ntheir time in library. I spy a makeover on its way, what better way to\nrelieve your frustration than by\nshopping? What I will say is, that\neven in a roomful of geeks you will\nalways find a diamond amongst the\nrough, just get ready for some com-petition, because most of the female\nIC population will be charging the\nsame way you are. Remember alls\nfair in love and war.\nDear Miss C,\nI\u2019ve moved into flat with some\nfriends from halls. My flatmates\nare great friends, but bad flat-mates. I mean they never pitch in\nwith household chores leaving me\nwith a clogged sink full of dirty\ndishes and nothing to eat off unless\nI spend hours scrubbing. I think\nwhat bugs me most is though that\nthey also never buy any toilet roll,\nand use all of mine, it\u2019s beginning\nto drive me crazy and I\u2019ve only\nbeen living with them a few weeks,\nwhat do you suggest?\nNisha\nDear Nisha,\nFirstly? Calm down and breathe, it\u2019s\nonly been a few weeks. I\u2019m guessing that you haven\u2019t tried talking\nto them about it? The thing is that\nif you continue to do their washing\nfor them and buy them toilet roll,\nthey probably won\u2019t see a problem,\nit\u2019s just like being at home, you may\nhave just found yourself appointed\nflat mum. If you keep going this\nway whilst silently plotting their\ndemise, things aren\u2019t really going to\nget much better. The best thing is\nto try setting up a cleaning rota and\nmake everyone pitch in. No one like\nchores unless you\u2019re a close relative of Mr Muscle but hey it\u2019s better\nthan living in a room full of empty\nbeer cans and month old MacDonald\u2019s. If you guys are really as close\nas you say then I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll\nunderstand and will make some\nchanges. If not, you could always\ngo army camp on them giving them\none plate, one fork and one knife\neach until they get the point. You\ncould also try using toilet roll as an\naccessory to your outfits, that\u2019s way\nyou always have some around when\nthe need arises.\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHi kids, welcome to uni! Now\nthe fun starts, but fun spawns\nproblems. I\u2019m here to help you\nwith all the worries you might\nhave about life at uni and beyond.\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to email me,\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk. I look\nforward to hearing from you!\nMiss Confidentiality X\nMystic stars\n27\nfelix\nThursday 29 September 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "alone.\nFirstly, \u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 is\na period film that would not have\nbenefited in any way from the new\ntechnologies that have appeared\nin today\u2019s movie industry. Granted,\nthe cinematography in the latest\nversion is breathtakingly beautiful.\nThe shots of the English moors and\nthe countryside were nothing less\nthan inspiring. However, \u2018Pride and\nPrejudice\u2019 is more than a discovery\nprogramme. Amazing cinematography is not an excuse to remake this\nmovie.\nThe second question we should\naddress is the apparent dearth of\nliterature in today\u2019s world that must\nhave led to the exhausted remake\nof \u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019. Have we\nsimply lost our story-spinning touch\nsince the invention of the Internet?\nGranted, \u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 is a\nclassic and the remake has probably\nhelped keep it from disappearing\nfrom the literary world.\nJane Austen, like Oscar Wilde\nfirstly fools the readers into deciding who the bad guy is from the very\nbeginning only to be proven wrong\nwhen the plot unravels. However,\nthere are also new pieces of literature with amazing new plots and\nangles such as \u2018The Time-Traveller\u2019s\nWife\u2019. Why are we looking in the past\nfor inspiration when we have inspiration right here?\n\u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 is a brilliant\nsatire of the ridiculous customs and\nworries that plagued the female species in that period of time. However,\nwhat worries me is the fact that\nnone of the female population of\ntoday\u2019s world gets Jane Austen\u2019s\nP\nride and Prejudice, everybody has heard about it.\nGuys hate it but the girls\nlove it. In fact, the old plot\nof the misunderstanding\nthat soon clears up to allow true\nlove through is recurrent theme in\nromantic comedies. Just to name a\nfew, there is \u2018How to lose a guy in 10\ndays\u2019 and the ever-popular \u2018Bridget\nJones\u2019 Diary\u2019. The original version\nof \u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 (which was\n3 hours long) which followed the\nexact sequence of the story written\nby Jane Austen shot Colin Firth to\nstardom. The latest one must have\nbeen expected to blast both Keira\nKnightley and Matthew MacFadyen\nto stardom as well.\nHowever, the question that\nplagues me is not the quality of the\nremake but rather the point behind\nthe remake. The story of Mr. Darcy\nand Elizabeth Bennet was written\nmore than a hundred years ago and\ndespite the fact that it still strikes a\nchord with today\u2019s audience, has it\nsimply been overdone? In our gen-eration, where scriptwriters look to\nnovels for inspiration, (remember\n\u2018Lord of the rings\u2019?) perhaps \u2018Pride\nand Prejudice\u2019 should have been left\nBattle of the sexes: Round Two\narts.\nPride and Prejudice gets another makeover...but does it really need one?\nmessage in this movie. Just look at\nthis month\u2019s cover of Cosmopolitan\nfor proof. I\u2019d like to believe her real\nmessage was not the love story but\nthe female species\u2019 ridiculous obsession with betrothal. Why must we be\nin such a hurry to get hitched? Is it\nonly through marriage that women\nbecome complete? We have come\nsuch a long way since the women\nof those times. Why do we still look\nat betrothal as the only way we can\nbe accepted in today\u2019s society? Has\nnothing changed at all?\nTo be honest, this remake of \u2018Pride\nand Prejudice\u2019 was the best remake\nI\u2019ve ever seen. Keira Knightley\n\ufb01lm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPride and Prejudice\nDirector: Joe Wright\nStarring: Keira Knightley, Matthew\nMacFadyen\nLength: 127 minutes\nCertificate: U\nReleased:17 September 2005\nHHHII\nbrought a softer, more vulnerable\nside to Elizabeth Bennet\u2019s character\nthat helped endear her to today\u2019s\naudience. Matthew MacFadyen was\ndefinitely more \u2018lost\u2019 than Colin\nFirth was \u2018uptight\u2019 in this remake.\nHowever, MacFayden is a dear and\nhe has the cutest puppy-dog eyes.\nAs he strides across the moor in\nhis semi-transparent white shirt\nand billowing black coat, there is\nno one that has better screen presence than he does as Mr. Darcy. If\nI had not seen the original version\nand have not been a fan of the book,\nI would have been totally awed by\nthe on-screen chemistry that flowed\nbetween the two of them.\n\u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 is but overdone beef, tough and hard to swal-low. What we need in today\u2019s film\nworld is a new angle and possibly a full stop to women\u2019s obsession with getting married. We are\nwomen, hear us roar! And if you are\nnot yet inspired, take some time off\nto listen to Natasha Bedingfield\u2019s\n\u2018Single\u2019. Maybe once we actually\ncease our obsession with marriage,\nJane Austen will cease to turn over\nin her grave.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nAll hail the new Sti\ufb00meister!\nTad Hilgenbrick speaks up about American Pie 4\nThe wedding\u2019s over so what\u2019s\nleft of the motley crew? This\ntime around, the focus is on Matt\nStifler (Tad Hilgenbrick). Matt\nStifler is the younger brother of\nSteve Stifler (Stiffmeister) and\nhe gets sent for the ultimate\n\u2018band camp\u2019 experience. To live\nup to his reputation as the next\nStiffmeister, Matt attempts to\nwire the camp with hidden cameras to turn it into the set for\nhis own \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d-type\nvideo. However Cupid\u2019s arrow\nstrikes Matt and he falls for fellow campie Elyse. American Pie\n4 is the next set of gags in this\nfamous series as Matt tries to\nstifle his Stiffmeister urges in the\nname of true love.\nWhat was your first reaction to\nthe making of a fourth American\nPie film?\nI knew there was a lot of pressure\nfor the film to fill the shoes of the\nfirst three but I thought it was a\ngreat idea to continue the legacy.\nIt was something which I grew\nup with and the whole purpose of\nthe film was to make people laugh\nhard so I jumped at the opportunity\nto continue this legacy and I think\nmost people will agree after watching the film that it was a success.\nThe film set up cussing in its finest\nsense and it really is very funny.\nIn the film you play Stifflers broth-er, how was it trying to work as a\ncharacter expected to live up to\nStifflers reputation?\nEverybody who loves the American\nPie films will definitely have a love\nfor Stiffler so trying to create a\ncharacter similar to his was obviously going to be very difficult. I\nhad to study the Sean William Scott\n\u2018s classic films to try and work on\nsome of his quirks, there is a love\nside of the story but a lot of Sean\u2019s\nmannerisms are still there.\nDo the American pie films give a\ngood representation of student life\nin America?\nThere is a surprisingly large\namount of work but there is a big\nparty aspect to it. I think its more\nof either one extreme or the other.\nPeople are either working really\nhard or going out and getting completely wasted with beer bongs.\nThe women aren\u2019t all as gorgeous\nas these films make out but some\nare really really hot. Guess it\u2019s like\nanywhere really.\nHow does the American youth\nimagine typical British students?\nI dunno, posh? Playing Polo?\nHanging out with Prince William\n(laughs). No, seriously, I studied\nacting in London for six months at\na school near St. Pauls and it was\nsix of the best months of my life.\nThere was a place in the neighbourhood called the Duke, it was a\nfantastic pub and every night you\nwould see exactly the same people\nin there. I even went back recently\nand recognised the bar man. I\u2019d\nlove to come back to London and\nspend some more time here, its\nsuch a great place and the nightlife\nis awesome.\nRock on Matt Stifler!\nJonathan Stoddern\nStudento.com\nA stolen moment at the break of dawn...\n8\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 29 September 2005\n\n"
