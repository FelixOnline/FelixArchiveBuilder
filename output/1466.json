Among its eclectic collection of\nleaks are a manual on the \u2018Boomerang\u2019\nmethod of sniper location, a description of FBI methods for mobile phone\ntapping, a full list of British postcodes\nand a roster of BNP members. Their\nwebsite describes their mission as providing \u2018a multi-jurisdictional public\nservice designed to protect whistle-blowers, journalists and activists who\nments that would otherwise be covered\nup. The problem is that along with this\ngrowth has come the inevitable rise in\nthe number of people looking to shut\nthe site down and quickly. Wikileaks\nhasn\u2019t helped its cause by being exactly\nthe impartial publisher it claims to be,\npublishing articles from all areas of\nthe political spectrum without bias towards any particular political philoso-phy. Apart from true free speech activ-ists, this has meant the site has found it\nhard to make any real allies, something\nthey may desperately need as the site\nseeks to expand its reach.\nShrouded in secrecy\nShrouded in secrecy\nhave sensitive materials to communicate to the public.\u2019 For a website that\nhas little funding, Wikileaks has shown\na remarkable ability to stay in the head-lines, bragging of more scoops in its 3\nyear lifetime than the Washington Post\nhas had in 30. Yet how long the website\nwill be able to survive is questionable,\nas it is hounded by governments and\ncorporations that often come with the\npower to switch off servers, confiscate\ndocuments and launch major legal\nbattles - weighty financial burdens on\na site that survives largely on donations and awards from human rights\nactivists.\nTheterribleandthegruesome\nTheterribleandthegruesome\nFor a website that believes in openness and transparency, Wikileaks itself\nis shrouded in secrecy. Ostensibly to\nprotect the identities of the network\nbehind the website, the only face that\nhas associated itself with the website\nhas been that of the founder, Julian\nAssange. Even Assange is a figure of\nmuch mystery, a former computer\nhacker turned activist - who, during\nthe incubation period of Wikileaks has\nbeen described as \u201cfrequently forgetting to eat or sleep, writing mathematical formulas all over the walls and the\ndoors\u201d. A mathematics student who\ngrew disaffected by the amount of research being done at his college for the\nAmerican Department of Defence, Assange has channelled his efforts into\nhuman rights and anti-censorship\nmovements, working on software\nwhile campaigning for global privacy\nrights. Wikileaks has been his biggest\nsuccess to date and while the organisation is still struggling financially, it\u2019s\nmaintained a steady stream of headline\ngrabbing leaks that have caused uproar\nin the mainstream media.\nSources at risk\nSources at risk\nThe biggest of these was the recent\npublishing of classified American military footage of a helicopter gunship\nfiring on Iraqi civilians in cold blood,\na horrific video that only served the\nemphasise the case for Wikileaks\u2019 ex-istence. Apart from the gruesome and\nbloody, the collection of documents\nthat Wikileaks has amassed in 3 years\nis astounding. The site offers nearly a\nmillion articles ranging from Church\nof Scientology manuals to the guide\nfor standard operating procedures at\nGuantanamo Bay and therefore has become an invaluable collection of docu-The toll of maintaining and updating\nthe website is beginning to become ob-vious. After three years of maintaining\nstrict secrecy about the identities of its\ninformants, American intelligence services were able to detain an informant,\nArmy analyst Bradley Manning. Aside\nfrom the fact that Manning seems to\nhave been a steady source of information for them, this will come as a major blow for Wikileaks as it will mean\nthat other informants will be much\nless likely to trust the website to protect their identities in the face of an\ninvestigation, even though Manning\nwas turned over to the FBI by another\nhacker. As I write this article, there\nare reports that Wikileaks is attempting to publish 260,000 classified cables\nbetween American diplomats and officials in the Middle East, and that the\nPentagon has launched a manhunt to\ndetain Julian Assange before he manages to upload the cables. The only\ncomment from Wikileaks on this issue\nhas been on their Twitter stream simply to say that \u2018it looks like we\u2019re about\nto be attacked by everything the US\nhas\u2019 and \u2018Any signs of unacceptable behaviour by the Pentagon towards this\npress will be viewed dimly\u2019.\nIs automation the future?\nIs automation the future?\nThis comes at a time when there\nhas been much talk about Wikileaks\nexpanding from the central Assangebased system into a set of autonomous\nunits that operate across the globe.\nThe purpose of such a system would be\nto reduce the dependency on Assange\nand his team to maintain the website,\nwhile simultaneously increasing the\namount of material they publish. Yet\nthere are many risks to such a plan, and\nit is doubtful whether Wikileaks will be\nable to organise a secure, multinational\nnetwork of Wikileaks cells. The most\nobvious risk is closure and detention\nby various national governments, but\naside from that there\u2019s also the question of whether Wikileak\u2019s finances\nwill be able to sustain expansion of any\nsort. With its greater size, there also\ncomes the question of how they will\nmonitor what gets published and what\ndoesn\u2019t. With Assange not monitoring\neverything, there will have to be some\nmethod to maintain neutrality and\nprevent political agendas from seeping\ninto the website.\nWikileaks is vital for the work it does,\nand there\u2019s no doubt that a great repository of important information will be\nlost if Wikileaks were to go down for-ever. Yet, considering the nature of the\nwork they are doing, it\u2019s unfortunately\nlikely that it\u2019s only a matter of time\nbefore something happens that either\npermanently shuts the website down\nor fundamentally alters its purpose. I\nhope to be proved wrong and Wikileaks has shown an astonishing ability\nto bounce back from setbacks. But in\npitting various national governments\nagainst a few men with limited re-sources, I don\u2019t know many who would\nbet money on Wikileaks surviving out\nthe year\nCheck out what all the commotion\nis for yourself at WikiLeaks.org\n\u201cEven Assange is\na figure of much\nmystery, a former\ncomputer hacker\nturned activist\u201d\nI\nn a surprise press conference\ncalled at Apple\u2019s headquarters in\nCupertino, California, early on\nThursday morning, Apple announced that they would be releasing\na new 4G version of the iPhone \u201cbefore\nthe end of July\u201d. The announcement\ncame just days after the release of pre-orders of the fourth generation iPhone\nmodel, which had broken all sales expectations with pre-orders selling out\nin both the US and the UK, leaving\nboth critics and fans stunned.\nThe new phone boasts many new\nfeatures over the iPhone 4, primarily a 4G modem replacing the slower\n3G chip. Critics have claimed this is\na move to combat the increasing momentum that HTCs EVO 4G Android\nsmartphone is gaining. The fun doesn\u2019t\nstop there however, as the iPhone 4G\nsports a new third camera unusually\npositioned on the top of the case to\nmake the device easier to use when\nwalking, by allowing users to watch out\nfor obstacles in the background whilst\nstill staring down at their phone. The\ndevice also comes with a localised hair\ntrimmer for emergency touch-ups to\nbeards and nose hair, and a glue gun\nto facilitate the repair of plastic glass-es. Apple said the new features were\ndesigned to appeal to the \u2018core Mac\nmarket\u2019, and also announced that the\nrelease of a new app, the \u2018Pretentiometer,\u2019 which alerts users when they\u2019ve\nbecome too mainstream.\nIn a bold move, Apple announced\nsimplified pricing for the \u2018revolutionary\u2019 new device, which will retail at 499\nregardless of what currency you\u2019re us-ing. Purchasers in the US will obviously get a bargain at $499, compared to\nthe \u20ac499 in Europe and \u00a3499 in rip-off\nBritain. To maintain the price differ-ence, Apple also revealed that on top of\nthe carrier lock to AT&T in the US, devices are now \u2018region-locked\u2019 and can\nno longer be imported or brought back\nfrom overseas. This also means that if\nyou wish to travel with an iPhone 4G,\nyou will have to buy one from each\nregion, or in some cases country, that\nyou intend to visit. More details of the\nnew model are expected to emerge after the Electronic Entertainment Expo\n(E3) in the coming weeks. ;)\nSTOP\nTHE\nPRESS\niPhone 4G\nUnveiled\nto Stunned\nPress\nByS.Worthington\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNewspaper rocked by fresh scandals\nT\nhis week saw further scandals for the embattled felix newspaper that is still\nstruggling to recover from\nrecent news surrounding\nEditor Dan Wan\u2019s unholy communions\nwith senior members of the Roman\nCatholic Church. It emerged on Tuesday that next year\u2019s editor-\u201celect\u201d Kadhim Shubber had in fact bought the\nposition for $500,000 from a Romanian Governor Rod Blagojevich. The\nposition was initially supposed to go\nto Barack Obama, who won 51.5% of\nvotes cast in the Union\u2019s online poll, in\nwhat the media described as a massive\nlandslide that set a clear mandate for\nhealthcare reform.\nBut the FBI is now alleging that\nfollowing Obama\u2019s decision to turn\ndown the position in order to become\nPresident of the United States, Shubber bribed Blagojevich to give him the\nseat instead. The FBI\u2019s suspicions were\nfirst raised when they noticed that\nShubber was Iraqi and therefore most\nprobably an Arab. They claim to have\nsubsequently obtained secret footage\nof Shubber boasting \u201csup me bitches,\nguess what - I just bribed my way to\nbecoming felix editor!\u201d Mr. Shubber\ninsists that that comment has been\ntaken out of context.\nThe newspaper\u2019s legions of staff were\nunited, along with both of its read-ers, in dismissing the allegations as a\ndistraction from the important work\nahead. Politics editor Phillip Goldcrees, expressed strong support for\nShubber, asking \u201cwho amongst us can\ntruly say they have never slept with a\ngoat? Oh what, you mean the bribery\nthing?\u201d Poor People Editor Rory Fenton added, \u201cblah blah blah poor people\n\u2013 that\u2019s why I support Kadhim.\u201d\nBut the most damaging aspect of this\nstory for felix may be the way in which\nit handled it. The story was initially\nleaked by one of the paper\u2019s own bloggers in an article for the online version\nof the publication. Staff felt Editor Dan\nWan in particular was out of touch, especially when asked about his efforts to\nclean up the news leak. His answer of\n\u201cI want my life back\u201d led many to doubt\nhis sympathy with staff who have been\neven more rocked by the scandal.\nThe newspaper is used to being criti-cised, for example for making up most\nof its news stories, relying on Wikipedia as a primary research tool and considering staff photographers to be an\ninterchangeable asset with Google Images. But the recent revelations about\ncorruption within the organisation\nhave weakened its bargaining position\nin currently ongoing negotiations with\nRupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation\nabout a possible takeover deal.\nDan Wan has been under pressure recently to testify against Malaysian\nopposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, but both men strongly deny the allegations\nOn your way to work you pass a small\npond. On hot days, children sometimes play in the pond, which is only\nabout knee deep. The weather\u2019s cool\ntoday, though, and the hour is early,\nso you are surprised to see a young\nchild splashing about in the pond. As\nyou get closer, you realise that it\u2019s a\nvery young child, just a toddler, who\nis flailing about, unable to stay upright\nor walk out of the pond. You look for\nthe parents or babysitter but there is\nno one else around. The child is unable to keep its head above the water\nfor more than a few seconds at a time.\nIf you don\u2019t wade in and pull him out,\nhe sounds likely to drown. Wading in\nis easy and safe but you will ruin the\nnew shoes you bought only a few days\nago, and get your suit wet and muddy.\nBy the time you hand the child over\nto someone responsible for him and\nchange your clothes, you\u2019ll be late for\nwork. What should you do?\nThis is the central piece of philosopher Peter Singer\u2019s book \u2018The Life You\nCan Save\u2019. There is, of course, only one\nmorally justifiable course of action;\nwading in. And of the new shoes and\nfew hours\u2019 pay - they\u2019re clearly meaningless compared to saving the child\u2019s\nlife. Singer\u2019s argument is as follows: if\n10 million children under the age of\nfive die every year of poverty, is failing to respond not morally equivalent\nto walking past a drowning child? Especially if combating extreme poverty\nwill take no greater sacrifice than that\npair of shoes.\nBut just how effective is the aid that\nindividuals and governments invest\nin combating world poverty? It\u2019s easy\nto talk about children and ponds but\nthe situation on the ground in a developing country may involve corrupt\nleaders, civil wars and inefficient charity bureaucracies. It\u2019s time to put the\neconomics of fighting poverty under\nscrutiny.\nThere\u2019s an apparent contradiction in\nwhat charities tell us about the world\u2019s\npoor. They tell us that a billion of the\nworld\u2019s people live on $1.25 a day or\nless. And yet they then say that it only\ncosts \u00a33 to feed a child for a month.\nOnly \u00a35 for a mosquito net. Only a few\npounds for a month of primary educa-tion. Unless I\u2019m grossly mistaken about\nthe dollar/pound exchange rate, the\nworld\u2019s poorest should quite comfortably be able to afford all of these basics.\nPeople on such a wage have no financial security as they haven\u2019t the ability\nto save up for rainy days. In the case\nof a sudden medical bill or natural dis-aster, that may mean selling an animal\non which a family had relied for milk\nand meat, leaving them poorer still.\nSubject to such a spiral, it can\u2019t reasonably be expected for these people\nto \u2018help themselves\u2019 put off poverty if\nthey can\u2019t afford the medical care or\neducation to get into work or improve\nfarming techniques. This would also\nhave been the case in London only a\ncentury ago until universal education\nand, later, healthcare were established.\nIt takes a minimum standard of living\nbefore a person can become economically productive.\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that aid will\nmake the situation any better. The\nquestions still remain - how much does\nit really cost to save a life and is aid really a long term benefit?\nA concrete example is the prevention\nof malaria. Nothing But Nets, a charity\nthat sends anti-malaria nets to Africa,\nsays it costs just \u00a35 for one net - \u201cthat\u2019s\n\u00a35 to save a life\u201d, they say. \u201cIf you donate \u00a350, that\u2019s 10 lives saved\u201d. But this\nis clearly not really the case. Most people who get these nets will not die of\nmalaria. Many of those who do get the\ndisease will not die of it, not forgetting\nthat in practice the nets may not always\nbe used all of the time. Taking these\nfacts into consideration (and bearing\nin mind that a net will cover more than\none child) the truer figure is more like\n\u00a3500 for each life saved, according to\nthe organisation GiveWell. This seems\nlike a lot, and certainly considerably\nmore than the charity would have us\nbelieve but perhaps we can put it into a\nwider context. Our own governments\nuse an approximate \u2018price per life\nsaved\u2019 when making decisions about,\nfor example, the cost effectiveness of\nimproved road safety. According to\nfigures by the USA\u2019s Environmental\nProtection Agency, the average life in\nAmerica is worth 7.22 million dollars,\nor 4.5 million pounds; in other words,\nthe government considers intervening\nto be justified if they can save a life for\nno more than every \u00a34.5 million spent.\nBritish figures are similar. If a life is\nworth this sacrifice to save in the West,\na life lost to malaria in Africa will have\nto be worth less than 500/4500000=\n0.00011 lives in the West. It\u2019s simple\narithmetic. Can we really justify such\nimbalance?\nA strong argument against aid is\nthat it encourages dependency and\nremoves the incentive for countries to\nhelp themselves. It is true that while\ncharities must avoid dependency, the\namount of money put by charities towards the education and healthcare of\nchildren in developing countries will\nnever compare to the amount our own\nUK government spends on our university tuition (\u00a37,000 per student per\nyear) or healthcare (\u00a31,700 per person\nper year) for each of us. I\u2019m sure we\nwould all be offended at the idea of this\nencouraging dependency in British\nstudents. I certainly don\u2019t plan to be on\nthe dole after graduation.\nA fair criticism is that food aid encourages dependency when wealthy\ncountries simply offload their surplus\nfood to developing nations, destroying\ndomestic farming in the process and\nleaving communities entirely dependent on the foreign food but this isn\u2019t\npracticed by charities, except in emer-gencies. It is governments who have to\nanswer for that.\nThe argument is hard to refute, but\nit is equally hard to act on. It\u2019s hard to\nconsider oneself a bad person for enjoying at pint in the union or going on\nholiday, and yet the argument above\nwould have us down as passing by a\ndrowning child. It\u2019s certainly true that\nthe drowning argument can never realistically be taken to its extreme, which\nwould have all of us give up everything\nuntil we had barely enough for our own\neducation and health. Thankfully, that\nisn\u2019t at all necessary and the sacrifices\nrequired are quite manageable.\nPeter Singer suggests that every\nperson who finds themselves in the\ntop ten percent of American earners\nshould donate 5% of their income to\ndevelopment charities, rising to 10%\nfor the top 1%. This wouldn\u2019t be at all\ndifficult and, importantly, wouldn\u2019t be\na tax, rather a suggestion. This equates\nto those earning over $100,000 per\nyear, or \u00a365,000. How many Imperial\nstudents are likely to be earning this\nkind of money by the time they reach\ntheir thirties? My guess is, quite a few.\nIn the US alone, this would raise over\n$450 billion - well over double that required to reach the UN\u2019s Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (and that\u2019s not including the amount already promised\nby government) to eradicate extreme\npoverty.\nBut while poverty fighting salaries of\n\u00a365,000 are a long time in the future for\nus students, there is still much that we\ncan do.\nGetting involved in the many charities on campus is a great start. Extreme\npoverty is arguably the last great evil\nleft for mankind to face down. With\nthe right will from both government\nand citizen it can be done and as I hope\nis shown above, tackling it is not just a\nmoral obligation but entirely practical\nand painless.\nAre your shoes worth more than a child\u2019s life?\nRory Fenton spends his summers teaching English to Kenyan orphans - do YOU?\nRoryFenton\nRoryFenton\n\n"

After\ntaking a break from felix\nfor several weeks due to exams\nand such like, I had one final\nopportunity to get an article printed as science\neditor. After a four\nweek break,\nyou would\nhave thought\nthat would be plenty\nenough time to come\nup with an utterly\namazing idea. Some kind\nof thoroughly researched\nfeature with a whimsical interview,\nflashy graphics and a show-stopping\ntitle. But no, nothing, not a sausage. I\ncouldn\u2019t even think of anything to rant\nabout in typical column style where I\ncould bombard you with my opinion\nabout something you really don\u2019t give\na damn about and would stop reading after 100 words. (Though I doubt\nyou're still here even now.) The only\nthing I can think of is that\nthe whole summer term\nin its revision-filled glory\nhas turned my mind to\nmush and banished any\namount of creativity\nthat was doubtfully\nlurking in there in\nthe first place.\nScience, I think, is\none of the most difficult subjects to write about.\nYou only have to thumb through the\nDaily Mail - not quite sure why you\nwould - or The Sun - again, especially\nOn writing \u2018Science\u2019 - a half\narsed rant\nScience Editor\nwhen you have such a high quality paper\ndistributed around college for free every\nFriday - to see what a crap job they do of\nit and some of the rubbish that passes as\n\u2018science news\u2019 (though, strictly speak-ing, this column can\u2019t really pass\nfor either of those terms.)\nAs is well documented by\nseveral stand-up come-dians, the Mail would\nhave us all avoiding\nartificial light and\nwater for fear of developing cancer. (In-terestingly, they claim\ngardens, grapefruit, sex\nand electricity both cause\nand prevent cancer \u2013 talk\naboutadilemma.)Socheers\nfor anyone who wrote for the\nsection this year and sorry\nwe can't pay you.\nAlthough, saying this,\nKadhim just brought in\na copy of The Sun: \u2018As\nfollowers of Pascal have\nfound, everything in the\nuniverse has a non-zero\nprobability except for ab-surdities. And absurdity is\na phenomenon without a valid mathematical relation.\u2019\nEh?! THE SUN!?!?\nAll in all it\u2019s been\na good year for the\nscience section with articles on laser diet treatments and the use of horse\nplacenta fluid in injury\ntreatment featuring among\nthe covered topics. Of course we\ngot heavily involved with following the\nW\nelcome to the end\nof the academic\nyear, the end of an\narduous, tumultu-ous, rewarding and\nlife-defining year, something which\nyou'll always look back on with fond-ness. Or maybe not. In fact, probably\nnot. You may find that you're so worn\nout from exam season and all the associated shit that you built onto it that\nyou'll need 3 months to recover by doing absolutely nothing. Typical, just\ntypical.\nBack in my first issue in October I\ntold you not to become a typical Imperial student. I told you to not follow\nthe stereotype and actually go and do\nsomething different outside the realm\nof your immediate sphere, but here\nyou are, the typical exhausted end of\nyear student with nothing else going\non in your life. But who am I to look\ndown my nose at you? I'm just a lowly\nscience editor with no right to dictate\nterms, surely? Wrong. I know better,\nand I know how you should be living\nyour life. End of.\nAnyway, to other matters. We've\ntried to bring you quite a lot this year\nin our section. Some weeks, Brigette\nand I have neglected to offer you any\npearls of wisdom due to reasons such\nas \"work\", \"other commitments\" and\n\"being a second year physicist OMG\nIT'S SO HARD\", but most of the time\nwe have endeavoured to take time out\nof our lives to create something origi-nal, interesting, witty and sometimes\nopinionated. It is something that I\nhope you have enjoyed reading occa-sionally, because it's been a fantastic\nthing to be responsible for, mostly due\nto the creative and imaginative skills it\nhas forced me to harness as well as the\ninfluence and power at my disposal.\nOccasionally people (boring, pedantic,\nlosers-at-life I can only assume?) have\nwritten in complaining about certain\nthings that have been published, but\nmost feedback has been positive. It\u2019s\ntradition to end on a lighter note in\nthe final edition of the year, but we\u2019ve\nmaintained a degree of integrity and\nhonour the whole time and don\u2019t see it\nright to ruin our hard work with one\nslack issue. By way of a compromise,\none of the stories below is false, the\nother is true. Enjoy.\nBut to conclude, and let this be my\nparting shot, so what if I, myself may\ncome out with a terrible, career inhibiting degree in a couple of weeks\ntime? I\u2019ve tried damn hard, but just as\nimportantly I\u2019ve maintained a perspec-tive, and a view of what it\u2019s like to actually be a normal human being, unlike\nthe majority of the Imperial populace.\nEven if bad news does come my way, I\ncan freely say my whole time at Imperial hasn\u2019t been a waste, not at all.\nIt would, however, be a complete lie\nto say that this place is the dogs bol-locks. It\u2019s not. For the most part, Imperial attracts the wrong sort of people\n(dull, boring nobodies who have had\nit all on a plate), gives them the wrong\nthings to do, and makes it too easy for\npeople to come out the other side and\ngraduate as insular, nervous, quivering\nwrecks. I\u2019ll most definitely look back\nupon my time fondly (to a point), but\nreally? There\u2019s a whole world out there\nyou know, and maybe that\u2019s something\nyou should think about before you\ncome back next year.\nWot u lookin\u2019 at?\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\ncourt\ncase between Simon\nSingh and the Brit- ish\nChiropractic Association (boo-hiss) - that was at least four weeks of\nmaterial right there. We also highlighted the problem surrounding libel tourism and its effect on science writers\nbeing able to make public scientifically\ntrue, if reputation damaging, informa-tion. We had an entirely unexpected\nresponse to our call for writers for\nthe Green Week edition, with ten\narticles sent in over the space of\none week (trust me, that\u2019s lots!),\ncovered the second attempt\nto switch on the LHC and\nHubble\u2019s 20th birthday. So,\nbusy times!\nLike I said, I\u2019m fresh out\nof ideas and need a summer\nbreak to clear my head of\nmulch and cobwebs. But,\nhey, we filled the space\nonce more and there\u2019s\na science page for the\nfirst time in a couple\nof weeks!\nOh yeh, the random pictures? Not\njust essentials for any\nlairy summer weekender\n- they all give you cancer also. Don\u2019t\nsay you weren\u2019t warned - flip flops are\ntruly evil.\nOn Wednesday new plans to combat the increasing problem\nof global climate change got the go-ahead from the new\ncoalition government. The Nimbus 2000 project will see the\nconstruction of two large \u2018dehumidifying\u2019 machines set to be\nplaced above the English Channel and the Atlantic. The socalled \u2018Cloud-Creators\u2019 will extract excess water vapour from\nabove the sea surface, condense the water to liquid using\nelectricity generated by inbuilt solar panels and produce\nclouds. The Creators stretch 9km into the sky and will increase\nthe high-level cloud content of the atmosphere thus increasing\nthe planetary albedo and allowing for an increased reflection of incoming solar radiation.\nThe whole project will cost \u00a326million and take five years to construct. Early computer\nsimulationsshowthattheNimbus2000projectcouldcooltheUKbyover15degrees-conditions\nnot seen in this part of the globe since the last ice-age. Dr Rob Green, the brains behind the\nconcept, stated \u2018We hope this will revolutionise how we perceive and tackle climate change. I\nwant the UK to act as a small \u2018cool - box\u2019 which will gradually lower the temperature of the rest\nof the Earth over a longer period of time.\u2019\nThe idea has been met with much enthusiasm by the public. Stacey, 21, Luton commented \u2018It\u2019s\nreally good idea and we need to stop the sea levels rising because things are dying.\u2019 However, the\nNimbus 2000 has been a cause for concern for many animal rights activist groups who claim the\nmachines will disrupt the flight patterns of seagulls and may pose a danger to them should they\nfly into the machines. The first phase of the development is scheduled to begin later this year.\n\u2018Cloud-Creator\u2019 gets go-ahead\nThe Daily Mail has this week reported findings\nfrom its new research laboratories in Happy Valley\n- Goose Bay, that the humble black Labrador has\nproperties that make it an ideal candidate to\nbe the first official \u201cParkinson\u2019s disease cure\u201d.\nThey claim that the degenerative disorder can be\nreversed, and in 99.99% of cases cure the patient\ncompletely. How does it work? Well, evidence has\nyet to be released from the somewhat secretive\nand controversial institution, but it is thought\nthat the curative effect can be induced by simply\nstroking the animal whilst it sits next to the patient with a bone in mouth (assuming\none\u2019s hand can be kept still for long enough).\nThe skeptics are already out in force to condemn the findings. Distinguished\nrestaurateur Zheng Wong from the \u201cChinese Official Chowing-on-dogs Kollection\u201d\n(COCK) dismissed the findings as \u201cabsolute wubbish\u201d. He continued \u201cthese things,\nthey need to be eaten not worshipped. You saw what happened when the Hindu\u2019s\nstarted worshipping the cow, they stopped eating the besets meat of them all and their\nlives have been worse ever since!\u201d.\nDespite the fact that the evidence has yet to be released, Labrador lovers have\nembraced the findings, stating \u201cwe knew this all along, I mean, how can one breed\nof dog be so handsome, functional and loving without having at least one curative\nfunction\u201d. We\u2019ll let the jury decide.\nLabrador saves the day...again!\nBrigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins\n\n"

At the\nstart of the year we appointed a new\nOperations Manager and moved into\nnew offices on the second floor of the\nUnion building. Our amazing new spaces\nfor student activities were all open by\nChristmas, providing additional large\nrooms for students to shout and beat\neach other with sticks, among other club\nactivities.\nWe hate paperwork as much as you do,\nso we\u2019ve tried to reduce the barriers\nto running activities as part of Imperial\nCollege Union \u2013 we\u2019re great with clubs\nbut haven\u2019t always supported smaller\ngroups of students doing good work\nin the community. This is why we\nintroduced \u2018Projects\u2019, which are like\nclubs but intended for small, short-term\nstudent-run projects which benefit\nsociety, whether locally, nationally or\nglobally.\nThe paint was barely dry on Phase 2 of\nour refurbishment when Phase 3 kicked\noff, as we secured \u00a32.4m to replace our\ntired bars and nightclub. The feedback\nwe\u2019ve had about the project has come\nfrom a broad range of students, and\nwe\u2019ve listened to it all. It\u2019s very clear that\nwe won\u2019t be able to please everyone\nthough! I won\u2019t be around when it opens,\nbut next year\u2019s team will have an amazing\nnightclub and bar. For the first time in\nmany years students will have direct\ncontrol over events which are held in their\nnightclub, with student groups invited to\nsubmit formal proposals and the elected\nEnts Committee choosing which are\naccepted.\nAs part of our drive to spend more\nmoney on club activities and student\nrepresentation, we\u2019re developing our\nconferencing brand to make maximum\nUnion Review of theY\near\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nuse of the building when students aren\u2019t\nusing it. We\u2019ve had to take the difficult\ndecision to cut funding this year, but hope\nthe plans we\u2019ve put in place for the next\nfew years will allow that to be reversed\nin future. We can\u2019t expect funding from\ncentral government and the College\nto increase, so we have to exploit our\nbuilding and location to bring in external\nmoney, while ensuring that students can\nuse our facilities when they need them.\nAlthough lots of work has taken place\non commercial services and student\nactivities, we haven\u2019t neglected our core\nfunction: representation. This has always\nbeen a less visible part of our work, as\npeople only notice it when things are\ngoing wrong for them. For the first time\nwe provided training and a handbook\nfor student representatives and have\ndocumented the rep system and how it\nworks.\nAlthough we struggled at the start\nof the year, we\u2019ve devoted time to\npostgraduate representation, embarking\non a project to identify and communicate\nwith postgraduate representatives who\npreviously received little or no assistance\nfrom us (and many we didn\u2019t even know\nexisted!) It\u2019s only the start of bringing\npostgraduate representation to the same\nquality as our undergraduate system.\nIt\u2019s not been plain sailing all the way, and\nwe haven\u2019t achieved everything we set\nout to do, but it\u2019s certainly been exciting.\nThere\u2019s been laughter and tears along the\nway, but it\u2019s been worth it.

Of course my job would\nhave been much harder if it wasn\u2019t for\nthe regular quality contributions I was\nsent. I want to especially thank Jade\nHoffman, Stefan Zeeman and John\nPark for their brilliant reviews and I\napologise for any butchering I might\nhave done to them.\nWe are very fortunate to live in\nLondon but I am first to admit that\nI haven\u2019t taken full advantage of the\nwealth of cinema available to us. I can\nblame the inconveniences and stress\nof my busy Imperial timetable, but I\nknow that most of the time I am too\nlazy to trek all the way to the East End\nto watch an inconspicuous independent film limited in its release to one\ncinema. It\u2019s hypocritical of me to rant\nabout illegal movie downloads hurting\nthe film industry when I\u2019m content to\nlanguish on my bed and watch a piss\npoor quality version of Shrek 4 online.\nBut when I have been bothered to\nwatch something different, I have been\nthoroughly rewarded. The highlight of\nthe year for me was Love Exposure, a\nfour hour long Japanese Indie film that\nwas incredibly mental but insanely\ngood. The only cinema in the whole\ncountry screening it was the ICA (In-stitute of Contemporary Arts) and so I\nthought it was a too good a chance to\nmiss. There are plenty of big cinemas\nin London to watch mainstream releases and a wonderful array of smaller\n\u2018arthouse\u2019 and independent cinemas\nlike the BFI and Curzon theatres to\nwatch little known gems.\nCritics deplore at the lack of quality\nof films these days but we are in fact\nwitnessing a silent revolution in cinema that most people are unaware is\nhappening, and it all started with The\nBlair Witch Project. Traditionally, films\nare very expensive to make as cameras,\ntape and development are not cheap.\nHollywood films would look professional and glossy and independent\nfilms would instead look shabby.\nHowever, the advent of the digital\ncamera has allowed quality films to\nbe made on a low budget, The Blair\nWitch Project was originally shot for\nabout $25,000 but went on to make\n$248,639,099. Suddenly movie studios\nand investors were intrigued by the\npotential of low budget films. Over the\nlast decade, the quality and sophistication of digital technology has improved\nso much that now anyone with a few\nthousand pounds and some computer\nsoftware can compete for the Oscars.\nAs Hollywood pushes towards 3D to\nkeep punters returning to the cinemas,\nnovice directors are emerging to provide us will interesting films that push\nthe boundaries of style and taste. I believe the critics are wrong, if they look\npast commercial cinema then they\nwould see a huge ocean of creative talent that is getting larger everyday.\nThat is why we are so privileged to\nlive in London where all the blockbust-ers, homegrown \u2018indies\u2019 and World\nCinema are available to watch with a\nlittle bit of effort and an Oyster card.\nIt\u2019s a delight watching films and just as\nenjoyable reviewing them. If you have\nalways wanted to submit a film review\nbut haven\u2019t found time, don\u2019t hesitate\nto do so next year!\nFilm Editor\nIn a felix exclusive, we divulge all the information on the planned\nRoman Polanski directed musical biography about Josef Fritzl\nI\nn a recent interview, Roman Polanksi revealed his plans for his\nnew project. Due to the controversial topic of the film\u2019s subject,\nFritzl! has been shrouded in\nsecrecy but using all the journalistic\ntechniques at my disposal, I have managed to gather some interesting de-tails. If you haven\u2019t heard of Josef Fritzl\nthen you have probably been locked\nin a basement for the past twenty four\nyears.\nAs Polanski is twiddling his thumbs\nunder Swiss house arrest, it was too\ndifficult to contact him however, I\nhave received information from other\nundisclosed sources. The film is described as a sequel to The Sound of\nMusic with a working title of The Von\nTrapped Family. According to the\nfilm\u2019s producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, the\nplot will explore the Austrian tradition\nof teaching their children about sex by\nKevin Spacey Josef Fritzl\nkeeping them in the dark. \u201cWe will also\nhave plenty of explosions and an exciting finale where Fritzl transforms into\na twenty foot robot to avoid arrest.\u201d\nBruckheimer is reported as saying.\nMichael Bay was first choice to direct\nbut his schedule clashed with plans\nto make a documentary on the BP\noil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, where\ngovernment scientists race to prevent the oil slick from taking over the\nworld. Bay is described as being \u2018gutted\u2019 for missing the opportunity to\ndirect the Fritzl film. David Lynch\nwas approached as well to direct but\nhe was soon dropped for insisting\nthat Fritzl was replaced by possessed\nSiamese twins and the film to be set in\na \u2018Minoan parrallel universe\u2019 instead of\nAustria.\nBruckheimer is happy that Polanski\nhas enough experience with underage girls to handle the film\u2019s sensitive\ntopic. Dakota Fanning is speculated to\nhave been cast as the daughter Elizabeth Fritzl. After inquiring about the\nrisqu\u00e9 scenes involving her character,\nDakota stated that \u201cit can\u2019t be worse\nthan spending two months with Tom\nCruise on the set of War of the Worlds\u201d.\nThe only other role to have been\ncast so far is that of Josef Fritzl himself\nwho will be performed by the double\nAcademy Award winning actor Kevin\nSpacey. \u201cKevin jumped at the opportunity to play Fritzl\u201d, said a delighted\nPolanski, \u201che is perfect for the part,\nthere is no other actor who could fill\nthat man\u2019s shoes\u201d. Daniel Day Lewis\nwas another contender for the part but\nhis plan to do it \u2018method\u2019 and start his\nown family with his daughter in a dungeon proved unfavourable due to time\nconstraints.\nAndrew Lloyd Webber will write and\nscore the music and songs including\n\u2018There is no escaping while I am raping\nunder the floor!\u2019 Another song will describe a neighbours amazement at living next door to Fritzl\u2019s daughter. \u201cFor\nthe past twenty four years I\u2019ve been living next door to Alice. Alice, who the\nfuck is Alice?\u201d This film will not be released in the foreseeable future.\nThe set is projected to be cheap\nThe most highly anticipated films at the Edinburgh International Film Festival\nThe Illusionist Jackboots on Whitehall Superhero Me\nGet Low\nThe Illusionist is the talk of the\ntown in Edinburgh at the moment.\nIt is a melancholic adaptation of a\nJaques Tati story brought to life by\nthe brilliant animation of Sylvain\nChomet (The Belleville Rendevous)\nIn this highly explosive alternative\nhistory, the Nazi\u2019s have invaded\nBritain and it\u2019s up to the Scots\nto form a resistance and rescue\nWinston Churchill. It looks\nfantastically barmy with Ewan\nMcGregor donating his voice to\na cast of ridiculous\nlooking puppets.\nRobert Duvall stars as a mean\nhermit who decides to throw a\nfuneral party for himself whilst\nhe\u2019s still alive.

Hangman (himself)\nFELIX Editors Encourage Newcomers!\nEd Knock, Awesome Film Editor\n\u2018Watching a film is like gazing through a window into your own soul\u2019\n\u201c Hey I\u2019m Ed Knock the Awesome Film Editor. I\nactually put the \u2018Awesome\u2019 in there myself, but\nI\u2019ve always been known for my outlandish ways\nand I think it makes me look edgy.\nI\u2019m not really known for who I am, but for\nwhat I do - and that\u2019s write!!!!!!!! You probably\nread my film reviews and think, \u2018I\u2019ll never be able\nto write like this\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019s so incredibly insightful;\nI would never have made that connection between The Nutty Professor 2 and the ChadianLibyan conflict,\u2019 but you can because I believe in\nyou. You see I don\u2019t just write, I believe!\nI\u2019ve taken my fans on an emotional journey\nof self-discovery, whilst instilling my boundless\nknowledge of film.

Hold thy tongue, for I,\nGilead Amit, would converse with some jibber-ing flailing retard before practising the noble art\nof discourse with thou!\nHarrumph! The sheer notion of literary neophytes uniting with Felix veterans such as my-self, Gilead Amit, piques and repulses me to the\nbrink of a volatile fireworks performance, hosted by my own gizzard, gullet and mouth!\nOh and on another note, just because you\ncan\u2019t find a real fucking root for negative one,\ndoesn\u2019t mean I, Gilead Fucking Amit, can\u2019t; And\nno I\u2019m not going to have a fucking coffee with\nyou weird thirteen-year old girls and Fuck you\nEmmanuel College, seriously, FUCK YOU!!!!!!!\nDan Wan, Proper Editor\n\u201c It\u2019s been a pleasure to work with me and I\u2019m\nconfident that I\u2019m passing the torch on to a\nguy that will most likely drop it or blow it out\u201d\n\u201c\u04cd\u02bf\u08c5\u04c7\u03ad\u0449\u04c1\u03f7\u202b\u05fb\u202c\u0d26\u073e\u202b\u0684\u202c\u1072\u0aef\n\u031f\u0ef3\u00e9\u0be0\u202b\u0775\u202c\u02bf\u09bb\u0aca\u058c\u03da\u03ad\u0449\u0ab6\u065c\n\u0293\u00e7\u0aa8\u0563\u0505\u0409\u03da\u02d9\u0b65\u13c3\u0f03\u0c47\u09a3\u00e9\u113a\n\u02aa\u02fe\u0a85\u1063\u04c9\u16ba\u0bd5\u03ad\u0449\u1072\u0aef\u031f\u0ef3\u09fe\u120f\n\u0429\u0455\u0333\u1246\u12f1\u00e9\u04cd\u0743\u0431\u10df\u04cd\u202b\u0684\u202c\u0507\u0950\u1070\n\u116d\u139d\u0b55\u012c\nWhich roughly translates to English as,\n\u201cI hope dat Hang-a-man does not resorta to\npreurile jokes abouta my Chinese Heritage or\nusesay Jackie Chan as my photo because it\u2019s da\nonry Chinese persons dat he know. \u201c\nH\nit and Miss; My mantra,\nmy motto, my excuse for\ntactless jokes. The great\nthing about writing behind a veil of anonymity is that I receive direct uncensored\nfeedback about my articles. If there\u2019s\none thing I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s that I simply\ncannot please everyone. One person\u2019s\ncup of tea is another person\u2019s cup of\ncoffee - and they hate coffee. Probably\none of those take-away coffees with the\ntiny drinking holes in the lid. You can\u2019t\nsip, you can\u2019t tentatively test the temperature with your tongue, you have\nno choice but to just go for it - AAAH\nJESUS F***ING MOTHERF***ING\nJESUS F***************C******** MY\nTONGUE! WHO DETHIGNED\nTHETHE LIDTHS? - one of those\ncoffees.\nI guess I could always use the\nMarmite analogy, but after Jade Goody\ndescribed herself as Marmite, soiling\nthe brand and my favourite toast top-ping, I decided I could never use the\nword again. Fucking bitch\nAnyway, seeing as it\u2019s the final issue,\nI thought I would do the good egotistical thing of interviewing myself. It\u2019s\nprobably because I find myself more\ninteresting than any of you.\nHangman: Hi hangman.\nHangman: You don\u2019t have to say hi,\nthat\u2019s just stupid. I thought we agreed\nyou wouldn\u2019t do this. You\u2019re embarrassing me\nHangman: Do you enjoy writing\nhangman?\nHangman: No. It\u2019s about as enjoyable\nas walking, and I don\u2019t have the use of\nmy legs. Well I have the use of my legs,\nbut pretending that I don\u2019t gets me a free\nseat on the bus and the high-ground over\nthose fucking lazy pensioners who can\u2019t\nstand up. They shouldn\u2019t be getting on a\nbus if they can\u2019t stand up.\nHangman: Could anyone write\nhangman?\nHangman: Anyone with hands and a\nbasic grasp of the Engloosh language.\nActually just anyone with hands. You\nknow what, you could probably just\nbash your head on the keyboard.\nHangman: Do you think anyone is\nreading this interview?\nHangman: No. I\u2019m already bored of\nwriting it.\nHangman: Which was your favourite\narticle you wrote this year?\nHangman: The Hitler interview because only I found it funny. I wrote it in\nthe style of a Celebrity interview from\na magazine.\nIt was meant to be picking on celeb-rities, but people just saw the name\nHitler and went, \u2018Ooooooh, jews, holo-caust, that\u2019s not cool etc\u2019. I should point\nout that his album, Wrong Turnz went\nplatinum in America last month and\nhe\u2019s currently working on a song with\nLady Gaga called \u2018 Rumourz hurt\u2019.\nHangman: Do you admire any of\nyour fellow felix editors?\nHangman: I don\u2019t so much admire, but\nfear Gilead Amit. When he looks at you\nin the eye, your brain feels like it\u2019s melting from inferiority. When trying to engage in an intellectual discussion with\nhim, I might as well just stick my tongue\nout, drool and flap my arms about.\nHangman: And the others?\nHangman: All just trying to be Gilead.\nHangman: How do you go about\nwriting an article?\nHangman: I try to write dark highbrow satire and then realise that I\ncan\u2019t. I look at the blank canvas on the\ncomputer screen and think, \u2018this has so\nmuch potential\u2019, then ruin it. Imagine\nfirst seeing your unborn child on an\nultra-sound screen and imagining all\nthe great things he\u2019s going achieve in\nlife, then the doctor comes in and tells\nyou it\u2019s a girl.\nHangman: How many complaints\nhave you had?\nHangman: To my disappointment, only\nthree. One about the Beginner\u2019s guide\nto the working class, one about the cartoon of Jesus on a Cross, and my reference to the Cumbria shootings in Twatter. No fatwas yet.\nHangman: Do you think you crossed\nany lines?\nHangman: Osama crossed some lines,\nbut then he\u2019s the founding leader of AlQaeda so what do people expect? I\u2019m\nmorally devoid, so I don\u2019t believe in\nlines.\nHangman: Do you worry about offending people?\nHangman: I don\u2019t set out to offend people unless they\u2019ve annoyed me. I try not\nto be crude and tasteless unless I feel\nit\u2019s a necessity. While I try to remain\nfacetious, it sometimes just appears\nflippant. I have to sit down and think,\nhow can I make people laugh? It\u2019s not\nlike writing a review of a film or a play,\nmy one job is to make people laugh\nand it\u2019s a lot harder than people give it\ncredit for. A funny image or conversation sometimes just can\u2019t be translated\nto paper. If I worried about offending\npeople, I wouldn\u2019t get anything writ-ten. I stay away from Jew jokes though\nbecause I\u2019m scared of Gilead....he\u2019s Jewish.....or Palistinian.....one of them\nHangman: Will you be continuing\nhangman next year?\nHangman: Sadly not because I\u2019m not\ngoing to be here. I may be able to continue Twatter by email, which is the\nonly thing people read anyway. I guess\nthis is my tearful goodbye....I\u2019m meant\nto say something like I\u2019ll miss everyone\nand that it\u2019s been a pleasure.....I won\u2019t\nand it hasn\u2019t.\nKadhim Shubber, the next Editor\n\u201cWhen people look at me they see a tall gangly\nIraqi in slim fit trousers and a bow-tie, but I\u2019m\nactually a - Oh no, that\u2019s fine\u201d\n\u201cFelix next year will be a fun and welcoming en-vironment. I work on a strict, but fun deadline\npolicy and need all articles into the office by\nMonday 4.00 AM. If you miss this deadline then\nI won\u2019t be angry, I\u2019ll just be slightly annoyed, but\nin a fun sort of way.I\u2019ll be using the Guardianapproved Smiley Face Chart\u2122 and will award\na smiley face for every article handed in by the\ndeadline. Ten smiley faces and you win the coveted Guardian-approved Kit Kat Chunky. Spelling/grammatical errors, lack of enthusiasm, loss\nof name badges, use of the name \u2018Voldemort\u2019, fat\nthighs, or derogatory comments about the Smiley Face Chart\u2122 will earn you a sad face. Three\nsad faces and you\u2019re out, but in a fun way :).\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nBack in 1927, Andr\u00e9 Gide, a French\nauthor, heard about opium-smoking,\ncocaine-addicted school kids. One was\ncaught injecting in his finals. When\ncornered, he blamed his teacher: \u201cDo\nyou think anyone could endure the\ndullness of his teaching without shooting up?\u201d Contrary to contemporary\ntabloid warnings about the ever-spiral-ing degeneracy of today\u2019s youth, drug\nconsumption has long been a rite of\npassage across the world for a minority of young people trying to cope with\nthe emotional and physical stresses of\ngrowing up, meanwhile defying authority and causing mischief.\nIn Britain, narcotic prohibition came\ninto force through the 1920 Dangerous Drugs Act, which passed following debate between six MPs. The only\ndissenter was a Scottish doctor, Walter\nEliot, who warned against the moral\nabsolutism those \u201cbarbarians of the\nWest\u201d \u2013 American prohibitionists \u2013\nwho had pressured other countries\ninto following their lead. From these\nfoundations emerged the Prohibitionist consensus that grew to become the\n\u201cWar on Drugs\u201d, a war that governments are losing miserably, defeated by\na motley collection of ruthless organized criminals, baffled potheads, hopeless addicts, profit-hungry dealers and\nordinary consumers.\nIn 1927, Edmund Wilson wrote that\n\u201cpeople going on sprees, toots, jags,\nbrannigans or benders\u201d were rare because \u201cfierce protracted drinking has\nnow become a universal feature of social life.\u201d He was speaking at the height\nof the Prohibition, the law that turned\nAmericans into a nation of law-break-ers and created a new breed of organized criminal.\nContemporary parallels are plain to\nsee. Conservative and Labour politicians desperately clamber over one another to prove their moral absolutism:\nsternly condemning drug-users, playing to tabloid hysteria over mephe-drone abuse, and competing to condemn and denigrate Professor Nutt,\nthe sacked expert who mistakenly pronounced his own opinion.\nFor decades, the question of decriminalizing drugs has largely been outside\nthe parameters of accepted debate.\nThe dominant discourse on illegal\ndrugs portrays them as the greatest social evil, looming over the minds, bodies and souls of the nation\u2019s children.\nThere is a stigma attached to arguing\nagainst prohibition, one that makes\nme seriously reluctant to put my name\non this article for fear of future repercussions concerning my professional\nadvancement.\nStepping out of line from the prohibitionist consensus leads to attack by\npopulist demagogues on all sides, as\nwas seen in the criticism of Professor\nNutt, unsurprisingly nicknamed the\n\u201cNutty Professor\u201d (despite being an\ninternationally recognised expert in\nneuropsychopharmocology).\nVoicing opposition to prohibition\nhas long been one of the popular media\u2019s enemies. Criticism of prohibition\nis muted, relegated to opinion col-umns. This is driven by two factors:\nfirstly the issue\u2019s political unpopularity with the voting population (i.e.\nmiddle-aged parents and the elderly),\nand secondly, because critical debate\nof complex policy issues doesn\u2019t sell\npapers. Headlines like \u201cCocaine Kate:\nSupermodel Kate Moss snorts line after line\u201d do.\nThis has been a significant and neglected cause of youthful alienation\nfrom conventional politics ever since\nthe end of 1960s, when the over-op-timistic counter-cultural wave broke\nagainst the rocks of the conservative\nbacklash.\nFollowing the United States making\nLSD illegal in 1968, youthful preference steadily shifted towards more\ndamaging drugs: to cocaine and heroin\nfrom the 1970s, MDMA/Ecstasy from\nthe late 1980s, crack and crystal meth\nfrom the 1990s, and now ketamine\nand mephedrone at the end of the\nnoughties.\nTelling the curious, the rebellious,\nand the vulnerable that chasing any\nkind of unsanctioned high is wrong,\ndisgusting and evil has had limited ef-fect. Disingenuously telling schoolchildren that smoking cannabis will result\nin their becoming a schizophrenic,\ncrack-addled prostitute will clearly alienate them from established power\nstructures (particularly the police)\nwhen they discover this is not true.\nIllegal drug users frequently construct a self-image as individualist rebels against conventional society and\nthe established political order. This\ngoes for both addicts and occasional\nabusers. For addicts, it is more attractive to see oneself as a romantic outsider free from conventional morality\nrather than a hopeless wretch, driven\nto desperation by sickness. Changing\nattitudes to addiction, recognising it\nas an illness deserving pity rather than\nanimosity is one step towards tackling\nit.\nMeanwhile, occasional drug-fuelled\nhedonism has become an entrenched\npart of clubbing culture. Cocaine consumption in Britain is the highest in\nEurope. According to UN statistics,\n5% of the world\u2019s population take illegal drugs. Another UN estimate\nguesses the trade is worth $320 billion\nper year. This giant sum goes straight\nto the pockets of organized criminals,\nspilling gallon after gallon of blood in\nthe Third World \u2013 as can be seen in\nMexico at the moment.\nProhibition, as in the time of the\nprohibition of alcohol in the US in the\n1920s, essentially removes the role of\nstate in regulating trade rules and enforcing contracts. As a businessman, if\nyour product of, say, gold are stolen by\na competitor, you can go to the police\nto get them back and put your competitor out of business. The security\nservices possess the monopoly on vio-lence. If, however, your product of illegal liquor or cocaine is stolen by your\nrival, unable to go to the police, you\nmust arm yourself and seek vengeance.\nThe police lose their monopoly on vio-lence, and become an unwelcome and\nineffectual referee in the competition\nfor profit.\nThis simple explanation accounts for\nthe violence of organized criminality,\nfrom warring Colombian cartels to feral youths in street gangs. In modern\nconsumerist society, where wealth is\nportrayed as the precursor to happi-ness, the ambitious few without the\nconnections or education to achieve\nthis legally will inevitably resort to\nachieving it illegally. Producing, transporting and pushing illegal drugs is the\nmost profitable way to do this.\nEffective repression of drug markets\nat best forces a change in consumption trends and the relocation of pro-duction. For example, cannabis production has shifted from the Middle\nEast, Latin America and South Asia\nto secret factories and farms in the\ndeveloped world, often manned by illegal workers. Opium production has\nmoved from Thailand and Turkey to\nBurma and Afghanistan.\nRemoving traditional supply routes\nfrom Colombia to the US led to their\nrelocation to Mexico, which is now\nfighting a bloody war with powerful,\nruthless and heavily-armed criminal networks. Prohibition has been\nthe spring of rivers of blood in Latin\nAmerica. Blood feuds, corrupted regimes and criminal empires have be-gun, fattened and imploded, fuelled by\nthe giant profit margins that prohibition stimulates by the high price of and\ndemand for illegal drugs.\nThere is little evidence that more\nrepressive policy reduces drug abuse.\nRepressive Sweden and more liberal\nNorway have precisely the same addiction rates. UK cannabis consumption\nactually decreased during the time it\nwas a Class C. Unless we create a totalitarian system of informant networks,\narbitrary repressive punishments and\nabsolute control over borders, drug\nabuse will simply not go away. Removing prohibition is the least bad option.\nThere are some glimmers of hope,\nemerging from the century-old fog\nof hysteria. Various influential cultural and political outlets in the media\nare putting the case against prohibi-tion. The television series the Wire,\nNarcotics and prohibition in UK today\nDominc MacIver\nDominc MacIver\n\u201c... prohibition, the\nlaw that turned\nAmericans into\na nation of lawbreakers\u201d\n\u201cMeanwhile,\noccasional drug-fuelled hedonism\nhas become part of\nclubbing culture\u201d\namongst the finest western cultural\noutputs of the noughties, argued passionately against the continuing fallacy\nof prohibition. The Economist, a bastion of the British Establishment, has\nlong done the same. Stories abound\nof British policemen, having caught\npotheads in the act, helping them play\nthe system out of sympathy. The US\nis very quietly opening the door on a\nstate-by-state basis for decriminalized\nmarijuana through a messy, state-by-state system of medical prescriptions.\nThe contours of a new policy would\nhave to be gradual and cautious. Returning cannabis to Class C would be\nthe first step, with an exemption for\nthe strongest strains. Reducing penalties for possession, and, later, supply,\nwould be the next. Any money saved\nfrom law enforcement should be reinvested into drug education and re-search, and public health programmes\nto cut addiction, particularly in prisons\nand deprived areas. Fully decriminalizing soft drugs, providing honest information about them and pricing them\naccordingly through taxation would\nboth offer government a (much need-ed) new stream of revenue and greatly\nreduce the role of gangsterism in the\ntrade. This alone would be a good start.\nToday\u2019s generation \u2013 apathetic, in-debted, demoralized and broke \u2013 have\nbeen largely turned off conventional\npolitics. Prohibition is not all to blame.\nWe have been left with an ugly, ugly\nworld full of debt and pointless war by\nour elders. Governments don\u2019t change\nuntil their population compels them\nto. Let us hope the coalition government charts a separate course to its\nforebears. I am not optimistic. I just\npray our generation doesn\u2019t descend\nfurther into apathy and hedonism,\ninstead of working to change a faulty\nsystem.\n\u201cStories abound of\nBritish policemen,\nhaving caught\npotheads in the act,\nhelping them play\nthe system out of\nsympathy\u201d\nDrugs guns and money are all very profitable. Some argue for their decriminalisation to cut crime and raise revenues.\n\n"

    "content": "34 felix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSPORT\nPonies, sticks, sunshine and silverware\nWith exams hitting our polo teams\nhard this summer it was a somewhat\ndiminished crowd that arrived at Offchurch Bury Polo Club for the Akuma\nUniversities Polo Nationals. With most\nof our Novices stuck with their revision for the weekend we were pinning\nall our hopes for a strong result on this\nyear\u2019s batch of new players in the Beginner Section.\nOn the first day of the tournament\nwe emerged from our tents with varying levels of fatigue; not all due to\ndrinking. But with plenty of time to\nwake up and get ready before matches\nstarted we even had time for a quick\nshopping trip and a little cricket before\nwe had to deal with the now traditional\nstress of ponies arriving late, getting\nlost or breaking down on the journey.\nFortunately myself and Jon Matthews had no matches on Friday so\ncould sort things out as much as possible before our Beginners 2nd team had\ntheir first match late in the afternoon.\nWith Flora stuck in the exam hall one\nof our first team members had to sub\nin, but Muhammad really helped Mikaela and Giuseppe out in their first\never competitive chukka [match].\nThe team played really well.\nGiuseppe in particular showed just\nhow much you can pick up your game\nwhen the pressure is on and really got\ninto hassling the opposition for the\nball; hooking their swings and riding\nthem off to spoil their attacking plays.\nThe net result, a win for the B2s and\na great start to our nationals, and with\nthe arrival of our few stragglers that\nevening we were all in high spirits for\nthe start of play on Saturday where\neveryone would be playing two matches on our busiest day.\nSaturday started somewhat earlier\nand all at the same time. Jon and I,\nplaying in the combined [mixed] division revisited an old grudge match,\nplaying on opposing teams. In one of\nthe fastest and most fun matches I\u2019ve\never played I finally managed to get a\nlittle revenge and turn the tables on\nJon after he won at the winter nation-als. Unfortunately my elation was short\nlived as we were both sorely trounced\nby the other team in our group, some\nsmall recompense being gained by the\nfact that they went on to win in the\nfinal.\nThe Beginners too didn\u2019t get the\nstart they wanted for the day. Having\nto play at the same time as us on the\nopposite pitch meant a lot of stress as\nfive people tried to mount their ponies\nat the same time. The addition of Flora\nto the team meant a very different feel\nand shape to the team and perhaps the\nteam needed a little more time to settle into that new shape as they were\nunable to play quite at their best and\ncouldn\u2019t match that 1st round victory\nin the 2nd round.\nAfter a short gap our 1st team\nmounted up for their first match in\nthe Beginner 1 division. We had high\nhopes this year since we knew Muhammad and Thijs have a big hit on\nthem that was unlikely to be matched\nby other teams in their division and\nCharles was there to add some extra\nconsistency and security in position\nnumber 2, but I think it\u2019s fair to say\nthat they themselves piled the heaviest\nof expectations on, eager to show how\ngood they really are at the end of only\none year of training.\nPerhaps it was this that showed in\ntheir play, all seeming a little tense in\ntheir first match. Their opponents\nmanaged to gain a couple of good\nbreaks and everything seemed quite\neven for a time. Those big swings\nthough and the confidence to really attack the ball eventually proved telling\nthough and the Beginners were able as\nthe match progressed to assert their\ndominance despite a few little slips and\nmisses.\nThey came away with a great result\nto build on as the initial tension started to release and they went forward\nto their second match knowing that\nif they played to their full ability then\nthey were in a very strong position.\nTheir next couple of matches though\nwere to be against two of the tournament favourites, particularly Warwick\nwho have the advantage of being on\nhome ground and are often able to\ntrain several times in a week. And, in\ncontrast, due to the weather leading up\nto the nationals the teams were only\nable to get out to play on the fields\nonce or twice and so were at a real\ndisadvantage in terms of experience\nof the larger, faster, summer version of\nthe game.\nThe Warwick match seemed to follow a similar pattern to the first and\nwe were all a little surprised at how\neasily our B1s were able to stamp their\nmark on the match against a team we\nall expected to be challenging them\nhard. Again it didn\u2019t all go Imperial\u2019s\nway and a few little fouls crept in again\nand allowed Warwick to get a slight\nfoothold in the game, but for the second time the big swings and pace of\nour Beginners proved too much to\ndefend against and once their forward\nmomentum got going it proved impossible for Warwick to stop.\nThe B2s were also up to face a Warwick team in their final chukkas. A 2\nchukka match across Saturday and\nSunday. We were really impressed with\nthe way the team were playing togeth-er, all of them playing some of the best\npolo we\u2019ve seen from them.\nGiuseppe showed that his increase in\nconfidence in the first chukka was not\na one off. Flora, generally one of our\nquietest players, seemed to pop up in\nsupport of the other two at every play.\nAnd Mikaela, who has picked up the\ngame only since finishing competing\nin BUCS for our riding team, showed\nhow consistent and reliable she\u2019s become as a player in so little time.\nUnfortunately, despite stepping up\ntheir game significantly the team were\nonly able to manage to hold Warwick\nAlex Savell Polo\nto a narrow victory, keeping them in\ntouch with their opponents and in\nwith a shot in the second half on Sunday morning.\nIt was the B1s that drew the really\nshort straw though, their Third match\nslipped off the end of Saturday\u2019s proceedings and was rescheduled for\nSunday morning at ten to ten meaning\nthey were the ones unable to really enjoy the players party on Saturday night.\nA marquee, a DJ, a bar and a couple\nof hundred polo players makes for an\ninteresting evening and there were\nmore than a few embarrassed faces\nthe following morning and a few angry\nglares at those teams choosing to drive\naround a field full of sleeping students\nat 4 am, blaring out music and waking\nhalf the field up.\nSo it was slightly bleary eyed that the\nB1s made their way to the ponies on\nSunday morning. But that didn\u2019t seem\nto bother them too much once they\ntook to the pitch. This match seemed\nto have less periods of flowing play\nthan the others, a few fouls on each\nside kept the play to shorter bursts and\ninconsistent spot hits from both teams\ncould have cost either side a goal if the\nother could capitalise.\nIt was us that managed to though\nand a couple of great spot hits from\nMuhammad led to some great chanc-es. One in particular pushed just wide\nas Thijs headed to goal at pace in particular led to a missed hit out from the\nopposition and was probably the pivotal point in the match. Leaving the B2s\nto face Newcastle in the final.\nBoth my chukkas followed directly\nafter Jon\u2019s in our playoffs in the com-bined. All of these were hard fought\nand had some great moments, but\nwhere Jon\u2019s team managed to beat his\nopponents in the first chukka and hold\nthem to a stalemate in the second the\nresults for me were reversed, going\ndown 2-0 in the first and unable to\nbreak a stalemate in the second leaving Jon and I 5th and 4th respectively\nin our division.\nThe B2s also had a mountain to\nclimb in their second chukka, needing\nto put 2 past Warwick to get a victory.\nUnfortunately, it was not to be and despite Giuseppe\u2019s growing confidence\nlittle things meant they never quite\ngot the break they needed to get a goal\nyet they also managed a very respectable 0-0 draw in their final chukka, just\nloosing on aggregate.\nSo we all waited with anticipation for\nthe Beginner 1s, crossing our fingers\nand wondering whether they could actually bring home the trophy. Right at\nthe end of the day they took to the field\nfor the final time against the blue shirts\nof Newcastle. I know my heart was in\nmy mouth as the first play of the match\ngot underway and Newcastle quickly\nmanaged to counter a first break by\nour beginners, perhaps the first team\nto really be able to keep up with our\nB1s and mount some kind of defence\nagainst them.\nTrue to form though, the B1s\nstepped up their play. Suddenly they\nweren\u2019t able to go it alone and unchallenged but they were there in support\nof one another and quickly a couple of\nmassive goals from 40 or 50 yards were\nscored and Newcastle finally collapsed\nand conceded two more making us\nthe champions with a convincing 4-0\nvictory.\nA happy bunch of polo players with their trophies - but what did the horses get?\nICU Riding and Polo put on a very impressive performance in the summer nationals with trophies aplenty\nA specimen of horse, in no doubt highly sought after by Furse\n\n"

For\nevery story of drugs,\ncrime and general badness, there are\nat least two along the lines of, \u201cLargest\nBanana Museum Saved,\u201d or \u201cMan Has\nSex With Bicycle.\u201d The ratio is a keen\nreflection on our society. The negative articles are news because they are\nexceptional and the odd articles are\nnews because they are indicative of the\nworld we live in. It reaffirms a long-held belief of mine: that deep down,\npeople are stupid but good.\nThe universe is massive, not that\nyou needed me to tell you that. Millions of galaxies, billions of stars, and\nit\u2019s mostly empty. Whoever packed\nthe shopping bags after the Big Bang\nclearly overcharged us. But this is more\nthan just a violation of our consumer\nrights. For the most part, the universe\nis cold, desolate and empty. For all intents and purposes, we are alone. Not\nthat anyone would notice. Like I said,\nthe universe is massive \u2013 and we are\ntiny. I remember looking down from\nthe Queen\u2019s Tower once and remarking how small everyone looked from\nmy vantage point, like ants even. Compared to the universe, collectively we\nare smaller than the grains of dust in\nthe shadow of an ant. An anorexic ant.\nIn a corset. We\u2019re not even dust \u2013 we\u2019re\ndust\u2019s dandruff!\nDon\u2019t worry if this is starting to get\nyou down because I\u2019ve got something\nthat\u2019ll cheer you right up. Death. It can\ntake the form of an apocalyptic asteroid or a splodge of fat bedding down\nin the wrong coronary artery; it can\ncome after the longest of longevities\nor seconds after conception. Needless\nto say, when it does come, it is uninvited and does not care a jot for what\nit interrupts. In that sense, it has much\nin common with taxes, that other universal constant. Death is a lot like jury\nduty; it\u2019s unpleasant, it messes up our\ndiary for the foreseeable future and\nit\u2019s something everyone has to put up\nwith.\nSo where does that leave us? We\nhave (in the absence of rampaging tax-is, leopards and spontaneous human\ncombustion) eighty years or so on an\ninsignificant planet in one of the dimmer corners of an uncaring universe\nbefore the lights snuff out, the curtain\nfalls and we\u2019re done for good.\nNow, the rational reactions to this\nreality would be sadness or anger. The\nonly reason anyone would rise out of\ntheir Poesian pit of despair would be\nto impotently punch a wall for a few\nhours. But I look around and while,\nyes, there is plenty of anger in the\nworld and more than enough sadness,\nthese aren\u2019t all there is! In spite, or often because, of our own mortality, we\nhave built up the most complex designs of architecture, the most soulful\nworks of art, the most exquisitely precise theories of science and logic. None\nof it will last \u2013 it all carries the same\nexpiration date as we do \u2013 but we do\nit anyway! Yes, we have our fill of pain,\nangst and anger but we match it measure for measure with joy, awe and won-der. And when we do see fit to see red,\nto rage, rage against the dying of the\nlight, we make sure to do with a stiffly\nworded letter to whom it may concern.\nIn a distinctly irate font.\nAnd what of when the galleries and\nmuseums close, when the libraries and\ncinemas shut their doors, when Facebook crashes and the servers go down?\nWhen we are cut off from our friends,\nour society, our culture and there is\nonly the vast, uncaring emptiness of\nthe universe to gaze up at and com-prehend. Are we overcome then? Yes,\nof course we are! But by grief, no! We\nsee the myriad fires in the firmament,\nthe shooting stars, the planets, bright\nand wandering \u2013 and, if we\u2019re lucky,\nperhaps a supernova. We see all this\nand are struck dumb. If we have the wit\nto summon words to the occasion, the\nmost eloquent of us may just be able to\nmuster, \u201cWow!\u201d\nTo some, we\u2019re just a guttering match\nbut I think we burn brighter than a supernova with petrol thrown on it. So\nthe universe may be cold and empty \u2013\nbut it\u2019s pretty \u2013 and death may be ubiquitous and rude \u2013 but life is great while\nit lasts! We are fleeting and inconse-quential. But we are also ridiculously\nsilly and reassuringly good.\nNo. Hang on, that\u2019s not right. Scratch\nthat. We\u2019re bloody amazing!\n\u201cWe are\nfleeting and\ninconsequential but\nalso ridiculously\nsilly and\nreassuringly good\u201d\nRhys Davies will make you happy, ready?\nAngry Geek is finally getting some counselling\nF\nather died today. Or maybe\nyesterday, I don\u2019t know. Oh\nwait, no, I do know because\nit\u2019s a hugely important point\nof detail. It was last June.\nMuch as I appreciate the importance of\nFrench people doing sod all throughout their lives and then writing a book\nthat sums up how they felt, I\u2019ve got to\nsay that while there are some things I\nforget - GCSE Biology, what nuts my\nbrother is allergic to, that sort of thing\n- there are other things that I put a bit\nof effort into remembering. My father\ndied on June 29th last year. It was fucking awful, and Albert Camus can go to\nhell.\nWhile I was quite open about the\npassing of my grandfather a couple\nof years back, I didn\u2019t mention my father\u2019s long-term illness and eventual\ndeath. Why? I\u2019ll be honest, it didn\u2019t\nstrike me as gold-plated comedy ma-terial. But more than that; while my\ngrandfather\u2019s death was swift and relatively uneventful, my father\u2019s death\nwas prolonged, unenjoyable, and not\nreally for public consumption. Yet here\nwe are.\nSo, I\u2019ve started counselling. I realise\nit might come as a surprise to many of\nyou to discover that behind this facade\nof ranting, hatred and insecurity there\u2019s\nactually a good deal of repressed rant-ing, hatred and insecurity vying to get\nout. Like all truly self-destructive mo-rons, I decided that the best approach\nto take to the whole affair of death\nwould be the classic \u201cProblem? What\nproblem? You\u2019re the one with prob-lems, buddy. Problems with your face,\nthat is. Now how about that Israel-Palestine situation?\u201d stance. It\u2019s a stance\nwhose track record looks something\nlike British tennis players - alright up to\na point, but likely to collapse violently\nwhenever anyone actually needs to rely\non it. The violent collapse occurred a\nfew months ago, and I promptly found\nmyself sitting in the student counselling service wondering why they didn\u2019t\nhave one of those lying-down-couch\nthings.\nCounselling is sensationally strange.\nIt\u2019s like your own personal episode of\nTrisha, where you are simultaneously\nthe audience, participant, interviewer\nand the \u2018He\u2019s here in the studio!\u2019 cock\nthat jumps out halfway through as a\nsurprise guest. The counsellor acts\nlike a cameraman, shifting focus between these otherwise idiotic parts of\nyour personality in order to try and\nprovide some kind of link between\nthem all.\nBefore going to counselling, my impression of the experience - and by\nimpression I mean wild guesses based\non years of cynicism and episodes of\nThe Simpsons - was that it involved a\nlot of chin stroking, and then several\nrepeated stabs in the dark until one of\nthose stabs hit a particular region on a\nflowchart or Venn diagram which categorised me into some variety of loon.\nOn reflection, this was somewhat\nunfair.\nMuch to the chagrin of my counsel-lor, at least at first, I spent a lot of time\ntrying to work out how the process\nworks. My conclusions - uh, dunno?\nIt\u2019s nuanced. It\u2019s the exact opposite of\nwhat I spend most of my day doing -looking at a problem, planning a solu-tion, and ploughing that bastard until\nit\u2019s solved. Instead, we sit and stare\nand wonder. Sometimes we do the clich\u00e9d thing and talk about childhoods.\nSometimes we talk about mistakes I\nthink I made. And sometimes we talk\nabout vitamin supplements.\nThe whole process of dealing with\nthis depression has been very much\nlike the cancer that caused the problem\nin the first place; I don\u2019t talk to other\npeople about it, there\u2019s no known cure\nand it doesn\u2019t make for very entertaining comment pieces. And I\u2019m still unsure of what the role of counselling is\nin that. But one thing that I am now\nsure about is that student welfare is A\nGood Thing. And that my Simpsonsfuelled preconceptions of the process\nare extremely unhelpful.\nIt\u2019s Fathers\u2019 Day this weekend, which\nwill be exactly the shitter you might\nexpect it to be. I will spend it playing\nDoom 2, eating Wotsits and doing\nother things that remind me of the old\nman. If you\u2019re also spending this weekend reflecting on exam performance\nor how much you pushed yourself this\nyear, my advice would be this - don\u2019t.\nHave a great summer. I\u2019ll be back, miserable as ever, in the Autumn.\n\u201cCounselling is\nsensationally\nstrange. It\u2019s like\nyour own personal\nepisode of Trisha\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk FOOD\nLa Ratatouille\u2019s simple yet classy interior adds to the gastronomic experience\nRestaurant Review: La Ratatouille\nT\nhere are just some days\nwhen your body and palate yearn for some quality grub derived from our\nneighbours from across the\nChannel. This kind of day involves the\nconsumption of well conceived, rich\nand most of all scrumptious dishes,\nwhich, in my opinion, should not be\neaten too often. For me, these days don\u2019t\noccur to often; my palate is slightly biased towards lighter Asian cuisines, but\nwhen these days occur, they happen in\na big way. I go for the richest, heaviest,\nmost tummy-tantalising grub I can get\nmy hands on. So on one such day I decided to indulge most of my senses at La\nRatatouille, a little restaurant situated\na stone\u2019s throw away from Baker Street\nstation. As you enter, its traditional\nFrench fa\u00e7ade complete with wooden\nchairs and tables, alfresco dining area\nand pleasant music make for an unpre-tentious, slightly homely atmosphere\nin which to dine. Alas this place not\nonly has the ambience for a quality dining experience, it also has the food to\nmatch.\nThe menu is not overly extensive, yet\nis filled with the right number of French\nclassics as well as twists on the said which\ncan keep you mulling over your choices\nfor a wee while. For starters, myself and\na fellow diner elected to opt for an onion\nsoup and a Mediterranean seafood soup.\nThe former embodied the classic sweet\nand salty flavours of this Gallic soup dish,\nand was topped off with croutons and an\noverly-generous layer of grilled cheese.\nPretty good stuff, but not quite up to the\nDespite trying pretty hard, Chris Sim could hardly find fault with the produce of this French establishment\nFinding the best Korean eateries that this town has to offer\nChris Sim definitely enjoyed this challenging quest, and here are the winners which are worthy of your custom\nI\nt has taken me all year, but I\nthink I\u2019ve decided once and for\nall. My two favourite Korean\nrestaurants, from very, very different categories. The former\nis superior for a less hastily gobbled,\nmore formal eating occasion; whereas\nthe latter is great for a quick lunch.\nThe former in my opinion has risen to\ntake the mantle of London\u2019s best Korean restaurant, whereas the latter has\nalways held a special place in the hearts\nof Asian students throughout this city.\nYou might be able to guess the title of\nthe former, especially if I informed you\nthat it took that aforementioned crown\naway from Ran recently. I am talking\nabout Arang, one of the more pricey\nestablishments whose higher charges\ndefinitely are justified by the quality\nof the cuisine, impeccable service and\nclassy ambience created by modern\nKorean d\u00e9cor and spacious seating ar-rangements. And not to mention complimentary kimchi and beansprout\ncold side dishes, which provide the\nperfect method to get your stomach\nacid going.\nBut now down to business. Their\nstarters are generally of high quality,\nof particular note were their kimchi-chun (kimchi pancake) and dokbokki\nFood: 9.25\nValue: 8.0\nService: 8.0\nAmbience: 8.0\nOverall: 8.5/10\nstandard of the latter, which oozed with\nunctuous seafood notes, the origin of\nwhich was no doubt from the shells of\nprawns and lobsters. This light soup, accompanied by some crispily toasted croutons and grated cheese, made for the perfect commencement to our meal.\nHaving had a brief rest from the consumption of the entrees, the mains arrived on time. We decided to opt for the\nbalance of a light fish dish, whole roasted\nseabass with tomato and basil, and a\nheavy meat concoction, braised lamb\nshank with mashed potato, sundried tomato and garlic confit. The former was\neasy one the eye, and easy on the palate\ntoo, with the unspectacular yet clean tomato and basil flavours enhancing rather\nthan overpowering the subtle tones emanating from the fresh sea-dweller. Au\ncontraire, the lamb shank was uber-rich,\nand comprised delicately soft meat falling\noff the bone, sublimely smooth mashed\npotato and unctuously rich gravy packed\nwith lambby and rosemary-derived over-tones, punctured by the occasional sweetness of sundried tomato and mellowness\nof the roasted garlic. We partnered these\ndishes with the creation which gave the\nrestaurant its name. Not overly sweet,\nthis rendition of ratatouille hit all the\nright spots; well cooked vegetable components brought together by a rich tomatoey\nreduction.\nDespite our stomachs approaching\ntheir fill, the delights that are French desserts were too tempting to miss out on.\nAnd without doubt, La Ratatouille lived\nup to the billing in this department. A re-juvenatingly refreshing vanilla ice cream\nand raspberry vacherin with red berries\nsauce had all the right elements of a summer dessert: sweet, light and cooling, with\nthe tartness of the berries balanced by the\nsoothing vanilla ice cream aided by the\ncrunch of meringue fingers. This was the\nperfect complement to an indulgent plum\nand almond tart with cr\u00e8me anglaise,\nwhose plums were juicy and plump, pastry was baked to perfection and whose almond filling was as close to velvet as one\ncould hope for.\nDespite a slight delay in the arrival of\nthe starters, the overall level of service\nwas excellent, with all the food arriving\npiping hot. The portion sizes were fair\nfor the price, with starters setting you\nback around \u00a35-6, mains around \u00a313-16\nand desserts around \u00a34-5, which, considering the quality of the gastronomic\ncreations, generates value to such an\nextent that in my opinion, you\u2019ll be\nhard pressed to find at many other mid-ranged French eateries. And it gets bet-ter, for us students are eligible for a 10%\ndiscount when dining at this quality\nestablishment.\nBeef bulgogi (barbequed beef), probably Korea\u2019s second most famous dish\n(rice dough sticks with fish cake in a\nsweet and spicy sauce). The former\nhad a crisp exterior, soft batter interior\nwith interludes of crunchy kimchi and\nonion, brought together by a slightly\nsweetened soy dipping sauce. The latter consisting of not-too-heavy rice\nsticks and richly flavoured fish cakes,\nmarried by a wonderfully spicy yet subtly sweet chilli sauce, with a few background notes to the tune of seafood, is\none dish to really get your tastebuds\nracing. At this point I\u2019d recommend\ntrying some more exciting starters,\nsuch as yukhwe, raw beef strips with\npear, egg yolk and sesame seeds. This\nis a delightfully light and sweet dish,\nyet with the salivating satisfaction of\nbeing composed of high quality beef.\nFor mains, a traditional Korean barbeque should definitely be on any diner\u2019s wishlist when visiting Arang. Their\nbeef bulgogi is not just packed with\nsesame overtones, it comes accompanied with spring onions and wrap it in\nlettuce, a more authentic touch not often seen at Arang\u2019s counterpart estab-lishments. Another cow-derived dish\nis their galbi (beef short ribs), again\nmarinated in a sesame and soybased\nsauce, but whose meat firmer than\nthat of bulgogi yet is divinely richer in\nmeaty notes. And don\u2019t worry about\nleaving with that barbeque smell en-grained in your hair, for an extractor-fan type device more than adequately\ndeals with those aromatic odours.\nKorean food lovers out there should\nof course be able to name the latter,\nit is, of course, that little restaurant\nwith an everpresent queue of Asian\nstudents standing outside, Assa. Its\ncharmingly overcrowded feel, especially when seated close to the kitchen\nsteaming with heavenly aromas, gives\nit a slightly homely touch. Service is\nbrisk, and top quality, simple one dish\nmeals are incredibly moreish. Take for\nexample their pork and vegetables in\nspicy sauce with rice, so simple, but\npacked full of flavour and is a truly\nmoreish treat. Their hotpots (vari-ety of meat, seafood or vegetables in a\nspicy broth) are also tasty, though not\naltogether suitable for those whose\ngastro-intestinal tract is slightly chilli\naverse. Other dishes that are worth a\ntry are yukejung (spicy beef soup) and\ntheir kimchicun.\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\n\u201cThank you for reading each week, and I hope\nyou\u2019ve laughed, learnt and even baulked at felix\nas much as I have this year.\u201d\nT\nhirty issues later, and\nwe\u2019ve got a full complement for this year. This,\nbeing the thirtieth, is an\nissue that seemed so long\naway when I started as felix Editor\nback in August 2009. It may not seem\ntoo long ago for you, but after several\nstrings of sleepless nights and intensely\nstressful print deadline days, it seems a\nlifetime to me.\nAlthough it might not literally have\nbeen a lifetime since then, my Editorship has certainly been a defining\nphase of my time at university, if not\nmy life.\nI\u2019m still a mediocre Biologist fumbling his way through an otherwise\nstraightforward degree. Coming to\nthink of it, taking a year out to edit the\nstudent newspaper is probably an ultimate form of procrastination. Unlike\nmost students in sabbatical positions\nwithin the Union, I have little interest\nin Union politics; neither did I come\ninto this job hoping to peak the interest of The Guardian or The Times. I\u2019d\ndescribe myself as an average student\nat Imperial and really hope that has\nshone through in every facet of my role\nas Editor, from the pitch and direction\nof the newspaper\u2019s content to the way\nI\u2019ve approached new and returning\nwriters. Throughout the year, I\u2019ve run\nwith stories that have been of interest\nto me, and hence what I judge as of\ninterest to the students of Imperial. I\nhope my judgement wasn\u2019t too off target and you\u2019ve been reading intently.\nThe main bone of national contention this year has been that of the\nBrowne Review on student finances.\nIntensified by the General Election\nthat saw each of the three main parties\ntake an interestingly different stand on\ntuition fees, the Browne Review\u2019s findings will be released just as we return\nfor a new academic year in the autumn.\nThe Review will be highly influential in\nthe Government\u2019s plans for raising tuition fees; so much so, their proposals\nto lift the current \u00a33,290 cap on fees\nwill most likely be executed.\nHigher education looks to be an\nentirely different playing field in the\ncoming years, and it has been up to\nthe current students to take a stand. I\nwas incredibly impressed with the Aldwych Group\u2019s dedication to the cause\nagainst the Russell Group, an administration that represents our universities and hence us. They had seemingly\nrefused to let those they represent see\nwhat they were submitting to the ongoing Browne Review.\nAlthough they claimed transpar-ency, our own Union President took it\nupon himself to march his way into the\nRussell Group offices to ensure that\nGroup\u2019s Browne Review submission\nwas released publically and promptly.\nIt was good to see Imperial College\nUnion actively involving themselves\nwith issues of great importance to students beyond South Kensington. Student activism didn\u2019t die with a bygone\nera.\nThe felix Editor\u2019s relationship with\nthe Sabbatical Officers in the Union\nis usually quite a rocky one. In previous years, Editors have gone head-to-head with Presidents. I\u2019ve always\nfound it odd that I could be slating\nsomeone I\u2019ve spent plenty of time becoming friends with, known for years,\nand who sits three floors above me in\nthe Union Building. Luckily, this year\u2019s\nadministration has been a steady ship,\ncaptained by the born-to-be President\nAshley Brown. He\u2019s done a good job\nand stayed off our headlines, which has\nhelped me run with lead features and\nstories that are of genuine interest to\nyou, rather than the tried-and-tested\n\u2018Union does something wrong\u2019 expos\u00e9.\nAs promised in my election manifes-to, I did pick up on the Union\u2019s failings\nwhen needed and not unnecessarily.\nTheir dealing with the new bar names\nastounded me. After taking a successful student poll for a new bar name,\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief 2009-10\nthey decided to scrap the entire thing\nand start over. This time, without a\npoll. Democracy at its best.\nCloser to home, Sir Roy Anderson\u2019s\nsudden and swift resignation threw the\nfelix office into an investigative frenzy.\nPreparing for that issue in November\nallowed us to lead with a story that was\nthe essence of student journalism.\nThe hierachy of our institution was\nin turmoil, and rumours regarding why\nthe Rector left so quickly were bandied\naround the country. The head of one\nof the world\u2019s most respective institutions leaving with a dark cloud over his\nhead was making national news. We\neven had a reporter from The Guardian phone us up for extra information.\nFor a little while, we were ahead of the\nnational press on this story.\nWith every single person associated\nwith College\u2019s governance tight-lipped,\nwe didn\u2019t quite find out the real reason\nwhy Sir Roy stepped down as Rector,\nbut we definitely lifted the lid on a few\nthings along the way.\nHopefully, lips will be loosened as\ntime rolls on, then we\u2019ll finally be able\nto conclude one of the biggest stories to\ncome out of Imperial in recent times.\nObviously, we don\u2019t get a story that big\nor with that much potential to run with\nevery week. This is even more so the\ncase in the lulling Summer Term.\nI\u2019m incredibly proud of Phoenix, our\nspecial summer arts annual. We were\nsecretly confident about how much\nuntapped creative talent was about\ncampus and, luckily, we were right.\nI hope Phoenix will continue to exhibit everything Imperial\u2019s students\ncan excel at beyond their degrees.\nOne aspect of this past year I am\nmost thankful for is the opportunity\nto meet so many other students. From\nthose who just recognised my face\nfrom the newspaper to those that ended up being an integral part of the editorial team, I\u2019ve loved meeting you all;\neven if you didn\u2019t all leave me walking\naway with a smile on my face. There\nwere several occasions where some of\nyou left me puzzled, worried, angered\nor offended. Despite that, the emotion\nstirred is evidence of how much I care\nabout about felix and my job.\nThere is a thick black line between\ndelight and stress for me in the felix\noffice. This line is a wide, dark wedge\nof delirium and caffeine. However, the\nfelix office has been a place of many\nthings: searing discussion and debate,\nentertainment and, for some, solace.\nAs different section editors, copy editors and contributors pass through the\ndoor, it has been wonderful to see so\nmany new faces enter the fold. Most\nnotably, there\u2019s the news team entirely\nmade up of Freshers; Luke Turner,\nwhom was miraculously appointed\nMusic Editor within Freshers\u2019 Week;\nLizzy Griffiths, a Fresher who due to\nher regularity in the office has become\na felix veteran in my eyes; and Charlotte Morris, the girlfriend of the Comment Editor that accidently usurped\nhim as Comment Editor, and then\nending up doing so much more and\nbecoming Assistant Editor.\nIt is to the latter who I have awarded\nmy hand-picked accolade of Editor of\nthe Year. Charlotte has become a driving force behind felix, and has climbed\nher way up the editorial ladder to one\nof the highest positions of responsibility on the team. Her organisation and\nalmost demonic necessity to get things\ndone there and then will lend her great\nhelp if she decides to become Editor\nduring her time at Imperial. Thank you\nfor your invaluable support this year,\nCharlotte. Maybe we\u2019ll pay for you to\nget elocution lessons to lessen that\nNorthern accent of yours.\nIt mustn\u2019t take anything away from\nthe rest of the editorial team this year.\nWe\u2019ve had about 50 editors on the ros-ter, more than ever before. Each and\nevery one of them has done a tremendous job to produce 40 pages every single week. The fun we all have together\nduring the week has shone through in\nevery Friday\u2019s product, and that\u2019s entirely satisfying for the Editor.\nWhat\u2019s in the works for next year, I\nhear you bark. felix will be in the capable paws of Kadhim Shubber. He\u2019s\nalready running around the place like a\nboy with a new toy trying to get exciting projects ready for next year. I\u2019ll be\ntaking a step back, and thankfully you\u2019ll\nsee less of me in the newspaper. Maybe\nyou\u2019ll even see more. Either way, if you\nsee me around College, come and say\nhello still. We\u2019ll get a pint or do pretty\nmuch anything that\u2019ll prevent me from\nstudying Biology again.\nKadhim has all the abilities required\nto excel as a student newspaper editor,\nand I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll evidence that with\nnext year\u2019s felix.\nHave a memorable summer, and\nwhilst you won\u2019t have felix to remind\nyou of the lighter side of life, make\nsure you take as much enjoyment as\nyou can out of whatever you\u2019re doing.\nThank you for reading each week, and\nI hope you\u2019ve laughed, learnt and even\nbaulked at felix as much as I have this\nyear.\nThank you once again, for helping\nme take so much pleasure in producing felix this past year.\n\n"

I will leave you with a quotation from a beautiful book - Narcissus and Goldmund by the revered Herman Hesse - as food for thought:\n\u201cWe fear death, we shudder at life\u2019s\ninstability, we grieve to see the flowers\nwilt again and again, and the leaves\nfall, and in our hearts we know that we,\ntoo, are transitory and will soon disap-pear.

As part of\nthe continued effort to cut costs in the\ncurrent economic climate, and with\nthe status of university fees unsure, union officials as well as College bigwigs\nhave come to the decision that reducing funding, or removing it altogether\nin the case of certain teams, is a viable\nway of reducing expenses.\nSpurred on by the fact that the Imperial College rugby 1sts were unable\nto win varsity for the umpteenth year\nin a row, finance hacks in the SAC\ndecided to take a closer look at other\nshite teams wasting Imperial\u2019s money.\nIt turned out that the felixSport league\ntable was of great help in this task, as\nit was clearly obvious which teams actually set out to win matches and earn\nBUCS points for Imperial and which\nteams were simply in it for the wanton\npost-match alcoholism and destructiveness (an unnamed source placed\ngreat emphasis on the term \u201cchundermonkeys\u201d). Looking at the table shows\nthat most medics teams (bar rugby)\nare useless, Imperial girls (admittedly\na small group) can\u2019t play netball to save\ntheir lives and rugby and hockey are\npropping up both their league tables\nand the union bar at the same time\n(that\u2019s an A for effort, then).\nOf course, sport at university has\nalways been associated with a more\nsocial, less competitive approach and\nmany students think it\u2019s unfair to judge\nteams based solely on sporting merit.\nIt would seem that the overzealous\nbean-counters in Beit, Imperial lackeys through and through, focussed\non the more numerical side of things\nrather than understanding how important it was to share a pint with\nyour mates after the match. Crushing\ndefeat or no crushing defeat, sport is\nabout more than just winning. As an\nunnamed rugby fresher once said (or\ntried to say, I could only half hear him\nas his head was in a toilet): \u201cthe important thing isn\u2019t winning, it\u2019s GETTING\nSMASHED!\u201d Beautiful stuff, worthy of\nPierre de Coubertin himself.\nInterestingly enough, quite a few students think the planned cuts are a good\nmove. Without wanting to generalise,\nit is true that much of Imperial suffers\nfrom a general, geeky apathy towards\nsport. An anonymous Sci-Fi member\nheartily agreed with the union\u2019s mo-tion, going as far as calling it \u201ca bunch\nof idiots running around and then getting drunk\u201d before letting out a sharp\nhiss and retreating from the sunlight\nback into the cool, dark confines of the\nbasement library in Beit quad. Others, less extreme in their views, simply\nbemoaned the way the raucous jocks\ntake over the union on Wednesdays\nand Fridays, \u201cdowning Snakebites with\ntheir ties around their heads after having gotten hammered by some team in\nSurrey\u201d. Oh dear.\nAs a short-term measure, getting rid\nof all the shit sports clubs who haven\u2019t\nwon anything since the Conservatives\nwere last in power does seem like a\ngood option. A lot of money will be\nfreed up and the next ACC chair will\nbe able to concentrate on sorting out\nthe shambles left behind by his or her\npredecessor, called the \u201cworst ACC\nchair in history\u201d by some high-up admin people (here\u2019s to you, Chaz). Who\nknows? Maybe if we focus on the good\nstuff, Imperial will actually come off as\na decent sporting uni.\nActually, that\u2019s not true. Imperial and\nits geeky stalwarts are doomed to occasional flashes of sporting brilliance,\nbut we\u2019ll never dominate the country.\nI know what we can do to win some-thing, though. Scrap the entire ACC\nand use all the money to build a huge\ngaming-specific computer facility (or\ngive all the compscis a year of paid\nleave to play WoW). We\u2019ll have the\nLeft 4 Dead world championships in\nthe bag in no time at all.\nUpon labouring through the labyrinth that is the Imperial College web-site, felix uncovered news that the DiscDoctors, less commonly known as the\nImperial College Ultimate Frisbee club\nare just a signature away from realising\ntheir dream of constructing a multi-acre facility designed for the sole use of\nparticipants in the plastic disc throwing activity. Harlington, said to be of no\nuse now that no sport will be played is\nleading location vying for the contract\nto build this frisbee-dome.\nThey came against stiff competition\nat the hands of Sam Furse, who after\nthe funding farce of last year, submitted\na bid to acquire the entire fleet of thoroughbreds from the UAE. He failed.\nUnion\nslashes\nsports\nfunding\nSport Imperial said\nto be fed up with\nunderperforming\n\u201cshit\u201d clubs. In other\nnews Ultimate\nFrisbee\u2019s the\nDiscDoctors unveil\nplans to transform\nHarlington into\nEurope\u2019s first multi-acre Frisbee Dome\nafter Samuel Furse\u2019s\nfailed horse purchase\n\n"

But the friendships created,\nand times spend exploring new experiences vastly outweigh any negatives.\nUniversity is supposed to be hard- and\nwe\u2019re at one of the best establishments\nin the country. Anyone who says that\nthey hate Imperial and wish they never\ncame are simply looking in the wrong\nplace. My university career has been\nspent constantly attempting different\nthings, that once graduated, I\u2019ll never\nhave the opportunity to do again. I\u2019ve\ndone everything, in my mind, I\u2019m\ndone, I\u2019m off. There\u2019s no point walking\nover the same old ground.\nI wish I had something chic or motivational to say, but all I want you to\ntake home is that your university is\nwhat you make of it. Many of you will\nbe moving on into your second or third\nyears- second years will no longer be\nthe freshers, and third years will have\nultimate respect of adoring freshers.\nIt is up to you to ensure that the new\nbatch of freshers are welcomed in the\nway that you wish to have been. You do\nneed to set an example. I myself only\nstayed at Imperial in my first year due\nto the Hockey Club, and particularly\nto my hall senior Richard Bacon of the\nquote, \u2018university is about wrecking\nyour body for four years and spending the rest of your life recovering.\u2019 I\nconcur. I hated my course, but had a\ngreat time in the bar. True I was prone\nto vomiting, falling asleep on Huxley stairs and generally being a bit of\na mess, but that was then. Now I look\nat the freshers getting over excited and\njust think \u2018they\u2019ll tire out soon.\u2019 But\nthat is the fixation of the Union, people say that it\u2019s shit- these people are\ncomplete fucking morons. Now that\nmay just be my view, but the things we\nare allowed to do and get away with\nmake it a very special place. You must\nremember that the Union is run by stu-dents- they know what you want, they\nare one of you! The Union is there to\nallow students to have fun doing what\nthey want- look at the new entertainments committee, set up to allow stu-Wordpath 1,466\nHow to play:\nMake a path from the origin word to the destination\nword by taking steps between words using one of the\nthree following methods:\nLetter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.\ne.g. WORDS -> WARD\nAnagram: Rearrange the letters.\ne.g. WARD -> DRAW\nWordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4\nletter word from any 5+ letter word that contains\nthem both.\ne.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)\nNoconsecutivestepsmaybemadebythesamemethod.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)\nwould be invalid.\nEarliest, SHORTEST, valid path between the\ntwo words wins.

She is\nbang tidy see her uta.\n\u201d\nGreen Card\n\u201cGive her one for Gaelic.\n\u201d\nFAO Danny\ndents to host their own club nights. To\nfurther that I saw a post on the phase\n3 blog which said the new bar looked\n\u2018like a place you might get kicked out\nof if you were hammered.\u2019 The fact that\nwe don\u2019t is a testament of the Union\u2019s\nview that it\u2019s a place where people will\nstart to learn their limits. They\u2019d much\nrather people ascertain said limits in\na safe environment, where if they do\nfuck up, then they won\u2019t end up with\nthe Police. That\u2019s just the bars, I\u2019m\nnot starting with the clubs or support\non offer. I think I\u2019m wandering, in a\nnutshell, don\u2019t blight the vision of the\nfreshers.\nPeople always say that \u2018it just seems\nlike yesterday...\u2019 and unfortunately, it\u2019s\nno different for me. I remember the\nSaturday I arrived, just as well as I remember the following day, sitting in\nA&E with blood pouring from my head\ndue to my poor ice skating technique.\nEnjoy your time here, it will pass you by.\nIn my final few words, I want to talk\nabout friendships. University is a trying time, and at times you need your\nmates to give you the helping hand you\nso desire. You\u2019ll meet many new peo-ple, and simultaneously, you\u2019ll grow\ndistant to some. The precious few will\nremain, the ones which you spent the\nbest part of your social time with, and\nthe ones who feature most heavily in\nyour stories. I write this, not with a tear\nin my eye, but a definite sadness as I\nrealise that I will be leaving behind so\nmany classmates that I\u2019ve relied upon.\nSome new, some old, but all I want to\nsee again. I think that\u2019s the same for\nall grandaunts, and hopefully you. So\nBanter Squad, Chaps Club, Hockey\nClub and the RSM- laters boys.

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nF\nor years now, the leading question in Modern\nArt has been, \u201cYes, but is\nit Art?\u201d Those five words\nhave haunted museums and\ngalleries up and down the country as\npeople have grappled for answers, or\nalternatively, suggested that answers\nare merely one way of many of seeking\nand expressing knowledge in a post-colonial, post-modern, post-office so-ciety. However, things are beginning to\nchange as more and more people ask\nthe new question on the block, \u201cYes,\nbut will it blend?\u201d\nIn a drive to breathe more life into the\nart world, classic works, both old and\nnew, are subjected to the steely jaws of\nthe blender to pur\u00e9e out the essence of\nart itself. The leader of this new move-ment, Paul Verizer, described the philosophy behind it, \u201cArt comes in many\nshapes and forms and what is art varies\nfrom person to person. The debate is\nfine, noble even, but it's getting in the\nway of what art should be about; making weird shit and getting paid for it.\nWe're trying to recapture that element,\njust when it is at risk of being lost.\u201d\nWorks already transformed into\nBlendArt include sculptures, installations and several of the nation's most\npopular paintings. The results have\nbeen interesting, inspiring, and in\nRhys Davies uncovers the secret movement of Blendism: famous pieces of artwork that have been blended\nsome cases, surprising, keeping many\na commentator on the edge of their\nseat.\nThe mystery of the Mona Lisa's smile\nwas famously solved last month when\nthe blended product was found to have\nthe same consistency as a McDonald's\nHappy Meal; turns out she was just\nhappy after all.\nOther blended works include Damien Hirst's \u2018Mother and Child, Divided\u2019\n(which actually made quite a splendid\nbeef gravy) and the \u2018For the Love of\nGod\u2019 skull (though the diamonds did\nput the blender out of comission for\na few weeks); Michelangelo's \u2018David\u2019\n(which is now being touted as a powerful aphrodisiac) and Tracey Emin's \u2018My\nBed\u2019 (which, everyone agrees, has been\nmuch improved by blending).\nWe are living in exciting times.\nWith so much already achieved by the\nBlendism movement, what does the\nfuture have in store? Verizer stated\nthat one day, he would like to blend\nThe Angel of the North if only he could\nfind a blender big enough. Work has\nalready begun on such a device but it is\nevident the Blend-men still have a long\nway to go.\nOn seeing the blender-in-progress,\nmany people are prompted to ask\nthemselves and those around them,\n\u201cYes, but is it art?\u201d\nArt? Yeh, sure, sure... but will it blend?\nBelieve or not, the original Mona Lisa was actually blended in 1972. Mr. Bean drew the replica currently in the Louvre\nGet recognised!\nIf you\u2019re working with others to help your community, the Philip Lawrence Awards\nNetwork (PLAnet) wants to hear from you!\nTo find out more and be in with a chance of winning a prestigious award and \u00a31000\ntowards your project visit www.philiplawrenceawards.net\nThat\u2019s exactly what one Imperial student did.

Faulkner has kidney problems and must undergo dialysis every\nother day. After intensive interviews and psychiatric\nevaluations, Pakistan police stated, \u201cThe doctor told us\nhe has some psychological problems but said he is not a\nmad man.\u201d Instead, they concluded that he felt that Apple \u201cwas not doing enough\u201d to get iPads in stock in his\nlocal Colorado Apple Store and set out to do something\nabout it because Hamas refuses to agree to tenets set\nby international members of the peace process including\nEurope, Russia, and the U.S.\nPakistan\nAn embarrassing Brown end\nAshley Brown, who had spent an extraordinary 81 years at Imperial as a stu-dent, was found lying naked in his office\nin Beit Quad late last night by a shocked\nDeputy President John James. Despite\nperforming oral resuscitation Mr James\nwas unable to revive Mr Brown or his\nflagging erection. He was rushed to\nCharing Cross hospital where he was\ndeclared dead at 03:34 am. Reports that\nhis body was desecrated by drunk medics are unconfirmed.\nIt is believed that Ashley was engaged\nin auto-erotic asphyxiation but it will\nnot be known for certain until a postmortem examination is conducted.\nEarly medical tests show the presence\nof branded super sexual-stimulant, Union Policy. It is a substance chemically\nsimilar to viagra, but it is said to contain\ndangerous levels of methyl-boringum\nand phenyl-uselessness.\nMr Brown first came to Imperial as a\nfresher in 1939 and during his time as an\nundergraduate, postgraduate, PhD stu-dent, Live! Editor and Union President\nhad won respect for his honesty and\ncan-do attitude.\n\u201cWho would have thought eh?\u201d said a\nguy we met in the pub, \u201cAshley Brown, a\nfucking pervert.\u201d\nContinued from Front Page His colleagues echoed those sentiments telling felix \u201cAshley was an inspiration to us all but I guess he wasn\u2019t\nquite right in the head\u201d\nDeputy President John James however slammed his colleagues for their\nintolerance. In a call from the North\nAfrican coast he said \u201cWho cares if he\nliked to choke himself while he played\nthe fiddle. What people do in their own\ntime is their own business. And to be\nhonest, he had a look of ecstasy on his\nface so maybe he was on to something\nafter all.\u201d\nMr Brown was a mere four weeks\naway from completing his year as President, a year he described as one of the\n\u201cgreatest and proudest achievements\u201d\nof his life. This proclamation came after\nhe claimed he was dictated by astrology into becoming President last year.\n\u201cWell, I showed those stars who\u2019s their\nDaddy, now!\u201d he exclaimed at Union\nCouncil last week.\nBrown\u2019s extraordinary behaviour had\nbecome increasingly erratic in the latter days of his Presidency. He reportedly\ndrew up plans to construct a nuclear\nbunker in Beit Quad before his clinical\nadvisors reassured him that World War\nII was \u201cwell and truly over\u201d. Mr. Brown\nhas been regularly seen crying over the\ndamaged walls of the Victoria & Albert\nMuseum where chip marks from the\nBlitz bombings were preserved to commemorate London\u2019s resilience under\nadversity. It was an adversity Brown\nexperienced first-hand as he hid in the\ncatacombs of the Museum itself as a\nsmall child.\nAlthough unconfirmed, leaks from\nImperial College Health Centre suggested that Mr. Brown was suffering from\nschizophrenia, and that his personality\nhad become split between a mad-cap\nPresident of a faltering student Union\nand a Robin Island- incarcerated Nelson\nMandela.\nThe tragic news is especially poignant\nas he had plans to marry his sweetheart\nin the Union this summer. OK! magazine revealed last month that his fianc\u00e9\nwas unhappy at hosting the wedding in\nBeit Quad, stating the Union\u2019s catering\nservice was \u201clike something from a horrible boring nightmare\u201d.\nPlans have already been drawn up to\ncommemorate Mr Brown and the work\nthat he did for the Union and students\nin general. Proposals are said to include\na day of mourning, a special concert in\nthe Great Hall and perhaps, a giant ice\nsculpture of Mr Brown on the Queens\nLawn.

In a Oval Office television address, his first, U.S. President Obama received\nmixed reviews when he asked, \u201cCan\u2019t the British get\nover this already? It\u2019s been over 300 years since the Tea\nParty.\u201d Meanwhile, two newspapers, both owned by the\nsame company, debated over which country\u2019s pensioners\nwould be hit hardest by BP\u2019s stock market decline. The\nSun seemed to convincingly defeat the New York Post\nin the debate: BP is 40% British-owned, as opposed to\n39% American-owned. A new controversy raged due\nto idiomatic confusion after BP chairman Carl-Henric\nSvanberg, a Swede, mistakenly said, \u201cWe care about\nthe small people.\u201d Those hit by the catastrophe were\noffended by the use of \u201csmall\u201d and would have preferred\nthe use of the word little.\nUSA\nN\north Korea intentionally lost its first round\nWorld Cup match with Brazil in order to please\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. An exclusive felix interview with a DPRK higher-up, the\nfirst ever of its kind for this column, alerted us to the\nsituation. According to FELIX\u2019s source, \u201cKim Jongil watched the film \u201cCity of God\u201d last week, really\nloved it, and wanted to say thank you to the Brazilians by ensuring that his outstanding football team did\nnot outshine the Brazilians at their national sport.\u201d\nThe match was 0-0 at the half, at which point Kim\nmade the order, and his team allowed Brazil to score\ntwo goals. In the eighty-ninth minute, in a highlight\nbound to be played alongside his execution on state\ntelevision for many years to come, Ji Yun-Nam scored\nbringing the final score to 2-1.\nN.Korea\nBy TOM GREANY AND HAL NEVILLE-JONES\nUNION PRESIDENT DEAD IN\nSOLO OFFICE SEX GAME\n\n"

The Surfsoc\nFreshers were keen to pick up on our\nweekend traditions, as Ellie seized the\nopportunity to drop the milk and leave\nus all wondering why we don\u2019t just let\nJamie carry it. The Welsh banter continued as we met the elderly couple\nwho ran the hostel, who said they\u2019d get\nour keys \u2018now in a minute\u2019.\nWaking up on Saturday the great\nweather allowed us to appreciate the\nlocation of the hostel, an old Lifeboat\nHouse, as we ate breakfast looking out\non the Gower and Port Eynon beach.\nAfter a short drive we met with the surf\nschool in Rhossilli at 10 am, but were\ndisappointed to see the lack of waves\nthat the forecasts had been predicting\nall week. On the plus side the conditions were ideal for beginners, of which\nthere were five novices, all of whom\nkeenly jumped into their wetsuits to\nget started with their lesson. Not ones\nto be fazed by the less than ideal state of\naffairs or waste a weekend by the coast\nthe rest of the crew zipped up and waded out into the water to try their luck.\nAfter some lunch and a game of beach\ncricket the surf picked up with the high\ntide and most of the group headed\nback in for an afternoon session, before heading back to Port Eynon to get\nthe evening meal underway. Committee member Alex Karvelas fired up the\nbarbeque beside the seafront to cap\noff a relaxing day in South Wales. After many burgers/sausages/bananas,\nand feeling pretty beached we headed\nto the local pub to catch the England\ngame, which won\u2019t be spoken of here. A\nfew drinks later and not wanting to be\nin poor condition for the next day the\ngroup got in a solid 4 hours sleep before\nthe morning wake-up call.\nSunday morning started off grey\nand overcast but brightened up considerably once the bus reached the\ncliffs. Surfing conditions were much\nimproved from Saturday with regular\nsets rolling in on the 2mile long sandy\nbeach. With the sun holding out we\nwere able to surf all morning with some\npretty nice rides to be had. The morning\u2019s surf provided a nice end to the trip\nand with the sun slowly creeping away\nfrom sight the team followed suit and\nheaded to the local inn for the Sunday\ncarvery in preparation for the 5 hour\njourney home.\nSurfSoc bade farewell to the valleys\njust as the heavens gave way to the infamous Welsh rain. The return journey\nwas a more laid back affair but one with\nquiet satisfaction (or so I believe). Although the surf wasn\u2019t as brilliant as it\ncould have been the sunshine and ambience made up for it and resulted in a\nthoroughly enjoyable weekend.\nTabby Mirza Surfing\nForget the World Cup - try the Wimbledon sweepstakes\nRobert Bush Tennis\nThe English summer has arrived and\nwith it, as always, Wimbledon! After\na very unpredictable and surprising\nAEGON championship at the Queen\u2019s\nClub and at the Halle Club in Germany\nwhere Federer was beaten by Hewitt,\nthe winner of Wimbledon this year will\nprove very hard to predict.\nHowever, the Imperial College Tennis Club is offering the chance to win\nan ATP tennis T-shirt or towel if you\npredict the right player (male or fe-male) to win Wimbledon.\n***\nThis is how it will work:\nEmail lawn.tennis@imperial.ac.uk\nwith your intention to enter;\nyou will receive one of the top 16\nseeds selected by random (1 male player and 1 female) OR you can select an\nunseeded player of your choice or a 16-32 seeded player.\n***\nCan\u2019t get away from the vuvuzelas and the En-ger-land chants but want some summer sport? Tennis Club has the answer for you!\nThat\u2019s not all -how about a bit of\nSummer Tennis?\nThis summer, football will probably take centre stage but nevertheless\nthere will be the usual flock of people\nblowing the dust of their tennis rackets\nand catching some summer sun while\nchilling out on the tennis court.\nThe tennis club is offering a half\nprice discount for summer member-ship. At only \u00a315 you will recover the\ncosts after playing just twice! The club\nsupplies the balls, rackets and organises opponents of a similar standard.\nWe already have 4 sessions booked in\nJune and courts are still available. You\ncan pay for membership at www.impe-rialcollegeunion.org/lawn-tennis-157/\ncategory.html after which you will automatically receive your username and\npassword to book courts. Then go to\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/tennis to book\nyour court!\nSo if you have an internship, live in\nLondon or are still studying join now\nto secure courts for June, July, August\nand September and emulate Andy\nMurray\u2019s (possible) success at this\nyear\u2019s All-England Championships.\nApparently this is in Wales. If I gave two shits I would go further to dispute this claim. But I don\u2019t so I won\u2019t. T\u2019isn\u2019t half bad though\nLet me know if ANYBODY partakes in this comp featured by this highly enthralling form of faux-gambling. Actually, don\u2019t.\n\n"

Anyone guess who it is? Yep, saviour of the world\nBarack Obama. He looks a bit scared, maybe because of Ed\u2019s wandering hand/paw.\nYeah, thanks Az (Games Writer), what\nwas the fucking point? Lined paper? No\ncolouring in? You should be ashamed.\nAlthough I am a fan of the blank\neyebrows and goaty beard.\nRox Middleton (Copy Editor) has gone for an \u201cI can draw me\u201d look, I particularly like the\nSchindler\u2019s List-esque use of red which, of course, you can\u2019t see as I scanned these in on a\nblack and white copier. There\u2019s a slight tinge of sadness there, obviously because the hair\nwas longing for a yellow felt tip.\nThis interpretation the Editor Master Dan Wan Esquire really emphasises exactly\nwhat he is: a short chubby Chinese boy, or the effort he\u2019s taken to ensure his hair\nis absolutley perfect, even using a completely different pen! Definitely gay.\nThe Library - a post modernist gallery or just Rhys Davies (Catnip Editor) was\nso lazy he couldn\u2019t be arsed to use his own paper. This is a drawing of much\nsymbolism. Is the straight jacket an expression of his own madness or a cry for\nhelp? And what\u2019s with the fez?\n\n"

Kadhim\nFelix\u2019s essential summer playlist\nThe first offering in six years from the\nCalifornian stoner hip-hop troupe,\nthere\u2019s a lot you\u2019ll find familiar about\nthis latest CD. It starts slowly, with a\ncouple of tracks that could have been\ntaken from almost any of their old al-bums, albeit this time with a bored-sounding Tom Morello going through\nthe big-riff motions in the background.\nStill, it gets better: they still have an ear\nfor a tune, and tracks like Get It Anyway and K.U.S.H. will still have you\npulling \u2018West-Side\u2019 white-boy dance\nmoves in your living room. Sure, the\nalbum\u2019s still full of the old stoner clich\u00e9\nstuff, designed solely to outrage Daily\nMail reading parents while delighting\ntheir 13-year-old offspring, but that\nsaid it\u2019s still pretty good fun.\n- Duncan Casey\nCYPRESS HILL\nRISE UP\nPRIORITY\nALBUM\nA weird mix of styles and influences,\nthere\u2019s potential for this lot to be some\nfun - but not until they work out what\nthey want to sound like. The drummer\nand bassist want to be in a death metal\nband, while the vocalist is happy turning out Blink-182-style, radio friendly\npunk-pop. The end result is confused\nand patchy, but good in places: think of\na Bullet For My Valentine that have got\nthe joke, or a Lostprophets with a bit\nless ego and you won\u2019t be too far off.\n- Duncan Casey\nFOUR YEAR\nSTRONG\nENEMY OF THE\nWORLD\nUNIVERSAL\nMOTOWN\nALBUM\nReviews\nIt has been a\nprivilege and a\nlot of fun\nY\nes we\u2019ve reached the end.\nThe absolute, immutable end.

I\ngot free tickets to loads of gigs and managed to grow a sizeable CD collection\nalong the way. Most importantly, I\u2019m\nnow able to hold a conversation about\nmusic without wondering why farm\ntools like \u201cPitchfork\u201d keep cropping up.\nI hope that you\u2019ve enjoyed reading\nthe section too. We made an effort to\nhave a lot of content each week. That\nmeant doing shorter gig and album reviews but to be honest, we didn\u2019t think\nthere was much point in doing long,\noverwrought reviews; we wanted to let\nyou know about as much music as possible and with a little prodding, let you\nmake your own mind.\nMy one regret is that we didn\u2019t spend\ntime publicising musicians at Imperial.\nThe worry was that we couldn\u2019t do it\nin a way that wouldn\u2019t offend fellow\nstudents but that was also credible, i.e.\nyou the reader didn\u2019t think we were\njust being nice for the sake of it. It\u2019s a\nproblem that I hope next year\u2019s Music\nteam will overcome because there is a\ngreat deal of talent at Imperial and at\nthe very least their own student newspaper should be open to them.\nFinally, get involved next year. People always tell me that they\u2019re worried\nabout their writing being poor and my\nresponse every time is that the only\nreason that my writing is passable now\nis that I\u2019ve practised. You\u2019ve got to start\nsomewhere and felix is probably the\nbest place. We\u2019ll give you tips and iron\nout any problems and we\u2019d never turn\nour noses up at your writing.

Whether you\u2019re an undergraduate trying to write a literature\nreview or a researcher trying to find a\nnew method, journals are the primary\nway of sharing new information on\nresearch topics with both specialists\nand generalists. Most, if not all journal\narticles are published online for download in PDF format ahead of their print\ndebut. If you or your institution have\na subscription to the journal, or it\u2019s an\nopen journal like the PLOS series, then\nyou can easily find and download the\narticle with PubMed or another peer-reviewed journal index. Once you\u2019ve\ngot the journal of course it\u2019s a simple\nmatter of just loading up your PDF\nreader of choice to read it. For one article that\u2019s fine, but imagine you read\nseveral articles a day and end up a library of journal articles totalling into\nthe hundreds, how do you keep them\norganised?\nEndnote by Thomson Scientific is\nthe current industry standard bibliography program and it\u2019s recently been\nupdated in the last few iterations to\nsupport attaching PDFs to citations. If\nyou\u2019re on a Windows PC, Endnote is\nabout as good as you can get, but those\non a Mac have a lot more choice.\nOf course you can use Endnote on\nthe Mac, but it\u2019s not a very \u2018Mac-like\u2019\nexperience. Mekentosj\u2019s journal library\nprogram Papers, is one great example\nof a very Mac-like and effective piece\nof software. It handles the downloading of citations and the articles associated with them, lets you view and\nedit the meta data of each paper, plus\nPapers lets you read the article both in\npreview and full screen reading mode\nright from within the application. One\nA\nnother week has flown by\nand we\u2019ve reached the end\nof another accademic year.\nSo, it\u2019s with a heavy heart\nI have to say, thanks for reading the\ntechnology section of felix this year. It\u2019s\nbeen a year to remember and 2010 is\nonly just getting started.\nIn the computing space we\u2019ve had\nGoogle execs facing jail-time, as well\nas big G\u2019s move out of China due to\ncensorship. We\u2019ve had the continual\nbattleground of processors move away\nfrom the Intel Vs. AMD and into the\nx86 Intel Vs. the ARM SOCs realm.\nWe\u2019ve also seen Apple unveiling the\n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 iPad, which caught the\nworld by storm selling out in the US\nto the detriment of launches in the\nrest of the world. Who\u2019d have thought\na $500 massive iPod touch would be\nquite the success it has been, especially\nWell this is it folks, felix is signing off for the year and so it\u2019s\ntime to wrap-up the week\u2019s\ntech news one last time.\nOnLive, the company that\npromises console quality gaming in your browser thanks\nto the cloud, went online on\nThursday. Limited to just the\nUS for now, the service costs\n$4.95 per month with an impressive list of titles available to\nplay right now, including Mass\nEffect 2, Assassin\u2019s Creed 2 and\nDirt 2 amongst others. Not bad\nfor a service that could have\neasily stayed vapour-ware.\nSticking with cloud ser-vices, Google has added a rudimentary video editor to it\u2019s\nYouTube service. While it\u2019s\nno iMovie, the editor lets you\ncut, combine and crop video\ncontent before upload. It\u2019s fast,\nsimple to use and in the cloud,\nwhat more could you want on\nthe go? iMovie on your iPhone\n4 perhaps?\nCineworld this week also announced that it\u2019ll be going all\ndigital projection within three\nyears. Converting all 77 of it\u2019s\ncinemas across the country\nto pure digital is going to cost\nCineworld in the region of \u00a340\nmillion, including \u00a310m the\nchain has already pumped into\nupgrading a third of it\u2019s 790\nscreens. Going digital should\nallow the cinema chain to reduce the price it pays for films\nthough a \u2018Virtual Print Free\u2019\ndeal with the studios, meaning that the cost shouldn\u2019t be\npassed onto the customer.\nThe upgrade, done in partnership with Arts Alliance Media,\nwill allow them to show sport,\nplays, opera and other alternative content on the big screen.\nGone are the days of print and\nreels, but is it truly better?\nE3 had the gaming industry\nbuzzing this week, with unveils from Microsoft, Sony and\nNintendo taking prime spots.\nFirst out of the gates was Microsoft showing off it\u2019s new\nXbox 360 (that\u2019s the 360 \u2018slim\u2019\nto you and me) and it\u2019s \u2018Kinect\u2019\nmotion sensing\ngaming plat-form, which was known by it\u2019s\ndevelopment name, Project\nNatal. It\u2019s going to be available come November for the\nrumoured price of $150, whilst\nthe 360 slim hit these shores\non Wednesday for \u00a3199 sporting a 250GB HDD and built-in\nWiFi.\nSony, not to be outdone by Microsoft,\nunleashed their take\non the motion gaming genera with the\nPlayStation Move.\nScheduled for a September 19th release, Move\nuses the PlayStation Eye and a\nMove controller, which looks\nlike a black Wiimote with a\nlolipop on the top. Whilst the\nMove and Eye can be had in a\npack costing $99 with Sports\nChampions, Sony\u2019s version of\nWii Sports, the Navigational\ncontroller is an extra $30. A\nPS3 plus Move bundle will be\navailable at launch for $400.\nSony wasn\u2019t done there\nthough, they also announced\nthat the PSN, Sony\u2019s free online gaming service, is getting\na paid add-on upgrade. PlayStation Plus will cost $49 a\nyear and bring with it exclusive\nDLC and other content, early\naccess to betas and demos,\nauto-updating and free full\ngames to play, which\u2019ll change\neach month. Great for those\nlooking for a little bit extra\nfrom the already solid PSN.\nLast, but not least, we had\nNintendo with it\u2019s latest 3D\niteration of the DS. Imaginatively named the 3DS, it comes\npacking an impressive glasses\nfree 3.5\u201d 3D widscreen, a 3D\neffect slider, a motion sensor, a\ngyro, a \u2018slide pad\u2019 joystick, two\ncameras\nfor 3D\nphotos\nand improved\ngraph-ics.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nSamuel\nSamuel\nGibbs\nGibbs\nTechnology\nEditor\nWaving madly\nat your screen\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nof the killer features of Papers is the\nability to just drag and drop a PDF article into the program and it\u2019ll do the\nrest for you. Should the meta data in\nthe PDF not be good enough to identify a citation match, Papers will then\nask you to select or search from a couple of options for the correct citation.\nOf course once you have your library\nimported into Papers, which you can\ndo from Endnote amongst others,\nsearching it with Spotlight is a breeze,\nby keyword, author, year or journal.\nThe searching doesn\u2019t stop there as\nPapers also lets you search PubMed\nand a few other indexes directly from\nthe program. Organising your articles\nin Papers is also incredibly easy to do\nusing drag and drop to simply move\narticles into and out of folders or col-lections. For instance if you happen\nto have a particular project you\u2019re researching and a subset of your journal\nlibrary directly applies to it, you can\nquickly and easily create a separate\nfolder in your library and sort your\ndownloaded articles in there.\nPerhaps the thing that sets Papers\napart from all other journal library\nmanagers is the ability to sync with an\niPhone and iPad app. Wirelessly syncing your iDevice means you can take all\nor a subset of your journal library with\nyou on the go for reading or reference.\nPapers syncing goes both ways how-ever, enabling you to search for, down-load, read and modify the meta data of\njournal articles on your iPhone then\nsync them back to your Mac. A simply\nfantastic feature if you happen to be at\na conference and someone mentions a\ngreat paper you should check out.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Papers is a slick\nand capable journal library organiser\nand it has a lot of nice features, but it\nlacks one crucial feature to make it the\nbe-all and end-all \u2018iTunes for journals\u2019\nand that\u2019s a cite-while-you-write func-tion. Papers can\u2019t itself insert citations\ninto your word processor of choice.\nYou can however export a library of\ncitations to your cite-while-you-write\nengine of choice, be it Endnote or even\nthe reference manager built into Microsoft Word 2008. It\u2019s not a bad solu-tion, but Papers just begs to have it\u2019s\nown word processor citation engine,\nand it means you can\u2019t just rely on Papers to get your work done.\nIf you just want to organise and read\njournal articles on your Mac or want\nto take them with you on your iPhone,\nthen you can\u2019t got far wrong with\nPapers.\nCosting \u20ac29 (about \u00a325) from Mekentosj.com, Papers for Mac is also\navailable with 40% student discount.\nPapers for iOS costs \u00a38.99 and is available from the iTunes App Store.\nPapers lets you catalogue, read and sync your journal article PDFs to your iPhone or iPad for reading on the go\nmotion sensing\ni l\ntho\ntha\nline\na p\nSta\nyea\nDL\nacc\np j y ,\nD\n-in the economic downturn we all still\nface. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have put it\npast Apple. It\u2019s sheer desirability is the\nenvy of electronics manufatures the\nworld over. But of course Apple wasn\u2019t\ndone with revolutionishing the tablet\ncomputing space, oh no! The iPhone\n4 launch is just round the corner and\nalready they\u2019re out of pre-order units.\nWith FaceTime and slew of other evolutionary improvements, Apple\u2019s Jesus\nphone looks likely to repeat it\u2019s success\nevermore.\nBut wait, we\u2019ve also had a massive\nexpansion of Android in the mobile\nspace, with HTC and Dell churning\nout some truly mind-boggling smart-phones. Palm also, sadly, ceased to be\nindependent this year and we wait with\nbaited breath to see what HP has up it\u2019s\nsleeve for the father of the mobile computing ecosystem.\n\n"

I remember our car being searched by the British Army every\ntime our family went shopping. I remember my little church being burnt\ndown and my Catholic school petrol\nbombed - twice. I remember the fear\nwhen our school was closed early during riots and being in the back seat of\nthe family car, aged 7, when a man was\nshot dead by the IRA outside our flat.\nLife in a city dissected by a 25ft wall\nmeant that I never met socially with\nProtestants, right up until coming to\nImperial.\nWe now find ourselves in a period of\nunparalleled peace and prosperity, although largely down to the death toll\nrather than political success. But while\nmost of the country was left in peace\nto tend to the emotional and physical\nscars of the past, families of the victims\nof Derry City\u2019s infamous Bloody Sunday massacre were left with insult and\nfurther pain; their dead or wounded\nloved ones branded terrorists by not\nonly the Army but the official inquiry\ninto the fiasco.\nIt is only now, after the release of\nthe new Saville Inquiry on Tuesday,\nthat I can say without fear of consequence what happened on Sunday\nthe 30th January 1972. 10,000 people,\npredominantly Catholic, marched on\nDerry City with the Northern Ireland\nCivil Rights Association, demanding\nan end to internment without trial.\nSuch marches had been banned by the\nUnionist Northern Irish government\nand the march was blocked by barricades set up and manned by the British\nArmy.\nEnraged, many of the younger protestors began throwing stones at the\nbarricade and were met with rubber\nbullets, tear gas and water cannon\nfrom the army. The army was then sent\nout to arrest as many of the marchers\nas possible. It is at this point that, when\nstudying the incident in school, we are\ntaught that it is difficult to say what\nhappened next but 25 minutes later\n13 marchers lay dead with a further 15\nwounded, one of whom later died. According to reports from the soldiers at\nthe time, the Provisional IRA opened\nfire on the Army, who responded ap-propriately, shooting back at them,\nreturning one shot for one shot and\nmany of those killed were found to\nhave had nail bombs in their pockets.\nThis, at least, was the official account\nas accepted by the Widgery Tribunal\nwhich looked into the shootings. It is\nthis same account that has now been\nfound to have been largely fabricated.\nBritish troops should never have\nbeen used to block marches which\nnever should have been banned in the\nfirst place. That paratroopers, who\nwere trained to fight Soviets, perpetrated a massacre against British citizens (British whether they liked it or\nnot) in a British city is now clear. This\nmassacre was then covered up, with\nthe scapegoat of the dead innocents\npreferred to the tarnishing of the regiment\u2019s name. To go through almost\n40 years of being told by the government that your dead brother, son or\nfather was a terrorist and got what he\ndeserved must have been unimagina-bly hard for the relatives of the Bloody\nSunday victims.\nAt a time when there is such attention on the wrongs of that Sunday, it\nis understandable that some will raise\nthe many people, including soldiers,\nwho were killed in equally as cold\nblood by the IRA and other terrorist\ngroups in Northern Ireland, as well as\nhere in London. Death dealt by terrorists should never go without investigation nor be left unpunished, but the\nidea that murder could be committed\nby professional soldiers against the civilians they are supposed to protect is\nsurely beyond justification; that they\ncould then manage to cover this up is\nbeyond belief.\nThe victims of IRA bombs were\nnever blamed by the government\nfor their own deaths. A simple truth\nRory Fenton\nRory Fenton\nYesterday evening it was announced\nthat the Cabinet will be replacing the\nEngland team in the World Cup. In a\nmove that sees the first democratically\nelected national football team, David\nCameron and chums will swapping\ntheir suits for England kits.\nThe switch was prompted after\nEngland\u2019s draw against the USA gave\nrise to widespread condemnation\nof Capello\u2019s squad. After decades of\narmchair managers proclaiming they\ncould pick the squad better than the\nEngland manager we are one step\ncloser to the goal.\nWhile no-one actually voted for the\ncabinet to represent us at football,\nthe cabinet doesn\u2019t accurately represent the overall will of the country in\npolitics either. As such they have decided they have an equal mandate to\nrepresent the nation in South Africa\nas they have in Westminster.\nWith Green no longer in goal, the\nchances of England bringing home\nthe World Cup have soared. Bookmakers already are giving 2-1 odds\nthat William Hague will score a hattrick in today\u2019s match against Algeria. Other star players include Eric\nPickles, who, being almost the size of\nthe goal, is expected to block nearly\nevery shot on target.\nWhile the cabinet are in South Africa the country will be run entirely\nby the Queen. She has stated her\nmain policies will be to set up an Alpaca farm in every local park.\nPrince Philip has been deputised\ninto the foreign office.\nThe Lib Dem players are widely ex-stands; 14 unarmed civilians were shot\ndead by the army of this country.\nIt is hard to stress enough the influence that Bloody Sunday had in dragging Northern Ireland into much of\nthe bloodshed that followed it. Many\nmoderate Catholics who had previously rejected violence drifted easily\ninto the hands of the IRA, including\nsome I know and perhaps my own\nexperience of nineties Belfast could\nhave been rather different. The effects\nof the past 40 years cannot be erased\nby a single inquiry into 14 of the over\n3,000 who died in the Troubles but if it\ncan heal some wounds and right some\nwrongs, not only is the principle of justice upheld, but a chapter may finally\nbe closed on one of the bloodiest times\nin Northern Irish history.\nMike Hunt\nMike Hunt\nCameron captains England\npected to start on the bench. This is\nby far a promotion from their tea and\ncoffee making tasks in the cabinet.\nAfter years of advocating a 4-3-1 formation they have backed down to the\nTory demands of a 4-4-2 lineup for a\nchance to sit on the bench.\nBoris Johnson has flown out to\nSouth Africa but is unlikely to play\nafter his rugby-tackling shenanigans\nof his last football match. Of course\nBoris isn\u2019t a member of the cabinet,\nbut it just wouldn\u2019t be right for the\nother toffs to go without him.\nNaturally the move means that\nfrom now on the England team will\nbe democratically elected.\nFollowing the World Cup we will\nfinally have an England squad that\ntruly represents the English pub-lic. Tactical voting has a whole new\nmeaning. Boris Johnson could be England\u2019s star player if he could avoid rugby tackling\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 18 JUNE 2010\nA sickening display of hypocrisy in politics\nO\nne thing to notice amid\nthis whole positive discrimination debate is\nthat we here at Imperial benefit more highly\nfrom positive discrimination than\nmost realise. A few weeks back, felix\ninformed us that the Russell Group\nreceives two-thirds of the UK\u2019s higher\neducation budget. Now that\u2019s positive\ndiscrimination if ever I saw it: subtly\nimplying that those twenty universities are better institutions for the government to ply with money. However,\nI think this is an example of sensibly\napplied positive discrimination. From\na logician\u2019s point of view what is the\npoint in investing money in something\nthat you know is going no-where; that\nis why we don\u2019t invest more money in\nless capable, less pioneering universi-ties. The same argument can be applied to whether known alcoholics\nshould be given liver transplants. If\nthe probability of wastage is high, why\nbother? It is in these situations that\npositive discrimination works.\nIt is when decisions are made that go\nagainst logic that positive discrimination becomes a laughing stock. Nathan\nHolford spent his entire article describing a situation where a company\nwas choosing between two completely\ncandidates, identical in all but gender.\nBut the fundamental flaw is that this\nis not positive discrimination. It is defined by what he said \u2018makes no sense\u2019\n\u2013 where ability is completely ignored.\nBut this is where the entire issue comes\nfrom. It is illogical.\nThat is to say nothing of his claims\nthat it does nothing to undermine\npride. The sting of being denied a job in\nfavour of someone less qualified must\nbe painful. But to get a job because of\nyour gender must be infuriating.\nImagine if this policy was in place in\nthe admissions process of this very uni-versity. Imagine being denied a place\nbecause the college had to fulfil their\nfemale quota or they were already full\nof people of your ethnic background.\nYou may remember the feelings of\nDiane Abbot on the issue of race at\nImperial around this time last year.\nIf she had her way, everyone would\nbe defined by their race or gender or\nsexual orientation and not the people\nthey are beneath. Ironically this is the\nargument used by most anti-discrimi-nation organisations. To use what they\nso vehemently protest against in order\nto ensure equality is a sickening display\nof hypocrisy. Interestingly enough, Diane Abbot is currently campaigning to\nreplace Gordon Brown as leader of the\nLabour Party. Her campaign centres on\nthe fact that she is black and a woman.\nAre these really the qualities people\nAzfarul Islam bids adieu to Imperial\n\u201cFun turned to\nhorror at the first\nlecture when\nI realised that\nnothing made\nsense\u201d\nW\nhen approaching\nthe end of something as momentous as University\nlife, one can\u2019t help\nbut sit down for extended periods of\ncontemplation - even if said sit downs\ntake out rather scary chunks of time\nfrom working on my final year project.\nBut it simply must be done.\nThere\u2019s nostalgia, there\u2019s regret,\nthere\u2019s joy and - I\u2019m not ashamed of\nadmitting it - a sense of unfathomable sorrow. School passed by over an\noverly long, protracted period and you\nreally had no choice on the matter; Alevels ended before they even began.\nUniversity, though? There\u2019s an entirely\ndifferent phenomenon altogether. Can\nI even begin to describe that first feeling of freedom? Or that realisation that\nall of a sudden, one is truly a master of\nhis or her own destiny? Or reminisce\nabout chance encounters that change\nthe course of our lives? Or appreciatively look back on mistakes even, at\nleast ones that let us gain incomparable experience? I could, however, easily\nbegin to rail at spending that one (and\nsoon, far more than one) weekend in\nthe library. Seriously, what\u2019s up with\nthe workload here?\nThe first time I found myself in the\nwide hallways and even wider common room of Beit was like nothing I\u2019ve\never been through. What\u2019s to compare\nagainst? In school events you knew\neveryone and gravitated towards your\npeer group. At parties, weddings and\nthe like back in Bangladesh, you were\neither busily involved in managing\nthe proceedings or just found yourself\nmilling around uncomfortably in an attempt to find some long-lost relatives\nand then spend the whole time catching up with them.\nIt was soon after that one of the Senior\nTutors spoke to us gravely in the Great\nHall about being adults or some such.\nDid that matter when the carnival-like\natmosphere of the Freshers\u2019 Fair hit me\nfull in the face? Of course not. My poor\nmailbox still bears the scars of the myriad clubs and societies I expressed \u201cinterest\u201d in without any intention of ever\nattending a single event. Note to certain\nsocieties: can you please, please sort out\nyour mailing list subscription cancellation procedure? Thanks.\nFun turned to horror at the first lecture when I realised that nothing made\nsense. Imperial has this habit and it\u2019s\ncome up in discussions with friends\nquite regularly: it doesn\u2019t matter how\nhigh a pedestal your school stood you\nup on because Imperial will kick it\ndown. And then kick you in the face.\nAnd then walk off. And run back to\nkick you some more. I actually went up\nto the Senior Tutor to ask her if I was\ndyslexic or suffering from some sort\nof learning disability because my hubris couldn\u2019t allow me to take in that,\nat University, you really needed to rediscover studying. Or at least, fake it. I\nthink she took pity on me and handed\nme a booklet about, you guessed it,\n\u201clearning how to learn\u201d. I would like to\nsay that turned out to be some sort of\nhallowed revelation with angelic trumpets playing softly, but it transpired\nthat pure and simple determination\nworks quite well too. Well, determination to not fail, at the very least.\nAround then, I also started to meet a\nlarge number of like-minded (an earth-shattering experience after being one\nof very few geeks at school) individuals\nwho continue to amuse, annoy, enthral,\nchallenge and support me to this very\nmoment. Every day, these encounters\ntook place with relentless regularity:\nI couldn\u2019t get over the fact that there\nwere so many new faces to process.\nThere\u2019s a close friend of mine whose\nname and number I asked for thrice on\nthe same day when we first met. Also, I\ndidn\u2019t even get his name right until after a week. Speaking of names, I took\nthis very good opportunity to shorten\nmy own when introducing myself. I got\nrather tired in Bangladesh when not a\nsingle person could get my name right,\nmangling it with either mispronunciation or simply couldn\u2019t get the ordering of letters right. I could reasonably\nargue that Imperial lead to new beginnings in more ways than one.\nThe year 2007 was pretty special\nbecause that\u2019s when I joined felix as\nGames Editor thanks to a glowing recommendation from the, no surprises\nhere, Games Editor of yesteryear. I\nwas initially contemplating whether\nI\u2019d have time to do something like that\ngiven that EEE has a reputation of all\nwork, no play. Suffice to say, it was a\ndecision I cherish every day. I had a\nblast in my position (and missed a\nbunch of lectures in the process), met\nsome incredible people (who are still\nin felix) and paved the way for my contribution to Imperial College; three of\nus banded together to create Another\nCastle which joined the lofty ranks of I,\nScience, Phoenix and The Rival as the\ngaming magazine of Imperial College.\nSure, it seems like I\u2019m approaching\nthis with the demeanour of the elderly\nand about to inscribe my memoirs, but\nI dare anyone to not dig deeper into\ntheir memories once they\u2019re at the end\nof University. The end. Now there\u2019s a\nfunny phrase. Perhaps it is just me. A\nfriend of mine had picked out some of\nmy traits and through a process of unceremonious typecasting and the use\nof some online psychological profiling,\nfound that I\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019s\nnot very good at dealing with closure.\nAt the time I heatedly disagreed with\nher but I couldn\u2019t really do that now.\nI\u2019ve always been proud of my writing\nability and any other time I\u2019d probably\nbe shaking my head at this childish attempt to squash in four years of, well,\nlife into this space. What I really mean\nto say is that I thank you all. From all\nthe academics I met in various departments (well, mostly Computing and\nElectrical Engineering), to the members of countless societies, to the lovely\npeople that have been part of felix and\nare still part of it, to the seemingly-disorganised yet well-meaning Union\nto all the irreplaceable friends and acquaintances I\u2019ve met over the years, to\nyou who actually gives a damn about a\nUniversity leaver\u2019s ramblings. I would\nname each and every one of you but I\ncan\u2019t take up the whole paper now, can\nI? This is the one time that the word\n\u2018epic\u2019 fails to capture the feeling but\nhere it is anyway: you\u2019ve all been epic.\nThank you for the memories.\nJonathan Woodcock has the last word on the positive discrimination debate\n\u201cIf Diane Abbott\nhad her way,\neveryone would be\ndefined by their\nrace or gender or\nsexual orientation\u201d\nlook for when choosing a leader?\nThe problem is that whilst racism,\nhomophobia and sexism exist, enforcing positive discrimination is to\nsubliminally imply that all people are\nracist, homophobic or sexist. This is\nabsolutely not the case and positive\ndiscrimination is just a disguise for a\ndeeper social evil than that which it\ntries to prevent.\n\n"
