    "content": "TTjE BfTJAQR\nOF\nCTjEftPSKHTE\nIt was a somewhat turbulent time in\nCheapskate\u2014a time of change and\nrenewal. For many of the citizens had\nfinished their examinations, and the\nrevellers of the previous night were\ntrying to sleep off the aftereffects\u2014if not\nthe memories. Yet their agony was\n\"matched, if somewhat differently, by\nthose citizens who were still working\naway. However, for some of the delights\nof freedom were being enjoyed by those\ncitizens who had been able to leave the\nkingdom. And there were those who it\nseemed would never leave\nAt the top of the Queen's Tower,\nsome of Cheapskate's more resilient\ncitizens were involved in a ceremony\nwhich was most indicative of the change\nand renewal\u2014and how futile and\nineffective it often was. For the\npretender to the swivelling throne, the\nheir apparent for so long, was about to\nachieve his final goal. Various citizens'\nrepresentatives stood, in a less magical\ncircle, watching the coronation of Ian\nBalls as Citizen's President. Dave\nParalytic and Eric Sloth, the page boys,\nstood behind the re splenda nt Balls\nholding the tail of his long, flowing and\nflea ridden gown. Mike Dress, who liked\nany excuse to put on a new frock and\nhave his picture taken, stood at their\nside. His recently purchased blonde wig\nsat less than firmly on his newly polished\nhead with its thin, wire y strands rustling\nin the wind. And, as ever, when they had\nBy\nJuvenal\nan opportunity to be out of their office.\nGormless Layon, the citizens' President.\nPristine\u2014the wicked witch of Southside\nand the incomprehensible Seanoff Levis\ncompleted the group.\nIt was with a tear in her eye that\nGormless began to read her lengthy\nspeech\u2014quantity rather than quality\nwas her speciality. However, fortunately\nfor those present, Gormless became\novercome with emotion, and gulping\nback a sob, she abandoned her speech\nand asked Pristine to pass the much\ntreasured symbol for a much abused\njob\u2014the President's crown. But to\nGormless' distress, Balls' patience had\nsuddenly come to an end. After waiting\nfor so long, after so many tedious\ncommittee meetings, sucking up to so\nmany of the Baron's seedy employees\nand having to put up with Gormless for\nnearly a year, a few seconds was simply\ntoo long to wait. In true, and indicative,\nNapoleonic style Balls grabbed the\ncrown and placed it firmly upon his head.\n\"That's it,\" cried Paralytic, who was\noverjoyed that the whole turgid business\nhad come to such a rapid conclusion.\n\"Southside everyone,\" he shouted. \"A special barrel of mead has been laid on at\nthe citizens' expense!\" Such a cry was\neven enough to wake Eric Sloth from the\nslumber into which he had inevitably\ndrifted and before you could say 'Jolly\nHockey Sticks' all the menfolk were\nhalfway down the stairs. Gormless and\nPristine stood to gg th j jr \u2014so suddenly\nalone. Gormless could no longer control\nher emotion and burst into a fit of tears.\nFor this was not how she had imagined\nthe event ending. Despite Balls' recent\ntruculence she had made a special\neffort\u2014an extra splash of perfume, or\ntwo, an ultra-tight pair of jeans that\ncaused her so much agony to put on and\neven her skin fitting jumper that she\nnormally reserved for her elections. But\nall these endeavours had been in\nvain \u2014now Balls was President\nGormless feared that she had nothing to\noffer\u2014well almost nothing. Pristine,\nrecognising Gormless' distress, offered\nher a word of advice from a very old\nhand:\n\"Don't worry Gormless. There's plenty more fish in the sea,\" she\nsuggested comfortingly.\n\"Well you should know\u2014you've had\nhalf of them,\" replied Gormless bitch i ly. And with her pride severely damaged\nGormless began to make her way back\nto the Citizens' Office on her own while\nPristine flew off to Southside.\nChange was afoot elsewhere in\nCheapskate that day. Leaning back in a most comfortable chair, with a 'cigarette' in one hand and a glass of\nsuitably chilled wine in the other, sat\nDave the Rave the new FALIX Editor.\nDespite being from the industrial\nhomelands, from which Cheapskate had\nbeen so unfortunate to receive Ian Balls,\nDave the Rave had contrived to change\nhis manner to that of a country\ngentleman who would like to be editing a somewhat more august journal than\nFALIX. However, reality had it\notherwise and Dave the Rave began to\ndiscuss his plans for the journal with one\nof his colleagues Huge Pigeon, who had\nreplaced him as the Citizens' Media\nRepresentative.\n\"\nI think I 'll introduce a society page,\"\nsaid Dave, thinking of all those nubile\n'Finding good staff these days is so difficult',mused Dave The R "

It's an\neven greater pity that our\n'President', who freely admits\nto being uninterested in\nanything outside the Union, is\nnot prepared to do anything\nabout this either. It's a total\njoke; she is unprepared to take a stand on matters outside or\ninside the Union, so what is she\nthere for? I totally agree with\nthe view that she is not a representative at all, but merely\nan administrator.\nYours, in vain hope that things\nmight improve next year,\nChristine Taig\nME1\nDear Editor\n1 would like to express my\ndisgust at the behaviour and\nattitudes of some members of\nthis Union. First of all, Steve\nBishop and Jim Boucher claim\n*that their bigoted demonstrations in the Union Bar are\nmerely 'friendly banter'. It is\nhorrifying to think that these\ntwo engineers, products of this\nso-called 'Centre of Excellence'\nhave' received a training here\nwhich will encourage them to\nperpetrate the same revolting\nattitudes against the minority of\nfemale professional engineers in\nindustry.\nI am disgusted that our Exec\nhave refused to discipline these\ntwo for this behaviour.\nFinally, I am disgusted at our\nPresident, Gaynor Lewis, who\napparently fails to see how\nserious this breach of discipline\nis\u2014in fact it seems safe to say\nthat she has done nothing\nwhatever to benefit female\nstudents during her term of\noffice.\nWhat we are talking about is\na vehement, personal attack on\nsome of our students, just\nbecause they are female, by an\nall-male group of bigots. While\nthere is one woman in this\nCollege who wishes to drink in\nthe Union Bar, she should be\nable to do so in the confidence\nthat she will not be personally\ninsulted.\nMoreover, while this behaviour is allowed to go\nunchecked by Union and\nCollege alike, I believe that it\nconstitutes an assault on all\nfemale students and staff.\nYours\nDiane Love\nPhysics PG\nDear Pallab\nWhilst not accepting the\nfactual accuracy of the article in\nthe last issue of FELIX, or in\nMiss Love's complaint; I would\nlike on behalf of the Links Club,\nand myself, to apologise for our\nbehaviour on Thursday if we\ncaused any offense to any\nperson present in the Bar.\nYours\nS Bishop\nLook\nalike\nSir\nHave any of your readers\nnoticed the extraordinary\nsimilarity between Ian Bull the\nPresident-elect and ET?\nI wonder if by any chance\nthey are related?\nYours sincerely\nMr S Spielburg\nAll in\nthe family\nDear Pallab\nWe the Counter Staff feel we\nhave a right of reply to your\nissue, Refectory, 8/6/94. Your\nappreciation of the hard work\nput in by management and staff\nin the kitchen is commendable,\nit has not always been so in the\npast.\nWe do however, feel your\ncriticism of Mr M Parsons,\nDeputy Manager to be unfair.\nHe is in fact held in high regard\nby many of his staff, who don't incidentally, come from the one\nfamily in Fulham.\nYours faithfully\nCelia De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nGloria De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nMaureen De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nKath De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nElizabeth De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nVera De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nMargaret De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nAnne De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nMarianee De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nRita De Lorenzo\nFulham SW6\nE.T. Outdoor\nsafety\nDear Pallab\nMr Vaca go's' Opinion'( FELIX676) is that members of\nRC C outdoor pursuits clubs\nshould be 'forced to gain\nexperience in a safe way'. Will\nthe forthcoming safety\nguidelines be the nature of this\nenforcement, and is the safe\nway positively to encourage the\ndecision 'no, not today' when\nconfronted with a seemingly\nun surmountable obstacle?\nWhilst I agree that an accurate\nrisk assessment should be made\nin such a situation, and its\nacceptability judged, Mr Vacago is suggesting that clubs\nadopt this almost defeatist\nattitude of his: 'If in doubt, turn\nback.'\nJust as physical endurance\nand fitness are increased by\nbuilding up the severity of the\nexercise and stretching the\nbody, so in the outdoors, sound\njudgement is best accumulated\nby making the effort to\novercome the obstacle. If it\nresults in failure, then the limits\nare known, but if success\nresults, then what was\npreviously not thought possible\nhas been achieved, and one's. own capabilities improved.\nUniversity-based outdoor\nclubs are often at the forefront\nof new exploration and\nadvance, and their established\nmembers have a high standard\nof technical expertise, much of\nwhich may well not have been\ngained if the decision to 'go for\nit' had not occasionally been\nmade.\nHe also suggests solo\nventures be discouraged.

    "content": "Benefits over the Summer\nUnlike the Christmas and Easter\nholidays, there is no element included\nin the student grant to cover\nmaintenance over the summer\nvacation and therefore if you are\nunable to get a job between July and\nOctober you will be eligible to 'sign\non' as unemployed in the area in\nwhich you are living.\nThere are three main types of\nbenefit: unemployment benefit,\nsupplementary benefit and housing\nbenefit.\nThey are not mutually exclusive\nand therefore it is possible to receive\ntwo or all three types of benefits\nsimultaneously (but only up to a maximum of approx \u00a327+ rent a week\nfor a single person).\n1. Unemployment Benefit\nTo be eligible for this you will have to\nhave paid or been credited with Class\n1 National Insurance contributions\non earnings of at least \u00a3 1,475 between\nApril 1982 and March 1983. This will\ngive you a basic rate of \u00a327 per week\nor a little less if you do not quite meet\nthe contribution conditions. You will\nautomatically be given the claim\nforms for unemployment benefit\nwhen you sign on (see 'How to Claim'\nbelow) but take your P45 and a note\nof your National Insurance number\nwith you.\n2. Supplementary Benefit\nOriginally conceived as a 'safety net'\nfor those unable to meet the\ncontribution conditions for\nunemployment benefit but now\nprovides the principal source of\nincome for a large proportion of the\ncountry's unemployed including\nmost student claimants. Eligibility is\nprimarily dependent on the\nclaimant's ability to sign on as\navailable for work in the area in\nwhich they are living. There are two\nrates of benefit: householder and\nnon-householder. 'Householder'\nimplies someone who is individually\nresponsible for all household\nexpenses but even if you share a flat or\nhouse with others but have your own\nroom, meters, etc. it may be possible\nto argue that you are maintaining a separate household. If you think you\nhave been incorrectly classified you\ncan appeal (see below). The basic\nrates for Supplementary Benefit are:\nhouseholder \u00a3 2 6 . 8 0 ; non-householder \u00a321.45.\nHow to Claim Unemployment or\nSupplementary Benefit\nOn the first weekday of the vacation\ngo down to your local unemployment\nbenefit office (addresses in the phone\nbook) and sign on as available for\nwork. They will tell you any future\narrangements for signing on, get you\nto fill in a number of forms and give\nyou a Bl claim form which should be\ntaken or sent to the local\nSupplementary Benefit Office. You\nmay be called for an interview by this\noffice and you will need to take with\nyou proof of identity, recent bank\n\u2022 statements and your rent\nbook/tenancy agreement/letter from\nyour landlord (Student Services if in\nIn these days when money is tight and the DHSS\nis even tighter you need to know all you can\nabout your entitlements if you're not going to get\nscrewed. In this article Student Services Welfare\nAdviser Karen Stott explains the ins and outs of\nthe benefits game.\nCollege accommodation).\nAnyone receiving supple men a try benefit is entitled to free NHS dental\ntreatment, glasses and prescriptions.\nSo if you think you might be needing\nany of them ask about claiming whilst\nyou are at the DHSS office.\n3. Housing Benefit\nResponsibility for meeting housing\ncosts now lies with local housing\nauthorities. There are three types of\nbenefits:\na) Certified Housing Benefit\u2014 for\nthose receiving supplementary\nbenefit and so called because\neligibility is dependent on receipt of a certificate of entitlement from the\nDHSS. Under this benefit you may\nreceive 1\n0\n0\n% of your housing costs.\nb) Standard Housing Benefitanyone can apply. The basic rebate is\n60% of your rent and rates on weekly\nearnings of around \u00a360 for a single\nperson with additions or deductions if\nyour income is above or below that\nlevel.\nc) Housing Benefit Supplement- an\naddition to standard housing benefit\nfor those who apply but narrowly\nmiss qualifying for supplementary\nbenefit on income grounds.\nStudents can apply for housing\nbenefit in term time and vacations\nalthough term time eligibility is\nlimited. During the summer your\nentitlement will depend on your\ncircumstances. If you are\nunemployed and receiving\nsupplementary or unemployment\nbenefit, you should get 90-100% of\nyour housing costs back through\ncertificated housing benefit or\nthrough standard housing benefit and\nhousing benefit supplement. If you\nare working, you may still be able to\nclaim some money back, depending\non your income, through standard\nhousing benefit. Since standard\nhousing benefit can be paid during\ntemporary absences from your\nnormal 'home' you may also be able\nto get some help if you have to pay a retainer on your term time\naccommodation over the summer but\nyou will need to convince the housing\nauthority that your term time address\nis in fact your 'home'.\nHow to Claim Housing Benefit\nIf you are claiming Unemployment or\nSupplementary Benefit then all you\nneed to do is to make it clear to the\npeople dealing with your claim that\nyou wish to claim Housing Benefit.\nThey should then send you all the\nappropriate forms to be completed\nand returned to your local housing\nauthority.\nFor standard housing benefit call\ninto the local housing authority office\n(usually based in the Town Hall) for\nthe area in which you are paying rent,\nor for boroughs around College,\ncome into Student Services and\ncollect a housing benefit application\nform. Your claim will be dated from\nthe day on which your completed\nforms are received by your local\nhousing office and you will need to\nsubmit proof of your rent and proof\nof your income with the application.\nNearest Benefit Offices for College Residences\nEvelyn Gdns, Earls Court Sq, Fremantle Hotel and Cale St\nUnemployment Benefit Wyfold Rd, Fulham SW6 385 2241\nSupplementary Benefit Waterford Hse, Waterford Rd, SW6 736 3399\nHousing Benefit Kensington & Chelsea Town Hall, 937 5464\nHornton St, W8\nHalls of Residence\nUnemployment Benefit\nSupplementary Benefit\nHousing Benefit\nsame as Evelyn Gdns\nSame as Evelyn Gdns\nWestminster City Hall, 83 Victoria\nSt, SW1\n828 8070\nHamlet Gdns & Sinclar Gdns\nUnemployment Benefit 200 Shepherds Bush Rd, W6 603 3456\nSupplementary Benefit Charles Hse, 375 Ken High St, W14 603 4633\nHousing Benefit Hammersmith & Fulham Housing 748 3020\nCentre, 77 Glenthorne Rd, W6\nLexham Gdns\nUnemployment Benefit\nSupplementary Benefit\nHousing Benefit\nSame as Hamlet Gdns\nSame as Hamlet Gdns\nSame as Evelyn Gdns\nFOR THOSE NOT LIVING IN COLLEGE ACCOMMODATION: You can\n'sign on' at any Unemployment Benefit Office (addresses in the phone book\nunder 'Employment Offices') and they should be able to tell you which is your\nappropriate DHSS and Housing Benefit offices. Alternatively, Student Services\nhas a list of the offices relevant to each London postal district.\nThe housing authority do have the\npower to reduce the amount they pay\nif they consider your rent to be\nexcessively high. If you think they\nhave used this power unreasonably\nyou can appeal (see be lov v). If you are\ntrying to use standard housing benefit\nto reclaim money that you have to\npay as a retainer on your term time\naccommodation, then you must\nsubmit a claim to the relevant housing\nauthority in London.\nSome points to note with claiming\nbenefits\nHolidays: Housing Benefit can be\npaid during temporary absences but\nyou should let the housing benefit\noffice know your plans. For\nunemployment/ supplementary\nbenefit you can complete a holiday\nform which will allow you up to\nsixteen days away within the British\nIsles without losing benefit but you\nmust sign on again as soon as you\nreturn. If you go on holiday abroad\nyou will not be entitled to any benefit\nwhilst you are out of the country and\nyou must start a completely new\nclaim as soon as you return.\nCo-ha biting: When an unmarried\ncouple-live together as husband and\nwife they are treated as a married\ncouple for benefit purposes. The\nofficial reason for this regulation is to\nbe fair to married couples, but since a married couple receive considerably\nless benefit than two single people it is\neasy to see another reason for the\npersistence with which this regulation\nis followed up. If you are classified as\nco-ha biting only one of you will be\nallowed to make a claim with the\nother person being treated as your\ndependent. To avoid being classed as\na couple you will have to prove that\nthe two of you live totally\nindependently as regards rent and\nother bills, and you will usually need\nto prove you have your own rooms. If\nyou feel you have been unjustly\nclassified then appeal (see below).\nAppeals: Ifyoufeel your benefit has\nbeen incorrectly or unfairly assessed\ndon't be afraid to appeal. With both\nsupplementary and housing benefit\nyou have the right to appeal to a supplementary benefit tribunal or\nlocal authority review board\nwhichever is appropriate. However,\ndelay in asking for a review could\ncause you to lose your right to appeal.\nSo if you are unsure about your\nbenefit write to the relevant authority\nas early as possible asking for a full\nbreakdown and indicating your\nintention to appeal if necessary. If\nyou want to know more about the\nappeals procedure. Student Services\ncan give you an outline of what\nhappens and represent you at a tribunal or review board if you so\nwish. We can also help you check\nyour assessment to see if an error has\nbeen made and help with chasing up\nunpaid benefits. Just call into the\nStudent Services Office, 1\n5 Princes\nGardens, any weekday between\n9:30am and 5:30pm or call us on 589\n5111 ext 2033.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\n\n"

The first issue, in the summer\nvacation, severely criticised Michael Arthur,\nStudent Services Officer, for overbooking of\nthe Summer Lettings Scheme and alleged\nmismanagement. However the scheme was a financial success.\nAlso in the first issue, the censorship of\nboth the Handbook and the Rag Mag by\nGaynor Lewis and Christine Teller was\nrevealed. In the fresher s issue of FELIX the\ncensored jokes and editorial comment were\npublished.\nLondon Student Travel was told to leave its\noffice on the walkway during the summer\nafter it was discovered the company was not\npaying any rent for the premises. The former\ntravel shop was later re-opened by the Union\nas a regalia shop, misleading ly named the\n'Sports Shop'. After extensive negotiations a new travel office has recently opened in the\nJCR operated by ST A. Faulty Fremantle\nResidence issues were again at the fore with\nthe long running Fremantle Hotel saga.\nAndrew Walker, the Fremantle Warden,\nresigned in November in mysterious\ncircumstances. The real reason for him being\nasked to resign has never been revealed but it\nis widely believed that there were complaints\nfrom residents about the way he performed\nhis duties as Warden. A great deal of\nanimosity between Mr Walker and Michael\nArthur, amongst others, became apparent\nduring the row over the resignation. The\nsituation was further complicated by the\nstructural problems being experienced in the\nFremantle, with allegations being published\nin FELIX that Mr Arthur was to blame for\nthe situation.\nThe appointment of Mr Walker's successor\nwas also controversial, the post being filled\nwithout it being advertised. Despite the\ncontinuing structural problems the\nFremantle is being kept for another year\nduring which time the landlords are unlikely\nto make improvements to the property since\nthe property is likely to be completely gutted\nand rebuilt once the College's lease has\nexpired.\nRag Week in November was also highly\nsuccessful, although a planned mini Rag\nWeek in March was something of a non-event.\nThe Rag Fete this term was a considerable\nsuccess with a record amount being raised,\nlargely from students paying to climb up the\nQueen's Tower.\nA Rag raid by UCL students in February\nleft a trail of damage in the Chem Eng\ndepartment after a lecture was dist rup ted with flour and eggs being thrown. Twentytwo of the Guilds Union shields in the Mech\nEng foyer were stolen, but later returned.\nUCL agreed to foot the bill for damage\ncaused.\nUnion President Gaynor Lewis having\nher name taken during Tiddlywinks.\nRag raises the roof\nRag had a good start to the year with a record\namount being raised in the annual\nTiddlewinks event, this year back on Oxford\nStret after being held on Kings Road last year.\nThe anti-pornography campaign led by\nMichael Newman has continued throughout\nthe year. A motion banning porn events on\nUnion premises was successfully defeated by\nMines Union officers at the Freshers' U GM, but it was passed at a subsequent meeting. In\norder to be able to hold their annual Mines\nRevue, which includes a strip show, R SMU introduced a motion at the third U GM which\nspecifically allowed any type of event to be\norganised by CCUs. Undaunted by the\nsetback Mr Newman tried contacting several\nnational newspapers, a move which resulted\nin a story in the Daily Express concerning\nmm ga mm* mi\nAn IC Student cops it as part of a Rag fund raising event at Covent Garden\n\n"

Then there was Runequest;\nI A Now FELIX brings you an adventure on more familiar ground in...\nip ij one que tft Iii \u00bb\nif TT Ii it Here is a factual role-playing game for all those\nTrolls, Goblins, Elves and Hobbits who are fed\nup with the fantasy world and want to try living\nthe life of an everyday IC student.\nIf you have never played this type of game before, all you need\nis two dice, a pencil and a bit of common sense. On the\nother hand, if you are a seasoned adventurer, you will welcome\nthe opportunity to pit your wits against FELIX Editor-elect David\nRbwe, Gaynor Lewis, John Smith, the NatWest service till and\nmany other 'monsters'!\nRead only the numbered paragraphs you are sent to in the\ntext\u2014reading any others could spoil the adventure. Begin by\ndetermining your intelligence and constitution.\nIntelligence. Roll 1 die and add six to the score. This number is\nyour intelligence. The higher your intelligence, the better you\nwill fare in Battles.\n\u00bb \u2022 \u00bb\nConstitution. Roll 2 dice and add 12. This gives your\nconstitution; a high score enables you to resist attack in Battles.\nIf your constitution is reduced to zero, you become\nincapacitated and you are out of the game. You may increase\nyour constitution by eating and drinking certain things.\nHowever, you can never increase it beyond its initial value.\nCombat. You are frequently asked to 'do battle' with adversaries,\nand you are given their Intelligence and Constitution. First, roll\ntwo dice and add your intelligence. Then do the same for the\n'monster'. If your score is higher, deduct two from the\n'monster's' constitution. If the monster scores higher, deduct\ntwo points from your own. If both scores are equal, deduct two\npoints from yourself and the monster. Repeat this round until\none constitution has been reduced to zero\u2014this is the loser. You\nmay be asked to do 'one round of battle', in which case you do\nnot fight to the death'.\nTo Start\nWrite down your Intelligence and Constitution in the boxes.\nAlso write down your equipment. Atthe moment, all you have is\na plastic Waitrose carrier bag\u2014if you find anything on the way,\nput it in the bag and note it down. Write down the money you\nhave\u2014at the moment all you have is your Servicetill card. If\nyour reach the Servicetill, you can try to get \u00a350, a cheque book and a statement. If you hear of any scandal about anyone, write\ndown their name in the 'Scandal' box.\nNow you are ready to start. What is your quest? Look at\nparagraph 1 to find out. Good luck!\nIntelligence: Money:\nConstitution:\nMoney:\nEquipment: Scandal:\nYour quest is a simple one; you are an\nordinary student at IC and all you want\nis a phone. Of course, in order to obtain\na phone, you will need a room in Hall.\nYou will probably need some money\ntoo. Arriving at South Kensington tube,\nyou go northwards up the tunnel. When\nyou come out, do you go east to\nStudent Services 23 or west to the\nServicetill 53?\nYou fight:\nJohn Smith\nIntelligence 10\nConstitution 8\nIf you lose, go to 51. If you win, goto 16.\nYou have selected the most delicious\nand nutritious part of the meal! Your\nconstitution is restored to its initial\nvalue, and* you stride out of the\nrefectory with renewed vigour. Go to\n49.\nCongratulations! You have your\nSouthside Room. As you return to the\nwalkway, you cannot contain your joy.\nSuddenly you see a strange figure\nsome wav off. He ao pears to be yelling\nand leaping about. Do you run away 33\n(lose 1 constitution point) or go and\nmeet him 41?\nThe people at the RCA won't serve you\nbecause you are 'obviously an IC\nstudent'. This indictment of your\nappearance is such a blow to your ego\nthat you immediately lose 2\nconstitution points. Will you go to\nSherfield 44 or do without 25?\nYou sit down at a table which has an\nattractive mosaic. On closer inspection\nyou notice it is in fact deeply ingrained\nwith cigarette ash, tomato ketchup and\ngreen mould. Do you eat the soggy\nchips 14, the battered mince beef roll\n20, the greyish viscous gray 29 or the\nplate 3?\nYou knock on Gaynor's door and enter\nher office. She asks you to sit down.\nWhen she discovers that you want a telephone, she refuses, explaining that\nthere just aren't enough to go round,\nand that she d aren't upset John Smith.\nIf you know any scandal about Gaynor,\nyou may try to blackmail her 24.\nOtherwise you must do battle with her\n28 or try asking her back to your place\n11.\n8\nJohn Smith remains silent when you\nhint at the information you have on\nhim. You are terrified, but dare not\nshow any sign of weakness. Go to 16.\nYou tell Dave that you know all about\nhis 'Hotel high jinks'. He turns ashen-faced and tight-lipped, and invites you\nto the upstairs office. He tells you all\nthe sordid details you need to know\nand gives you the FELIX Editor's pewter tankard on condition that you\ntell no one about his activities. You\nagree and leave 36.\n10\nThere is a loud crack and an enormous\nblue flash. You are thrown to the floor\nby a nasty electric shock. Lose 2\nconstitution points. Storm back to\nStudent Services and complain 46.\n11\nGaynor agrees to your in vitiation \u2014lose\n1 intelligence point for asking her.\nThrow one die. If you throw a six,\nGaynor enjoys your company and\nagrees to talk to Jen on your behalf.\nShe suggests that you see Jen yourself\n39.\nIf you throw 1-5, Gaynor is very\ndisappointed with your performance.\nHer tears upset you so much that you\nlose 1 point of constitution. The\nfollowing morning you decide to go\nand see Jen 39.\n12\nTo get your cheque book, you must do\nanother round of battle with the\nServicetill. If you lose, repeat this\nround, or try thumping it 31. If you win,\ntry to get a statement 27 or try\nthumping it 31.\n13\nYou go home to your room and\nimmediately fall asleep, exhausted\nafter the day's activities. At 2:00am the\nfire alarm goes off for 30 seconds. Roll\none die. Unless you score a six, lose 1\npoint of constitution. This happens\nagain at 5:00am and 8:00am. Each time\nthrow a die and deduct 1 point unless\nyou throw a six.\nWhen you wake up, you find that\nEstates, with alarming speed, have\npainted water-soluble double yellow\nlines around your bed instead of\ninstalling a phone. Go to Estates and\ncomplain. 40.\n14\nYou are violently ill and lose 4\nconstitution points.

    "content": "BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\nOn 31 May, subsequent to advertisements\nappearing externally in the national press,\nstaff in Sherfield were notified that the\nCollege intends to appoint a Chief\nAccountant. In making this appointment, not\none of the officers in the Finance department\nwas consulted. Imposed decisions, whether\nmade by muddled managers, mysterious\nmasons or ma fios i, will always cause\ndiscontent since they automatically devalue\nthose most closely affected by the decision.\nResponsibility for the secrecy and non-involvement of the present staff can be firmly\nlaid at the feet of John Smith. On 30 April he\nheld a meeting of all administrative officers\nostensibly to brief them on major\ndevelopments within administration.\nAlthough a decision had been previously\nmade to make the appointment and\narrangements were in hand to advertise\nexternally, no mention of the appointment\nwas made at the meeting. Surely this was an\nact of monumental bad faith.\nWhy did John Smith need to keep the\nappointment secret? The only interpretation\nmust be that he has something to hide.\nPerhaps he considers the position to be a sinecure and intends bringing in a friend or\nanother ex-colonial service duffer.\nHad Mr Smith or Mr Lloyd-Davies asked\nthe officers in Finance they would have\ndiscovered a consensus that this\nappointment is irrelevant to the needs of the\ndepartment. There is also a consensus that\nthe list of main duties compiled for the new\npost is nonsense and that it will totally\nmislead any outsider applying for the job.\nThis latest crassness is not a one-off\nexhibition. Shortly after John Smith joined\nthe College the previous Chief Accountant\nretired and an attempt was made to replace\nhim with a young man who once worked in\nthe Finance department. On that occasion\nthe appointment was , seen to be a catastrophe and there was a revolt on Level 4\nculminating in a petition against the\nappointment. It is believed the College had to\npay a considerable sum in compensation\nwhen they withdrew the offer of employment.\nJohn Smith has paid lip service to the\nprovision of management information. Why\ndoes he not use the opportunity afforded by\nthe retirement of Fred Hollingshead and\nHelen Hartley to organise Finance in a modern manner by creating separate\nfinancial and management accounting\nstructures within the department?\nUnfortunately the choice of Chief\nAccountant as a title shows the anachronistic\nand old-fashioned thinking which is in\noperation. A quick review of Accountancy\nAge will reveal that organisations living in this\ncentury do not use this title any more.\nIncreasingly it seems that the use of the\nword 'management' in relation to anything\nthat happens in Sherfield must be considered\neuphemistic.\nIn support of the above statement it is\npossible to point out the manner in which\nJohn Smith has failed to press u rise Estates\nand Refectories into adopting an efficient\nmanagerial approach. For example, Victor\nMooney has been forced to relinquish\ncontrol of the Union refectory but John\nSmith should have compelled him to run it\nproperly in the first place. Excuses which\nVictor Mooney makes about the design of\nthe outlet and the consequent inadequate\ncatering are only excuses and do not explain\nhis own inertia in trying to meet student\ndemands.\nThe Estates section has its own style, its\nhead, Don Clark, is so busy that he has\ndivested himself of his major responsibilities.\nHe is so busy that he will be able to attend\nReading University part-time to read for a business degree. He is so busy that, after an\nabsence of many months, he has been able to\nattend the last two refectory committee\nmeetings. Who is kidding who?\nIn as far as John Smith has any discern able management style at all, on current\nperformance it appears as a cross between a Feydeau farce and a Grand Guignol offering.\nIt is ironic aP that even now the wealth of-knowledge and experience available within\nthe department has been ignored in the\nprocess of formulating future policy. As\nthings stand the appointment of a Chief\nAccountant is deemed by many officers in\nthe Finance department to be unnecessary\nand it could turn out to be yet another very\nexpensive mistake.\nLook\nAlike\nSir\nHave any of your readers\nnoticed the resemblance of our\nIrish Hon Sec Sean Davis and a potato?\nI wonder if by any chance\nthey are related?\nYours sincerely\nMr KP Crisp\nA. Potato Sean Davis\nJames Chalmers Senior Assistant\nCollege Secretary\u2014formerly a member of\nthe Colonial Office working in Malaya, James\nChalmers has been with IC for over twenty\nyears. He began in Personnel, rising to the\npost of Personnel Officer; he was promoted\nin 1982 to his current position in\nAdministration. His demean our is one of\nunhurried confusion, he has an undeniable\ngift in his ability to muddy the clearest pool.\nHis policy in dealing with any problem is to\ntake the issue to a cool dark cellar and to\nleave it to mature for four or five years. He\nwill, of course check the problem at\nrespectable intervals to remove dust and\nmould. He is often able to surprise John\nSmith by the way he insists on allowing\nnothing to interfere with this rule. As James\nwill always tell the interested connoisseur\nthat many of his very best problems would\ncost the College several thousand pounds if\nthey had to be solved now. But there is\nalways the possibility that they have been\nsolved too soon and that the price could have\ni increased. However I feel that such a 'development is highly unlikely.\n' His technique in choosing a problem to\ndeal with is quite exceptional. He removes a sheaf of papers from the random pile in his\n! filing cabinet (or cellar as he likes to call it)\nand lingers over the date, 1974, '76 and '78\nbeing especially fine years. The yellowing\nsheet is passed in front of light so that signs of\n; mould or mouse excrement are visible, then\nthe bouquet of crystallised gin and damp\nmould is inhaled. If selected it then joins one\n| of the 14 piles that border his desk,\ni Many people consider that such skill is\nI merely the worst aspect of an old duffer put\n'out to pasture, amiably blundering with no\n'great effort towards retirement. But to raise\nthis base role to such an art is an\nachievement that leaves people like Jen\nHardy-Smith speechless with admiration.\nThe Mole\n\n"

    "content": "Three hours later, Gormless was still in\nthe Baron's office. Pristine had been arguing\nwith John Secretary-for over an hour and the\nBaron was already fast asleep. Gormless had\nlong since tired of trying to get a word in\nedgeways and was beginning to feel drowsy.\nSuddenly she was startled by a large white\nrabbit dressed in a checked shirt and faded\njeans who ran into the room muttering \"Eh,\nbah gum, ge zun d he it electronic cash register\nboo le ry wool e ry fat fryer disposables\nHandbook articles Baron's committee, I'm late, oh dear, I'm late.\"\nIt looked just like J Martin Boolery\nWoolery, the FALIX News Editor, but had\ntwo large rabbit ears and whiskers.\n\"He's not allowed on this committee!\"\nscreeched Gormless, and immediately leapt\nfrom her seat and dashed after him.\nUnfortunately she failed to notice two of the\nBaron's artisans who had lifted some of the\nfloorboards and were gazing forlornly into a large hole in the floor. Before she could stop,\nshe had fallen in.\nHer fall was cut short when she came to a gentle landing on something soft and furry.\nShe stood up and looked around\u2014she was in\na dimly-lit cellar with mould growing on the\nceiling.\nThere was a squeak from her feet. She\nlooked down, and then jumped back in\nalarm. It was an enormous furry rat with\nglasses and a big twitch y nose.\n\"Are you Gormless? Oh this is so exciting!\nI'm Jonathan Clockwork Ratperson,\" he\npointed to a large key in his side.\n\"Pleased to meet you I'm sure,\" replied\nGormless, remembering her manners. She\nheld out her hand and shook her new rodent\nfriend by his ample nose.\n\"Could you please tell me where I am?\"\nasked Gormless.\n\"This is John Secretary's rat infested\ndungeon of course!\" replied Ratperson.\n\"How curious! I 've never been down here\nbefore. Thank you very much for breaking\nmy fall, by the way.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry for not being softer,\" said\nRatperson, eager to apologise. \"Come and\nmeet my friend.\" He pointed to an enormous\nrevolving cage on the other side of the\ndungeon.\nless ii|\nInside the cage a large dishevelled rat sat\ncrying its eyes out. The rat bore a strong\nresemblance to Michael Newperson. \"Oh\ndear, don't cry, what's the matter with you?\"\nasked Gormless sympathetically.\n\"Oh, my tale is a long and sad one, but I 'll\ntell it to you anyway,\" he wailed. Looking at\nhis tail, she thought it was rather long, but\ncouldn't see anything sad about it. She\nthought about it for so long that the Rat's story appeared rather like this:\nMichael P Newman was\nbanned from\nthe Union for\ntrying to\nstop what\nhe thought\nwas not right.\nHe said girls\nwere degraded\nwhen nudes were\nparaded in rude\npublications and\non Mines Porn\nnight. \"I 'll be\njudge, I 'll\nbe jury,\"\nscreeched\nGaynor in\nfury, \"I 'll\ntry the\nwhole case\nand I 'll\nban you,\nyou dog!\"\nNow he's IC's disgrace\nand he\ncan't show\nhis face\nso he\njust sits\nat home\njerking\noff in\nthe\nbog.\nGormless was rather perturbed about the\nstrong resemblance the obviously fictitious\ntale bore to real life. In typical fashion,\nhowever, she washed her hands of the poor\nrat's problem and went on her way.\nSoon Gormless found herself outside\nblinking in the sunlight in a beautiful garden.\n\" AHEM!\" A loud and familiar cough made her look\nbehind her. She was astonished to see an\nenormous magic mushroom with a six-foot\ncaterpillar sitting on top of it, smoking a rather suspicious-looking hookah.\n\"And who are you, little girl?\"\n\"Please sir, I'm Gormless.\"\n\"I can see that,\" drawled the Caterpillar,\ncrossing and un crossing his eyes and legs\nand yawning.\n\"Hmmm, you must be good for something.\nCan you recite poetry? Recite 'You are old,\nMr Munchey' for me.\nGormless began.\nBLUNDERland\nou are old, Mr Mooney,\" the Wicked Witch said,\n\"And your hair has become flecked with white,\nYet when posing for photos, you stand on your head;\nDo you think at your age it is right?\"\n\"In my youth,\" Mr Mooney replied to the Witch,\n\"I stood on my head all the time.\nI did so, what's more, without getting a stitch,\nSo be off, or I 'll boil you in brine!\"\n\"You are old,\" she went on. \" As I 've already said,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat.\nAnd yet you maintain we are properly fed,\nPray, how do you justify that?\"\n\"In my youth,\" he replied, \"I kept myself trim\nChasing girls and avoiding my wife.\nAnd now, as you see, I'm no longer so slim,\nBut that's usual at this time of life!\"\n\"You are old, Mr Mooney,\" the Wicked Witch cackled,\n\" And soon you'll be going for good.\nYet still you keep hush about money when tackled,\nDon't you think it's a little bit rude?\"\n\"In my youth,\" Mr Mooney replied to the hag,\n\"I kept the books perfectly well!\nSo keep your nose out, you impertinent bag!\nMy books will cook with me in hell!\nAll the time she was reciting, she grew\nmore and more aware that the Caterpillar\nwas very like the Baron and this made her\nconfused.'\n\"I'm afraid I got some of the names wrong,\"\nshe said nervously.\n\"It was wrong from beginning to end,\" the\nCaterpillar pronounced. \"What can I do for\nyour1 back into the Surefield\n\"I'd like to get\nBuilding please.\"\n\"Have a bit of this mushroom, then. It will\ngive you anything you want.\"\nGormless timidly broke a bit off the\nmushroom and nibbled it. ,\nSuddenly her head exploded and she felt\nas if she was flying in all directions at once.\nWhen she got back to normal again, she was\nonce more in the familiar corridors of power.\nUnfortunately, however she was quite lost,\nand getting more and more confused all the\ntime.\nShe wandered this way and that for a good\nten minutes before she found an office she\nrecognised. There were two signs on the\ndoor. One said:\n'The office of Tweedledong Lark', and the\nother:\n'Tweedleheadbang Cameroon-Lark's Office'.\n\"How curious!\" she declared. Confident\nshe would be dealing with two complete\nidiots, she strode into the room without even\nknocking. And there they were, drinking tea\nand bickering as usual.\n\"It was my nice, new T SQUARE!\"\nscreamed Tweedleheadbang.\n\"And you broke it!\"\n\"I never did!\" shrieked Tweedledong. They\nwere just about to come to blows when they\nboth noticed Gormless and rather sheepishly\nsat down again.\n\"What can we do for you, Gormless?\" they\nchorused.\n\"Oh, I just popped over for a word about\nthe Citizens' Residences,\" she lied hastily.\n\"Sit down, dear,\" Tweedleheadbang\nfetched her a comfy chair while Tweedledong\ngave her a cup of tea.\nAnd then, without more ado, they stood\nside by side in the middle of the room and\nbegan their report: ^^^^^^^^gt t^k The Sun was shining in the sky,\nShining with all his might.\nHe tried his very best to make\nThe tiles look smooth and bright.\nBut this was hard for most of them\nHad dropped off in the night.\nThe Painter and the Carpenter\nHad walked for many miles.\nThey cursed like anything to see\nSuch quantities of tiles.\n\"If only they could be replaced,\"\nThey said, \"We'd be all smiles.\"\n\"Ten thousand tons of scaffolding\nWere hired for seven years.\n\" Do you suppose,\" the Painter said\n\"We'll end up in arrears?\"\n\"I'm sure,\" replied the Carpenter. \u2022\nHis eyes were full of tears.\n\"Oh Freshers, come and live in Hall,'\nThe Painter shouted out.\n\" A lovely single Southside room\nIs great to boast about.\nDon't fret about the fire alarms,\nWe'll fix them soon, no doubt!\"\nThe FELIX Editor looked at him\nAnd scribbled something down;\nThe FELIX Editor shook his head\nAnd frowned a thoughtful frown,\nMeaning to say, he plainly thought\nThe Painter was a clown.\nBut four young fresher s hurried up\nAll eager for a place;\nEach so determined to be the first\nIt soon turned to a race.\nThey pushed and fought and kicked\nand shoved\u2014\nSweat poured from every face.\nFour other fresher s followed them,\nAnd yet another four.\nAnd thick and fast they came at last,\nAnd more and more and more.\nSoon most of them were cut and bruised\nAnd all of them were sore.\nThe Painter and the Carpenter\nWalked miles, I 've heard them tell,\nUntil they reached the derelict old\nFremantle Hotel.\nAnd all the little fresher s stopped\nAnd one rang on the bell.\n\"The time has come,\" the Painter said,\n\"To stop and have a nap.\nAnd talk of roofs and leaks and damp,\nAnd how to mend a tap.\nAnd why the rent here is so high\nWhen all agree it's crap.\"\n\"But wait a bit,\" the fresher s squeaked.\nTurning a little grey,\n\"We can't move in to this old dump,\nNo matter what you say!\"\n\"The sun's come out,\" the Painter said,\n\"Oh, what a lovely day!\"\n\"It seems a shame,\" the Painter said,\n\"To play them such a trick,\nAfter we brought them out so far\nAnd made them trot so quick\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\n\" ;\n\u2022 d) \u2022.: the; ie th\nWhile they were talking, Gormless had\nwandered over to the window and seen some\nsort of sherry party going on in the garden\nbelow. At last, something normal and\nreassuring after all those confusing\nadventures! As soon as they had finished, she\nthanked them hurriedly and ran out and\ndown the stairs.\nSoon she was back in the garden, and\nthere she saw the strangest group of people\nshe had seen that day. Somebody who could\nhave been Pissmore's twin brother, but wore\na top hat, and another big rabbit who was\nsimilar to Sawn Off were both trying to stuff a hippo into a teapot. Around them lay the\nremains of a picnic, but there was still a half-full bottle of sherry left. Gormless licked her\nlips.\n\"Oi! And who might you be, to be sure?\"\nthe Pissmore lookalike shouted belligerently.\n\"I'm Gormless,\" she replied.\n\"Begorrah, you'll be all roi gh t with us then!\nOi'm the Mad Oirish Bookie, dis is the Mad\nOirish March Hare and dt s\" he poked the\nhippo, \"is the hippo. WAKE UP YOU STUPID\nCOW!!\" he bellowed in the hippo's ear.\n\"Please, Mr Bookie, I'm ever so thirsty.\"\n\"Get some o' the hard stuff down your\nthroat,\" he said, offering her some sherry.\nGormless helped herself greedily.\nBut something was wrong.\nShe was giddy.\nEverything was spinning round.\nAnd suddenly, Gaynor woke up.\nShe was in her office, being shaken by\nSean, Jo Claydon and John Passmore, who\nwere shouting,\n\" WAKE UP, YOU STUPID COW!\" \"Get some more sherry down her throat.\nThat should wake her up!\" said Jen.\n\"Oh, Jen,\" Gaynor said, \"I 've had such a nasty dream that I was in a cruel land called\nCheapskate where Christine was a witch,\nyou ran the office and Ian ignored me all the\ntime.\"\n\"Oh but darling\u2014you are!\"\n\n"

    "content": "SPORTS REVIEW\nICclubs strong as ever\nAs another year draws to a close\nthe time has come to look back\nand reflect upon the achi ev ment s of yet another outstanding\nsporting year.\nThis year has been significant\nfor our affiliation to U AU and\nsubsequent brilliant performances by the Vollebyall, Water\nPolo and Hanging Gliding teams\nto carry off their respective\ntrophies.\nFirst a mention for the Water\nPolo Club. Back in December\nthey got through to the U AU national final by winning the very\nclosely contested Southern\nUniversities Championship.\nThey went on to clinch the\nnational trophy in a dramatic\ndeciding game against Loughborough with two goals inside the\nfinal minute.\nThe Volleyball team also had\nsimilar success, winning their\nU AU final 3-2 against\nBirmingham.\nLadies Rugbv-a pushover\nDuring the same week the\nHang Gliding Club went to\nSwansea to compete in the first\ninter-university hang gliding\ncompetition. They came back\nimpressive victors, having beaten\nPlymouth and Manchester Polys\ninto second and third places\nrespectively.\nA special mention must go to\nthe Basketball Club who before\nthis year had not won a game for\na season and a half. Under the\nBreaking roofing tiles\ninspired leadership of Tim Vink\nthey went on to put all of this\nbehind them by winning the\nLondon Colleges League, only\nlosing one game in the process.\nThe Boat Club continued to\nuphold its brilliant reputation\nwith notable performances at all\nlevels. The best performance\nprobably came from the first\neight in the Head of the River race\nwhere they came ninth overall.\nThis was the best performance by\na college side since the 1960s. The Sailing Club have also\nproduced some consistent\nperformances throughout the\nyear. In February they regained\nthe Castaways Cup beating QMC\nin the final and thus avenging last\nyear's defeat.\nThe Judo Club excelled again\nthis year with the men's team\nwinning the annual intercollegiate competition for the\nthird year t running and the ladies\ncoming third in their event.\nTurning to athletics, the 36th running of the Hyde Park Relay\nwas again a great success despite\nthe bad conditions with\nLoughborough and WLIHE\nretaining the men's and ladies'\n' trophies respectively. In the ULU\nTrack and Field Championships\nthere were several notable\nperformances by Imperial\nwith Karate Club\nathletes. In particular, there were\ntriumphs from Thales Kasagonnis\nin the pole vault and Richard\nJohnson in the triple jump.\nThe Rugby Club failed in their\nvaliant attempt to regain the\nGutteridge Cup which they last\nwon two years ago. They were\nknocked out in the semi-final by\nWestminster Hospital in a close\nmatch.\nThe Ladies Rugby Club hit the\nheadlines earlier this year when\nthey were filmed by LWT for The\nSix O 'clock Show. The match\nplayed against QMC was won 8-4\nby IC's ladies.\nThe Badminton Club reached\nthe UL U Knockout Cup Final\nfor the third year running. The\nfinal hasn't been played yet, but\nIC are clear favourites to retain\nthe trophy, Whilst not\nperforming up to their usual\nstandard in the league, mainly\ndue to some dod gy match\nclaiming tactics used by other\nclubs, all six teams finished in the\ntop three in their leagues.\nThe Cricket Club have shown\nthey would be in for a very good\nseason if it would only stop\nraining! They easily won the\nUAU Southern Indoor Championships comprehensively\nbeating UEA in the final.\nFinally we come to the\nFootball Club. On the whole it\nwas a fairly uninspired year for\nthe Football Club, the one bright\nspot being the marvellous cup\nrun by the third team who were\nunlucky to lose in the final of\ntheir competition to a late goal\nfrom QMC Seconds. A special\nmention to the sixth team who\nmust be the most underrated\nbunch of lads in the College.\nCongratulations to all of the\noutstanding sporting achievements that have taken place at\nImperial this year and FELIX\nwould like to take this\nopportunity to wish all of the\nsports clubs the very best for the\nfuture.\nImperial is the best sporting\ncollege in London. Let's hope we\ncan keep it that way.\n4\nX1 lJ\n\\ \\ d Ufa 1 0iU\"' \u2022 ff tv p1A life on the ocean wave\n\n"

    "content": "MM News\nHall to\nhave\nwarden\nEx-student\nin jail\nIn February 1982 Haluk Tosun,\nwho completed his PhD at IC in\n1976, was arrested in Istanbul\nwith 22 other executive members\nof the Turkish Peace Association\n(TPA). After a period of\ndetention and a military trial,\nHaluk and seventeen others were\nsentenced to eight years hard\nlabour, and the others all\nreceived five years. All 23 have\nbeen adopted as prisoners of\nconscience by Amnesty\nInternational.\nAmnesty International are\ncurrently circulating petition\nforms within IC, and intend to\nsend copies to the Foreign Office\nand the Turkish Embassy. Many\nsignatures have already added\nweight to the action, including\nthose of the Rector, Prof Kibble\nand 140 other IC academics.\nPetitions are currently being\ncirculated in Halls, Houses and\nrefectories. Anyone requiring\nfurther details can contact\nCharles Penman, Mathematics.\nNew\nLaundry\nFor\nCollege\nThe Central Launderette in\nSouthside basement (opposite\nthe refectory) opened a week last\nWednesday. The launder et te was\ncompleted a month ago but\nopening has been delayed whilst a TV security camera was installed.\nThis final delay lasted twice as\nlong as the two weeks predicted\nby College Security Officer\nGeoffrey Reeves when interviewed by FELIX last month.\nThe charges are 50p for a wash\nand lOp for drying, as predicted\nin FELIX earlier this term. All IC\nstudents are entitled to use the\nfacility, but clearly only those\nliving on campus are likely to use\nit in practice. Opening hours are\n10:00am in the morning until\n10:00pm at night seven days a week. In the evening, security,\nguards on the Southside main\nentrance will allow access to the\nlaunder et te after 7:00pm when\nthe doors are normally locked.\nThe new launder et te should\nallow the existing Hall\nlaunder et tes in Southside to be\nconverted to kitchens, which are\ndesperately needed. However,\nthe decision on this is one for\nindividual wardens subject, of\ncourse, to sufficient funds being\navailable.\nThe launder et te was originally\nscheduled to open on 5 March,\nbut this date now appears to have\nbeen wildly optimistic. Several\nsubsequent opening dates were\nfixed but all passed without the\nlong-awaited event. The latest\ndelay seems to have been caused\npurely by lack of forethought by\nthe College Security service. This\nmeans that the launder et te has\nnow opened just in time for the\nsummer vacation when most\nstudents take their dirty washing\nhome to their mother. No doubt\nthe conference guests in\nSouthside over the summer will\nbe duly impressed with the\nfacility although it is not expected\nthey will make extensive use of it.\nA warden is to be appointed to\nthe Montpelier Street Hall of\nResidence for next session. The\ndecision, taken by the Students\nResidence Committee, is in line\nwith the new College policy of\nincreasing the number of\nwardens.\nMontpelier Street Hall was\nacquired in 1982 and occupies a prime site just off Brompton\nRoad opposite Harrods. It is a postgraduates-only residence\nwhich accommodates 78 male\nand female students in small\nsingle rooms. There is also\naccommodation for three\nmarried couples. At present the\nHall is under the auspices of the\nWeeks Hall warden and has a resident sub-warden. The new\nwarden will live in the Hall, and\nso the post of sub-warden will be\ndropped.\nJohn Smith\nin court\nJohn Smith, the College Secretary, spent seven hours in the\nwitness box last week at the Lands Tribunal, Chancery\nLane, the \"higher court\" for rating cases. He was appearing\nas witness-in-chief for Imperial College in their appeal, with\nthe Inland Revenue, against a rating decision made in\nOctober 1980 in favour of Westminster City Council.\nThe Council have increased the country are looking at it with\nrates that the College pay on their\npremises from 3'/2% to 5-6%.\nTraditionally, universities and\ncolleges have been rated at the\nlower level under the terms of the\n'provincial memorandum',\nwhich favours educational\npremises over commercial ones.\nThe Westminster City Council\ndispute the terms of this\nagreement, and those parts of IC\nbounded by Imperial College\nRoad, Queensgate and Exhibition Road have been rated at 5%\nsince October 1980. The College\nrate bill for 1982/3 was\n\u00a31,967,000.\nThis is being seen as a test case,\nand local councils, universities,\nand colleges throughout the\ninterest. If the decision goes\nagainst IC then other councils\ncould follow the example of\nWestminster City Council, and\nuniversities and colleges would\nface massively increased rate\nbills. The financial burden would\nultimately by borne by central\ngovernment in most, but not all,\ncases. All universities, except\nOxford and Cambridge, have\ntheir rate bills payed by the\nUniversity Grants Commission.\nThe total sum thought to be at\nstake is \u00a340,000,000.\nThe case, now in its second\nweek, is expected to finish before\nthe end of the month but a result\nmay not be heard until October\n1984.\nLucky Laura O 'Neil, Chem Eng 3, is the envy of all her friends after winning a fabulous FELIX weekend for2 in Paris. Theprize\nwas donated by STA, the new College travel firm, whose manager\nMark Fletcher is pictured above with Laura.\n\n"

    "content": "GAYNOR LEWIS REVEALS ALL!\nIn this FELIX exclusive interview Gaynor\nLewis talks about her successes and\ndisappointments during her year as\nPresident and answers some of the\ncriticisms levelled against her.\nFELIX: What do you think that\nyou've achieved in your year\nas President?\nGaynor Lewis: I think we've\nachieved quite a lot this year\nreally, both in the services\nprovided by the Union and the\nclubs and societies within the\nUnion. We changed London\nStudent Travel over to a Sport's Shop and introduced a new\ntravel centre providing, we\nhope, a better service. The\nchange, handover, in the\nrefectories. We don't know\nwhether it's going to be\nsuccessful or not. Differences\nmade in the transport system\nwill be of benefit to a large\nnumber of students at IC. It\nwill mean that a lot more clubs\nand societies will be using the\ntransport system.\nHow do you feel that what\nyou've achieved has lived up\nto your expectations at the\nbeginning of year? Have you\nachieved everything you set\nout to do?\nI think a lot of the things that\nwe set out to do at the\nbeginning of our year were to\nfinish a lot of the previous\nyear's business. One of the\nmajor objectives was the\nprovision of the central\nlaunder et te facility in\nSouthside. We finished what\nSteve Goulder had started.\nThis will be a great success.\nThis was due to input by\nUnion officers and the Rugby\nand Boat Club.\nAlthough there have been\ndelays in the Central\nlaunder et te, things have gone\nquicker than last year.\nYou've come in for criticism in\nthat you've concentrated on\nInternal Affairs as opposed to\nthe External Affairs of the\nUnion.\nI think that we have officers to\ndeal with every aspect of the\nUnion \u2014 we have lots of\nsupport from sabbatical\nofficers. I think the Internal\nServices of the Union were in a mess at the start of the year. I think you've got to take things\nslowly, one step at a time. You\ncan't concentrate all the time\non everything. There was\ninterest this year among the\nsabbaticals to concentrate on\ninternal affairs. I think that\nPeter Burt, the External Affairs\nPresident Gaynor Lewis\nOfficer has done a very good\njob.\nYou mentioned the Union take\nover of the refectory earlier.\nYou clearly consider this to be\none of your major achieve-men ts.I think it's one of the major\nsteps forward taken by the\nUnion\u2014the decision was\nmade by College to help us\nfinancially and in a supportive\nway. It has yet to be proven\nwhether or not the refectory\nwill be a success under Union\nmanagement.\nWhat would be the consequences of failure?\nI don't know! It's not going to\nfail. As far as we see at the\nmoment there is no need for\nthat refectory to fail. If it does\nwe'll have lost a fair amount of\nfinancial support by College\nand there will be problems\nwith the staff that we appoint.\nIt's up to the students to come\nand support the refectory.\nMr Mooney will leave in April\n1985. Do you for see any great\nchanges in the refectory\nsystem after that?\nI didn't know Mr Mooney was\nabout to leave in April 1985. Mr\nMooney's been leaving this\nCollege so long I can't remember when the first date was.\nWhat's your opinion of the\nnew Chairman of the\nRefectory Committee, Dr\nSimon Perry?\nI think Simon Perry tries very\nhard. I have been disappointed that the Refectory\nCommittee don't seem to be\nable to make decisions when\ncalled upon. He chairs the\ncommittee well on most\noccasions. When decisive\naction is called for we have felt\nthat he's been slightly lacking.\nCriticism has also come from\nthose who perceive that\ndecisions In the Union are\nmade too high up without\nsufficient consultation of\nstudent representatives.\nI think many decisions inside\nthe Union are taken by the\nExec due to lack of time. I don't think they are taken without\nconsultation. I am sure you're\nreferring to decisions regarding the telephones. It is\nclaimed I made the decision\nmyself that's not correct. I indicated what I thought the\noutline should be\u2014I discussed it with more than one\nof the Union officers and more\nthan one of next year's Union\nOfficers, and this was\naccepted by many.\nYou have been critical of\nFELIX in your annual report\nfor this year and in the first\nterm FELIX made personal\nattacks on Michael Arthur and\nStudent Services in general.\nDo you feel that these attacks\nwere Justified?\nMy comments about FELIX in\nmy annual report stated that I was disappointed that I was\ncontinually having to correct\ninaccuracies in FELIX.\nTo whom did you have to\ncorrect these inaccuracies?\nTo students who came to see\nme after articles had been\nprinted in FELIX asking why\nsuch a situation occurred. As\nfar as attacks on Michael\nArthur are concerned I would\nsay that on a number of\noccasions Michael has not\nlived up to his job as much as I would have liked him to do. I think that he should come in\nfor criticism. But I felt that\nFELIX were continually\ncriticising, sometimes without\nreason, sometimes with\nreason. Any criticism that we\nmade of Michael Arthur on\nCollege committees was not\ntaken seriously. This has\ncaused problems as far as\nstudents are concerned.\nWe've felt that we're flogging a dead horse because of the\nattitude of College administration after certain issues of\nFELIX.\nFELIX has to be controversial\u2014it can be controversial and work together with\nthe Union officers rather than\nworking against them at all\ntimes.\nIn some cases FELIX has\nreported well, in the interest of\nstudents\u2014these reports have\nhelped us a great deal.\nYour award of a UGA to Ian\nBull was controversial in that\nit was an award to a very close\nfriend. Do you think that it was\npolitically wise to make that\naward?\nIan Bull in his work as ACC\nChairman thoroughly deserved a UGA and that was the\npolicy that I used in deciding\nwho I would award them to.\nWhat confidence do you have\nin next year's three sabbatical\nofficers?\nI hope they will work together\nvery well as a team. We, in fact,\nhave four sabbaticals next\nyear\u2014I think they will work\ntogether well. I think that the\nexperience that they've had in\nall their jobs amounts to more\nthan we had at the start of our\nyear.\nEveryone who reads FELIX is\nanxious to know what\nhappens to sabbaticals after\nthey finish their term of office.\nCan you tell us what you will\nbe doing next year?\nNext year I will be working for\nLloyds Bank on a Management Development course in\none of their branches in the\ncity.\n\n"

    "content": "One Last Rant Now is the time in the year when the FELIX Editor\ngets a chance to survey all he sees and have one\nlast rant before he loses all his super powers and is\ntransformed back into an obscure nobody once\nmore.\nThe Union\nThis year has been a fairly ordinary year for the\nstudents union. Things have been kept ticking\nover, the clubs and societies have been as healthy\nand active as ever and there have been a few\nimprovements in services without any real\nimprovement in the lot of ordinary students. The\nUnion's greatest problem, has been that as a body\nit has been irrelevant to most of its members. Most\nUGMs, even in the first term have been barely\nquo rate; what an indictment it is when not even 300\npeople out of a total membership of 4000 are\ninterested in the Union. One can hardly blame\nthem when all they get is a list of what Union\nofficers have already done on their behalf. There\nhas not been one single decision put to a UGM, not\none issue that a UGM's views have been\nconsulted. The Union can only become relevant\nand of interest to its members if it ceases to be as\nautocratic as it has been this year and allows its\nordinary members to take an active part in\ndecision-making and the running of the Union.\nGaynor Lewis\nGaynor has been a very pleasant and\napproachable President. She has worked hard and\nconscientiously throughout the year and has\nalways tried to be helpful to everyone that comes\nto see her. I have been critical of her this yea\nbecause she has not been one of the-'rt to'* ule\nPresidents. She came into the job without much\nexperience of the Union or College and has\nsuffered for it. She has not been able to take a broad view of the Union and this has led her to\nmake some very ill-informed decisions. Coming in\nfresh faced to College committees has meant she\nhas continually had to be on the defensive,\nresponding to proposals put forward by College\nand hardly ever putting Union initiatives to\nCollege. College are always ready to take\nadvantage of inexperience and weakness. She has\nbeen fortunate indeed to have Christine Teller, a woman of much experience, as her Deputy this\nyear.\nincreased by 1000 over night'. But he felt that this\nwould be 'uneconomical' and 'infeasible'.\nThe Union should not settle for a paltry one year\nout of three or four in College accommodation.\nCollege can get more accommodation if there is\nsufficient will. Pressure from the Union could\nincrease accommodation by 1000 overnight.\nAcademic Affairs\nAcademically most students get a good deal from\nCollege. The workload is often high but most of the\ncourses are the best of their kind in the country.\nThe only black mark in this otherwise rosy picture\nis the teaching ability of some of the lecturers.\nThese people may be brilliant in their field but have\nlittle idea of how to teach. Lecturer training is\nresisted by College because Imperial is primarily a research centre. One can understand the dilemma\nfaced by departments; on the one hand their\nreputation depends on attracting the best\nscientists in the world, on the other they have a responsibility to provide good courses for their\nstudents. Some departments do make an effort to\ntake teaching performance into account when\njudging promotions and making sure lecturers are\ndoing their jobs properly but this is by no means\nuniversal. The Union should be lobbying strongly\nnext year to get some sort of uniform policy in this\narea from the Rector.\nCollege\nIt is often said what a good position we are in in\nterms of student representation on College\ncommittees. However when it comes to making\nreally important decisions, all pretence of\ncooperation and consultation goes out of the\nwindow. Admin are always prepared to ask Union\nrepresentatives their opinion on certain issues at\nCollege committees and, as demonstrated with the\nmid-session price increase, is quite willing to ignore\nthem completely when it suits them.\nResidence\nUnless College continue to pay little more lh.in|\nlip service to the Union then we can only come to\nthe conclusion that student representation|\namounts to bugger all at this place.\nIt is worth remembering that some of the\ngreatest successes the Union had against College I in the sixties and seventies were when the Union |\nthreatened disruption and demonstrations.\nEverytime the Union has threatened refectory\nboycotts in the past in protest against price rises\nthe College have climbed down immediately. If\nCollege aren't prepared to cooperate with the\nUnion then they must be pushed, prodded and\nshouted at until they do.\nAnd finally\nAnd now, the end is near, and so I face the final\ncurtain This year has flashed past so quickly, it\nseems just yesterday I was preparing to embark on\nediting FELIX. I promised to make FELIX more\ncontroversial, more lively and more entertaining. A lot of people haven't like some of the things I have\nsaid but I felt a number of things needed saying\nstraight. It is clear from her interview with FELIX\nthat Gaynor is in broad agreement with me on a number of issues. Unlike the President I don't have\nto be tactful or pull my punches. When Gaynor\nsays she thinks Michael Arthur isn't doing his job\nas well as he should she really means he's an\narrogant windbag who's far too interested in\nsucking up to his bosses in College than helping\nstudents.\nProducing FELIX every single week of the term\nis a hard and arduous task and it is impossible to\nput your best into every issue. Over all 1 have been\npleased with FELIX this year and I hope you have\nenjoyed reading FELIX as much as I have enjoyed\nediting it.\nHave a nice summer!\nPallab Ghosh\n1 | J1^\\ ilk\nIt is often said that Imperial College offers more\naccommodation for students than any other\nCollege in London. Never the less it can only\nguarantee to accommodate its students for one\nyear in a House or Hall. At any other university or\ncollege this would be a disgraceful situation. With\nthe exception of its Princes Gardens Halls,\nImperial College offers some of the most\noverpriced sub-standard accommodation around.\nThe state of some of the Student Houses is\nappalling and students are often crammed into\nrooms like sardines.\nMichael Arthur was given the job of increasing\nthe number of residences for students. What did\nhe come up with? The Fremantle Hotel. A residence which is ill-equipped, falling apart and\ncosts nearly \u00a330pw! At a public meeting on Residence this year\nCollege Secretary John Smith said that 'the\namount of College accommodation could be\n\u2022Top Row: David Rowe, Jon Jones, John Burgess, Ulysses, Hugh Stiles, David Jones.\nMiddle Row: Tim Noyce,Hugh Southey, Len Moulder, J Martin Taylor, Matt Fawcett.\nFront: Nigel Atkinson, Peter Rodgers, Max Fellows, Diane Love, Nick Shackley, Pete Hobbis.\n\u2022Plus: Tony Atkins, Claire Moss, John Scott, Lyme James, Steve Brann, Malcolm Gray,\nSteve Goulder, Simon Neild, Guy Riddihough, Carolyn Aldred, Dave Parry, Nick Thexton,\nRich Archer, Pete Coleman, Jonathan Gerson, Peter Burt, Karen Stott and Steve Barnett.\nMy thanks to everyone who has helped on FELIX this year. It's been great fun working with you all. It\nwould be impossible to pick out a few people since every one has worked so well this year. However a special thanks to J Martin Taylor for (usually) being so reliable with the news and being a constant\nsource of amusement throughout the year. Jon Jonesfor pasting up so reliably all year. Tim Noyce for\nproducing his marvellous cartoons on demand so regularly for two years. Maz Fellowsfor typesetting\nund all her help throughout the year. An extra special thanks to Peter Dawson who has been working\n14 hours a day all this week printing this issue.\n\n"

When the\nMines Revue was held in March anti-porn\ndemonstrators picketed the event.\nThe Phoenix, ICU's literary magazine, was\npublished earlier this term. For the first time\nin many years it caused some controversy by\nincluding a story describing scenes of rape\nand violence, written by none other than the\naforementioned Michael Newman.\nBot-Zoo Tea Party\nAnother story given prominence in FELIX during the autumn term was the campaign to\nre-open the Bot-Zoo tea room. Due to staff\nshortages the tea service had been\ndiscontinued last session, but a campaign led\nby Peter Burt, last year's Life Sci Dep Rep,\nimpressed on the head of department,\nProfessor Wood, the strength of support for\nre-opening the tea room. Despite earlier\nstatements that the department could not\nafford to sub sid is e it the pressure brought by\nthe campaign paid off and the service\nresumed early in the spring term.\nEstates Fiascos\nThe bungling of the Estates Section of\nCollege has come in for some critical\ncoverage in FELIX this year. The re-cladding\nof the Electrical Engineering building was\nstarted in November, six years after the\nproblem of loose tiles was discovered. The\npotential trouble which may result from lack\nof routine main ten ace on College buildings\nwas featured in the Times Higher Education\nSupplement in January.\nThe repeated delays in the completion of\nthe new launder et te and gym facilities in\nSouthside were also featured in FELIX. The\ngym changing rooms were completed early\nthis term, but the gym itself still leaves much\nto be desired. At present it is only used by one\nUnion club. The launder et te finally opened\nlast week, over three months after the original\ncompletion date.\nNUS Nonsense\nMews residents complained about this kind of behaviour in Southside.\nremove outside telephone lines from IC radio\nand STOIC whilst increasing the number of\nlines in the Union Office. IC Radio have now\nbeen promised a local line only, but the\nl situation is still not resolved.\nIn the spring term a College notice on the\nmanagement of residence was issued by\n^College Secretary John Smith. He announced\nthe appointment of a Managing Surveyor to\nlook after the maintenance of all residences.\nThe new post was created on 1 May and is\nheld by Peter Hallworth, formerly a surveyor\nin Estates. Also in the notice was the decision\nto put wardens back in the Southside\nPenthouse flats. It was only emerged recently\nthat this will not be effected for at least\nanother year.\nConcern was expressed that the College's stated policy of reducing the subsidies it\neffectively gives the residence accounts would\nlead to high rent rises. The rise announced in\nMay, however, is in line with the grant\nincrease of 4%. But no assurances were given\nabout future years by Mr Smith when he\naddressed an open meeting on residence\npolicy in Feburary. The College has agreed to\nacquire at least 125 additional residence\nplaces to replace those to be lost when the\nFremantle lease expires.\nThe Elec Eng building which became\nfamous for its deciduous tiles.\nThe perennial NUS issue this year took a new\nform. Council decided to send two observers\nto the Christmas NUS Conference, a decision\nwhich was overturned at a later U GM. The\nU GM motion called for the practice of\nsending delegates to certain conferences to be\nreviewed. When the 'Rodgers Report' on\nconferences was published it found that ICU should continue to send delegates to these\nconferences, and subsequently aUG M approved the sending of two observers to the\nNUS Easter Conference. A report of their\nvisit appeared in FELIX. early this term.\nDelegates were also sent to the International\nConference of Students of Technology\n(INCOST) in Helsinki at Easter. A good time\nwas had by both of them, it seems. This\nconference is likely to be held at IC next year.\nThe NUS president came to speak at aUG M and was well received, although no\nmoves to get ICU re-affiliated were started. It\nseems there is still little support for the idea of\nre-affiliating amongst IC students, but no\ndoubt the issue will be raised again as usual\nnext year. The number of big name political\nspeakers was down on previous years,\nalthough Home Secretary Leon Brittan came\nin February.\nThe Southside Halls of Residence have been\nthe subject of several stories. At the start of\nthe year new regulations agreed between\nCollege and the Mews residents were\nintroduced to cut down on noise from the\nbuilding. The fridges on the landings were\nordered off by the fire inspectors, but in the\nabsence of a practical alternative posit on they\nhave merely been moved into the side\nlandings. Although originally a temporary\nsolution this arran g ment has now been in\noperation for over four months. More\nrecently the new fire alarm system has been\nthe cause of annoyance to residents by\nfrequently going off for no apparent reason,\noften in the middle of the night. And the\ndecision to fit electronic key card locks to\nimprove security in Southside has had design\nsetbacks and they are still not installed.\nThe new telephone system to be installed\nby the start of next session was reported in\nFELIX in November. Controversy\nsurrounded the decision by Gaynor Lewis to\nRefectories\nRefectory matters have not been in the news\nmuch this year, with two exceptions. Firstly\nthe Union Bar was equipped with a microwave in January. However, the failure\nof the Refectory management to provide a menu and price list has led to the service being\nunder-used. It is hoped that the situation will\nsoon be remedied and that a range of hot food\nwill be available all evening in this bar.\nThe other refectory story, and possibly the\nmajor story of the year, is the Union takover\nof the refectory in the Union Buidlng. This\noutlet has been losing money and custom for\nseveral years and College had hinted that it\nmight close, the Union put forward proposals\nin March for the takeover, and these have\nbeen approved by the College. Plans are\npresently being drawn up by the Union\nofficers for the opening of a new-style snack\nbar outlet next term. This is undoubtedly a major challenge* o the Union's resourcefulness; but if succes fully carried out\nthe potential advantages of having a Unionrun refectory are considerable.\n\n"

Having already sought\nmedical advice, I have been left\nwith no other choice but to tell\neveryone in Imperial about my\nfrustration in having to work\nwith two bloody annoying\nwomen.\nThe first one of these women\nis called Gayer (or something\nlike that). She is an Irish midget\nwho claims to come from\nWales. However we have been\nable to find out her true\nidentity. Apparently she was\nborn on 1 April 1962 in Ballina,\nCo Mayo and lived there for the\nfirst sixteen years of her life\nbefore defecting to London as a \"Death to all trees that loose\ntheir leaves before 1\nSeptember\". Unfortunately she\nhas now managed to infiltrate\nIC Union and therefore has\naccess to a lot of strictly\nconfidential files. Her true\nidentity was first discovered\nwhen she tried to pass herself\noff as a garden gnome in ULU\nswimming pool on 21 July of\nthis year. On being apprehended by the UL U security\nofficer she was found to have\ntwenty-six varieties of leaves in\nthe padding of her shoes. Also\non 28 July she was removed\nfrom Princes Gardens for\nattacking a chestnut tree with a butter knife and shouting\nloudly in the air \"Death to all\ntrees that loose their leaves\nbefore 1 September\".\nThe other so called woman is\nknown in the trade as Yes\nPlease Teller. The reason for the\nYes Please is because she can\nnever say no to a16 oz can of\nHeinz Baked Beans. On one\noccasion she was seen to drink\nthe guts of eight cans of this\ninebriating substance and the\nnext day proceeded to march\naround the Union Office\nfollowed by a long green line.\nThe smell being so intoxicating\nthat one sabbatical and two\nstaff had to be rushed to St\nStephens Hospital casualty\ndepartment to have their noses\npumped out and their toe nails\nshorted by 2.2mm due to a gathering of brown blotches in\nthese parts. On another\noccasion, after having eaten\nthree pup pad om s, two onion\nbaj is, a meat ph al, boiled rice\nand a nan bread, the fire\ndepartment had to be called to\nrelease her head from a bowl in\nthe gents bogs. On being freed\nshe explained that the smell was\nso bad she had to stick her nose\nsomewhere because she was\nalmost overcome with the\nfumes.\nBoth these people are a menace to public safety and I do\nnot think the public can sleep\nsafely at night knowing they are\nstill at large.\nYours, on the point of a mental\nbreakdown,\nThe Right Honorable Secretary\nSean C Davis\nI 've seen\nthe light!\nSir\nAs the sole up holder of\nprivate enterprise and free\nspeech at Imperial College, I feel that it is my duty to expose\nthe plot of a group of Soviet\nBolshevik infiltrators who\nhave of late succeeded in\nmanipulating the glorious IC\nConservative Society to their\nown devious revolutionary\nends.\nIt is quite clear that Jonathan\nGerson, the token wet on the\nConsoc executive, has over the\ncourse of the year been\nsubjected to merciless\nintimidation and h arras s ment by those who wish to drag the\nsociety into supporting a dubious range of trendy left\nwing causes. The principal\ninstigators of this conspiracy,\nwho doubtless have backing\nfrom the Kremlin itself, are the\nStalinite J Martin Taylor and\nhis Marxist cro nie, Graham\nBrown. These socialist\ndegenerates and their comrades\nhave the sole aim of subverting,\nnay, perverting, our British\nyouth from the fine upstanding\nmoral values which have for so\nlong been the pride of our\ncountry.\nThis kind of behaviour is, of\ncourse, not on, and I would\nurge all decent, patriotic IC\nspongers, sorry, students, to\nhave no truck with this kind of\ncorrupt nonsense, and jolly well\ntell the b lighters to get stuffed.\nYours, in defence of\nlibertarian values,\n'Blue Peter' Burt\nReformed\ncharacter\nDear Pallab\nI recently had cause to glance\nback through this year's issues\nof your worthy publication,\npaying particular attention to\nletters from such socialist\nluminaries as John Sattaur,\nPeter Burt and Robin Graham.\nImagine my surprise on\nrealising that these people\nwhom I had previously\ndismissed as \"frothing at the\nmouth Commies\" are actually\npurveyors of common sense,\nand sound humanitarian\nphilosophy. I now know that I have merely been a tool of the\nreactionary capitalist/racist/\nsexist forces led by the likes of\nIan McGregor and Rupert\nMurdoch. I can see that there is\na right wing conspiracy to\nsubjugate us, turn us into an\narmy of unemployed zombies,\nand lead us into war against\nPresident Cherenko. As I know th t President Chernenko\nis a peaceful man who merely\nwishes to protect his people\nfrom the evils of the free\nmarket, I am obliged to bring\nthis conspiracy to light, and to\nprotest against it. My first act of\nprotest will be to tear up my\nConservative Party membership card, and to join the\nLabour Club and even Veg Soc.\nOh, what a fool I was to\ncriticise FELIX as I have done.\nI see now that you too are a victim of the class struggle.

    "content": "A STAFF REPORTER WRITES\nG HO SH! THE TRUTH!\nPallab Ghosh comes from the Far East of\nHemel Hempsted. He came to IC in 1980\nwhere he read physics before taking over as\nFELIX Editor.\nPallab is a man who possesses a charming\nnaivety that only the unkind would term\nincompetence. He has unceasingly followed\nthe Leaning Tower of Pisa school of pasting-up. His spelling and grammar betray his\nBengali ancestry. He has never driven\nanywhere by car without crashing once on\nthe way there, and once on the way back.\nBut Pallab has made a genuine attempt to\nimprove himself. He went on a hugely\nexpensive typing course, but this only\nsucceeded in teaching him the 'Eagle'\nmethod of typing. He hovers for some time\nbefore he swoops, one-fingered, onto the\nkeyboard.\nPallab's first venture into the world of the\nmedia was when he made a video called\nCaptain Pulsar at school. He was Head\nBoy at school (where he earned the\nsoubriquet 'god') and so was able to\nproduce, direct, and star in the film, which he\ninflicts on his friends on every possible\noccasion.\nHis first bash at being an editor was when he\nproduced the Wellsian, the newsletter of the\nHG Wells Society. This was a great success\nand was critically acclaimed as being the best\nWellsian ever produced. This led some\npeople to believe that Pallab might do a good\njob of editing FELIX.\nAnd so it was that he stood for election to\nthat pre sti go us post. Almost immediately he\nwas accused of electoral malpractice by his\nopponent. Suffice it to say that nothing was\never proved, and Pallab was elected.\nIt was while celebrating his election victory in\nthe Union Bar that Pallab gave ample\ntestimony of the shape of things to come by\nbeing violently sick into a bucket d la Mr\nCreosote.\nSoon after term ended, and Pallab took\noffice, he developed an em baras sing 'crush'\non Gaynor Lewis, the Union President. After\nbeing spurned by Gaynor, Pallab took\nadvantage of every opportunity to slag her\noff in the pages of his organ.\nPallab's naivety has already been touched\nupon but another characteristic, equally\nevident, is his gullibility. On one occasion he\nbet someone that not only did Orson Welles\nstar in the film Citizen Kane but that also, by\nmeans of trick photography, he was able to\ntake the part of a small boy as well. Pallab\ncontinues to insist that Boris Karloff was\ncompletely deaf and dumb, despite the fact\nthat Karloff was renowned for his fine\nmicrophone voice. This wouldn't be so bad\nwere it not for the fact that Pallab considers\nhimself to be a bit of a film buff. On one\noccasion, when trying to impress his\ngirlfriend with his knowledge of film, Pallab\nwas furious to find that every bit of\ninformation that he gave was contradicted by\nthe man sitting next to them on the tube.\nReaders may think this article a little harsh\non Pallab. But rest assured. We in the FELIX\nOffice think that Pallab is one of the most '\ncharming and pleasant people we know, and\nwe wish him all the best in the future,\nwhatever it may bring.\nPallab Ghosh - FELIX Editor\n* YOUR#\nSTARS.\n*\nby Gypsy\n* * John\nLIBRA\n(Sept 23\u2014Oct 23)\nYou are very sympathetic towards others.
