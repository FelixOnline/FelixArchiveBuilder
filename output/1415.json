He\ndiscovers that the men who blackmailed Vesper into deceiving him, control an organisation (Quantum) more\ncomplex than the CIA or MI5 had ever\nimagined. Thus, he sets out on a confusing mission to uncover the truth behind Quantum and prevent Dominic\nGreene who heads this criminal group,\nfrom exploiting the world\u2019s natural re-sources. Absurdly, there is also a flimsy sub-plot, which Bond gets caught\nup in, involving a General Medrano\nand a attractive young spy for Bolivia\n(Camille) who is on her own personal\nassassination mission. Both are tied up\nsomehow, in relations with the treacherous business of Quantum.\nSo why was I so very disappointed\nwith Quantum of Solace? It had all the\nelements of a \u2018true Bond\u2019 but the pieces\nwere put together without any feeling\nor wit.

There seems to be a general consensus reached about the movie\n\u2013 rubbish editing of action sequences,\nlack of proper story line and no chance\nfor Daniel Craig to use his acting skills.\nAnd since I am not a particularly vig-urous Bond fan (read: I probably care\nmore about what my biophysics lecturer had for dinner than whether they\never make another movie in the series),\nI\u2019ll take any chance I get to see the film\nrun down by reviewers.\nBut don\u2019t you just hate it when movies disappoint?

Having\nbegun immediately where the forth\ninstalment left off, Saw 5 immediately\nlets rip, both figuratively and meta-phorically, and quickly descends into\nanother bland and torturous hour and\na half.\nThe plot involves the serial killer\nJigsaw\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 continuing his work\nof forcing people into sick games in\nwhich they have to torture themselves\nor others to survive, the purpose being\nthat if they are successful in their plight\ntheir survival will allow them to truly\nappreciate their lives.

No, it\u2019s not the directors,\nit\u2019s not the actors, not the editors, nor\nthe producers - on the whole they work\nhard, as long as they detach themselves\nfrom perusing the \u2018Suns\u2019 of the world\nfor any mention of their humble personas for long enough. I hold the publicists responsible.\nThey are the ones who get paid ridiculous money to sell you a product that\ndoesn\u2019t exist, a film so gripping, so new,\nso exhilarating that you\u2019ve never seen\none like it before. And that\u2019s probably\ntrue, but what is rarely mentioned is\nthat you will, in fact, never see a movie\nlike that. Because the truth of the matter is that the PR people have quite\nremarkably realised that our imaginations are our best worst enemy. So long\nas something stays only a vague idea in\nour tiny brains we can\u2019t become disillusioned about it. It\u2019s no secret that the\nmore publicity a film gets, the more\nwe think about it. But beware, cause\nthe moment you start thinking about\na movie before having seen it, you effectively sabotage it. P.S. Did you know\nthat they use CG effects to blot out\nKeira Knightley\u2019s spot marks?\nAlready sick of\nBond The plot is only interesting when it\ntellsyouhowJigsaworiginallyrecruited\nthe new victimiser, but the new \u2018games\u2019\nthat are played out are tired and dull,\nmainly because we have seen them all\nbefore. This film will only make sense\nto those of you who have already seen\nthe first four Saw films, because if you\nhaven\u2019t then you will have no idea\nwhat is going on, as no exposition is\npresented.\nThe advertising campaign for this\nfilm states that \u2018you won\u2019t believe how\nit ends\u2019. And I agree with this, because\nthe ending is of such a poor, predictable and disappointing quality you will\nleave the cinema not quite believing\njust how awful the denouement really\nwas. It is this reviewer\u2019s opinion that\nthe Saw series should have stopped\nafter the second one, as the first two\nwere both original and intelligent, but\neach subsequent film is just the same\nthing, but worse, repeated over and\nover again.\nWhy pay to see this film? Well if\nwatching random people dying in disgusting ways is your cup of tea, then\nI recommend it.

We were expecting a tantalising new type of Bond,\nhot, sexy and ready to go. This brings\nus back to the old Bond who was failing to raise an audience and ready to be\nshelved. I wanted to be on the edge of\nmy seat, but instead I was half-asleep.\nIt was mediocre and left me longing to\nbe watching its predecessor.\nThe storyline is poorly thought out\nand its translation onto screen is even\nworse. There is little or no dialogue\nworth remembering in this film and\nDaniel Craig\u2019s acting talents seemed to\nbe limited to a few grimaces and numerous encounters with M. The Bond\ngirls are limited in their roles and far\ntoo clich\u00e9d. It feels rushed, over-pro-duced and too concerned with its own\nflashy exterior to worry about the story it is trying to tell. This should have\nbeen the film of the year, and it could\nhave been!\nQuantum of Solace, all style and un-fortunately, little substance. Bring back\nMartin Campbell and let\u2019s have some\nproper Bond direction.\nFrom the early origins of cinema people toyed with the idea of synchronised\nsmell. In 1906, even before sound was\nintroduced to cinema, a family theatre in Forest City, Pennsylvania used\nscents to accompany their newsreel of\nthe Pasadena Rose Bowl. They dipped\ncotton wool into rose essence and then\nused an electric fan to waft the scent\ntowards the audience.\nThen in 1929 a cinema in Boston\nadded a lilac fragrance to their ventilation system while the opening credits were rolling for Lilac Time and the\nsame year at the premiere of Broadway\nMelody, a New York cinema released\norange blossom fragrances from the\nceiling during the screening. But these\nearly experiments did more to distract the audiences than to add to film\nexperience.\nAdding to the film experience was\nalso the idea behind \u2018feelies: cinemas\nof the future envisaged by Aldous Huxley in his cult novel Brave New World\n(1932).\nAlongside 3D vision and sound, these\ncinemas would offer the physical sensation of touch and movement (\u2018feely\u2019\neffects) and \u201csynchronized scent-organ\naccompaniment\u201d, all of which were intended to enhance the spectator\u2019s immersion into the film by increasing the\nillusion of reality.\nIn the 1940s a Swiss scientist, Hans\nLaube, who studied \u2018osmics\u2019, the science of olfaction (smell), developed a\nmachine he called Scentavision. This\nwas eventually picked up by a film pro-ducer, Mike Todd Jr., who re-named it\nSmell-o-Vision and used it for a film\ncalled Scent of Mystery in 1960. \u201cFirst\nthey moved (1895). Then they talked\n(1927)! Now they smell!\u201d went the advertising slogan for Smell-o-Vision.\nThe machine had a central \u2018brain\u2019 with\na rotating drum that housed the bottles\nof different scents.\nThis was connected to the film tape,\nwhich contained markers that would\nindicate when the scents were to be\nreleased. The scents would then travel\nthrough a system of plastic pipes until\nthey reached the audience, and were\nthen released from under their seats.\nA similar contraption known as\nAroma-Rama was invented by Charles\nWeiss: it released scents through the\ncinema\u2019s ventilation system and over\n30 scents were used in the 1959 film\nBehind the Great Wall. Aroma-Rama\nwas advertised with the slogan, \u201cYou\nmust breathe it to believe it.\u201d\nNeither of these technologies were\naccepted by audiences or critics. One\nNew York Times film critic said, \u201cif\nthere is anything of a lasting value to\nbe learned from Michael Todd\u2019s Scent\nof a Mystery it is that motion pictures\nand synthetic smells do not mix.\u201d Time\nmagazine similarly slammed Aromarama: \u201cmost of the production\u2019s 31\nodours will probably seem phoney\neven to an average, uneducated nose. A\nbeautiful old pine grove in Peking, for\ninstance, smells rather like a subway\nrestroom on a disinfectant day.\u201d The\nWhat if you could smell napalm in the morning?\nmain problems were that the scents,\nonce released, would linger about and\nmix with other scents, causing unpleasant smells, allergic reactions and nausea for some people in the audience.\nThe release of these scents were also\naccompanied by a hissing sound which\nwould distract from the movie, and\nin the case of Aroma-Rama, the scent\ntook a while to diffuse (although freon\ngas was used to facilitate this diffusion)\nand would reach some people too late,\nwhen the appropriate moment in the\nmovie had already passed. Although\nthe media hype predicted scents to be\nas important as sound in cinema\u2019s evo-lution, the first public appearance of\n\u2018smellies\u2019 also marked their immediate\ndemise.\nPaying homage to Scent-o-Vision,\nJohn Waters used system called Odorama in his 1981 film Polyester, with\nthe ad slogan, \u201cSmelling is believing!\u201d\nIn Odorama, the audience would receive scratch-and-sniff cards as they\nentered the cinema. The cards had 10\nscents covered by 10 numbers and the\naudience would have to wait until a\nnumber would flash on the screen to\nscratch and sniff a scent related to that\nmoment in the movie.\nThe scents included pizza, leather,\nflowers, a skunk, natural gas and farts.\nThe cards were printed with an emulsion of essential oils containing an aroMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107 ma-forming chemical. The emulsion\ncontains millions of tiny scent bubbles only microns in diameter. Once\nthe cards are scratched, the bubbles\nrupture and release volatile scents that\nthen find their way to people\u2019s noses.\nSmell-o-Vision and Odorama have\nonly been used in a handful of films\nsince, including the 2006 screening of\nThe New World with Collin Farrell\nin cinemas in Osaka and Tokyo, and\nseveral in amusement parks such as\nDisneyland.\nAt one point you could, but incorporating smell into movies is an old and tried idea that simply didn\u2019t work.\nAt the Film Cynic Clinic\nThis week it was suggested that as part\nof this column, I might actually consider reviewing a film. True, over the past\nfew weeks I\u2019ve tended to avoid commenting on current films and instead\nfocussed on some of the other aspects\nof cinema in general. However this\nweek I will try my hardest, to produce\na succinct, accurate and fair judgement\non a new release.\nI mean, to quote a popular BBC car\nand caravanning show, \u201chow hard can\nit be?\u201d All one has to do is to pick a\nfilm at random from the week\u2019s deluge\nof celluloid and string together an array of outlandish archaic adjectives,\ninterspersed like tiny gravel islands in\na river of contrived metaphor. As long\nas you don\u2019t state: \u201cIt was nice, I had a\nreal good time, and I would probably\nsay that you ought to see Shrek 3 too\u201d,\nthen you should be fine.\nBut what is the critics\u2019 role? What purpose should a review serve to the read-er? Is it a mere quantitative assessment\nof a film, based on a number of discrete\nwell-defined categories that allow the\ngeneration of a meaningful integer between 1 and 5? Sure we can rank the\nthousands of films out there with a\ndynamic range of 5. The silliness and\nfrivolities Hot Fuzz easily place it as a\nfirm 5, alongside the achingly beautiful (damn those darn pesky adjectives\nagain) Lost in Translation, with its elegantly composed scenes (and lack of\nending/purpose). Hang on a minute,\nso the Cornetto-munching, shotgun-toting cops, are numerically the same\nas Bill Murray\u2019s masterfully disparate\ncharacter? It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nIf you take the review and shine the\ninfallible *cough* beacon of science\nupon it, then things get even worse.\nSo you\u2019ve got this experiment and each\ntime you change this variable called\n\u201cthe film\u201d, and you then change the variable called \u201cthe reviewer\u201d, which incidentally means that pretty much none\nof your results are recorded on comparable scales. Are the results repeatable?\nAh well, that depends on what mood\nthe experimenter is in on the day.\nAt least there\u2019s no danger that the re-sult, or the review in this case, could\nbias future data. Actually, well no, that\ncould also happen. It follows logically\nthat someone reading a good review\nabout a movie will be more encouraged\nto see it, thus making it more popular\nand therefore leading to more good re-views. Most critics are unlikely to turn\naround and criticise something that is\nblatantly doing well, and this all leaves\nus in a rather muddled situation.\nIt is likely therefore that my initial prognosis was wrong. A review cannot be\na numerical assessment of a film; this\nsystem simply doesn\u2019t work due to the\nsubjective nature of pretty much every\naspect of the process. So what should a\nreview be? Perhaps it is simply enter-tainment. Something to read, perhaps\ntrusting the writer\u2019s judgement a little\nin your own decision making. Perhaps\nnot. Either way however you interpret\nit, enjoy this weeks\u2019 reviews and nor-mal, more cynical service will resume\nshortly.\nComments?

In contrast to last year\u2019s\nextraordinary conference, it appears\nto have been a very civilised affair,\nalthough a number of changes went\nthrough. Conference eventually voted\nin favour of the revised reform proposals by 614 votes to 142, easily meeting\nthe 2/3 majority needed to change the\nconstitution.\nThe decision must be ratified at a\nsecond conference, either a further Extraordinary Conference or at Annual\nConference in April. In either case, Imperial will play no further part in the\nprocess due to our disaffiliation.\nThe reforms originally eased the\nrequirements for delegates to Annual\nConference to be elected by cross-campus ballot, however this has been\nreversed. Proposals to allow elected\nofficers - who typically receive many\ntimes the number of votes of NUS\ndelegates - to automatically qualify for\nconference failed to pass.\nThe controversial Trustee Board remains intact, with the Black Students\ncampaign failing in its attempt to have\nan automatic seat for all liberation\ncampaigns on the supposedly apolitical board. The board\u2019s function is to\nensure the NUS remains financially viable and acts within the law, which led\nto concerns that it could simply throw\nout anything it did not like. This was\nclarified, with the Annual Conference\nable to refer items back to the Trustee\nBoard if it disagrees with their decision.\nA proposal to remove external trustees\nwas also defeated, meaning the \u2018safety\nnet\u2019 committee will be recruiting from\noutside the student movement.\nAttempts by far left groups to kill off\nthe talk of reform once and for all were\nrejected again, along with a number\nof other amendments. A proposal to\nforce conference delegations to be 50%\nfemale was thrown out - the amendment noted that over 50% of students\nare women, but the same does not apply to conference delegations. It should\nbe noted that despite Imperial\u2019s gender\nimbalance, the last conference delegation was almost a 50/50 split.\nOne other amendment of note aimed\nto stop ratification of the reforms occurring at a second extraordinary con-ference, instead requiring that the Annual Conference be the one to approve\nthe changes. However, this was also\nrejected, fuelling speculation that reforms will be \u2018forced through\u2019 by holding an additional extraordinary confer-ence, for which delegates do not need\nto be selected by cross-campus ballot.\nReports from Imperial\u2019s delegates indicate it was a civilised affair, and the\nmargin by which the reforms passed\nis more convincing than the last\nattempt.\nNUS vote for reform again Universities to be\nrestructured?\nUniversities face the prospect of radical changes after a review ordered by\nthe Government. In his report, Paul\nRamsden, chief executive of the Higher\nEducation Academy, said that universities should no longer class degrees as\nfirsts, 2:1s, 2:2s or thirds. Instead they\nshould issue report cards.\n\u201cThe present system of classification was designed for a smaller higher\neducation world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not\ndescribe the range of knowledge, skills,\nexperience and attributes of a graduate\nin the 21st century.\u201d\n\u201cIt reduces the complexity of a graduate\u2019s performance to a single category.\nAnd it is not reliable across different\nsubject areas.\u201d\nIn another report, Drummond Bone,\nVice-Chancellor of Liverpool University, said that British universities faced\ngrowing competition abroad, and that\nthe credit crunch had made distance\nlearning programmes more popular.\n\u201cThe figures for a massive increase in\ninternational education are no longer\ntenable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last 13 years\nhave seen an extraordinary expansion of global trade and an extremely\nbenign financial environment, neither\nof which can be relied upon in the\nfuture.\u201d\nProfessor Bone said that universities\nneeded to broaden their perspective\non overseas work, perhaps by building campuses abroad. This is an area in\nwhich US universities have been active,\nparticularly in the Middle East.\nImperial College have already setup several oversea parterships, one of\nwhich was reported in last weeks issue\nof felix (Issue 1,414).\nBusiness Editor\nLuke Dhanoa\nInternational Editor\nHassan Joudi\nFilm Editors\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nJonathan Dakin\nFood Editors\nRosie Grayburn\nAfonso Campos\nTechnology Editors\nRichard Lai\nRavi Pall\nWhat\u2019s On Editors\nRachel D\u2019oliviero\nLily Topham\nDeputy Editor: Kadhim Shubber Associate Editor: Gilead Amit\nImperial Canoe Club to the rescue\nMembers of Imperial College Union\nCanoe Club were involved in the rescue\nof a canoeist from a Snowdonian river\nlast Sunday. The individual was swept\ndown the river before he managed to\nclimb onto a rock just before Conwy\nFalls, near Betws y Coed, Gwynedd.\nThe individual in question was canoeing earlier that day with ICU Canoe\nClub, but is not a member of Imperial.\nIC Canoe Club were on their weekend\ntrip with a large cohort of beginners in\nWales, with the aim of the event being to introduce them to the basics of\ncanoeing.\nThe River Conwy can effectively be\nsplit up into three separate sections,\neach of varying difficulty. The first section of the river is described as very\neasy, with the next two sections getting\nprogressively harder. The final stretch\nof the river is considered a grade 5 and\nshould only be attempted by very expe-Jovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nrienced canoeists.\nIt was as ICU Canoe Club were getting ready to tackle the water that\nthey bumped into the individual who\nturned out to be a friend of one of\nthe members. The individual, age 20,\njoined the group as they went down\nthe river, however since the group was\nfull of a lot of beginners, it took longer\nthan expected and the individual went\non the do the next section alone, which\nis considered to be unwise, as he had to\nmeet a friend.\nWith all the beginners safely taken\nout of their boats, the more experienced went on to tackle the second\nsection of the river. This was not without it\u2019s own incidents, as one of the\nImperial canoeists managed to capsize\nhis boat and had to evacuate it. Due to\nthe fairly strong current, the boat was\ntaken away and after the IC students\nensured that the canoeist was safe,\nthey began the search for the boat.\nAfter a while, the boat was found\nwedged between two rocks, and the\nmembers present radioed the rest of\nthe group to come with more safety\nequipment to rescue the boat.\nIt was at this point that the Imperial canoeists were informed that the\nindividual that went on ahead never\nturned up. Assuming that he must\nhave missed the exit point, the group\nwent down to the third stretch of the\nriver where they found him stranded\non \u2018The Rock\u2019. This particular rock has\nreceived it\u2019s name as it is the last large\nrock in the river before Conwy Falls, a\n30-40 ft drop.\nBoaters from the nearby caf\u00e9 were\nakready at the scene, but didn\u2019t have\nenough safety equipment with them.\nAt this point, Tom Haywood from\nImperial College Union Canoe Club,\ncalled the minibus to bring down the\nsafety equipment that they had with\nthem. Rory Fyffe, President of Imperial College Union Canoe Club, then\nmanaged to organise his club to contact the emergency services and give\ntheir current location. In the mean-time, the older members of the club\nsecured a line and got the individual\nto a safe location. Due to the nature of\nthe river and the steep cliff faces on either side, the members of ICU Canoe\nClub could only get the individual to a\ncertain point where it was considered\nvery unlikely for him to get back into\nthe water.\nThe Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue\nteam and the Betws y Coed fire service\nthen arrived on the scene and managed\nto get the individual to safety. Rescuer\nChris Lloyd from the Ogwen Valley\nMountain Rescue Organisation told\nBBC Wales that \u201cThis kind of rescue\nis a regular occurrence on this stretch\nof river, and we get called out three to\nfour times every year.\u201d\nIt was later found out that the individual had missed the exit point after\nthe second stretch of the river, and\nafter seeing a stretch of the river that\nhe didn\u2019t like, he decided to portage\n(get out and walk down the bank). He\nthen managed to drop the canoe in the\nIC Canoe Club aid canoeist stranded on a rock above a\nwaterfall whilst attempting to recover his canoe\nwater and decided to jump in after it.\nAt this point the rapids took the individual downstream until he managed\nto cling onto \u2018The Rock\u2019 where he was\nlater found.\nThe rescue services praised Imperial\nCollege Canoe Club for their contribution to the rescue attempt, as well as\nreceiving a lot of gratitude from the\nindividual involved. The reaction to\nthe events last Sunday can best be described by the email Rory Fyffe, President of Imperial College Union Canoe\nClub, sent to the members.\n\u201cGiven the events of this weekend I\nwanted to email you all. Firstly to thank\nyou all for your help, level-headedness\nand patience last night. I was greatly\npleased by the way the whole club re-acted. Especially those for which this\nwas their first ever kayaking trip.\u201d\n\u201cThe team-work, initiative, sensitiv-ity, professionalism and assumption of\nresponsibility displayed last night was\nexcellent and illustrates what a strong\nclub we have this year. The emergency\nservices and the couple involved send\ntheir thanks also.\u201d\nStudents develop bacterial machines to build\nthree-dimensional structures\nA team of Imperial College bioscien-tists are taking on other universities\nfrom around the world in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe annual event, of which Imperial\nhave taken a mixed team of undergraduates and postgraduates to for the past\nthree years, is a celebration of student\u2019s\nwork and research within synthetic\nbiology.\nThis year\u2019s team consist of nine undergraduates from different bioscience\ndepartments, four advisors and two\nprofessors. The concept they are taking\nwith them to the States involves turning harmless bacteria, Bacillus Subtilis\ninto efficient biofabricators.\nThe hope is that the bacteria will be\nable to produce self assembling organic compounds, such as cellulose,\non demand.\nKrupa Hirani, a third year Bioengineer, is a team member currently in\nMassachussetts, and explained briefly\nhow their concept would work.\n\u201cWe have designed a system where\nlarge numbers of bacteria would be\nswimming around normally in the lab\nuntil a blue light is shone onto them in\na particular shape,\u201d she says. \u201cThe bacteria in the blue light would then stop\nswimming around and produce a ma-terial, which would self-assemble into\nthe pre-designed shape created by the\nblue light.\u201d\nThe pre-determined pattern would\nbe similar to a 3D component of a knitted structure, and be used in different\napplications across the field, including\nproducing biodegradable clothes and\nsynthetic tissue scaffolds.\nOne of the team leaders, Dr. Paul\nFreemont was in a buoyant mood prior\nto the American trip, commenting \u201cAn\nawful lot of effort and hours in the lab\nhave gone into characterising Bacillus Subtilis and planning the genetic\nmanipulations necessary to transform\nthese organisms from innocuous soil\nbacteria to biological manufacturing\nunits.\u201d\n\u201cOur team\u2019s work is an example of a\npioneering use of a new bacteria as a\nbiological manufacturing unit and I\u2019m\nlookingforwardtosharingourachieve-ments with other university teams.\u201d\nThe team will return back this week,\nhopefully triumphantly, but otherwise\nthey should not be disappointed in\ntheir achievements they have worked\non since July.\nThese are exciting times for bio-sciences and bioengineering; both\nfully taking stock of the great advances\nin medical technology and the ever-increasing demand for ecological and\norganic manufacture.\nDaniel Wan\nNews Correspondent\nStudent Krupa Hirani at work on the biofabricator project\nDanielle Reeves\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nA report by Universities UK, which\nrepresents vice-chancellors said: \u201cIt is\nsimply naive to suppose that UK universities can operate effectively and\ncompete with emerging global giants\nwhile funding remains at about one\nthird of US levels. By 2023, a significant proportion of higher education\nmay be delivered by further education\ncolleges, private and international pro-viders. The challenge for institutions\nwill be to ensure that the UK retains its\nreputation for quality and excellence,\nand that diversity and differentiation\ndo not lead to incoherence within the\nsector.\u201d\nPredicted demographic changes over\nthe next decade should prompt fairer\npolicies for part-time students, it said,\nas there will be fewer full-time, teenage\nundergraduates.\nOne of the key points from the report\nwere that more postgraduate scholarships are needed to stop the \u201cbrain\ndrain\u201d, by which they mean that would\nlike to prevent students moving away\nfrom academia.\nThe reviews outline that there clearly\nis a problem with the current state of\nhigher education in the United Kingdom. These problems have also been\noutlined by the Minister for Higher\nEducation, David Lammy (Issue 1,413).\nImperial College have also recognised\nthat the current state is not ideal, and\nit was announced by Sir Roy Anderson\nthat Imperial would be introducing\nnew entrance exams by 2010.\nEarlier this year, second year students took part in a trial run of the exams that the new students would have\nto take, however feedback from the\ntests have so far been negative. felix\nwill report back on the full story in the\nnear future.\nGoverments calls for reports on the\ncurrent state of higher education in the\nUnited Kingdom\nCanoe Club President, Rory Fyffe, tackling some rapids\nImperial College Canoe Club on the River Conwy\n\n"

With both teams unbeaten thus\nfar this season, this match was highly\nanticipated as setting the tone for the\noutcome of the entire competition and,\nonly three foil matches in to the game,\nit was clear the tone would not be set in\nImperial\u2019s favour.\nVice-captain Nathan \u201cBadger\u201d Harmston, Alex \u201cLeukemia\u201d Bishop and\nNathan \u201cBicycle\u201d Blundell all found\nthemselves on the wrong end of 0 \u2013\n5, 2 \u2013 5 and 3 \u2013 5 defeats respective-ly. Alex again faltered in his second\nmatch, suffering an even worse 1 \u2013 5\nloss before Badger clawed some pride\nback for Imperial in an 11 \u2013 5 win that\nleft him exhausted and in severe respiratory distress. The joy was short\nlived however as Nathan B. proceeded\nto lose the following match 1 \u2013 5. Alex\nwas clearly inspired by Badger\u2019s heroics and managed a 10 \u2013 5 win, but with\nNathan and Badger following this up\nwith 1 \u2013 5 and 0 \u2013 5 losses respectively,\nit was not nearly enough and Imperial\nwere a massive 17 points behind at the\nend of foil, scores standing at 28 \u2013 45.\nEpee was up next and the epeeists set\nthemselves the lofty target of improving upon the foilists\u2019 performance, even\nif victory seemed impossible. Tim Harford-Cross set hearts a-fluttering with\na fine 5 \u2013 3 win in the opening match\nbefore Sjoerd \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d Miedema reminded Imperial their cause\nwas hopeless with a 1 \u2013 7 defeat against\nthe infamous Tom Bennett. Chris and\nSjoerd continued to drop points with 4\n\u2013 5 and 3 \u2013 5 losses before Tim actually\nput Imperial into the lead for epee with\na stunning 12 \u2013 2 victory. Chris failed\nto capitalize, going down to a 2 \u2013 8 loss\nand Bennett again proving impossible\nto handle. Sjoerd and Chris kept Imperial in it right until the end with 7 \u2013 5\nand 5 \u2013 4 wins before it was Tim\u2019s turn\nto face Bennett\u2019s unrestrained wrath,\ncrumpling to a 0 \u2013 6 defeat to leave the\nfinal epee scores at 39 \u2013 45 and Imperial\u2019s chance of victory vanishingly slim.\nCharlie Hennings opened the sabre\nin much the same fashion, losing 3 \u2013 5\nto a Bennett who seemed unperturbed\nfencing an unfamiliar weapon, and\nNathan B. ensured Imperial stayed on\nthe inexorable path to defeat by then\nsuffering a 1 \u2013 5 loss. Team captain\nMaurice Berk gave Imperial one last\nglimmer of hope with a resounding 9\n\u2013 5 win in his first appearance of the\ngame before Nathan B.\u2019s 3 \u2013 5 defeat\nfinally put the result beyond doubt.\nCharlie and Maurice compounded\nImperial\u2019s misery with 4 \u2013 5 and 1 \u2013 5\nlosses respectively, and neither Nathan\nB.\u2019s following 5 \u2013 5 draw nor Maurice\u2019s 6\n\u2013 5 win proved any consolation. Charlie went down to a 3 \u2013 5 defeat in the\nfinal match to a backdrop of Imperial\u2019s\nhope and dreams going up in flames \u2013\nfinal scores for the game standing at\n103 \u2013 135.

Almost too good.\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar\nto Minesweeper mixed with a dash of\nSudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink\ngrid is by drawing crosses around any\nzeros. Drawing crosses is purely done\nto so that you know where there can\u2019t\npossibly be a line. So, take the pattern\nbelow as an example. Begin by drawing\ncrosses, then by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in the\nfollowing directions:\nSlitherlink 1,415\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,414 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\nTEXT US!

My mood is up and down faster\nthan an excited electron and I have no\nidea why! It\u2019s beginning to affect all aspects of my life and I don\u2019t know how\nto deal with it! Please help me before I\ncompletely lose the plot!\nRollercoaster Baby\nDear Rollercoaster Baby,\nCalling it a mid-life crisis is a tad\nmelodramatic, don\u2019t you think? Perhaps when you start losing your rag at\nsomeone who bumps you in the tube\nstation accidentally you should pause\na second and think about whether this\nis a fight you are likely to win. There\u2019s\nno point getting into conflict unless\nyou\u2019re sure you\u2019ll come out as the win-ner. If you\u2019re generally feeling the inevitable midterm stress and wondering\nhow on Earth we ended up mid November when Freshers\u2019 week was only\nlast week then perhaps you should take\nsome time to pamper yourself a bit. I\ndon\u2019t necessarily mean the facial and\nmanicure type of pampering but why\nnot get your arse off the sofa and get to\nEthos \u2013 exercise it the best way to de-stress. Apparently, drinking and junk\nfood also affect your mental condition\nbut I\u2019m not sure that kind of gruesome\nsacrifice is entirely justified.\nDear Tamara,\nI can\u2019t stay awake in lectures! I\u2019ve tried\neverything \u2013 biting the back of my hand,\nstabbing it with a sharp pencil. Nothing\nworks. As soon as the lights dim for the\npowerpoint slides my eyes my eyes fall\nshut. Is there anything I can do?\nEyes wide shut\nDear Eyes wide shut,\nLess hanky panky at night would be\ngood, then you wouldn\u2019t be so tired.\nYou could develop a crush on someone\nin the lecture theatre and then you\u2019d\nbe too preoccupied with pulling sexy\nfacial expressions to think about sleep.\nOn the other hand, what difference\ndoes it make if you nap anyway? No\none listens to the words in a lecture so\nyou may as well nap while the lecturer\nfills a board and then copy it down.\nNext board \u2013 next nap. It\u2019ll help avoid\nthose pesky eye bags. You can combine\nthe two and fall asleep on your crush\u2019s\nshoulder for maximum effect.\nDear Tamara,\nI signed up to rowing in my Freshers\u2019\nweek and now I can\u2019t be bothered to get\nout of bed and drag myself all the way\nto the boat house. I\u2019ll just end up sitting in a cold wet boat with other half\ndressed boys and that doesn\u2019t really appeal to me before the sun is even up.\nLazy Boatman\nDear Lazy Boatman\nWhat can I say? Pull your finger out.\nDear Tamara,\nAt home I used to live far away from\nschool and my home life and school life\nwere very separate. At uni, I\u2019m in Beit\nand all my friends come to my room\nafter lectures and hang out all night\nthere. I love my newfound friends but\nI need some time to be alone and pluck\nmy eyebrows and things! Aargh!\nCrowded\nDear Crowded,\nWhy not just politely tell your friends\nto get the fuck out of your room because you need some space? Unless\nthey\u2019re complete idiots, they\u2019ll understand and move their procrastinating a\nfew metres away to the union . If they\nare idiots then why are you freinds with\nthem in the first place? Pity? You could\nof course come up with a cunning plan\ninvolving a contagious airborne illness\nso they will avoid your room but I reckon the honest approach is best.\nDear Tamara,\nShould I spend my money on going to\nFabric or on food? Eating is important\nbut partying is even more so. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m here for after all.\nWhat do you think?\nStarving Party-Boy\nDear Starving Party-Boy\nFood will only make you fat and nobody likes a porker \u2013 whatever chance\nyou once had of pulling will be lost.\nOn the other hand \u2013 going out is your\nbest bet on finding a girl willing to accompany you to your room so you can\nshow her your collection of C++ codes.\nYou will get laid and you will be happy.\nEasiest problem I\u2019ve ever had!\n3 2 2\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3 2 1 1\n2\n3 2\n1 2 1\n2\n1 3 1\n0 2\n1 2\n1\n3\n3\n1\n3\n1\n0\n2\n0 2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2 2\n3\n2 1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3 2\n2\n2 2\n2 3\n3 3 3\n1\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n3 2\n3\n2\nVirgo\nGuys, the gym is\nthe place to go if\nyou want to check\nout some ass.

Rosie Milton explores what happens when\nRussian artists get on the hallucinogens at Mushrooms of the Russian Avant-Garde\nI\u2019m sure the exhibition won\u2019t look this terrifying when you go. Also, despite appearances, the exhibits are not edible.\nSix Characters in Search of an Author\nThe Gielgud\u2019s latest production offers a modern slant on a classic. Natalia Jardon King reports back\nThe modern take reinterprets and gives Pirandello\u2019s (r) work a decidedly fresh and modern slant. It seems they\u2019ve carried his classic and impeccable sense of style too.\nT\nhe last time I wrote for\nfelix, it was regarding\nthe Cold War Modern:\nDesign exhibition at the\nV&A museum. From this\nperspective we were able to see the\ndirect impact the Cold War had on\nthe creatively-minded of the era \u2013 domestically in terms of propaganda and\nmost importantly, the strong impression of nationalism which it implied.\nMoving along a few years, Igor\nMakarevich and Elena Elagina reveal\nto us the strong connections that\nthey \u2018experienced\u2019, whilst under the\ninfluence of psilocybins, to the culture\nand history of their Russia.\nThrough the creative media of\nsculpture, photography, film and\npainting they have chosen to share\nwith the public the truths (and lies,\nshould we say) that the world of\nmagic mushrooms presents to those\nwho choose to indulge in a trip\ndown the rabbit hole with them. Not\nbeing someone who can at first-hand\nshare the visions of a \u201cmycophiliac\nmenace\u201d, as artistically described by\nthe exhibition\u2019s curator Nadim Julien\nSamman, I can only reveal to the reader\nmy interpretation from a critical point\nof view.\nAbout the mushroom: Amanita\nmuscaria, or the fly agaric (the most\nwell recognised of the basidiomycete\nfungi), is effectively a poisonous, yet\npsychoactive toadstool \u2013 instantly\nrecognisableforitsdeepredmushroom\nwith white spotted spores on its\nsurface and its white stalk. Reactions\nfrom ingestion vary in individuals and\ncan range from nausea, euphoria and\nrelaxation to delirium \u2013 in the case of\nsevere poisoning. It is made very clear\nto visitors of the exhibition that the\nartists not only ingested but encourage\nthe use of mushrooms for recreational\nand revelatory purposes.\nMushrooms & Russia: the\nconnection? There is certainly a lot of\nhistory behind the exhibition, implied\nthrough multiple depictions of Russian\narchitecture, the realised and the\n\u2018fantasized\u2019 also, including especially\nVladimir Tatlin\u2019s constructivist,\nutopian tower \u2013 \u2018Monument to the\nR\nupert Goold and Ben Power have produced another\nclassic with a twist. After\ncombining the Chapman\nBrothers with \u2018Dr Faustus\u2019, they have re-interpreted Pirandello\u2019s \u2018Six Characters in Search of an\nAuthor\u2019.\nIn the 1921 original, six characters\nstorm into a stage rehearsal and demand that their story be told. Abandoned by their creator, this is their\nonly hope of release. The modern production at the Gielgud Theatre sees\nthe family intrude on a TV drama-documentary about assisted suicide in\nDenmark.\nBefore the six characters invade the\nscene, the producer and her colleagues\nare striving to construct an engaging\nbut faithful representation of death.\nOnce interrupted, the family introduce\nthe more controversial debate as to\nwho is real in the play- the characters\nthemselves, the actors hired for dramatic reconstruction in the Danish\ndocumentary, or the producer?\nThis is definitely a fresh interpreta-Third International\u2019 (1919).\n\u201cthe exhibition\noffers a\nfresh and\nunderstandable\nversion of events\nfar removed\nfrom the dusty\naccounts of\nhistorians\u201d\nTo Makarevich and Elagina\nretrospectively, the idea of the \u2018tower\u2019\nwas a dark and oppressive image. It was\nTatlin\u2019s design for a new headquarters\nof a world communist government.\nThe implication therefore is that Tatlin\nwas acting in the spirit of irrationality,\nyet simultaneously was driven by the\nforce of objectivity.\nMakarevich and Elagina want\nus to understand what they have\nunderstood from the past, from their\nperspective. Although ideas filtered\nthrough psychedelics are not exactly\nstable, it offers a fresh and bizarrely\nunderstandable version of events\nfrom history that are far removed\nfrom the dusty and factual accounts of\nhistorians.\nTurning now to the works\nthemselves, we are presented with a\nroom of several similar paintings -roughly cut, grainy photographs are\nused to frame silhouettes of the iconic\nfly agaric - in the thinking of these\nartists it has become symbol for their\nown (mind) revolution.\nThere are wooden toadstool\nsculptures like the onion (or\nmushroom)-shaped domes of Russian\nchurches and one with the Tatlin\ntower set upon it, with an ornamental\nCorinthium column base \u2013 further\nsuggesting the direct relation to\narchitecture.\nThese images raise all kinds of ironic\nand interpretive questions regarding\nreligion and the social systems of\nRussia, inviting consideration. In a\nfeatured fascinating video recording,\nSergei Kurehin proceeds to inform us,\nin all seriousness, that he has proof that\nRussian revolutionary and communist\nVladimir Lenin was a mushroom.\nThrough simple, technical diagrams\nhe shares his claim (available to view\non YouTube if you need convincing)\nand in turn allows us to understand\nthe structure of Makarevich and\nElagina\u2019s work more clearly. Out of\nthe mushrooms grow ideas and it is\nthis method of presentation that the\nartists have chosen, all the time in\nkeeping with the notion that \u2018seeing\nis believing\u2019 and with the inspiration\nprovided by the hallucinogenic power\nof mushrooms, we can see the world\nthrough Makarevich and Elagina\u2019s\neyes.\nMushrooms of the Russian\nAvant-Garde will be on view at\nClub Row, E2 until 22 November.\nAdmission is free.\ntion, but the engrossing tragedy of Pirandello\u2019s family steals the lime-light.\nSuicide, sibling murder and incest\nseem more interesting when compared\nto a discussion concerning levels of reality in art.\nThere are moments when the audience squirm silently in their seats- in\nparticular at the re-enactment of\nthe Father\u2019s assault on his own step-daughter.\nWe are entranced as McDiarmid\nsinisterly snips Denise Gough's suspenders before transforming her into\na doll-like child. It shocks and justifies the previous accusations that the\nFather had exposed his paedophiliac\npreference by his daily visits to the\ngirl's school gates. McDiarmid and\nGough give the best performances by\ncapturing the guilt and desperation\nthat inhabit their lives. The scene is\nbrilliantly capped off by the mother\u2019s\ninterruption and sudden rendering of\npain through an operatic aria.\nBut it fails to present an awe-inspir-ing production. Perhapsbecause the\nsubsequent tragedy of the producer is\ndwarfed by that of the family or maybe\nbecause as clever as the producer\u2019s\nwandering backstage is, stumbling all\nthe way to next door\u2019s Les Miserables\nseemed redundant, time-consuming\nand even absurd. It\u2019s a pity, for the\n20 minute stretch was in fact a detriment to what should have been a very\nmoving end. That\u2019s not to say however\nthat Noma Dumezweni doesn\u2019t give\nher character force. And it\u2019s worth the\nvisit- if only for the beautiful depiction\nof chaos, pain and dark fears of the Pirandellian family.\nphoenix\nOUT NEXT WEEK\nPick up your free\ncopy with felix\n\n"

There they laid out\nthe fundamental guidelines which were\nto rule state and people for centuries to\ncome. Guidelines which could not be\ncrossed yet not set in stone but set in\nthe hearts and minds of the populace.\nNaturally The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual union have been\namended no less than twenty three\ntimes to follow the course of time and\nthe ever changing zeitgeist. The European Union set out to copy the Americansbyadoptingasimilarstanceforthe\nfederation of Europe. The story of the\nEuropean constitution starts with the\nLaken declaration in 2001. The Laken\ndeclaration derives its name from the\nEuropean council meeting which was\nheld in Laken, Belgium in December\n2001. The declaration introduced the\nEuropean Convention which was a\nbody set up to produce a draft of the\nEuropean constitution (now known\nas the Treaty of Lisbon) it was chaired\nby the former French president Val\u00e9ry\nGiscard d'Estaing and this is where our\nstory begins.\nIn 2004 the then 25 member strong\nunion signed the Treaty establishing\na Constitution for Europe (TCE) but\nis more commonly referred to as the\nEuropean Constitution. Establishing a\nconstitution is a messy business by any\nstandards, this any barrister with training in constitutional law will tell you.\nFurthermore it is ironic to say the least\nthat the Americans managed to, 230\nyears ago, compose a document that\nwas more comprehensible than what\nthe supposedly learned citizens of Europe compiled in the 21st century.\nIn true democratic fashion something so substantial and which affects\nthe state as much as a constitution has\nto be ratified by the people (though\nmost countries preferred to adopt\nwhat some call \u2018backdoor democracy\u2019\nwhereupon the parliament denies the\npeople a say, through parliamentary\nrepresentation, on an issue which will\nhave a considerable impact upon their\nlives). The first country to put the\nWith the influx of new member states, the European Union must adapt by developing a new treaty, or constitution, governing the organisation\nThe European Parliament, an important political arena or a greedy, undemocratic body?\nconstitution to the people was France\non the 29th of May 2005 the people\nvoted. Three days later the electorate\nof the Netherlands were called upon\nto deliver their judgement. Rather embarrassingly for Brussels both nations\ndelivered a resounding \u2018no\u2019 (54.68%\nagainst in France and 61.54% against in\nthe Netherlands). Alas the constitution\nwas dead. Or so it was believed\u2026\nIn view of the fact that such a significant member of the EU (France)\nhad rejected the final piece of the European federation project they could\nnot be bullied into voting again, apparently smaller nations, however,\nare not allowed to speak their minds\n(like Ireland) and have to be politically\nbeaten into submission i.e. by having a second referendum for daring to\ndefy the powers that be. Consequently\nMr. d\u2019Estaing and his team had to go\nback to the drawing board to appease\nthe people of France and the Netherlands. What they produced was the\nTreaty of Lisbon. The workings of the\nformer treaty and the latter are difficult to understand, as we shall see\nlater, for good reasons. But just to give\na good example of how arrogant and\nignorant the EU is consider this: one of\nthe problems the people had with the\nconstitution was that it gave too much\nprominence to the notion of the EU as\na state. Thus all references to the flag,\nanthem, motto and a public holiday\nwere removed (the treaty is still 231\npages long as opposed to ten pages\nfor the American constitution). But in\ntrue EU fashion they reinstated them\nin October this year in the midst of\nthe financial crisis \u2013 when one would\nhave thought that they would have better things to do. Former Italian Prime\nMinister Giuliano Amato succinctly\nsums up the mood of the EU towards\nthe people: \u201cThey decided that the\ndocument should be unreadable. If it is\nunreadable, it is not constitutional, that\nwas the sort of perception\u2026 Should\nyou succeed in understanding it at first\nsight there might be some reason for a\nreferendum, because that would mean\nthat there is something new.\u201d\nFrom the continent to the \u201csceptical\nlittle isle\u201d; in their 2005 manifesto the\nLabour party promised, if they won a\nthird term in office, they to would put\nthe constitution to the people. Looking\nat their manifesto from this period further reinforces this pledge; \u201cThe new\nConstitutional Treaty ensures the new\nEurope can work effectively\u2026 we will\nput it to the British people in a referendum\u201d. As previously stated the TCE\nwas thrown out by voters in France and\nthe Netherlands and was thus judged\ndead by politicians in the UK hence\na referendum on a dead constitution\nis illogical and the issue was not further pursued. As always with the EU\na \u2018no\u2019 is considered a complete rejection of the entire European project\nand is thus deemed unacceptable (Ire-land was made to revote on the Nice\ntreaty in 2002 so was Denmark on the\nMaastricht treaty in 1993 \u2013 for having rejected both initially). Hence the\n'Draft Treaty amending the Treaty on\nEuropean Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community'\nmore commonly known as the Treaty\nof Lisbon was put before the world in\nJuly last year.\nLittle time passed between the announcement of the treaty and the calls\nfor a referendum. Most voters were\nshocked, as was the media, to learn\nthat the government, now lead by Mr.\nBrown, did not consider the Treaty\nof Lisbon equivalent to the European\nConstitution. There are a few reasons\nfor this: the constitution attempted to\nreplace all earlier EU treaties and start\nafresh, whereas the new treaty amends\nthe Treaty on the European Union\n(Treaty of Maastricht) and the Treaty\nEstablishing the European Community\n(Treaty of Rome) - the UK was particularly adamant for a modest \"amend-ing treaty\", which could be ratified by\nmeans of a parliamentary vote, like\nearlier EU treaties, i.e. circumventing\ntheir 2005 manifesto pledge to hold a\nreferendum on the constitutional trea-ty. Another reason being that Euroscpeticism is very much alive in the UK,\nfor example recently the Bedfordshire\ntown of Luton, in a mock election,\nvoted 54% to 35% to leave the EU, thus\nthe prospects of winning a referendum\non a treaty which effectively creates\nthe state of Europe are slim. In conclusion their stance became as such: since\nit is not the same constitution New\nLabour does not have to honour their\nmanifesto, indeed YouGov (a market\nresearch firm) poll for the Telegraph\nin October 2007 showed that 94% of\nthe people did not believe the Government\u2019s argument that the Treaty is different to the constitution. This breach\nof trust between the government and\nthe people would turn out to be particularly embarrassing for New Labour\nand Gordon Brown.\nIn 2008 Paul Stephenson and Lorraine Mullally of I want a referendum\n(iWar) wrote an article for the Spectator where they address the key issue of\nthe government\u2019s broken promise; that\nthe treaty is not the same as the con-stitution. In their article we find that\nno less than twelve heads of state regard the treaty the same as the rejected\nconstitution yet the omniscient British\nprime minister appears to running an\nentirely different agenda by contradicting his European counterparts by\nstating that the two documents are\nfundamentally different. Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, Telegraph, 29\nJune 2007: \u201cThe substance of the Constitution is preserved. That is a fact\u201d.\nGuy Verhofstadt, Belgian Prime Minister, Agence Europe, 24 June 2007:\n\u201c[the new treaty] takes up the most important elements of the Constitutional\nTreaty project.\u201d Even a European Commission representative in the form\nof Margot Wallstrom had something\ncheerful to say about the resemblance\nof the two documents: \u201cIt [the Treaty\nof Lisbon] is essentially the same proposal as the old Constitution.\u201d\nOpen Europe (a think tank) published a mammoth 263 page-by-page\ncomparison of the Lisbon Treaty and\nthe TCE. In 2005, Brown in an interview with the Evening Standard told\nthe reporter in regards to the EU treaty\n\u201cIt's not as though this is being imposed on the country. People will have\nthe chance to put their views.\" This is\nin stark contrast with \"[if it] were the\nold constitutional treaty, we would\nbe having a referendum\" yet the iWar\ncampaign along with Open Europe\nfound that the treaty contains 96% of\nthe old content and only 6 articles of\nthe original 448, relating to symbols,\nhad been removed \u2013 but they have\nalready been reinstated as shown (ar-ticles of symbols) and the 448 articles\nhave been amalgamated into 70 larger\nones yet with the same content.\nRegrettable is not a strong enough\nword to describe this great deception\nfor never before have so few decided\nso much for so many. This should be\nenough compelling evidence to convince anyone that the treaty is in fact\nthe same as the old constitution and\nthat the government with Mr. Brown at\nits helm should honour their manifes-to. However just to make it irrevocably\nunambiguous consider the words of the\nchief architect of both documents Mr.\nd\u2019Estaing \u201cThe treaty of Lisbon is the\nsame as the rejected constitution. Only\nthe format has been changed to avoid\nreferendums\u201d. Davy Crockett once said\nthat \u201cI would rather be politically dead\nthan hypocritically immortalized\u201d. Mr.\nBrown clearly does not share this sentiment for in October 2007 he was quoted as saying \u201cThe manifesto is what we\nput to the public. We\u2019ve got to honour\nthat manifesto. That is an issue of trust\nfor me with the electorate\u201d.\n\n"

Most, however, seem to be just a\ngood old fashioned waste of my time.\nHowever, contraception based emergencies aside, I can think of no better example of time-wasting than the\npetition.\nAccording to a highly valued internet\nsource (that may or may not have been\nthrown together by a despotic bunch\nof unemployable English Literature\ngraduates and passed off as an ency-clopaedia) the petition has its origins\nin Imperial China, whereby Emperors\nwould remove corrupt members of\ngovernment office by the will of ordinary people. Clearly that idea took off,\nseeing as now in China ordinary people are \u201cremoved\u201d by corrupt members\nof government office.\nAnd so hundreds of years of pointless endeavour recently culminated in\nPetitions: a waste of perfectly good ink\nsomeone thrusting a piece of paper\nin my face and demanding that I sign\nin order to get the Gaza strip border\narea opened and allow some student to\ncome and study at Imperial. I signed,\nand along with the sheer millions of\nother signatories, I of course had the\neffect of going up to the parties involved in this long running religious\nand political conflict, slapping them\nboth around the face with a wet mackerel and proclaiming loudly \u201cJust sort\nit out, douchebags!\u201d At that instant, the\nstudent in question would magically\nappear at Imperial\u2019s pearly gates and\nseveral extraordinarily well endowed\nwomen would materialise with frozen\nCapri-suns and feed them to me. The\nword \u201cempowerment\u201d doesn\u2019t even\ncome close.\nIn fact (and much to my personal\ndismay), none of these things hap-pened. All that happened was that it\nmade me feel a little less guilty than my\nother possible course of action, which\nwas to tell the petitioner to entertain\nthemselves with a part of my anatomy.\nI appreciate that once upon a time\npetitions used to work- back in a time\nbefore Pigs had evolved to lose their\nwings- governments believed in the\nwholesome notion of democracy and\nlistened to the paper based woes of\ntheir citizens. But you can hardly blame\nthem for not caring anymore when they\nare inundated with thousands of mind-numbingly stupid requests. I have\ntaken a few choice requests from the\nnumber10.gov.uk e-petition website:\n\u2022 \u201cMake all animal killing illegal\u201d- 3\nsignatories; admittedly most of these\nare from people who have taken the\n\u201cname\u201d box to mean \u201ccomment\u201d and\nfilled it with hilarity such as \u201cwe\u2019re\nmeat eaters you dope.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cStop VATing chocolate biscuits\u201d- 6\nsignatories, including an amusing aside\nabout Jaffa cake classification.\n\u2022 And my personal favourite, from\na Lady called Lisa with most intuitive economic mind I\u2019ve seen in years:\n\u201cPrint lots of money to clear the debt.\u201d\nThis was alongside the comment: \u201cwhy\nwould it ruin the economy??? It\u2019s already near to ruin, if extra money was\ngiven to the banks from a machine,\nrather than our taxes, this could only\nhelp everyone.\u201d Thanks Lisa. (In fair-ness, someone did ask \u201cLisa, is ignorance really bliss?\u201d)\nThese were all, rather worryingly,\ngenuine. Even the petitions with the\nmost signatures have just become\nan opportunity for government spin,\nwhere the PM\u2019s press army replies\nwith how the government has actually\nalready tackled this issue, and they in\nfact are the shit. The problem is people have become so self-absorbed that\nthey feel they can write about their\ninsignificant woes and post them into\nthe public domain; actually we couldn\u2019t\ngive a damn about Johnny Bellend\u2019s\nchocolate digestive dilemma. In fact,\neven causes that deserve public recognition are lost in a swarm of insanity,\nwhich is a shame; despite the pointless\nnature of the petition, it can very occasionally be a pathway to something\nbigger.\nSo the next time someone tries to\nforce feed you good intention, don\u2019t\nbother in subjugating yourself to their\nwhims.\nBe more man than I was and actually\ndo the planet and civilization a favour-save the ink and the paper.\nJaimie Henry\nS\no, for the last fortnight my\nboyfriend has been pretty\nmuch constantly in and out\nof hospital. No, I realise you\ndon\u2019t care, just bear with me\nfor a minute. There\u2019s a really satisfying\nrant you can get all opinionated about\ncoming up in a second.\nI\u2019m a chemist. Largely, this means\nspending 2-3 hours a day in lectures,\n6 hours a day in labs, 2-3 hours a day\nwriting up reports and problem sheets,\nand 8 hours a day whinging about it.\nSometimes we even sleep. I could be\nwrong but I\u2019m pretty sure most courses\nat IC have at least that workload by the\nstart of the second year. Hence, when\nyou\u2019re actually not just skiving, being\nforced to miss large chunks of college\nis worrying, especially if you\u2019re actually\nplanning on coming out of all this with\na degree.\nMy boyfriend then. He has Crohn\u2019s\ndisease (yes, I know you\u2019ve all figured\nout who I am now, shut up for a sec).\nThe other weekend I had to take him\ninto hospital for a major flare up,\nwhere we were terrified his intestines\nhad ruptured. This week, he\u2019s in for\nmajor surgery, and there\u2019s not much\nwhich can really be done about it. Both\ntimes we were majorly dicked around\nStop treating us like snotty teenagers\nby the hospitals \u2013 not really anyone\u2019s\nfault, but no less annoying for having\nto sit around waiting for 3 days, each\nnight being told they\u2019d defnitely have\na bed for us by tomorrow morning.\nThere\u2019s been stress, there\u2019s been sleepless nights, there\u2019s been tears. This isn\u2019t\na request for sympthy, you understand,\njust an explanation of the situation to\nemphasise the next point.\nWhen I found out, last Friday, that I\nwas probably going to spend a lot of the\ntwo weeks after that up and down from\nOxford, I sent an email to a bunch of\npeople in my department, explaining\nthe situation, and that I would probably be sporadically absent for a while. It\ntook them until Monday for even ONE\nperson to reply, and I quote:\n\u201cI am sorry to hear of your boyfriend\u2019s unfortunate medical condi-tion. However, it is difficult to give you\nvery much leeway as you are not the\none who is actually ill.\u201d\nOk, this is an angry article, so I\nshould probably also note that I was\ngiven a \u201cfew extra days\u201d to hand in my\nnext report, but still. The idea that it\u2019s\nonly if you\u2019re ill that you should be up-set? Bullshit. His parents, obviously,\nhave time off work. The institutions\nwhich are PAYING them for a service\nare prepared to let them off because,\nobviously, they\u2019re upset that someone\nthey love is going under the knife. The\ninstitution I am paying to educate me\ncan\u2019t be flexible for two damn weeks.\nI\u2019m prepared to bet that if I was a mar-ried, mature student whose husband\nwas having surgery, they\u2019d feel differ-ently. In fact, I know this is the case,\nbecase it happened to my mum.\nAnother example: I don\u2019t know about\nyour department but mine has always\nrammed it down my throat that if you\ndon\u2019t revise/work over Easter you\u2019ll do\nsignificantly less well in your summer\nexams. During my first year, a member of my immediate family attempted\nsuicide over the Easter holidays, which\ndefinitely damaged my attempts to\nwork. The response of college? \u201cYou\nhave the whole of the summer term\nto revise.\u201d The whole of the summer\nterm? We have LECTURES in summer\nterm! We have new shit to learn, never\nmind revising the old stuff.\nI get there are rules. I get that the\nacademic and adinistrative staff are\njust doing their jobs. I also get that\nundergrads at Imperial are treated\nlike a fucking afterthought. I\u2019ll admit\nI\u2019m not the best student, even when\nhealthy and in college, but speaking\nas someone whose university time has\nbeen plagued with illnesses and family\nemergencies I can tell you that the general attitude of the institution is one of\ncontempt. They act as if giving you full\ncredit retakes should remove all your\nworries \u2013 as if it\u2019s not doubly stressful\ndoing the exams twice AND having\nother issues in your life. The first assumption is always that the student is\ntrying to get something for nothing.\nThe stereotype is that we\u2019re lazy, self-ish, immature... - fuck that.\nI don\u2019t want this to be taken as an attack on the staff, who by and large are\nsympathetic on a personal level and\nin any case just doing their jobs, but\nthe frustration of having metaphorical\neyes rolled every time you have to explain something is draining to say the\nleast. Particularly if it\u2019s not like you\u2019re\nnot proposing to make up the work.\nImperial students are, in the majority,\neither hardworking or bright enough\nthat it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t personally know anyone who doesn\u2019t, when it\ngets right down to it, work their asses\noff for the best grade they can acheive.\nIt\u2019d be really nice if the people who\nwrite the rules could stop treating us\nlike snotty teenagers. And now I\u2019m off\nto make up some time in labs.\nCalliope Muse\nStudent Television of Imperial College\nGot an issue with the Union?\nTake it to Jenny Morgan, the Union President, in stoic tv\u2019s exclusive\n\u2018Ask the President\u2019 program, where the President is faced with your\nburning questions. Autumn 2008 Episode Friday 21st November.\nEmail your questions to:\naskthepresident@stoictv.com\nS\no, who thinks Healthy Living Week was a success? Oh,\ndid you not know it was on?\nYou know those hideous pastel yellow t-shirts that were\ndotted around college last week? Yeah,\nthey were for HLW, organised by our\nDPCS and Sport Imperial. When I say\norganised though, I am using it in the\nloosest possible terms.\nThat\u2019s right, this is going to be a bit of\na rant peeps so take this as your warn-ing; I\u2019m a woman scorned and I\u2019ve had\na lot of caffeine!! It\u2019s a long story folks\nand I\u2019m liable to go off on one about\nit given half a chance but I\u2019ll try and\nkeep this concise if only to keep you\nreading\u2026\nAll sports clubs were given the opportunity to run a session as part of\nHLW. Netball girls vs. Rugby boys \u2013\nthe grudge match \u2013 seemed like a great\nsuggestion to me and original feedback\nfrom the \u201cpowers that be\u201d was equally\npositive. We were envisioning a similar event to the one we ran last year for\ncharity where the boys wore dresses\nand got majorly put in their place by a\nbunch of girls who like to wear pink,\nhappy times :) Everyone that I spoke to\nwas looking forward to it.\nFast-forward to Wednesday 6th, the\nday before the session we\u2019d been allo-cated. Whilst conversing with a friend,\nand after checking a HLW flyer, I realised there was a clash: Netball/Rugby\nand Kondi were scheduled at the same\ntime \u2013 quelle horreur!! I immediately\ngot on the phone to SI to alert them of\nthis most disastrous discovery!!\nNot so happy with Healthy Living Week\nCue lots of shizzle \u201cbehind the\nscenes\u201d (this I\u2019m still investigating into\nas everyone involved is being oddly\nsecretive, hmmm\u2026). Eventually I was\ncalled late on Wednesday evening with\nsome alternative offers:\n- Kondi were given preference and\nwe were booted out of our original slot,\nno room for questions.\n- Then we were offered an area the\nsize of a Badminton court (bearing in\nmind that we need a space four times\nthat size and netball court markings)\nso that was a definite no from my end\nstraight away.\n- Finally we were told we could share\nHandball\u2019s slot (great idea \u2013 drag another sports team into the mess you\u2019ve\ncreated. Have they been apologised to?\nI doubt it). This would involve sharing\nfor half the session and then being able\nto have the full court for a game after\nthat.\nUltimately when I turned up on the\nday I was told this had been changed\nyet again though to us only having\n10minutes of full court game time.\nClearly lots more shizzle had happened\nbehind the scenes. Is it too much to ask\nthat if I\u2019m running a slot I be kept informed and be consulted on decisions?\nApparently yes.\nTo top it all off I was told that we\nwere actually supposed to be running\na \u201ccome and try\u201d session and that our\nplanned event did not comply with\nthe intended criteria of HLW. Where\nwas this opinion of us two months ago\nwhen I originally suggested it? Who\nknows, least of all the DPCS or SI.\nBasically \u2013 sort your lives out people!!\nIf you want to masquerade as some\nsort of professional unit then please do\nattempt at least a vague level of organisation and communication.\nSport Imperial have offered to pay\nfor the umpire we hired and are coming round to the idea of an alternative\nslot but the proposal is accompanied\nby many conditions that still need to be\nfinalised so watch this space; you know\nif I\u2019m not happy I\u2019ll be back for further\nbitching.\nIn conclusion though, what we hope\nto receive is a proper apology for being messed around and another hour-long slot in Ethos for free where we can\nrun our session as originally intended.\nIt will be for charity so if I promise to\nkeep you informed you guys have to\npromise to attend and support. Guess\nI\u2019ll see you all soon at Netball vs. Rugby\n\u2013 the grudge match (take II).\nPS. I\u2019m sure I was supposed to get\none of those granny-yellow tops for\nrunning a session? Holla back to me on\nthat note too pls whilst you\u2019re at it SI.\nPPS. Imperial Girl, whadafuh? I love\nthe idea of a Sex and the City style article but if that\u2019s going to be the concept\nbehind it then I want to see it written\nby someone who\u2019s getting more action\nthan me or it\u2019s not what I\u2019d call enter-tainment. Plus, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a\nshortage of guys at Imperial so you\u2019ve\nno excuse!!\nSpanky Pants\nThe rugby boys before they got embarrassed by the girls\n\n"

Of particular note, the\nUnion entertainments have been awesome as of late. This has been the best\nfreshers\u2019 week, and even first time in\nIC history. I find it a shame though that\nthere was such a conflict between the\nfaculty unions and the central union\nover the masquerade ball, which was\nhighlighted in last week issue of felix.\nIt seems that a great misunderstanding\nbetween the two cause such an upset.\nSure things were not timetabled in the\ngreatest way, but I assure there is no\nwar between the Union and the other\nparties. I personally didn\u2019t think that\nlast weeks article came out a little unjust toward the efforts both sides made\nfor their events. I hope that now things\nhave \u201cblown over\u201d the faculty unions\ncan work with the central union to better co-ordinate events. This can surely\nresult in bigger better and higher attended events.\nThe Union\nisn\u2019t all bad\n26 felix Friday 14 November 2008\nClubs & Societies Is your club cooler than the cat that\ngot the cream?

Nathaniel wasn\u2019t\nsure where he had overtaken the mini-bus, never mind he must have been\nhalf asleep at the wheel. In the wait for\nthe minibus the hall heating, yes it had\nheating, was cranked up to the max\nalong with the stereo and it\u2019s slightly\noff-putting record collection.\nSaturday\u2019s weather was calm, sunny\nand just plain gorgeous for the Lakes\nin November. It was decided to try and\nbag Helvellyn and Striding Edge making the most of the weather. Helvellyn\nseemed like a great idea until we arrived at the car park, \u00a312 for a minibus\nFor those of you who were somehow\nunaware, Saturday 1st November saw\nthe IC Debating Society play host to\nthe IC Intervarsity Debating Competition (IV), sponsored by Glencore and\nthe IC Finance Society. Universities\nfrom across the buzzing debating scene\nwere invited to participate. Teams from\nas far afield as the European Business\nSchool near Frankfurt along with more\nfamiliar faces from institutions such\nas Oxford and Cambridge all competed for the highly coveted title of the\n\u201cMaster-debater\u201d!\nThought provoking, amusing and\nat times bizarre points of view were\nheard along with numerous opinions\nthat were more often than not stated\nas facts! A variety of subjects were explored in depth, including the legitimacy of public funding in science and\nthe evaluation and reassessment of the\nrole that our democratic system should\nplay.\nThe final rounds saw Sam Block\nand Aliyah Akram of Cambridge (A)\ntriumph over Middle Temple, King\u2019s\nCollege and LSE on the motion that\n\u2018This house would be pacifist\u2019, by arguing that the United Kingdom should\ndisband HM Armed Forces and adopt\na new defence policy of passive resist-with the machine only accepting \u00a31\ncoins, which genius decided that. With\nall pockets emptied everyone set off up\ntowards a snow, ice and cloud covered\nsummit. A change to the route was\nmade as Striding Edge wasn\u2019t passable\ndue to ice. Nathaniel managed to miss\nthe summit of Helvellyn arriving at the\ntrig point one meter below. On the way\ndown Nathaniel slipped, landed in a\npuddle and took out Evelyne making\nher new trousers muddy, she wasn\u2019t\npleased.\nMost awoke on Sunday with a slight\nhang-over to beautiful clear skies and\na 15km walk ahead of them. Nathaniel decided to beast everyone around\nthe Coniston Fells which includes The\nOld Man, Swirl and Wetherlam with\na small amount of scrambling in be-tween. The views from the top were\nbrilliant stretching from Lake Windermere to Scafell Pike making the hours\nof pain in the minibus worthwhile. Jon\ncelebrated at the top of the Old Man\nwith a cup of Pims, something that\u2019s\nbecoming quite a tradition.\nLeaving later than planned and getting stuck in endless M6 roadwork\ntraffic our weekend of fantastic weather finished with a gourmet meal from\neither KFC or Burger King at Warwick\nServices. All in all a great trip, check\nthe photo\u2019s at www.fellwanderers.com.\nIf you fancy a trip to the countryside\nany time soon, come and join us; 12:30\nin Beit Quad on a Tuesday for more\ninformation.\nBlessedbysunshineintheLakeDistrict\nIntervarsity Debating Competition at IC\nance \u201cas Gandhi would have wanted\u201d.\nFred Cowell and James Prior of Middle Temple also took home the title of\nbest team on the tab; James Prior also\nclinched \u2018the best speaker\u2019 position.\nIf you have read this far down the article and any of it sounded provocative\nand of interest (or perhaps you just feel\ncompelled to have your point of view\nheard on any number of controversial\ntopics) then do come along to one of\nour meetings at 6.00pm every Wednesday in the Sir Alexander Fleming building \u2013 room 119, or email debate@im-perial.ac.uk. This year promises to be\nan active one for the Debating Society,\npresenting members with the opportunity to receive coaching from world-class debaters and participate in many\ncompetitions at different universities\nnationwide. We also have a team going to Cork in the Republic of Ireland\nthis New Year to partake in the World\nUniversities Debating Championships,\nso all in all it looks set to be an exciting year.\nThank you, once again, to our generous sponsors, Glencore and the IC Finance Society - without their support\nthe IV would not have taken place.\nNathaniel Bottrell\nFellwanderer\nKadhim Shubber\nDoes anyone else think I look like Mussolini\n\n"

Geek\nS\norryfortheabsencelastweek,\nI was temporarily paralysed\nfrom the brain down by New\nImperial Girl, and had to be\ntreated with 20ccs of David\nDimbleby and my girlfriend\u2019s cooking.\nOnce I\u2019d managed to clamber to my\nfeet, the deadline was past. Alas. And\nunfortunately it seems that Gilead was\ndrowned out by the emotional freak-show that turned up, which can only\nmean one thing. Ladies and Gentlemen, I hereby declare a State of Emergency within the nation of Imperial. As\na people, I compel you all - cheer the\nfuck up, you miserable cunts.\nWhat the hell are you people whining for now? \u201cAnonymous\u201d, a probably-female student who seems to be one\nFacebook friend rejection off of slashing her wrists, was just the entr\u00e9e last\nweek.\nNew Imperial Girl follows that up\nwith the heavy suffering of not being\nable to shower in order to stop herself\nfrom wasting her life away - inciden-tally, my dear, if you\u2019re curious as to\nwhy men aren\u2019t interested at Imperial, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not just the shallow ones who appreciate clean women.\nThen the delightful \u201cWatcher\u201d who\nwishes that those golly-gosh darned\nlife-saving medics could just be a bit\nmore polite when they\u2019re trying to give\nunprepared, equipment-less, off-duty\nemergency medical assistance. Yes!\nDamn them. Those selfless bastards.\nLook, if the worst thing in your life\nis that a doctor doesn\u2019t doff his cap to\nyou and bow on his way to perform\nan emergency tracheotomy, then my\nfriend, you\u2019ve got a pretty fucking\nsweet existence.\nProbably the cream of the crop last\nweek was Mr. da Flex, a man so ridiculous I half expected the text to fade\nout as I read it and Rick Astley to start\nplaying in the background. What in the\nname of Jar Jar Binks were you talking\nabout, man? You drifted between bit-ter, angry lyric quoting and badly-hid-den regret so frequently that I could\nsmell the tears of grief in the ink. Being\ndepressed is not a good justification\nfor asshattery, especially not the brand\nyou\u2019re peddling; and by that I mean the\nbrand that dresses you up as a charismatic ladies man with a penis like a\nfrench stick and enough testosterone\nto fuel another Madonna world tour.\nLet me tell you, right now I\u2019m sipping\na coffee in an exploitative franchised\noutlet, listening to The Andrews Sisters on my mp3 player. Angst? What\nangst? Yes, there are tasks to be completed before set deadlines and some\ntasks may require time periods that\noverstretch those given. Yes, this coffee is a bit milky. But hey, guess what?\nI\u2019m living in one of the greatest cities in\nthe world, studying at one of the highest levels possible, and I\u2019m not even a\nquarter through my life. I mean, once\nWALL-E arrives in my postbox, it\u2019ll be\nhard to see how I can complain about\nanything, really. Tickler cheddar was\neven on offer in Sainsbury\u2019s. Fucking\nTickler cheddar, everyone. Are you\ngetting this down? What\u2019s there to be\ndepressed about?\nWe all know depression is fun and\ngod knows I love a good wallow too.\nBut the trick is to try and not spread it\naround everyone else. Because the last\nthing people need is another reason to\nbe depressed. Happiness is fashionable,\nfolks. And according to Starbucks, it\u2019s\nofficially Christmas now, so you don\u2019t\nreally have an excuse. Chin up now.\nIf you were affected by any of the issues raised in last week\u2019s Felix, please\ncrawl into a hole and die. Alternatively,\nget in touch with us on our 24-hour\nInsult Helpline by emailing anan-grygeek@googlemail.com. Keep smil-ing, folks.\nMusic felix is my hot, hot sex\nGeek Woman vs Promiscuous Girl\nImperial Girl\nL\nast night was horrific.\nLet me walk you through\nit. Imagine I am studying\nin my room on a Thursday\nnight, dressed in glasses\nand baggies like a right Imperial nerd.\nA couple of days ago a friend had mention his friend was having a few friends\naround at a club night so I was thinking by 8pm, \u201cscrew this work- I need\nto go out\u201d. I didn\u2019t actually want to go\nout, but I somehow had to reconfirm\nmy sanity or more that I was a student and do actually have fun beyond\nstudying... That was my first BIG mis-take. Did I mention that this cute guy\nwas going to be there so I was perhaps\npersuaded to go. Yes, you\u2019ve guessed it-Mistake Number 2.\nSo imagine this, I\u2019m throwing off\n\u201cGeek-Woman\u201d clothes and transforming into \u201cPromiscuous-Girl\u201d clothes.\nWithin seconds you would have never\nof guessed I was a straight-A-student,\nstudying at Imperial with a promising and intellectual future ahead of\nme. But whatever, that\u2019s fine. A bit of\na \u201cDr Jeckle and Mr Hyde\u201d never hurt\nanyone.\nNo! Mistake Number f*king 3. If my\nlife was the lottery draw I would have\nbeen a multiple-time millionaire win-ner. Right so I am off out in my, dare I\nsay it, \u201cfuck-me pumps\u201d walking down\nto Earls Court station when an old\nman comes up to me and asks \u201cdo\nyou want to go for a coffee\u201d. What the\nhell is wrong with this guy? Doesn\u2019t\nhe know Starbucks isn\u2019t open at 9pm\nand more to the point if I needed and\nfound a pimp, no money could afford\nyou even a touch of my hair you ugly\nloser.\nOkay, but at least he confirmed I\nlooked hot or minx-like. Same thing\nat a club night I tend to find; no room\nat the inn for elegant beauty. So I get\ninto the club and see Cute Guy. Great!\nNow I am stalking the guy. \u201cWhy on\nearth...\u201d I am thinking at this point \u201c...\ndo I actually like this guy?\u201d So the night\ngoes on and I am getting cosy with this\nguy but obviously not in the view of\nhis friends. Mistake Number 4. Heard\nthe song \u201cLove locked down\u201d by Kanye\nWest- well quite literally it wasn\u2019t lock\ndown, it was stealth affection that I\nwas getting.\nSo the night is over and I am drunk/\ntipsy/drunk (DTD) and I am thinking\nthis Cute Guy will see me home. No\nI tell you. For all the flirting and affection over the night all I got was a\nwalk to the bus stop. Did I mention I\nwouldn\u2019t of even got that walk if the\nbus stop wasn\u2019t on his way home.\nWhere the hell did chivalry go? What\nhappened to opening doors, pulling\nout seats, walking on the outsides of\nthe pavement ... dropping a girl to her\ndoor and perhaps receiving a precious\nkiss on the cheek? No! No! No! That\nwould be too much. So here I am in my\n\u201cPromiscuous-Girl\u201d clothes that I put\non to impress this guy who has now\nleft me at this deserted bus stop, temperatures in negatives at 5.30 in the\nmorning!!! I have lectures in 4.5 hours.\nWhat a bad show of him. All I wanted\nto do is get back to being \u201cGeek-Women\u201d- where I felt comfortable and in\ncontrol.\nBut that is exactly it! I figured it out.\nBy day I am in control, I am powerful\nand a self-knowing woman. When I go\nout, I sometimes become this fragile\ngirl, who demands the attention of cute\nguys with the hope that their acknowledgement of me will confirm that I am\ndesirable. Speaking to others, I know I\nam not alone. So I am thinking, are we\ntrying to tackle the balance of a being\nsuccessful women with being a more\nemotionally vulnerable one?\nDo we let ourselves believe that because we do well in work we should\nbe able to let our love lives slip?Argh,\nMum was right- boys are trouble. Let\nme know what you think. Email: ImperialGirl@ic.ac.uk\nA\nll around me people are\nrushing for their trains\nand seemingly being\noutfoxed by the ticket\nbarriers, but my mind is\nelsewhere. Not on the assessed problem sheet that I have to hand in the day\nthat these words are published, nor\nthe lab report I have just a few days to\ncomplete. I\u2019m at Victoria station and\nmy mind is thinking about felix; the\nitalics should inform you that I\u2019m talking about this newspaper (which you\nshould never let the Associate Editor\nGilead Amit hear you call \u2018the felix\u2019, lest\nhe strike thee down).\nIt\u2019s a peculiar thing to be concerned\nwith on a Friday night. In a few hours\nI will see my parents and sister for the\nfirst time in months, something that\none would expect to be taking up more\nspace in my mind. But questioning my\nmotives for giving myself more work at\nthe end of an exhausting week invites a\ndeluge of further self-questioning.\nWhy do I spend my otherwise empty\nWednesday mornings, afternoons and\nevenings editing this newspaper? Why\ndo we writers and editors of felix throw\nour degrees down the pan as we obsess\nover every word and line in our beloved publication? Why do the majority of\nus study Physics?\nThese are questions that admittedly\nI struggle with each day, much as the\nCoffee Break/Technology/Layout/\nSeems-Like-He-Does-Everything Editor Ravi Pall and I will struggle with\nout studies as we guiltily pass sunny\ndays in the West Basement of Beit.\nfelix has an unmatched ability to\nprovide you with work, a simple step\ninto the officeis enough to ensnare me.\nThere\u2019s a page to re-edit here, formatting errors there, Shock! Horror! A section editor has left a big white space on\ntheir page. Don\u2019t even get me started on\nresearching news articles (which easily makes the time between dawn and\ndusk seem like five minutes, and not in\na good way \u2013 as the Editor knows all too\nwell). I might complain more if it were\nnot entirely self-inflicted: which brings\nus to the first question. Why do I, like\nothers, spend so much of my free time\non this newspaper? It would be cynical\nto suggest our CVs were the culprits\nand condescending to imply that we\nhave little else to do. The reason that\nI, like Katya-Yani Vyas (the unceasingly\nupper-crust Politics Editor), am behind\non academic work is because it is more\nfun to work on felix than on equations.\nOf course this is far too much of a flippant reason to justify abandoning all\nhopes of attaining a 1st class degree to\nmy parents, but it is the truth nonethe-less. It\u2019s hard for me to apply myself in\na boring lecture (as I\u2019m sure the ever-growing number of 2nd year Physicists\nannoyed by my constant chattering\nwill tell you) but it\u2019s easy for me to get\ndown to work when the \u2018work\u2019 is writing with my friends. It\u2019s mind-numbing\nto worry about whether I\u2019ve quoted the\ncorrect number of significant figures\nbut it\u2019s exhilarating to worry about\nthe number of lines separating images\nwhen you\u2019ve got the Fashion Editor\nDan Wan thinking up funny captions\nfor the aforementioned images sitting\nbeside you.\nPerhaps I\u2019m really skirting the issue here: maybe the felix team is full\nof students who really wish they were\ndoing a different degree (I know that\nCaz Knight, the Arts Editor, would be\ngone in a flash to live a life of Bohemian abandon if she didn\u2019t think it was\na waste to quit in her last year). This\nbrings me neatly onto the last ques-tion: who are the felix team and why\ndo so many of them call the Blackett\nKadhim\nShubber\nThe felix magazines\nL\nast week, the first of the free\nmagazines that felix produces was released. There\nare effectively three magazines plus a one-off special,\nthat felix produces. I, science is, funnily enough, the science magazine which\nis produced by students, primarily\nfrom the Science and Communication\ncourse at Imperial. This means that the\nquality of this magazine is very, very\ngood as these guys will be doing it for\na living. It is full of informative science\n(including engineering) news, as well\nas opinion articles and reviews. The\nbest thing of all is that it is free. Some\nof you who picked up your copy of felix\nfrom the library last week will have realised that it was shoved in the middle\npages. Some of you looked quite surprised to find it there, I should know,\nI was there putting the thing in as you\nlot were picking it up. But it is free, and\nvery informative, and, according to\nthe Guardian, one of the best student\nmagazines out there.\nNext week, we shall be releasing\nphoenix, which is in fact older than fe-lix. It was started by H.G. Wells who\nmany of you will know was a renowned\nscience fiction writer. This magazine is\nfocused more on the arts and literature\nside, with short stories, poems, visual\nart and photography. phoenix is the\none where we really let our hair down\nwith the visual design, so check it out\nand see what we\u2019ve come up with.\nFinally we have Another Castle. This\nis new to this year, and will be the gaming magazine. Imagine all those pages\nthat we had in felix last year, all neatly\ncompiled into one 56 page mammoth\nedition.\nI said finally, but actually there is one\nmore magazine, and that is the sports\nmagazine that will appear after varsity.\nSo as you can see, we have a magazine that will cater to the whole col-lege. Most importantly, I want you all\nto realise that they are free, and that\nthey are worth a read. The copies will\nmainly be found next to the library\ncafe, as well as next to most of the drop\nbins.\nSo sit back, relax and enjoy the variety that felix has to offer.\nThe Editor\nLaboratory home? Unfortunately the\nphenomenon that is the high proportion of Physicists in the felix office has\nnot been investigated by sociologists.\nI could suggest that it\u2019s because Physicists are more enthusiastic, better writers or more creative editors \u2013 but that\nwould be crossing the line between introspection and self-indulgence (so I\u2019ll\nstick to: I just don\u2019t know).\nUndoubtedly you are not lucky\nenough to know us personally. I\u2019m not\nsaying that we are happy about it but\nwe are too busy ignoring our social\nlives to rectify this problem. I won\u2019t be\nable to give you a comprehensive per-son-by-person breakdown of our per-sonalities: Food Editor Afonso Campos\ndefies rational thought in any case, but\nI will give you a few important snippets\nof information.\nLike the fact that Arts Editor David\nPaw is incapable of using an actual picture of himself as his Profile Picture\non Facebook or that we have varying\ndegrees of skill in Photoshop and a\nfew have no idea why everything disappears when they move the cursor to\nthe top right hand corner of the new\niMacs that inhabit our desks. It may\ninterest you to know we enjoy playing\na variety of music, from Tchaikovsky\nto Tomb Crew, very loudly when other\npeople are trying to work (well I enjoy\nit anyhow, I suspect that Music Editor\nPeter Sinclair\u2019s opinion of me lowers\nevery time I blare out Boyz II Men \u201cI\u2019ll\nmake love to you\u201d).\nThe people who worship at the feet\nof the cat are different, that much I can\nsay with confidence. We are the students who will never go into research\nbut also have little interest in the world\nof finance. We read stories, watch films\nor see another pint of snakebite being\nchugged at the Union and instantly\nideas and headlines form in our minds.\nThere is no question of stopping. I\nwould gladly miss a lecture; I wouldn\u2019t\nmiss working on an edition of felix. To\nothers my priorities need rethinking,\nto the members of the felix team, my\nlife gets in the way of far more important activities.\n\u201cThere is no\nquestion of\nstopping. I\nwould gladly\nmiss a lecture;\nI wouldn\u2019t miss\nworking on an\nedition of felix\u201d\nPromiscuous girl, or an attractive geek woman?\n\u201cA homage to the felix team\u201d, by Kadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "244 felix Friday 14 November 2008 25\nFriday 14 November 2008 felix\nI\nn 1215, King John allowed the\nCity of London\u2019s residents the\nright to elect their own mayor,\nor the first time. The new Mayor\nwas to be presented to the Sovereign, and so was accompanied by his\nsupporters in a parade through the city.\nThis was the first Lord Mayor\u2019s show,\nwhich has been an annual feature ever\nsince.\nThe modern Lord Mayor\u2019s show\nhas evolved into a grand parade that\nincludes the old and new livery com-panies, charities, various armed services and representatives of Londoners\nfrom all walks of life. The 3-mile long\nparade winds its way passed the sights\nof the city of London, converging on\nthe Royal Courts of Justice, where the\nLord Mayor takes an oath of allegiance\nto the sovereign.\nThis year\u2019s Lord Mayor is Ian David\nLuder, born and educated in London,\nit is his role to promote the City of\nLondon, both at home and abroad, as\nthe world\u2019s leading financial centre.\nOfficially, he also takes on a number\nof other roles, including Admiral of\nthe Port of London, Chancellor of City\nUniversity and presides over the Court\nof Aldermen and the Court of Common Council.\nAs the constituant college of the\norigninal livery companies, City &\nGuilds College Union enter a float in\nthe Lord Mayor\u2019s show. This years en-trywasconceivedandcreatedbyOwen\nConnick and Tom Murray from the\nAeronautics department. Owen tells\nfelix about the float, the theme and the\nday itself:\nEvery year the City & Guilds College Union enters a float into the Lord\nMayor\u2019s Show. In the last few years,\nthe theme has involved; an MRI scan-ner, a suspension bridge, a mock-up\nof \u2018The Queen\u2019s Tower\u2019 and a football\ngoal. So, we thought it was about time\nAero chipped in to remind everyone\nhow cool aeroplanes can be! With that\nin mind and the 100th anniversary of\nthe first British powered flight occurring in October we thought it a fitting\ntribute to build a replica of that original plane complete with wooden wing\nspas, stretched canvas wing coverings\nand simple riveted propellers.\nWork began on the organisation back\nin June, securing sponsorship from\nBP and registering our entry with the\nPageantmaster. Tom worked tirelessly\nto set up a top-notch CAD model using his solidworks skills to create a set\nof drawings and part-numbers which\nproved invaluable during the build\nstages.\nWe waited until coming back to London for the new term to start construc-tion. After we were kindly loaned\nsome garage space from the motor\nclub we ordered the timber, screws\nand bolts, begged and borrowed tools\nand favours and finally the construction began. Many a long night was\nspent measuring, marking, cutting,\ngluing and screwing in our cold but\nhomely garage tucked away underneath the ACEX building. Bit by bit\nand assembly by assembly the model\nbegan to take shape, first the fuselage,\nthen the wings, then the tail and finally\non a cold Thursday evening the canvas\nwent on and the Cody Flyer replica was\ncomplete.\nAside from the main build we had to\nsort out lorry hire, design banners and\nleaflets, make playlists, hire speakers\nand post off essential security paper-work. We ordered Helium balloons, paper aeroplane flyers and had matching\nT-Shirts and scarves. The Cody Flyer\nwould be accompanied on the float by\nthe C&G motor club mascot Bo\u2019 and\nfollowing proudly behind would be the\nRCS motor club fire engine Jez.\nThe motor club also made themselves useful by giving Tom and Owen\na lift to collect the generator and speakers in the back of the RSM motor club\nmascot Clem, a 1926 1-Tonne truck.\nCruising down Kings Road we managed to get the Ferrari driver in front\npretty annoyed as people stopped to\ntake pictures of us completely ignoring\nhis \u00a3100,000 pride and joy.\nWhen the day of the parade came\naround months of hard work and effort came together and with the help of\nwilling and enthusiastic volunteers the\nday went off with barely a hitch. By the\ntime we arrived at our start point the\nballoons had been blown into a single\ntangled mass of red and white and the\nchalk boards had been washed clean by\ndriving rain. The boards were quickly\naddressed by John and Sam with some\nrapid chalk overwriting and the balloons were sorted out by Suzie and\nAmanda who settled on large bundles\non each corner of the float.\nNobody could\u2019ve predicted how effective a fake moustache and some long\ncoats could be to transform Harry and\nVeronica, two 21st Century Londoners\ninto the spitting image of Mr & Mrs\nSamuel Cody, but I saw it with my own\neyes and it was so. With the finished\nplane, Sam Cody himself and a stiff\nbreeze we were more than tempted to\ncut the ties and let her fly, the Marshals\nhowever were not quite so keen so we\nerred on the side of caution and kept\neveryone and everything on board the\nlorry.

last\nSaturday. The IC 7\u2019s were up against\nliterally the best eleven players in the\nRoyal School of Mines but Cletus,\nWayne and the rest of the inbred hick\nGeologists were no match for the might\nand intelligence of the IC boys.\nRSM even called on their primitive\nknowledge of nature, using wind, fire\n(the sun), and rain in a vain attempt\nto get the upper hand. Initially it paid\noff as the IC boys, captained by James\nBrown, struggled to get the ball down\nand play the brand of football for which\nthey are famed and the RSM used their\nbrute strength to force an opener. The\ngame started poorly and the ball was\nstuck in midfield but with the wind behind them and the sun in the eyes of\nthe IC boys, RSM pressed on winning a\nsuccession of corners and throw ins.\nFromaninswingingcornerabouthalf\nan hour in, they broke the deadlock.\nThe dangerous corner was dipping into\nthe front post and was palmed back\nout to the corner taker by Goalkeeper\nEd Hughes, who, hassled by Greg \u201cwild\nwest\u201d Tainter found an unmarked,\nweb-footed team mate at the near post\nwho powered the ball towards the bottom corner only for Brown, intent on\ngetting himself up and running in fantasy football, lifted it high into the roof\nof his own net, 1-0 RSM.\nBut this only seemed to gee up the\nIC boys and they started to get the\nball down, Ryan Wilson gave their left\nback a torrid afternoon, twisting this\nway and that and he set up the equal-iser. Having found space, Wilson slid\nin Mike Turrell, who, surprised by the\nlack of a very willing offside flag, calmly rounded the Goalkeeper and stroked\nthe ball calmly into the empty net.\nIC pressed on and Luca Laraia and\nTurrell were frequently put through\nonly to be denied by the RSM captain\n(i.e. the one who was literate) running\nthe line. The midfield duo of Rory \u201cDelap\u201d Fleming and Alvin \u201cthe chipmunk\u201d\nChan started to dominate the centre\nof the park and Mo Muwahid on the\nleft wing was showboating with mixed\nresults.\nHalf time seemed to have come at\na bad time for IC as they were clearly\nin the ascendancy but they made it\n2-1 straight after the restart. Fleming\nbeat about 20 men and then squared\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 4\nRoyal School of Mines 1st 1\nEdward Hughes\nto Muwahid who cooly slotted home.\nThen RSM came back into the game\nand could have twice equalised but\nfor two important saves from Hughes\nand good defending from Chris Tennant and Tainter kept them at bay. IC\nthen ended the game as a contest as\nHenry \u201csuperman\u201d Balston scored a\nbullet diving header from another Wilson cross, but later contrived to miss\nan open goal. Muwahid tried to score\nwith an audacious rainbow flick before\nTennant scored the best goal ever.\nPicking the ball up at the half way\nline Tennant hit it first time over the\ngigantic goalkeeper to score a ridiculous goal and was mobbed by his team\nmates accordingly. IC saw out the rest\nof the game although substitute Xavier\nScott probably destroyed their left back\nwith his superior intellect.\nFull time, 4-1. Oh and Mit Patel\nplayed and did some throw-ins or\nsomething.\nImperial 7ths drill a whole\ninto the Miners\u2019 net\nOn paper, this fixture was going to\nbe the toughest of our season so far.\nBoth teams were sitting joint top of the\nleague, having played three and won\nthree. Superb performances recently\nagainst LSE (14-3) and Reading (15-2)\nmeant that we were going into this\nmatch on a high.\nThe day started with some anxiety due to confusion over our line-up.\nEventually with the team assembled,\nwe set off only to find that a long journey awaited us.\nWhen we finally reached the stunning Brunel sports facilities, we were\nslightly disappointed to find that our\nmatch was to be played in a less-than-ideal dance studio with an incredibly\nslippery wooden floor.\nHaving informed us that they had intended to start at 1.30pm, (even though\nsome of us did not finish lectures until\n12.30, before having to travel for over\nan hour!) the Brunel team forced us\nto start the matches, barely giving us\nenough time to hit a ball, let alone\nwarm up.\nAs a result of this we started slowly,\nhowever we certainly kept up with our\ntitle rivals. In fact after our first four\nmatches we led 3-1, thanks to a fantastic win by Eddie Liu over Brunel\u2019s\nNumber 1, eventually taking it 11-6 in\nthe final game.\nThe next 4 matches also went to us\n3-1, meaning that we had taken a very\nencouraging 6-2 lead at the halfway\nstage.\nEddie Liu continued his winning\nways, going on to take all four of his\nsingles matches and providing a strong\nfoundation for what seemed like it was\ngoing to be an IC win.\nThe match took a twist when\nBrunel\u2019s Number 4 rallied to beat both\nHeng-Kai Lee and Yan (our new-found\n\u2018consistency man\u2019) with some ferocious\nattacking table tennis. Unfortunately\nI went down to Brunel\u2019s Number 1 in\na very tight match, losing 12-10 in the\nfinal game.\nWith the score standing at 8-6 to IC\nwith three matches left we were informed that play could not continue\nas our hosts had only booked the hall\nuntil 5.00pm. Chaos ensued.\nOur opponents seemed to suggest\nthat the remaining three matches\nshould be forfeited to them, as it was\nour team who had arrived late (thus\nconveniently enabling them to win the\ntie 8-9).\nWe as a team felt very hard done\nby, especially seeing as Brunel chose\nonly to use two tables for matches, in\na space not too dissimilar to our own\nin Ethos where we use at least three.\nWhen I, as acting captain refused to\nsign the scorecard, I was confronted by\na member of the opposition in a somewhat aggressive manner.\nEventually both teams agreed to\nlet the score remain as it was at 8-6\nand leave the decision up to higher\npowers.\nOur next fixture sees us take on bottom of the league Middlesex University\nin what should hopefully be a comfortable victory. Once again thanks and\ncongratulations go to the team for a\nvery spirited performance.\nTempers fly\nas controversy\novershadows\nrivals\u2019 clash\nTable Tennis\nBrunel Men\u2019s 1st 8\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 6\nDarius Atashroo\n\u2018Can you get that van to go faster?\nJames wants to go faster\u2019 Not really the\nsort of thing you want to hear at 9;30\non a Friday night, somewhere on the\nM1. The plan didn\u2019t seem quite as fool\nproof now. The plan involved a hasty\nexit from London in order to get to the\nEdale campsite before its 11 o\u2019clock\nclosing time. Having attended lectures\nin somewhat inappropriate footwear\nwe clipped in and set off for the van\nrental place in Notting Hill. After a\nquick cruise across Hyde Park, and a\nregroup in the pub we loaded up the\nvan and got ready to go. All we needed\nwas Nathan to arrive and we would be\noff. Things were looking rosy. Then a\nphone call was made containing the\nwords \u2018derailleur\u2019 and \u2018Upside down\u2019.\nTo cut a long story short, the lights of\nEdale appeared through the van windscreen with 15 minutes to spare.\nAnd so Saturday dawned well, wet\nand cold to be honest, but we had come\na long way, and I was determined to\nshow the guys what \u2018proper\u2019 northern\ntrails where about. After a quick spin\nalong the road, we hit the first climb\nand ascended to the top of the Beast,\na twisting ribbon of wet rock dropping\ndown to the Snake Pass road. Things\nstarted off in a relaxed fashion, the\nfaster kids boosting of the rocky outcrops that covered the trail. However,\nit was only in the trees where things got\ninteresting. The fast kids had stopped.\n\u2018Is it down there?\u2019 Being the \u2018local\u2019 I\ndropped in first. You don\u2019t get this kind\nof trail within a train ride of Imperial.\nJust a rocky, slabbed, greasy, drop off\nladen mess. I loved it.\nThe rocks eased a little and despite a\ngritty climb, we where soon bombing\ndown steep singletrack, with the burger van lunch stop in sight. The final\nflagstone descent tested people\u2019s faith\nin their tyres, and ensured everyone\nhad earned their lunch. Carbed up, the\npenultimate climb was despatched at\nan epic pace by Roger, evidently there\nwas something in his bacon sandwich.\nA broken chain in the rain at the top\ndidn\u2019t dampen spirits, aided by the discovery of that weeks Felix amongst the\nspare tubes in my bag. Chain repaired,\nand Imperial issues digested we set off\non a naturally bermed, rock-laden descent back down to Snake Pass.\nThe revelation that we would have to\ncarry/push our bikes back up the Beast\nled to a fairly grumpy half hour, although things where quickly righted on\nthe final drop. With a gradient that just\nurged you to go faster, and ample opportunity for air time there were smiles\nall round at the bottom. We changed\nout of riding gear and decamped to\nthe pub. After 40 km and over 1000\nmeters of ascent and descent, drinks\nand much Yorkshire pudding-based\nscoff felt deserved. Usefully some doctors at the bar also diagnosed Dave T\u2019s\nmassively swollen hand from an earlier crash. Wouldn\u2019t get that in London\nwould you, eh?\nSunday dawned grim to say the least.\nAfter much deliberation over a somewhat calorific breakfast we decided to\nhead up the road to the top of the valley\nand hit up the singletrack descent back\ndown. After half an hour of winching up the murderous 1 in 5 gradient\nwe hit the sodden dirt and contoured\nup to the top of Rushup Edge. More\nsketchy flagstones lead to the where\nthe singletrack dropped off the ridge.\nOnce again I dropped in first, and immediately scored the weekend\u2019s most\nhilarious crash. Despite this inauspicious start, the trail was a beauty, alternating between gnarly rock gardens\nand rutted greasy singletrack. Stopping\nhalf way down I perfected my 180 skid/\ncrash routine.\nThe trail was so good we decided\nthat despite swollen hands, painful\nknees and the odd bit of dented pride it\nwas worth hitting up once more before\nheading back to the big smoke. An hour\nor so later, caked in Derbyshire dirt, we\nrolled into Edale for the final time. For\na weekend riding I reckon it had it all;\nRocky gnar, sweet singletrack, shitty\nweather and a few good stories for the\npub, I just hope it isn\u2019t the end of your\nmountain bike career, Nathan. We sure\ndid throw you in at the deep end.\nCycling club brown nose\nfelix and tackle the Peaks\nMr. B Nose\nAre there too\nmany teams?\nS\no RSM have one week of glory and then the lowest ranked\nIC football team demolishes\nthem. Are the faculty sports\nteams really still neccessary?\nWhy is it that we have multiple teams\nin football, hockey, rugby and more.\nWe can still have our yearly inter-fac-ulty competitions where we can stand\nup for the traditions of the engineer/\nscientist/miner.\nOn my last count there were 13 football\nteams, 12 rugby teams and 13 hockey\nteams! They would all consider themself under the banner of Imperial College and so why not compete together?\nWhy are faculty unions attemting to\nstart up new sports clubs for an annual\npiss up and match against the guys in\nthe building opposite? The union funding is stretched enough as it is.\n\u201813 football\nteams, 12 rugby\nteams and 13\nhockey teams!\u2019\nPeople play their sport for different\nreasons. Some for the social aspect,\nsome for a highly competitive match\nevery week, and from my experience\nthe bigger clubs provide both. The ar-guement that \u2018I play RSM for the social\nside\u2019 is bollocks. I play 1st XI hockey\nfor the social side...I just happen to be\ngood enough to be there! This could all\nbe taken one step further. God forbid\nit happens in my time at Imperial, but\nwhy do IC compete against the Medics. Don\u2019t quote me on this, but they\nare not half bad at most sports and if\nthey combined with the IC teams we\nwould not only have huge clubs but\nalso a chance to make the social and\nstandard immense.\nThis may solve the problem I addressed last week - we cannot sustain\nany teams in the current format at the\nhighest level. There is huge amounts of\nfunding, first class facilities, top notch\ncoaching and a university that has its\nhighest student population of all time.\nA very simple, but maybe contraver-sial , mix up of the format of IC teams\ncould proove to be the answer, Let me\nknow your views...!\nIn other news we have the cycling\nclub who managed to to put a smile\non our face with their publicity stunt\nwith a copy of felix.

For\nseveral days there were attempts to block\nthe railway route including sit-ins, protesters cementing themselves to the track and\nclashes with police involving water cannons\nand batons. With no nuclear waste processing facility of its own, Germany sends an\nannual shipment of spent fuel to France\nand Britain to be processed, before being\nreturned to a storage depot in Gorleben,\nLower Saxony.

If\nconvicted, the men - aged between 24 and\n43 years old, will face life imprisonment, the\nmaximum punishment in Australian law.\nWith criticism that this will be trial against\nIslam, the judge made a point of countering\nthis and telling the jury to clear their mind\nof any anti-Muslim bias for the duration\nof the trial which is expected to last up to\na year. Recently Indonesia executed 3 terrorists who were convicted of perpetrating\nthe 2002 Bali bombings. Back in Britain, an\nIraqi doctor is currently on trial for an attack on Glasgow airport in 2007.\nAustralia\nA wave of protests by factory workers has\nhit eastern and southern China in recent\nweeks, caused by job losses for workers of\nstruggling businesses. The global financial\ncrisis has meant consumers in the west are\nnotspendingasmuch,soChinesebusinesses\ncan\u2019t sell as much in exports. Consequently\nmany have been forced to reduce produc-tion, or shut factories altogether. With lower\nexports, China\u2019s economic growth forecast\nhas been lowered to 9%. Lower export demand is a problem also being faced by India, South Korea and Japan. All this comes\nas Chinese President Hu Jintao announced a\n\u00a3390bn public works programme.\nChina\nOnce again fighting has intensified in the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo between\nseveral armed groups over control of the\ncountry\u2019s vast mineral resources.

Despite reaching a\npeace deal in 2003 after a bitter 5-year civil\nwar, the so-called \u2018Kivu conflict\u2019 has con-tinued.

Abortion is illegal in most\nSouth American countries except in cases of rape or\nif the woman\u2019s life is in danger. The country\u2019s Roman\nCatholic Church, which 47% of Uruguayans follow,\ncampaigned against the bill.

You know \u2013 he was kinda important at some point. He was good at beating around the bush. I think.\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nRetro tripping on the Shad Thames\nCaz Knight embarks on an epic voyage to see an Alan Aldridge retrospective at the Design Museum\nNo wonder the dodos are extinct, if that\u2019s the way they used to carry on. Is that a patchwork-backed cow-turtle?\nM\ny recent trips to the\nDesign Museum and\nto the Cold War Design exhibition at the\nV&A got me thinking about design. I find it to be a bit of\na confusing word and unless you are a\n\u201cdesigner\u201d yourself, it can be difficult\nto know one exactly means.\n\u201cArt\u201d is a term very much instilled\nin us since those days of macaroni\nartwork and glue munching in kinder-garten. So, for someone who thinks\nshe knows a little more about art, design and culture than the average Joe\nImperial, I was still struggling to imagine what I would encounter in an\nexhibition entitled Cold War Design.\nStrolling through the rather redundant\nexhibition Design Cities at the Design\nMuseum, I came to my own conclusions about what I think design is.\nDesign is, in a sense, art with a\nfunction; something that strives to be\nuseful, attractive (even beautiful) that\nrequires skill and creativity to make.\nDesigners bridge a gap between the\nmethodical approach commonly found\nin the Sciences and the creativity of\nart. Except what design lacks (which\nart often has), is a supposed meaning-a message and a richness of emotion.\nThat is not to say design cannot\nconjure these things for certain people.\nEverything in the world is subjective to\na certain extent. I am certain there are\nthose who see the sublimity in physics,\nI think I certainly would if I were a little\nless ignorant.\nSo, design can include a panoply of\n\u2018things\u2019: furniture, crockery, cutlery,\nkitchenware, fashion, patterns used\nin decorating the above, technology\nand even cars. All of the above serve a\nfunction but a certain style and allure\nis required of them to give pleasure\nas they are used and to attract the\nconsumer.\nOne thing I appreciated from Design\nCities was the huge gap created by\nthe Industrial Revolution. We went\nfrom craftsmanship where everything\nwas made by hand, resulting in a\nsignificantly less amount of product,\nto mass production with consumer\nculture in mind. Craftsmen had to\nrethink their design and patterns: a\npatterneasilyetchedbyhandwouldnot\nbe as easily undertaken by machine.\nDesign (exhibitions) gives us an\ninsight into historical context, the\nculture of a time. Perhaps it is the\nmodern equivalent of unearthing\nancient artifacts at a dig, a snapshot\nof an age. This is certainly true of the\nother exhibition currently showing at\nthe Design Museum, a retrospective of\nthe work of illustrator Alan Aldridge\nwhich goes a long way to evoking the\nsaccharine, sugar cube-filled days of\nthe 60\u2019s. All this has me wondering\nwhy people ever stopped taking acid.\nA\ndd \u2018psychedelic\u2019 to any\nsentence, phrase or word\nand I\u2019m there. So it was\nwith Alan Aldridge\u2019s retrospective at the Design\nMuseum. The Independent\u2019s Information the previous weekend advertised\nthe exhibition as \u201cpsychedelic images\nand designs\u201d and that is all the persuading I needed. A quick peruse on\nGoogle images and my intrigue turned\ninto excitement as I made my way over\nto Shad Thames, located right next to\nthe bastion of English Heritage: Tower\nBridge and the formidable Tower of\nLondon. The world I was about to visit\ncouldn\u2019t have been further removed\nfrom the medieval nostalgia just a river\u2019s breadth away.\nPlease pardon my hideously unimaginative turn of phrase but this trip was\nseriously far out\u2026man. One climbs\nthe two flights of stairs to be greeted\nby a huge version of one of Aldridge\u2019s\nbold creations, serving to half conceal\nthe entrance of what we are about to\nreceive. One step in and already we are\nin another dimension. The very high\nceilings of the space are made use of, to\ncover wall and floors completely with\nblown-up versions of his work. The\neffect is warren-like \u2013 making us feel\nstrangely small, dwarfed by the giant\nAldridge himself, and many others, set\nagainst a black background.\nAldridge had an auspicious start\nto his career by managing to pass off\nanother\u2019s work as his own to establish\nhimself in a career until his natural talent as an illustrator impressed Penguin\npublishers, when they asked him to\nredesign covers for their fiction books.\nIt would be the start of a long career\nin which he always strived to seek new\nchallenges and styles, pushing himself\nfurther.\nAs well as working on album cover\nart with many bands such as the Rolling Stones and Elton John, one of his\nbetter works includes illustrating the\nBeatles lyrics book with each song\ntranslated into a beautiful, surreal and\ncolourful image. Aldridge describes\nthem as illustrations of the 60\u2019s, conveying the decade\u2019s social and cultural\nhistory.\nThe second \u201cBeatles\u201d room changes\nthe tempo and feel of the exhibition as\nwe emerge from the dark and into the\nconsiderably lighter. Again, every inch\nof walls and floors are white, covered\nwith all the illustrations.\nThe effect is like being suspended in\nthe clouds with these dream-like creations encircling you rather than them\nbeing a 2D decoration and encased\nin frames on the walls. In each drawing he has managed to encapsulate the\nvery essence of each song whilst adding more of his own interpretations\ninto their meaning.\nIn awe of Tenniel\u2019s illustrations accompanying Lewis Carroll\u2019s (magic)\nmushroom-inspired novel, Alice in\nWonderland, Aldridge decided he\nwanted to illustrate a Victorian children\u2019s novel as well. The Butterfly Ball\nand the Grasshopper\u2019s Feast put a previously unheard of novel to the forefront of public attention and looking\nat the illustrations through an adult\neye\u2019s, I was delighted at the world he\nhas created to bring the book alive. In\nhomage to this effort, a funhouse-style\nroom has been installed in the exhibition with green, mirrored walls and\nlarger-than-life sized cutouts of hanging butterflies and insects to recreate\nthis fantasy land.\nThere is nothing childish about this\nexhibition but it has all the optimistic innocence which characterises\nAldridge\u2019s work and childhood itself; a\nplace where the mundane is forgotten\nand replaced by a sense of ease, a sense\nof exploration and a hankering for the\nstrange. Perhaps the very antithesis\nof the society in which we live which\ndoles out pressure, encouraging us to\nconform, be in control and be normal.\nThroughout my meanderings back\nand forth and round the space, I felt\nlike I was getting a treat and as if I was\non the brink of an amazing new discovery and in a way I was. A feeling\nI always get when I see or hear of or\nunearth some fantastic new thing. I felt\nthe same way when I was introduced to\nthe art of H.R. Giger for the first time.\nPut into artistic terms, to quote H.S.\nThompson, \u201cit just never [gets] weird\nenough for me\u201d. There is just so much\ngoing on, so much colour, vibrancy,\nfreshness and beauty but without ever\nmaking one feel overwhelmed.\nAldridge shares a quality with Giger\nof being able to be intensely dark,\ntwisted and masculine. Yet he also possesses a quality of the intensely ethe-real, mystical and feminine which is\nnot necessarily evident in each of his\nillustrations.\nOne of the more memorable pieces\nwas a Mini decorated in true hippy, 60\u2019s\nstyle encompassing both a feminine\nenergy on one side and masculine style\non the other. The piece is a commemoration to both the 1965 Mini Aldridge\ndesigned for the Sunday Times cover\nas well as Mini\u2019s own 50th anniversary\nin 2009. Just to make me even more\ncontent was an animated compilation\nof Aldridge\u2019s art work with a sublime\nPink Floyd soundtrack, projected onto\nthe wall taking us hurtling though vortexes with kaleidoscopic effects: think\niTunes visualiser on a kooky concoction of psilocybin, acid and mescaline!\nI left feeling elated but deflated\ntoo, frustrated that I live in a decade\nin which it sucks to be young, where\nmusic, fashion and youth culture are\ntrite and where no one cares anymore\nabout being original and outrageous.\nTrue, the hippy ideals of the 60\u2019s could\nnot be maintained in any progressive\nsociety or beyond one\u2019s twenties, but\nthe kids then did appear to have a lot\nmore fun.\nIf Shad Thames is just too far east for\nyou then check out www.alanaldridge.\nnet or purchase his autobiographies\nPhantasia, or the recently published\nThe Man With the Kaleidoscope Eyes.\nT\nhe hypocrisy of political\nlife, and existential crises\nwhen faced with the stifled individualism of the\nmodern world: themes\nrunning through the heart of David\nHare\u2019s latest political offering \u2013 and\noccasionally jumping up to slap us in\nthe face, with mixed results. Meredith\nGuest (Tamsin Greig), the Home Secretary has a couple of problems, in\nthe form of a teenage daughter looking to get herself expelled from the\nprivate school she\u2019s been put into and\nan over-anxious party fundraiser (the\nominously named Otto Fallon, played\nby Stanley Townsend), conveniently a\ngovernor of the school, who has made\nmoves to stop that from happening \u2013\nspecifically a new gym. Ideal fodder\nfor the ever-loving press, the face of a\njudgmental public.\nHare does well to create that rare\nsense of the politician as human being,\nat ease away from the soap box. The\nplay asks questions about morality in\npolitical life (where does the boundary\nlie between public and private, party\nand individual?), but gives few an-swers; Meredith, through her own private Gethsemane, comes to terms with\nher driven political nature but there is\nno final resolution with her daughter,\nand we are left with a lingering lack of\nsympathy for such an intelligent yet\nemotionally detached character. This\nis not helped by one-dimensional portrayal of bullyboy Blair, complete with\ndrum kit and weights bench. Yes, she is\nsympathetic in comparison, but is that\nreally saying much?\nThe subplot, however, centred\naround Meredith\u2019s daughter Suzette\n(Jessica Raine) and her mentor figure\nLori(NicolaWalker),whogoesthrough\nher own crisis of conscience, remains\ngenuinely touching. Her husband has\nbecome a fundraiser for the party. His\ndisenchantment grows culminating in\nthat tried and tested technique, the ex-tended-diatribe-from-nowhere, which\nfelt like deus ex machina, Hare himself\nbursting onto stage. Though bewildering in the extreme, this is one of a few\nborderline absurdist elements to pro-ceedings, within the context of a finely\nwrought balance between the subtle\nand the stylised. This is a good play.\nWith more character development it\ncould be very good.\nThe set design is impressive and\nexciting: a cosmopolitan modernist\ncube-like shifting structure, dancing\nwith tinsel-town lights (at the first\nscene change I thought I\u2019d entered a\nmodern art exhibit). Tamsin Greig\nhandles things well from the excellent\nopening scene, although she is ultimately let down by a part which trails\noff towards the end of the play. Jessica\nRaine is excellent as her daughter: by\nturns acid-tongued, by turns delicate,\nthoughtful and genuine, I couldn\u2019t imagine a better harmony between writer\nand actor. She deals admirably with a\nscript (otherwise pitch perfect) whose\nknowledge of teenage dialect stretches\nto fitting the word \u2018like\u2019 into appropriate places in the sentence \u2013 thankfully the audience were uniformly over\n40, but I felt for the actress. Stanley\nTownsend, playing the amoral Otto,\nthe most consistent character, dominates his scenes to imbue proceedings\nwith the pout and swagger of New Labour in its heyday. \u201cRemind me why\nwe shouldn\u2019t be in power forever?\u201d he\nasks. A line about the booming economy immediately dates the piece; see it\nnow as a reminder of the good times,\nbefore that ticket money goes on your\nmortgage.\n\n"

    "content": "business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 14 November 2008\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Luke Dhanoa\nHow Wii\u2019s kill people in the Congo\nThe link between consumer electronics and civil unrest in the Congo.\nNo doubt you\u2019ve heard of the worsening situation in the Congo, but do you\nknow where the rebels are getting their\nfunding? Do you know why international governments seem more willing\nto step in to help the Congo as opposed\nto the other humanitarian disasters\naround the world? Because unless you\nthink about the hand that corporations\nhave had in the Congo it becomes hard\nto appreciate exactly why Congo\u2019s history is such a tragedy.\nLike most of Africa\u2019s pains, Congo\u2019s\nstory starts with a white European\ncolonist. Our particular colonist for\nthis country was King Leopold II, a\ncheeky Belgian chappie who acquired\nthe Congo in 1885 and named it The\nCongo Free State. Of course, considering that the entire country was legally\nhis personal property the name was a\nlie, but apparently no-one bothered to\ncall him out on it.\nCongo in hand, Leopold then went\non to extract all the resources he could\nfrom the country in a brutal, oppressive and deceitful manner. But to be\nfair to him, everyone was doing it; under the guise of humanitarian aid, colonists built a transport infrastructure\nthat would move resources efficiently\nto the sea. They then took whatever\nthey could fit onto their ships and left.\nRoad and Rail infrastructure was set\nup to take plundered goods out of the\ncountries as quick as possible but did\nnothing to improve transport between\ndifferent parts of the country, setting\nthe tone for the interactions between\nthe Congo and the West.\nIn the \u201860s, after the Congo had\ngained independence, Congolese soldiers started rebelling against remaining Belgian officers. In response Chief\nof Staff of the Army Mobutu was sent\nround to rally troops back into a cohesive Army. When violence broke\nout in the south of the country, then\nPresident Lumumba turned to the Soviets for military aid to stamp down\nthe rebellion. Then Chief of Staff of the\nArmy Mobutu managed to get hold of\nan absurd amount of money, paid his\narmy privately, staged a coup, arrested\nthe President and eventually (in 1971)\ntook over the country.\nBut where did he get the money?\nHow did he get the technical know\nhow to beat a Soviet led force? Who\nstarted all the strife in the south in the\nfirst place? And why?\nUp to the 60\u2019s Belgian companies had\nenjoyed special access to the Congo\u2019s\nresources and had significant commercial interests in the region. So when\nthe Congolese army started rebelling\nagainst remaining Belgian influence, it\nbecame apparent that the government\nwould need to step in to protect it\u2019s\ncompanies. So while the army was in\nstrife, the Belgian government encouraged unrest in the south to destabilise\nthe country. Sure, some people got\nkilled, but it was good for Belgium.\nWhen Lumumba looked to the Soviets for technical assistance in dealing with the southern troubles, the US\nstepped in with some classic cold war\nmaneuvering: The CIA sponsored the\nmost anti-communist power player\nthey could find (Mobutu) and led him\nto taking over the country, regardless\nof his ability to run a country. Thereby (hopefully) making the country a\nnew ally in the fight against the Red\nThreat.\nSince then, the world and his mum\nhave been trying to get a piece of the\nCongo pie. Congo has 80% of the\nworld\u2019s cobalt, massive copper and\nzinc deposits and vast quantities of dia-monds, but getting to these resources\nis usually too dangerous for compa-nies. So instead of setting up shop in\nthe Congo, they just pay people to\nsmuggle the resources over the borders\nand sell them on the international mar-ket. Western exploitation has made the\nCongo much poorer than it should be,\nexacerbating ethnic tensions and pushing Congo deeper into trouble.\nOne of the most interesting of these\nsmuggled goods is cobalt. Cobalt is\nused to make capacitors, which turn\nup in just about anything electronic,\nfrom mobile phones to airbags. Eastern Congo is a readily available source\nof cobalt but because of the situation\nit\u2019s in the country can\u2019t exploit the resources for it\u2019s own benefit. Instead the\ncobalt mines in the Congo are largely\nslave operated and the cobalt is then\nsmuggled into countries like Rwanda\nbefore being sold on the international\nmarket. Because cobalt is fungible\n(meaning that one kilo of cobalt is the\nsame as any other kilo of the stuff)\nit gets traded and re-traded several\ntimes in the commodity market before\nit usually reaches the final user. This\nmeans that a lot of companies don\u2019t\nknow where their cobalt is coming\nfrom \u2013 and to be honest, they usually\ndon\u2019t care.\nThe demand for cobalt has meant\nthat coltan mines have become key\nstrategic areas for fighting groups in\neastern Congo. Rebel and government\ngroups have battled fiercely for control\nof the mining operations, and utilising the funds to intensify the conflict.\nBoth groups have been accused of using slaves (made up of prisoners of war\nand unlucky civilians) to mine the resources worsening the damage of the\nwar.\nNow before we start it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Congo only provides\nabout 1% of the worlds cobalt, and\ncritics of the link between cobalt consumption and the fate of the Congo\nare always keen to point this out. That\nargument is ridiculous. Firstly, the 1%\nfigure is likely to be an artificially lowered figure because of the difficulty\ninvolved in tracing smuggled cobalt.\nSecondly that 1% is enough to cause\nserious damage - it\u2019s estimated that the\nRwandan army has made $500m from\ncoltan (the impure ore form of cobalt)\nsmuggling in the last 18 months alone.\nAnd finally, just because the Congo\nonly provides a small amount of the\nworlds cobalt doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t\naffected by global demand.\nWhen the Playstation 2 was launched\ncobalt prices rose from roughly $50 a\npound to about $275 a pound. That\nput huge pressure on the coltan mines\nto produce more, forcing more people\ninto slavery. With the last console cycle\n(Wii\u2019s, PS3\u2019s, Xbox 360\u2019s) coltan prices\nspiked and according to some report-ers, so did the price of slaves in the\nCongo. With everyone rushing to buy\nWii\u2019s for their kids this Christmas, it\u2019s\na sobering thought to think that you\u2019re\ncontributing to the trauma of slaves in\na faraway land.\nConversely in times when cobalt\nprices drop (as they will once enough\npeople have bought consoles) things\nget worse for coltan slaves. In 2001\n(following the internet bubble burst-ing) cobalt prices plummeted leaving\nminers in dire straits. When the mines\nclosed down, slaves were abandoned.\nFor some this was a wonderful chance\nto get back to their old lives. For oth-ers, who knew nothing beyond min-ing, this was horrific. Unable to farm,\nuneducated and without any means to\nsupport themselves many perished.\nIt\u2019s not a big step to think that the\nrecent increase in cobalt prices has\nhelped fund the new wave of civil\nunrest in the Congo. It won\u2019t be a big\nstep to think that when this funding\ndisappears, things will become harder\nfor people in the area. A lot of people\npoint out that companies can responsibly source their cobalt, and while this\nis true, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that\nnot all companies do, and it doesn\u2019t\nprotect the Congo from cobalt price\nfluctuations.\nSo, they\u2019re screwed if we consume\nand they\u2019re screwed if we don\u2019t. Seems\nlike a no win situation huh?\nNo.\nThe DRC (Democratic Republic of\nCongo) has vast potential. If developed\nit could provide investors with huge\nreturns in a very short period of time.\nThe problem is making the region stable enough for companies to move in\nand trade fairly with the Congolese\npeople. That\u2019s where governments\nhave been trying to step in, that\u2019s why\ncountries with little or no history with\nthe Congo are getting involved with\npeace talks now. They\u2019ll claim that humanitarian interests are at the heart of\ntheir concerns, but that\u2019s just a sham.\nIf the Congo becomes a stable region,\nI\u2019ll bet anything that investors will be\nflown in, in UN helicopters to buy up\nthe area. But \u2013 and here\u2019 the shocker \u2013\nthat\u2019s a good thing.\nCompanies do more for the third\nworld than charity does. Government\naid usually has political strings at-tached, which just leads to trouble, and\nthe majority of charity groups don\u2019t\nprovide any useful long-term solu-tions. If anything is going to save the\npoor, it\u2019s corporations.\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, there\nhave been plenty of examples of commercial exploitation of the poor and I\ndon\u2019t condone its practice in any way \u2013\nwhich is why we need to watch what\u2019s\nhappening. Corporations shouldn\u2019t just\nbe allowed to do whatever they want,\nbut they should have the freedom to\noperate and should have protection\nfrom extremeist groups. If you let that\nhappen, it would change Africa quicker\nthan aid ever could, and then, maybe,\nwe wouldn\u2019t have to worry about slaves\nmaking our stuff.\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor\n\n"
