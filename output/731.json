Whilst I won't comment about the bulk of\nhis egotistical rambling in\nlast week's letters page, I must object to the partisan\nrubbish in his last few\nsentences. For a start the\nBelow the Belt column in\nFELIX has been running for\nyears longer than the trivial\nand clique y Vicious\nRumours page in\nBoredsheet (only accurate\nmaterial in the title?).\nFurther seeing as I myself\nwrote the Below the Belt\ncolumn last term, it owes\nas much to my good friend\nHissing Sid (and Frank\nRowsell for those who\nremember him) as to\nanyone else.\nI don't want to sound\npompous with all this but I would just like to say that I know people who will go to\ngreat lengths to avoid Mr\nSpencer ranting at them for\nhours. Why someone of the\nadvanced years and hair of\nMr Spencer (I myself have\nspent years trying to look\nthat aged) should waste his\ntime promoting all that is\nworst in C CU rivalry I don't know. How such a mind\nbending ly boring person as\nTony can slag FELIX when\nhis idea of literature is this\nyear's Rag Mag is beyond\nmy puny brain.

Firstly, misuse of\nproperty and equipment by\nresidents is cited as a, presumably substantial,\nloss of funds and I would\nlike him to specify what\nactual type of damage was\ndone.\nIt was mentioned that on\nsite communication,\ncoordination and\nsupervisory qualities were\n'severly affected' due to the\nabsence of the\nHousekeeper, through\nillness. If this was such an\nimportant problem why was\nthere no temporary\nreplacement found for the\nHousekeeper, or\nappropriate transfer of\nduties to someone in\nauthority?\nI concede that Mr\nHaliworth's argument that\npainting the outside of the\nHouses was to prevent\nfurther crumbling of the\nfabric may be valid but I should mention that the\nrailings of the Houses were\npainted also, which is\nsurely one of the most\ncosmetic repairs to Evelyn\nGardens possible, whilst\ninside, window locks and\npigeon-hole locks\u2014surely a priority in view of the\nappalling state of security,\nremained un repaired or\nabsent.\nFinally I find Mr\nHallworth's comments that\n'there is little point in\nincreasing College security\nwhen we are surrounded by\nso many self-appointed\nClerks of Works' needlessly\ndestructive and implicit ive that his organisation and\ndeputation of responsibility\nleaves much to be desired.\nSurely Mr Hallworth should\nbe getting his act together?\nYours etc\nMike Stone\nChemistry\nCash\nWasted\nSir\nI write to draw your\nreader s attention to the\nnew garage being erected\nat the rear of Chemistry 1.\nUnbelievably, this structure\nis destined to house some\nof the vehicles of Professor\nHartley and his wife, who\nlive in the penthouse on\ntop of Biochemistry.\nWith College spending\nmuch time moaning about\nlack of finance I am\nastonished that a four\nfigure sum of money can\nbe found to provide a garage to house cars which\naren't even used for\nCollege business. To make\nmatters worse, several\nparking spaces have been\nlost\u2014parking spaces used\nby people who are on\nCollege business.\nAs they are local\nresidents, one wonders why\nthey can't get a street\nspace from the council, and\nleave the car park for those\nwho drive into College\neach day.\nYours etc\nNick Davies\nChemistry\nFriday 14 February FELIX\n\n"

Communist and\nCapitalist, Christian and\nMuslim, Conservative and\nLabour, 'and everybody\nhates the Jews' (Tom\nLehrer). 'Forgetting our\ndifferences' means, for\nmany people, forgetting the\nfaith for which they stand.\nBut history is full of tales of\npeople dying for their\nbeliefs, and there is no\nparticular reason to believe\nthat the trend will not\ncontinue, especially since it\nis at times of crisis that we\nare called upon to be more\nprincipled, not less.\nSo I suggest that we do\nnot waste effort by\npleading with people to\nforget their ideological\ndifferences.

    "content": "\"In the future everyone will look like a baked bean can for 15 minutes...\"\nAndy Warthog\nSome caustic wit pointed out to me\nthat today is Valentines Day and it\nwould be a good idea to include\nsome appropriate ideas in this\ncolumn. So having read Time Out's little piece on their own lonely\nhearts column I thought something\nlike, 'Scruffy mature journalist\nseeks kindred wally for mutual\ncynicism, boredom and tedious\nconversations about Roy Harper\ngigs' might fit the bill. Looking at\nthe sort of wit ici sms which actually\nmake it into print I feel a bit\nhumbled though. In addition I am\nnot really seeking to meet London's Gay population on an intimate\nbasis, which would cut out a large\nproportion of the small ad reading\npopulation. But it must be said that\ncommercial is ation does seem to\nhave crept into the way people meet\neach other to a tremendous degree.\nI'm sure there's very little you can't get delivered to the loved one of\nyour dreams by an out of work\nactor. Maybe this is one of life's necessary evils in a place like\nLondon, where social life is so\noften interpreted as 'strutting your\nfunky what s it' in a darkened room\nwhere the music is so loud that, the\nperson you thought was a liberal\nminded student into outdoor\npursuits is actually a married young\nconservative into collecting\nVictorian bondage gear! Personally\nI think it cheapens the whole affair\nif you pay (ironic, huh!) some\nAlbanian mountain cyclist to mutter\npre-composed words of endearment\nand thrust a box of 'Black Tray' at\nthe target of your affection. Mind\nyou if it's all for Rag that's another\nmatter. And hey! \u2014 why are we\nonly allowed to be romantic one\nday a year?\nI~u AVhen I took over this page\nsomeone said something about ideas\nfor things to do in our glorious\ncapital. But once in a while there's nothing wrong with taking liberties\n\u2014 so this week's suggestion is\n\"clear off\". 'Very droll' I hear you\nsay, but I'm desperate. Even the\nless astute of you might have\nnoticed that BR has slashed fares\nfor Railcard holders for February\nto one-quarter of the normal cost.\nThis means the reduction on some\njourneys can almost pay for the\ncard \u2014 spend money, save pounds\n(er?). Last weekend I went to\nBristol to see a gentleman called\nRoy Harper. This will make anyone\nwho knows me cringe at the\nthought of another plug for some\nageing ex-hippy (but he really is\ndynamite live, makes Billy Bragg\nlook like Noddy goes to social\ncommentary land). The point is that\nmost people can probably think of\nsomeone or somewhere they'd like\nto visit and now is a smart time to\ngo and (in the words of the\nimmortal Pink Fairies) DO IT.\nWell so much for pointing out\nthe obvious (as an old colleague on\nthe Tirane Times once said to me\nwhile relating the story of how he\nhad pointed out to the great Eugene\nZhog, the 1962 Albanian cycling\nchampion, that it would be\nimpossible to leap to freedom in the\nwest, on his push bike from the top\nof Mount Hoxha \u2014 the old fool\nwas blown out of the air by half a dozen machine guns before he\nplunged into the Strait of Otranto\n\u2014 but they never did find the\nh,od y!). More depressing\ndisappearances this week include\nSpitting Image and half a pint of\nmilk out of my fridge. I must admit\nthat the former is more distressing\nbut the replacement Hot Metal,\nabout the sordid newspaper\nbusiness, has got some good\nreviews. Right now a bit of\nsordidness would go down just great\naround here to liven things up.\nSpeaking of things sordid I always wondered what people who\nplay Dungeons and Dragons really\ngot up to. But I have been informed\nby our local a ff ici on a dos that there\nis more to role-playing games than\nsitting round a table saying things\nlike \"I 've just zapped your dragon\nwith a Magic Missile\". The general\nimpression seems to be that D&D is a reasonable but rather limited\nGive your heart away this Valentines Day\ngame, and cheap once you've spent\nthe first \u00a3100 on books and starter\npacks! The local loonies seem to\nprefer Runequest (edition 2) \u2014\nmysterious by name, and a mystery\nto me. It's wrong to be too cynical\nabout this as some of the games\nshops around London are well\nworth a browse (Ifindthat\nbrowsing shops is often the\ncheapest and most engrossing\npastime in London). THE shop for\npeople with strong fantasy urges is\nForbidden Planet in Denmark\nStreet, but the place itself, although\nit has a wide range of SF books\netc, has been described as a 'hole in\nthe wall in Tin-Pan Alley'. Near to\nHamlet Gardens is Games\nWorkshop which is full of posters\ngiving a vast number of events and\nseems to be very helpful. Games\nPeople Play up in Notting Hill is, I have been told, good for\nindependent models (ie other than\nthe usual Citadel crud). And two\nmore mainstream shops worth a look at least are the Virgin Games\nCentre and Hamleys. Personally I can usually spend hours in Hamleys\nregressing to childhood.\nOn to films and my favourite\nvenue, The Scala, has some good\nbills this month. On Saturday the\n15th there is an all-night er featuring Dune, 200 Motels (Frank\nZappa), The Wall, Barbarella and\nUp In Smoke. Then on Thursday\n20th there is Dr Strangelove and\nApocalypse Now (two of the best\nfilms on the madness of war ever\nmade) as a double bill. Saturday\n22nd sees a no th\" all-night er with\nNightmare On Elm Street, Blood\nSimple, Videodrome, Company Of\nWolves and The Evil Dead (yes the\none you're not supposed to be able\nto get on video). Andfinallyon\nFriday the 28th there is The\nTerminator and a film called Death\nLine. The latter is about a group of\nsurvivors from an 1892 rail tunnel\ndisaster preying on commuters on\nthe underground, it's got to be\ngross!\nAll night bills at the Scala are\n\u00a33.70 and start at about 11:30pm. Normal bills are \u00a32.70 (or \u00a31.70 on\npr duct ion of a student card during\nthe afternoon). There is also a50p initial membership. I can't claim\nthat the Scala is the most luxurious\ncinema in London but it has a certain character and the food stall\nis a lot better than the tacky,\nindigestible, overpriced, rubbish\nfound in most west end flicks.\n, 1 M iv' So to the end of another week's rambling and pretending to be a pretentious listings mag. I would .\nlike to dedicate this week's column\nto all those people who have made\nmountain cycling in Albania what it\nis today. Its not always fun being a critic, in the words of Eric of\nAramathea the sports correspondent\nof the Galilee Observer 'crucifixion\nis murder on the hands....'\n\n"

Its prices are very\nreasonable and its flowers\nare of very high quality.\nFelton's actually goes to the\ntrouble of cutting their\nflowers with a knife rather\nthan a scissors because they feel that this prolongs\nthe life of the bloom by not\nclosing up the stem. Their\nservice is very good, their\ndelivery charges within\nLondon are among the\nlowest I 've come across\n(about \u00a34 max), and they\nhave the added attraction of\na tempting display of\ndelicious (but fairly\nexpensive) handmade chocolates.

An old family firm, Pul brook and Gould specializes in\nflowers and foliage from the\nBritish countryside.

All of the work\ndone is very up-to-date,\nstylish, and good value for\nmoney.

    "content": "oS ff Bci hoo li Judith Hackney is to be the\nEditor of the 1936 Union Handbook. Ms Hackney was elected by paper ballot\nat \"\n1 u es day's IC U GM. Sarah Kirk was the only\nother candidate for the\npost. Proposing Ms Hackney, Alan Rose said\nthat he believed that her\nwork on IC Radio. STOIC and FELIX, along with her\ntwo years as a first year\nstudent at College, would\nbo invaluable qualities for\nthe job. Ms Kirk, the FELIX Reviews Editor, was proposed by last year's Handbook Editor, Nigel\nAtkinson. Among the other issues\ndebated at the U GM was a motion instructing the\nUnion to campaign for\nflexible licensing hours in\nEnglish, and Welsh pubs.\nDespite some concern that\nthis would contribute to the\nUnion's 'boozy image', the\nmotion was carried. The last motion to be dealt with\nproposed that the UL U policy of having 16 female\nsessions at their Health\nComplex, compared with\nonly 12 male sessions,\namounted to sexism. The motion was attacked by\nExternal Affairs Officer\nGrenville Manuel and DP Dave Kingston, who reported that there is a far\ngreater demand for female-only sessions, and the\nmotion was defeated by a clear majority.\nOne further motion was\non the agenda, proposing that Union publications\nshould refuse\nadvertisements from\nBarclays Bank, and that the\nUnion should discourage\nstudents from banking with\nBarclays. However, the\nquorum was successfully\nchallenged by Andy Juscott\nof DOC3 who believed that\nthe poor attendance would not provide a representative\nvote. The meeting was then\nbrought to a close.\nUNION BAR PROMOTION\n/hs His ,H fil fi!

BEERS\n50p/ PINT\nEstimates Revised The Royal School of Mines Union have reduced their\nestimate for next year from\n\u00a317 000 to \u00a314 000. The Estimate of R CSU and\nC& CU are \u00a311 000 and\n\u00a314 000 respectively.\nICU Deputy President\nDave Kingston has\nsuggested that these\nestimates may be accepted, with perhaps only a few\nadditional cuts. This would mean that R SMU would be\nallocated more money than\nR CSU, which has more\nthan twice as many\nstudents.\nMr Kingston justifies this\nstate of affairs by\nexplaining that R SMU members tend to be more\nactive in their union than\ntheir counterparts in Guilds and RCS, thus meriting the\nextra expenditure. He also\ncommented that his\nattitude towards such\nmatters was not swayed by\nthe number of students\nwho would bene if it from\nthe money, but the\nintensity of the activity\ninvolved, and the\ndedication and commitment of the people involved.\nUnion Finance Committee was due to\nmeet yesterday lunchtime.\nOwing to printing\nproblems, FELIX is unable\nto report on the meeting in\nthis issue.\nBar Success The Union Bar is more\npopular now than it was\nlast year, ICU Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston told FELIX this week.\nMr Kingston believes this\nis partly the result of the\npositive Union approach to\nrowdiness. He cited the\nsigns that have been\nposted in the Bar\nrequesting people not to\nstand on the tables as an\nexample of the way the\nUnion was responding to\ndisturbances.\nThe Bar, has in Mr\nKingston's view, changed from being a 'hacks' bar to\none of a students' bar in\nwhich students can feel\nwelcome, not intimidated.\nThe promotion of guest\nales and the presence of\nBod ding tons Ale has\nattracted many students.\nMr Kingston added that he\nhoped that students would be attracted to the Union Baron Friday night for a pre-revelry booze up as\nmany drinks are being\noffered at 50p/ pint.\nFrom Friday night\nBudweiser will be on sale\ninstead of Carlsberg because of complaints\nabout the quality of\nCarlsberg.\nNew Garage\nProfessor Hartley of\nBiochemistry is to have his\nown garage on College grounds. Work on the\ngarage has now begun\nbehind the Biochemistry Department, after being\ndelayed for a few weeks\nowing to bad weather.\nProfessor Hartley lives in a penthouse flat in the\nBiochemistry building. Jack Parry of the Estates section\nis handling the building\nwork, but it is unclear as to\nwho is providing the funds.\nCollege Secretary John Smith said on Thursday that Prof Hartley's garage\nwould replace one\ndemolished when\nBiochemistry's Link\nbuilding was built.He said\nthat the garage was an\nimportant facility for Prof\nHartley because he has a disabled daughter.\nField Cup Off\nField Cup has been\npostponed from last\nTuesday to next Tuesday This was because Guilds VP Symon Corns was ill\nand u able to organise the\nclues. The Guilds Office\nwas besieged on Tuesday by students worried about\nMr Corns, after Guilds Hon Sec Dave Page had put up\na large number of posters\nsaying that Field Cup was postponed because Mr\nCorns had died.\nSport Off\nThe RCS Soccer6' s and Guilds rugby 7's were\npostponed last Sunday owing to poor weather.\nBoth events are likely to\ntake place on Sunday March9.

It was a desperate try to reach the\nKing of Diamonds in a dilemma. He led another\nspade which gave the IC\npair an outright top.\nAnd lo, it came to pass in\nthe days of Frank the\nUsurper there arose a great\ntorment in the land. Runes\nwere cast and prophets\nwarned of omens\nforetelling doom. A leprechaun was seen\nplaying the bagpipes, whilst\ntwo goblins were overheard\ndiscussing the benefits of\naluminium replacement\nwindow frames. And there\narose in the land a great\nwringing of hands and\nrubbing of genitals and\npeople cried 'Oh who will\nlead us out of these dark\ntimes?'\nThe task was undertaken\nby one Bilbo Jefferson,\nprince of the Halfcuts. The\nGreat Deeds of Bilbo,\nScourge of Middlesex, are\nrecorded in the book 'There\nand Back Again (stopping\nfor a few bev vies on the\nway.' This document\nrecords Bilbo's clash with\nthe forces of darkness, his\nstruggles with ores,\ndragons, trolls and housing\nbenefit officials. For at this\ntime a great darkness lay\nover the land, and good\npeople walked in the\nshadow of fear. In the\nhours of darkness it is said\nthat innocent-looking\nkitchen utensils performed\nunspeakable acts with\nconsenting pieces of\n' cutlery.\nBut Bilbo rode forth. Red\nwas his banner, black was\nhis steed and brown were\nhis trousers. With the help\nof a few loyal Rotarians,\nBilbo overthrew the\nDarkness and made the\nland safe. Once more a man could walk freely in\nthe open and purchase\nNescafe over the counter\nwithout fear of\nrecrimination.\nNorth America\nHOW TO SPEND THE SUMMER IN THE STATES AND LIVE TO TELL THE TALE There will be a. presentation\ngiven by a representative\nfrom BUN AC on Tuesday\n18th February at 6pm in the\nUnion Lounge.

    "content": "Enthusiastic\nBishop\nIgnored\nDear Hugh, What a miserable and misleading little article\nFELIX carried on the\nBishop of Durham's visit\nlast week It conveyed nothing of the infectious\nenthusiasm with which the\nBishop spoke, nor the\ndelight with which he was received by his large\naudience. Here was a man alive with the faith,\nknowledge and experience\nof God, doing his uttermost\nto bring together his faith\nand the realities we live\nwith without fudging or\ndodging the issues.\nWhen he was asked the\ninevitable questions I heard\nhim say that the\nresurrection was something objective God did to\nchange the disciples' belief\nthat Jesus was dead into\nthe conviction that he was alive and active in their\nlives. As for the virgin birth\nhe 'wouldn't put it past God to do it that way, especially\nif God was acting as she.'\nbut he had to note there\nwere other virgin birth\nstories about gods and heroes current at the time.\nIt would be refreshing if\nFELIX reporters wrote with\na fraction of the Bishop's liveliness, wit and integrity.\nIt would do your credibility\nsome good too.\nYours sincerely\nDavid Ashforth\nChaplain\nBishop\nSummarised\nI felt the Bishop of Durham said some good and bad things when he came to\ncollege last Wednesday. Some of the good things he\nsaid were\n- Need enough faith to face\nreality\n- One cannot oversimplify\nthe many complex issues of\nthe world\n- One has to be clear over\nthe fundamentals of one's faith\n- Jesus is alive\nThe bad things were\n-There is not enough evidence for the virgin birth\nfor me to believe it (if this\nis true the Christian faith is\npointless as if Jesus was born of human father he\n\u2022HEAD TENANCY OPEN DAV\nThinking about applying for a flat\nnext Year?\nThis is your chance to see the worst,\nbest and the average CollegeRented flats.\nWEDNESDAY 19TH FEBRUARY\n12 N00N-6PM Collect a list of participating Flats\nfrom Student Services. 15 Princes\nGardens\nOpening Day for Application:FRIDAY 21ST February 1986\nwould be born a sinner and only if he was s in less could his death and resurrection\nsave man from the penalty\nof sin - eternal death.)\n- Jesus is not the only way to God( goes against what\nJesus says in John14 v6'I am the way the truth and the life no one can come to\nthe Father but by me'.)\n-The good news of the\ngospels is that God is God of the Universe\n(True but much more\nimportant is that Jesus'\ndeath and resurrection can save man from sin.)\n-There is no form of\nevidence for the physical\nresurrection\n(If they could, the Jewish leaders in the first century\nwould have disproved the\nphysical resurrection but\nthey could not as it was true.)\nTo close I quote Romans1 v17' He who is put right\nwith God through faith\nshall live'.\nD awd Thomas\nLife Sci 1\nMoonie's Fight\nBack\nCARP\n4 St Andrews Road\nLondon W14\n01-385 4762\nDear Sir, FELIX recently carried a story ' Moon ie Blues' (31st Jan.) containing several\nuntruths which I would like\nto correct.\n1) CARP and the Unification\nChurch CARP is a movement for\npeople seeking high moral\nand spiritual standards.\nMembership is not\nrestricted to members of\nthe Unification church, although we are proud to\nhave Reverend Moon as\nour founder.\n2) The Myth of\nBrainwashing The charge that Moon ies practice brainwashing\ntechniques has been fully\ndiscredited by recent\nsociological and psychological studies.\nProminent among these is\nthe ' The Making of the\nMoon ie'( Basil Blackwell, \u00a312) by Dr. Eileen Barker of\nLSE. Since the publication\nof this and other studies,\nthe allegation of\nbrainwashing has been\ndiscontinued.\n3) CARP 'offers students a release from the drudgery\nof work'\nStudents seeking a release from work, or an\neasier path, will not find\nwhat they are looking for in\nCARP. CARP expects its\nmembers to excel in\nacademic studies. We want\nto demonstrate how to live\nfor the benefit of others\nand for the sake of God and mankind. This is not\neasy, but it is truly\nworthwhile for those who can rise to the challenge.\n4) ' People who join...are\nseparated from their\nfamilies (and) their\nbelongings'\nDr. Barker's study also\nexposes this allegation as\nuntrue. The great majority\nof members are in regular\nand open contact with their\nparents. There is no evidence of anyone being\ndeprived of any possessions upon joining\nthe Unification Church or\nCARP. Some like to make contributions, but these are\nneither solicited nor required.\n5) 'People who join...suffer\npsychological damage' This is nonsense. In ten\nyears of membership, I have never met anyone who has suffered\n' psychological damage' as a result of contact with us! This is a media invention\nnow totally rejected by\nserious scholars and observers.\nThe Reverend Moon is\nalso described in the article\nas 'a con man'. Nothing could be further from the\ntruth. In recent years,\nleading figures from all\nwalks of life have come to\nknow and respect the\nReverend Moon for the\ngreat work he is doing scientists (including Nobel Laureates), professors,\npoliticians, ministers and other religious\nleaders...even journalists. In\nreality, the Reverend Moon has always been ready to\ninvest not only money, but\nalso his blood, sweat and tears for many projects;\noften these are not even\nassociated with the\nUnification movement.\nRecognition of this work is\nalso reflected in recent\nmedia coverage. The trend\nnowadays is neutral, often\nsupportive. The FELIX article is anachronistic in\nits simple, inaccurate and prejudiced response.\nIn conclusion, I urge all\nIC students to find out for\nthemselves about the\nchallenging work of CARP and the Reverend Moon, by contacting us at the\naddress given.\nYours sincerely,\nMike Balcomb\nCARP Director\n4 Friday 14 February FELIX\n\n"

College\nSecretary John Smith has\nindicated that IC will not be\nable to maintain the current\nlevel of financial support for\nNightline in 1986-87.\nWest London Nightline is an\ninformation and counselling service run for and by students\nin London, and is based in\nPrinces Gardens, South Kensington. Last year the total cost of\nNightline was \u00a310,769. This figure included the rent for flat\nwhich Nightline occupies, \u00a33000, and the director's salary\nof \u00a34,469 as well as a telephone\nbill of \u00a31,352. Of this \u00a31,835 was provided by participating\nstudents unions, including ICU. In 1984-85 Imperial College provided the accommodation, and paid the phone bill and a substantial fraction (40%) of the\ndirector's salary.\nICU Welfare Officer Peter\nWilson has sent a circular to all\nLondon University student\nunions and student newspapers,\nhighlighting the threat posed to\nNightline. Mr Wilson explained that Imperial College will be\nprepared to continue funding accommodation and administration costs, but that\nother colleges must make a substantially larger contribution\nif Nightline is to survive. He called upon all student unions\nto let their college\nadmins t ration know of the\ndifficulties. In particular he asks\nthat all college secretaries be\nmade aware of the problems before the meeting of the\nSecretaries of Schools( Univeristy of London) on r Febraury 28. A proposal will be\nput forward at the meeting,\nsuggesting that Nightlines hould become a University\nservice, and the cost spread\nthinly over a large number of\ncolleges.\nFELIX spoke to College Secretary John Smith about the\nNightline issue yesterday\nmorning. Mr Smith pointed out\nthat other colleges are planning\nto withdraw money from\nNightline, and he was not\nenthusiastic about IC having to\nsupport the service. He was\nunhappy about the present cost\nof \u00a34 per call to Nightline.\nWest London Nightline took\nover 2,600 calls in 1984-85, on\naverage 12 per night during\nterm-time.

This has resulted in\nstudents having to queue and wait to collect their post, and the messenger and security\nguards having a lot more work\nto do. In the most recent\nFalmouth Keo gh newsletter,\nconcern is expressed over the\ngeneral state of security in the\nHall. There has been regular\npress ahead with legal action\nagainst the builder;.\nNorman& Daw burn have\nbeen ordered to pay College a sum in the region of \u00a3850,000\nplus interest and legal costs.\nCollege Secretary John Smith said yesterday that the damages awarded by Judge David\nSmout, QC, totalled more than\n\u00a31 million plus costs. Mr Smith added that the architects were\nlikely to appeal against the\nruling. ( JudgeS m out has\nawarded a14 day stay of\njudgement pending consideration of any appeal).\nMr Smith said that the bulk of\nthe award would go to the\nUGC, and since the cost of the\nrepair work had been\napproximately \u00a31.5million the\nCollege had lost money.\nstealing from landing\nrefrigerators to the value of\nhundreds of pounds.

But despite\nthe rather unsuitable\nweather an a the\ndisconcerting comments of\nboring reason a bia passers by, the hard core of the\nteam set cff in high spirits\nto fight its way through blizzards and arrive at the\nfrozen broads of Norfolk.\nThe first fight to be won was convincing the\nopposition( UEA) that we were seriously considering to break the thin layer of\nice and race against them For some mysterious\nreason they were more keen to go to the pub and challenge our drinking. A short talk and a promise from our team that we were willing to have a drinks\nrace afterwards convinced them there was no place\nfor wimps in our team\n(even if our Commodore still insists on using a lilo\nto sleep on) and that we\nwere determined to go out\nthere and race.\nThe start of the first race,\nwith the IC boats in first\nand second position and\nthe opposition trailing\nbehind showed that we\nreally meant what we said.\nThe rest of the races\nproved to be as easy, so by\nthe end of the day we\ncould boast that we had\nwon al! the races in the\nmatch, an achievement that\nshouldn't be underestimated.\nThis was done without\nthe help of Ape, who viewing the weather and the lack of his dry-suit\ndecided that being team\nphotographer wasn'ta bad\nidea after all. This proved\nrather useful when Robson, after winning the last race\ndecided that he didn't need\nto hold on the tiller\nanymore.

Colin Byrne, the NUS Press\nOfficer, said that the\nUnion's reaction was 'absolute jubilation, and a vindication of NUS's campaign against the\ncontinued erosion of the\nstudent grant'. Duane Pass man and Michael Connolly, Education and Welfare Officers for the\nKensington and Chel tsa sites respectively said that\nthey were 'delight ad that\nthe students feel that NUS is an important\norganisation', adding that\nthey were 'looking forward\nto some great national\ncampaigns'. Ian Markham, Education and Welfare Officer for the\nStrand site, which before\nthe merger was not in the\nNlJ|fc was more hesitant.\nHe said he had enjoyed the\n'lively campaign' which involved 'national hacks'\nfrom both the NUS and the\nFederation of Conservative\nStudents, who are opposed to all compulsory student\nunip n s.He added that he\nfelt-the Conservatives had alienated a large section of\nthe students' and consequently the Union voted to affiliate.

Dave Kingston, hardly\na Left-wing activist,\nattended the protest, as did\nJ Martin Taylor.\nFinally, in the light of the\ndecision by K QC students\nin their recent referendum\nto affiliate to the National\nUnion of Students (FELIX\n729) , and that by UCL at\ntheir U GM not to\nd is affiliate, may I congratulate those students\non their sound judgement,\nand express the hope that\nImperial won't be too long\nin following their example.\nFaced as we are with\nthreats to our education\nand to our standards of\nliving while at College, the\nimportance of national\nrepresentation for all\nstudents, and of coordinated response to the\nthreats has never been\ngreater.\nYours,\nPete Hobbis.\nRSMU Defended\nDear Hugh,\nI'd just like to comment on\ntwo of your articles:\n(1) Every Wednesday is an\nRSM bar night.(2) I gather the RSM Rugby\nClub's 'disgusting\nbehaviour' consisted of\nstanding on a table singing\n'We're going up sunshine\nmountain'-a totally\ninnocuous song.\n(3) The RSMU budget was\na statement of expenditure,\nnot the final claim to ICU,\nwhich has to have income\ndeducted from it. Even so it\nhas risen, but this is due to\na rise in interest in RSMU\nand the new clubs being\nfounded within it.\nBut did FELIX ever try to\nask our side? No! Yet again\none sided rumour is\nprinted, and the resultant\nimage not cared about. I personally am beginning to\nget pissed off with this anti-RSMU stance. I Hope next\nyear's Editor will try and\nask the other side before\nprinting inflammatory\nrumours.\n/ remain yours, etc\nDavid Pearce\nSexist SF Soc\nDear Hugh,\nI wish to moan bitterly\nabout the grossly sexist\nattitude displayed by Dave\nClements (I believe), SF\nSoc Chairman (on\npermanent loan from South\nBermondsey Sewage\nReprocessing Unit) ie\n'...when men were men and\nwomen did what they were\ntold' in last week's advert\n(hardly a feature) for\n'Picyornose 4'. It is bad\nenough having to endure\nthe Cosmic Ferret's abysmally pretentious\nstories which weekly\nmasquerade as articles, let\nalone being subjected to\nhis doctrinal ly unsound\nattitudes.

Some are a pain\u2014maybe they've had a year in industry, or come\nfrom public school, and\nthink they know how things\nought to be\u2014but it's their\nfirst experience of college,\nso they moderate their\nviews. PhD fresher s are fine\ntoo\u2014either working quietly,\nor being of such hyper\nintelligence that they fit\ninto the 'IC Attitude' easily.\nMost MSc's are great\nguys/women too\u2014but\nsome are real arse holes. They come from some\ncrappy provincial little\nuniversity where they were\ntop dogs, and bring their\ncrappy provincial little\nattitudes to Imperial.\nThere is a case in point\nwho attends the MSc/3rd Year Al lectures in\nComputing. What a wally!\nHe banters the lecturer with\npointless quips, interrupts\nwith irrelevant quips and\nthen loudly admonishes\nany other student\nmurmuring in the\nbackground. Yet he seems\nto have no comprehension\nof how incredibly irritating\nhe is to everyone else.\nI am not criticising his\nridiculous dress or the way\nhe wrinkles his nose, like a Pekinese on heat\u2014each to\nhis own. What I object to is\nhis attitude to lectures. At\nIC we listen reasonably\nquietly and attentively.\nQuestions are used to\nmake ideas more\ncomprehensible. They\nshould not be used to\nscore points to enhance a student's personal\nstanding. It is a pain in the\nbutt that one student can\nso completely waste eighty\npeople's time for no better\nreason than to try to make\nhimself look good.\nYours faithfully,\n3rd Year Computing\nUndergraduate\n(Name supplied but wit held by request)\nThanks\nDear All,\nMay I, on behalf of Pete\nand myself, say a big thank\nyou to everybody,\nespecially Tom, for the\nsupport which the guests at\nthe RCS Annual Dinner\ngave us on the\nannouncement of our\nengagement.

    "content": "Planning For Disaster\nIncidents at nuclear power plants, like the one in 1979 at\nThree Mile Island in the United States, are fortunately very\nrare. However, it is important to consider the potential\nconsequences of such accidents and pre-plan emergency\nprocedures. Debbie Wilkes examines the research being\ndone at IC in this field and the safety measures being\ntaken at home and abroad.\nThis assessment of\npossible consequences can be extremely complex, as it\nhas to take into account all\nthe factors of the release,\nits dispersion into the\nenvironment, and the\nresultant contamination\nand exposure of human beings. Here at Imperial\nCollege, in the Mechanical Engineering Department, a group under Dr HelenA p simon is looking at\nnumerical models for the\ndispersion of pollutants in\nthe atmosphere; with the\naim of estimating risk on a probabilistic basis and to\nhelp in the planning of\nemergency procedures.\nPre planning of\nemergency procedures is of\nthe utmost importance, as\nin the event of an accident\nat a nuclear power plant\nrapid action might be\nneeded to protect people.\nThe form of any protective\nmeasures would depend on many different factors\nincluding local geography,\nsituation of population\ndensity relative to the plant,\nweather conditions and the\nmagnitude of the release.\nIn the early phases during\nthe release steps might be\ntaken to protect people\nclose to the plant from\ncontamination through\natmospheric exposure. For\nany protective action to be\neffective there would need\nto be prior knowledge of\nwhich areas were most at\nrisk. Once an atmospheric release had finished there\nwould then be the problem\nof foodstuffs, especially\nmilk and crops, becoming contaminated with activity\ndeposited from the cloud. At this stage it might be\nnecessary to protect people\nat a greater distance from\nthe plant and the protective\nmeasures might well\ninclude destruction of any\nmilk produced in the area.\nFinally there would be an\ninquiry, which would involve an in-depth analysis\nof the consequences over a greater distance. If the\nmost effective emergency procedures are to be\nproduced then all of these\nfactors have to be taken\ninto account.\nDr Ap simon's work\noriginally began with a research project backed by\nthe French Commission Energie Atom i que( CEA). The project was to estimate\nthe collective dose to the\nwhole population that\nwould come from the small\ndoses( small compared to\nthe natural background)\nthat result from routine\noperations. This involved\nlooking at how radioactivity\nmight be dispersed on a European scale, and has\nsubsequently led to further\nwork in this area with the\nEuropean Commission. The Commission requires\ncountries planning to build\nnuclear power stations to\nreport to the EEC on the\npotential trans frontier consequences of an\naccident in one member state on another member state. By using computer simulations of the\ndispersion Dr Ap simon has\nbeen able to obtain a much fuller picture of the\npotential consequences of\nan incident.\nWhen looking at the\npotential risk all the many\ndifferent environmental\ndispersion pathways have\nto be taken into account,\nwith the result that\nassessments can be\nextremely complex. For\ninstance, the characteristics\nof the terrain around a nuclear power plant may\ngreatly affect the\ndispersion. Weather\nconditions at the time of an\nincident may also have an\nimpact, particularly rain, as\nprecipitation brings the\nradioactivity down to earth\nso contaminating the\nsurface and affecting the\nsafety measures needed. A recent development at the\nMeteorological Office means\nthat there is now better\ninformation about the\ndistribution of rainfall in the\nUnited Kingdom. Using radar scanning they now\nproduce a map, once every\nfive minutes, showing where it is raining.\nHowever, at present this\ntype of service is not\navailable for most other\nEuropean countries. The group have also been\nconsidering the effect of\nliving in cities. In particular\nwhether buildings provide\nany shielding, and the ways\nthat radioactive material\nmay penetrate buildings.\nDrAp simon will shortly\nbe chairing an EEC group\nwhich is being set up to\nreview computerised assistance in accident\nassessment. By making use of meteorological data\nextending over the whole of\nEurope Dr Ap simon's group have been able to develop\ncomputer programs to\npredict the trajectories of\npollutants. These programs mEGA BRA Ifl Valentine Verisimilitude\nYes, it's Valentine's day\nagain, folks, the day when\nall your friends get more\ncards than you, even\nthough you posted one to\nyourself on Wednesday, and deep in the heart of\nImperial College there is\nexcitement in the back row\nof lecture five of the\nAdvanced Chatting up Techniques course. Our heroes, Luke, Mike, Neil,\nOliver, and Pete, all\nbudding IC Bachelors have\neach received a Valentine\nfrom one of the five\nluscious beauties in the\nfront row; Andrea, Barbara,\nChristine, Diane, and Elizabeth. They are trying\nto guess which girl sent\nwhich card.\nLuke reckons that Andrea sent Neil's card. Neil,\nmeanwhile, is certain that\nthere is no way Luke's card\ncould have come from\nwere originally developed for use with radioactive\npollutants, but they are also\nvaluable for use with other j pollutants and are currently\nbeing used in Germany for\nacid rain studies.\nDr. Ap simon is also a motivating force behind the\nEuropean Association for\nthe Science of Air Pollution\n( EUR ASAP), of which she is currently chairman. The association, which was only formed recently, aims to\nprovide a forum for\ncommunication and\ncoordination between\nscientists, from Eastern as\nwell as Western Europe, working in the field of air\npollution. So far there has\nbeen an encouraging response from scientists all\nover Europe, and EUR ASAP has full\nprogramme of meetings\nplanned for 1986 beginning in Budapest in April. The international flavour of the\nassociation is reflected in\nthe committee which has\nmembers from Poland, Norway, the United\nKingdom, France, Holland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The members are also drawn\nfrom many different\ndisciplines including\nmeteorologists, chemists\nand biologists. But also\nvery important, the\nassociation aims to include the people implementing air\npollution air pollution\ncontrol measures, so also\nhas members from industry\nand government bodies.\nLast week's incident at the\nSellafield reprocessing plant is a reminder that\nalthough accidents at\nnuclear power plants are\nrare, they do happen. In the\nevent of a more serious\naccident measures to\nprotect people might need\nto be taken with great\nspeed. This can best be\nachieved if well researched\npre-planned emergency procedures exist.\nDiana or Eliazabeth. Mike thinks that Pete's card is\nprobably from Barbara, and\nPete says that Mike's card\nwas definitely not from\nElizabeth.\nNone of the cards was\nactually sent from the girl\nthat can be deduced sent it\non the basis of these\nstatements. Not only that,\nbut every statement turned\nout to be wrong.\nOne of the girls is Pete's sister, and thus hasn't sent\nhim a valentine and,\nknowing who she is would enable you to give all the\ndetails about who actually\nsent Valentines to who.\nSo who did send a Valentine to who, and who is Pete's sister? Answers, etc by Tuesday lunchtime\nfor the \u00a35 prize.\nPennies\nI 've had no solutions to\nthis, so I 'll let it run for\nanother week with a few\nclues\u2014it really isn't that\nhard. The easiest strategy\nworks as long as your\nopponent doesn't put any\nof his coins along a certain\nline. A more complex version of this same strategy relies on who puts\ntheir coin right in the\ncentre of the table. The strategy works for a circular or rectangular\ntable, but not for a triangular one. Enough? See what you can do.\n3\"l IP\nis I FELIX Friday 14 February\n\n"
