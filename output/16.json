    "content": "FELIX\nLETTERS THE EDITOR\nHALL DIHHER\nSir Polypheme, in your last issue (so long ago),\ntook the Musical Society, among others, to task for supporting Dinner in Hall. I must admit that in organising this shameful affair I was somewhat embarrassed at the response from our music makers in College as well as those who help us from adjacent\ncolleges. We totalled80. Very nearly everyone\nwanted to come. Polypheme thought that bringing so many people from one club destroyed the main\npurpose of a Dinner, viz to enable people of differing opinions to come into contact with one ano-ther; yet what better example could you have of\npeople of differing opinions than scientists and\nmusicians?\nPolypheme (who I take it is a male giant) asks,\nwhy not hold a club dinner in the proper manner like law-abiding Union members?* But surely to do this would only result in separating the musicians from\nthe rest - a pity, I think, for both parties. Would\nit not be better for Polypheme to ginger up \"the rest\" until there is such a clam our for places at Hall Dinner that no club could stand a chance of swamping\nHall Dinner?\nBut I agree - 30 was rather too many when our accommodation is still so limited. Tours faithfully,D.M. Tombs.\n* It would see a a \"Club\"Dinner\"were more appropriate\nto giants like Polypheme.\nThe following letter written to the Bd it or ofthe\n\u2022Evening \u2014 ' is reproduced exactly as received.\nIt supports our statement that FELIX will print almost anything!\nstevens terrace\nDear Sir just a few lines I was reading the 'evening 1\nabout the house ing shorted well I thinks those people\nwho hare got fats and house to there self should be\nmade to share them all given up and let somebody with\nchildren we got a single girl live ing in stevens ter race and she as got * room and wont share them and\nthere are plenty more like her I think it time the\ncouncil done something about it your truly Hx wC Philosophical group\nA Philosophical Group has been started within the\nLiterary and Debating Society. Philosophy is included in the syllabus of science students at many\ncontinental universities. It is felt that Philosophy is an interesting subject for discussion and\ndiffers from political discussion in that the results arrived at can sometimes be of practical value.\nThe group will invite speakers to address them\non subjects of philosophical interest and discussion groups will be held. If there is enough interest it might be possible to arrange a course on philosophy at Imperial College.\nThe first meeting of the group will take place\non Thursday, 8th Feb, in the Zoology theatre at 5.15\np.m. Dr. Whitrow or the lia th s. Dept. will speak on\n\"Philosophy and Science\". Watch the notice boards\nfor further meetings.\nP. Wegner, Vice-Chairman.\n'BRAINS TRUST'\nJan. 8th,1950. Gir - For several years the annual programme of the\nLiterary and Debating Society has included a Brains\nTrust. We have invited several notable personalities to I.e. for this year's event, arranged for Thursday,\nFeb. 27th. For the maximum he ne fit from the 'Brains', an\nample supply of really worth-while questions is required. I therefore appeal to the readers of FELIX\nto produce as many as possible, and to send them to the Secretary, Lit.& Deb. Soc., via the Union letter Yours faithfully, Paul G. Jeffery, Hon. Sec., Imp. Coll. Lit.& Deb. Soc.\n'IMPERIAL COLLEGE EXPBDITIONS'\nJan. 5th,1950. Sir It gave me very great pleasure to read in your\nlast number that I.e. are considering organising further expeditions. The 1938 Jan Mayen expedition undoubtedly brought great prestige to the College, but\nI am certain it did far more than that, in the case\nof individual members. They gained an experience\nahd\\a sense of achievement that is difficult to put\ninto words, but which were well worth all the sacrifices that had to be made in order to take part in the expedition.\nAs in most exploration, whether it be topographical or purely scientific, it is extremely difficult to explain to the materially minded people,just what\nis the use of it all. Fortunately, the man who is keen to go and find out things for himself, is not\nreally worried by what other people think, and when\nhis quest is over he is more than certain that it was\nwell worth while.\nSince the war, apart from government sponsored\nlarge expeditions there have been few scientific expeditions other than those organised by various universities to take place during the long vacations.\nSuch 'long vac' expeditions have developed greatly\nin the last2 or3 years and there have been as many\nas 6 or 7 different University expeditions in the field each summer. These expeditions, from St.Andrews,\nBristol, Birmingham, Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, Oxford,\nto mention some, have covered a wide field of investigation in such places as Gambia, Persia, Kenya, Norway, Spitzbergen, Greenland and Jan Mayen.\nIt is good therefore to feel that the spirit of\nadventurous investigation is reawakening in the form\nof a combined I.e. effort, and I very much hope the\nexpeditions will be a great success.\nYours faithfully, A. Stephenson,\nReader in Surveying, Dept. of Civil Engineering.\n(Mr. Stephenson is also director of surveying and curator of instruments at the Royal Geographical Society;\nin this capacity he has supplied many expeditions with\ninstruments and advice; in addition he has himself\nbeen a member of many expeditions in recent years.-Ed.)\nTHIS OHRISTIAH FAITH\nPartly as a result of interest shown during the Mission in London University last term, the LIFCU has\narranged a series of meeting* on the Christian Faith, to be held every Monday (except during exams.), at\n1.15 p.m. in the Botany Lecture Theatre. This series is specially designed fort hose who know little about\nthe Christian Faith and perhaps consider it illogical* or irrelevant to present-day circumstances - and\nwish to know more about some of its aspects. Questions\nwill be invited. We are confident that the facts that will be presented are worthy of the consideration of every true\nscientist and abundantly worth putting to the test., Geoffrey S. Bishop, Hon. Secretary.\nSir' When is Committee Room B coming back into\ncirculation? Yours disgustedly,\nA. Cue.\nContinued from page 1.\nWilson paid 3/6 for a half and R.H. G. Weighill of the\nServices XV was asked 7/- for a coco-cola! It is bel ie ved that the record for the evening was created by\nPaul who retired to bed at 11a.m. the morning follow-ing.

    "content": "FELIX\nSPORT RUGGER\nI.C. were beaten by the Royal Vet l nary College30 in the first round replay of the U.L. Cup; they\nw^ re unfortunately without two of the irregular players, Kenyon and Severn, due to injuries. Despite heavy rain which had fallen in preceeding days the pit vh was in good condition and\nafter losing the to s sI.C. kicked off into as light breeze. The play was very lively and the Vets, showed\nsuperiority in the set scrum s and line out s. The only score came by way of a try by the Vets:\nthe ball went lose during an I.C. attack, a fly kick failed to find touch, and an attempt to fall on the ball by an I.C. player was unsuccessful. The\nVets, seized the opportunity and followed up fast to score a try near the corner, which was not con-verte d. In the second half I.C. fared better, their forwards strove valiantly but lack of finish thwarted their efforts, and when the final whistle blew, I.C. came off the field tired and perhaps\nunlucky losers. SOCCER\nMid-Season Review\nI.C. Soccer is passing through one of those unhappy\nperiods which comes to all clubs at some stage in their history. Two years ago I.C. won the U.L. Cup,\nprovided both teams for the final of the U.L. six aside competition, and had five players regularly in the UL. team including the captain. This season I.C's only link with U.L.is the secretary Wally Goss who is a referee and not a play er; add to this the fact that some senior members of the club are not giving Stuart Williams the support\nhe deserves, and it is not surprising that I. C.are out of the U.L. Cup and that the1 st VI at least will prefer to forget the six aside tournament. Nevert he less, there are signs of improvement, and 6-0 victories over'.\"/ ad ham College, Oxford, and Civil Service Strollers together with a draw against Corinthian Casuals' A' and a42 win over R.M.A.( Sandhurst) hold out hopes of a much brighter future. The visit of the Dutch footballers from Delft wa.; cancelled by them at the last moment, Don Bow tell receiving a telegram which read:\" Sorry can't come,\nteam too strong. Letter following\". Whose team\nwas apparently left to our imagination l The letter following duly arrived and it appears that our Dutch\nfriends had arranged to come over in a tanker but that at the last moment the ship was sent to Korea and, with other methods of transport seemingly too costly, the Dutchmen decided to stay at home.\nThe 2nd XI finished last term with a run of 6\ngames without a win while the3 rd XI which has won\n6 out of the last7 matches seems unable to achieve much in the league. Both these teams are being let down by members not playing regularly while the4 th XI is suffering from the acute lack of interest which killed the5 th XI in its very early infancy. Some\npeople seem to overlook the difficulties involved in compiling a fixture list after the season has started and then, after complaining at the lack of games,man-age to be otherwise engaged when a fixture is arran ged. .\nIS THIS A RECORD? The following is reproduced from \"The University\", Jan. IP til,1951 i \"The course at Roehampjion\nhad been changed to avoid crossing the Portsmouth\nRoad and the distance was slightly increased to just over 5fj miles. E.F. Whitlock ( Imperial College) was\nan easy winner in the Individual Championship,\nrunning in, looking remarkably fresh, in the excellent time of \u00a38 minutes 13 seconds.\"\nWe join with \"The University\" in congratulating Ted Uh it lfc ck' s magnificent performance. His average\nt peed appears to have been 110.5 m.p.h. HOCKEY\nWith half the season past. records of matches played give the following picture: GOALS\nWON DRAWN LOST FOR AGAINST\n1st XIi r4 wgs~222 nd XI40529173 rd XI52318144 thX I2051924li ix ed XI11256 The 1st XI with only five of last year's team\nstill playing has now blended into a workmanlike \u2022\nside playing the direct, open and fast type of game\nwhich is rapidly becoming associated with the name\nof the Club.' In the last six matches 33 goals have \u2022\nbeen scored with only2 against. In the U.L. Cup'\ncompetition the semifinal has been reached for the third year running with excellent prospects of reach-ing the final. The next opponents are Westminster Hospital on February7 th( away).\nThe 2nd XI, playing solidly in defence, still lacks punch in the forward line where the onus of goal scoring rests all too often on the shoulders of\nthe centre forward; this partially explains matches\nbeing lost on three occasions by the odd goal. The 3rd XI can justify a good record despite many team changes and the4 th XI is still manifest when fixtures can be obtained. Special mention should be made of the Club's County player, E.C. Green who has recently played for Middlesex on two occasions. B. W.P. NETBALL\nA TALL STORY\nOn Thursday at915 I. C.W. A. turned out on to the Netball Court for a needle game against a representative team of the hostel men. The match had been\nin play but a few seconds before it became obvious\nthat the ladies needed a few Jacks to raise them-selves to the height of the game. At halftime they were on even terms but gradually the gap widened and though I. C.W. A. tried hard, the final score\nwas 9-4 to the men. Hearsay tells me that I. C.W. A. are changing their motto to \"Never say die\". No,\nnever do.\nElizabeth Canning.\nSAILING\nFrom its inauguration in1949 the Club sailed on the Welsh Harp, a reservoir inN. London over a mile in length where fine racing is possible. Sai ling mainly Fireflies, a IS ft. Dinghy of high per-form ance, the Club, last year, beat United F ospit.al s, Reading, and Kings, lost narrowly to Cambridge\nbut were soundly beaten by Oxford. This year,\nReading have been beaten on their own \" ater, and\nhigh hopes are entertained concerning the senior universities. I.e. is now affiliated to rs.h.F. S. and In this fixture provided two crews out of three. From being the' Cinderella' of the college r,,I.C. is now\none of the strongest due mainly to an influx of extremely competent fresher s. The first3 nter f: ol-leg e points race has also been won b vI.C. In their spare time members have built a slip way, erected a hut and have made many additions to\nthe amenities of the site. All this has been achi eve d by the considerable and whole-hearted co-op-e ration of the constituent colleges. It is felt that this club, perhaps more than any other, exemplifies the spirit of University first and College second, a spirit which is not always shown in other\nspheres of sport. T.R. "

    "content": "FELIX\nVIEWPOINT\nOn this page we hope to print, from time to time,\narticles on controversial topics and matters of gene ral interest. Contributors will be given a carte\nblanche and the Editor, therefore, accepts no resp on sibi lit y for the views expressed. The first of\nthese articles concerns the new london newspaper,\n\"University\".\nPAPER UNIVERSITY The great cry of despair, which incidentally has\nlately acquired a hint of the same monotony as the\nbleating of many sheep, that students at this College\nhave no university life misses one significant fact.\nLondon is not a suitable home for a university.\nWith the world's greatest city to explore, why\nblame the students who refuses to give up time to organise dances for those who have to be cajoled by Jubl i city into dancing? Why blame him for refusing to\nplay rug ger or row for a college which will support\nhim only if mascots be jeopardized on touch line or\ntow-path? What student in his senses will pay/a bob\nto see his companions' endeavours to act when the Hew\nTheatre offers him the finest in the land for one and\nsix?\nIf we in I.C. have tended to miss the obvious,\nsister colleges have shown themselves even less per-ce pti ve. Recently a fortnightly publication has emerged from U.C' sPi. office, the intent of which is clearly to promote a \"University of London Spirit\". As a solemn seal to these intentions the paper is cal led \"The University\".\nSo far two 4-page editions of \"The University\"\nhave been printed. They give news of goings on at\nother colleges and discuss at great length the proposed d is affiliation on political grounds of the N.U.S from the International Union of Students. (I.C. Union d is affiliated from the N.U.S. for similar reasons\nsome years ago). Ofte page is devoted to reviews,art-i cles a nd a short story and the fourth page to Univers it y sport.\nThe newspaper is well brought out. Really up-to-the-minute news is included and if the affairs at\nU.C. tend to attract an undue share of attention this is probably the fault more of other colleges than of\nthe editorial board.\nThe articles are good and the reporting, in gene r al,ex cill ent. One write-up is marred by an abominable trick of using a question and answer form with\nno finite verb in the interrogative. The staccato\neffect produced is probably int\u00bbnde d to rouse the reader - it certainly achieves this but not more readily or less painfully then would rack or thumbscrews. But\nin general we may say that \"The University\" i a the product of a lott of very hard work and -quite considerable\njournalistic and literary talent. It is unfortunate that this talent is so wasted.\nLondon University has a definite function as an examining body, as a useful pool of athletic strength to\ncompete with other unlv ers i tied and as an organisation\nin which colleges within fairly easy reach of each other can find suitable opponents and rivals. London\nUniversity can and does serve no other real purpose.\nIt is useless to compare London with Oxford and\nCambridge and other universities where all students\nfrom whatever college attend the same lectures.Here\nin London each college is an independent unit struggling against almost overwhelming odds to avoid becoming a10 to 5 sweat shop. Any deployment of for ces to foster an unreal is able and only dubiously desi r able \"London University\" Spirit\" is not merely a. waste of time but might possibly be a disservice to the\nindividual colleges.\nThe contributors to \"The University\" should consider whether the joy of writing for a very large but\nparticular public is justified when that public has\nonly a very nominal cohesion.

So when the second and third man both said\nthat they were white men, they were giving no clue\nto their identity. In the same way the first man\nmust also have said \u2022Bhat he was white. So the second man's statement saw at the first man's reply - that\nhe was a black man - was untrue, thus proving the second to be a black man. On the other hand, the third's answer that the first had called himself a white man\nwas true. He thus proved himself to be a white man,\nand eligible for rescue.\nCR0S SW0R DS0L UTI0 'ft 5 u \u2022Hcl E 'ft sE.

Union may as well give up hope; for the oldest inhabitant is al most certainly G.J. H. McCall, postgraduate Geologist. Born in1820( and still going strong) Joe comes\nfrom mixed Irish and Scots stock, who were it seems\nhighly prolific. His great grandfather had twenty children, including three sets of twins J his grandfather married twice having eight children by his first wife and seven by the second. Joe himself comes from a comparatively small family of seven, he being the last straw. After leaving ST. Edward's School, Oxford, where\nhis masters described him as being bone lazy, Joe\ncame to I.C. in1938to study Chemistry. After two\nyears he decided that even the army was better than Chemistry: he was commissioned in the R.A.S. C. and,\ntogether with a few others, was sent to conquer Mada gas car. The conquering hero was then posted to East Africa, and for some time was stationed at Jig j igg a(sic) his experiences here can be described only over a pint in the bar.( For those interested, Joe drinks mild). In 1946 Captain McCall returned to I.C. looking not a day older than when he left; he deserted Chemi s try for Geology, though still retaining an interest an interest in certain fields of Chemistry such as\nfermentation. He finally graduated in1949 top of the year with first class honours show i hg that it is possible to put extensive effort into both academic\nand social aspects of college life. Most of us know Joe as a result of his wide sporting interests. He has represented I.C. in hocky, squash, and cricket, and also plays a good game of poker dice, using an Irish halfpenny as a lucky charm.\nSince he returned to I.C. he has been captain of the I.C. second hockey XI, which as a result of his leadership has the finest team spirit in I.C. and is universally known as Uncle Mac's boys. This spirit is such that of those who have graduated to the first XI some have worked hard for' a passage back again. Joe' s other union activities include: the secretary ship of. the squash club, the Vice presidency of R.C.S.194950, and membership of I.C. Council. A profile on Joe McCall cannot be complete with out a mention of his 'Monumental Evenings'; their magnificence can be appreciated only by firsthand experience. But it is on record that Charles Bristow e once encountered him chanting 'Paddy Reilly' in a westbound tube train trying to get to Cockfosters! Howe ver, these celebrations have become less frequent, for it seems that his views on bachelor hood are being modified: his friends suspect he is' looking around'\n( Erratum: for1820 read1920.) N.U.S. In the N.U.S. referendum on the question of\naffiliation to the International Union of Students10,006 votes against15,632 were cast against cont in u ed membership of I.U.S. Membership of N.U.S. is105,660.

A great darkness is on this tribe. Some time ago an imp is et out across the great water to recover the got of sport taken long ago by the\nAussee tribe.

Christmas Carnival and they will tell you that it was one of the occasions of the year. Thanks are especially due to8. Pascoe and J. M. Groocock, upon whose shoulders fell the monumental task of organising this most en-joy able evening. Fantastic murals inspired by Rex Dadd put ever yone in the right frame of mind as soon as they ent ered the Union* and so right from the beginning the\nshow went with a bang. The company never lacked the\ninspirations of Bacchus - thirsty throats were well supplied with lubrication by Joe McCall and his two\nshirtsleeve d barmen. Their costumes, designed by\nJoe, would have stood them in good stead if they had\nentered the fancy dress parade. Costumes of special mote were those Of Don Webb, wearing a fortune tell er'stent, and Tony Embleton and partner wandering\naround as a pair of coconuts. The Cabaret this year was first class. A satirical ditty( with choreography) by David Greenfield and Joan Spencer; slapstick nonsense with flour, water, and beer by Guildsmen Jack Howarth, Stan\nCoppleman, and Derek Crossley; and the now famous\nZulu war dance by the old firm of Bock and Darkt his time in full dress of grass skirts and black greasepaint, and armed with real as sega is and shields.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE FRIDAY 26 JANUARY 1951\nRUG GER WEEKEND IN PARIS The Rugger Club toured Paris over the New\nYear and played one game against \"The North of\nFrance\". drawing66, There was no lack of\nactivity in other directions as the report shows.\n'DOES ANYONE HERE SPEAK ENGLISH?'\nOf the many perplexing problems discussed in the Oni on bar last term, the question of the rug ger club's tour to France over the New Year week-end claimed many a pint of frothy wisdom before its final settle ment. Despite some verger like rope pulling at a high level by Bill Robin3 on, the end of term saw little more than a vague promise from France and with36 hours to go such trivialities as travel, fixtures and\nac como dati on in Paris still required final confirmation. From out of this chaos eventually came enough orde4r to assemble some twenty-odd of the club at Victoria on the morning of December 29th. Knowing that Dick Edwards was in the party it was decided to meet\nan hour before the time of departure of the boat train but even the stoutest hearts missed a beat when, with a couple of minutes to go Pip Clemo was given up as\nlost. Not that it really mattered he was only one\nof t he forwards! On arrival at St. Lazare the boys were met by a fairy godmother in the form of Paul Valle t who modestly stated that all was arranged and prepared. Very many thanks, Paul, for the marvellous job you did on\nour behalf! That was the last we a aw of several of our party, apart from the game on Sunday, but rumour has it that a group of young men headed by a leader known only as\n\"Ifoose-tac he\" contrived to uphold the finest traditions of the club, T.C., the British Navy and sundry other organisations throughout the coi irs e of the wee-k end,^ he \" intellectuals\" headed by Doc S parkes made\na tour of the Louvre, Notre Dame and many other places of interest, but even this palled and they finished up\nby asking the local representative of Thos. Cook where\nthe best cabarets were to be found. Much to our disappointment, the second game which was to be played at Vieryon was cancelled owing to\nsome 12 inches of snow on the ground. The game played on New Year's Eve in Paris was hindered by 3 inches\nof snow and an iron hard surface. Of the game itself opinions seemed to vary. Some said it was good, some\nnot so good, whilst Stan Coppleman said that by far the best item of the afternoon was the playing of the French military band and the rendering of \"Rule Britannia\"( suitably amended) by the British United Ser v ttc es XV at half time. The match played against a. North of France XV was drawn, each side scoring six u joint s.I.C. went into the lead when Brian Lapp in kicked a magnificent penalty goal from the touch line and at halftime were leading by 6-5 after David Evans\njust beat Dick B lias in the touch-down for a try wide\nout on the right. Possibly the greatest spectacle of\nthe afternoon was afforded by Ian Grieve who, clad in colours blazer and i rima cu late I.C rug ger kit put the\" linesmen at the 'Varsity'game completely in the shade.\nAfter a large meal at the expense of the French; Rugby Onion the team adjourned to the Place Pigalle I where, having regard for the moral stature of FELIX, our reporter lost his note-book- One brilliantly outstanding performance by Derek Hughes is worthy of note. He contributed to the success of -a French Caba ret by a delightful rendering of three English madrigals but had barely informed us of the fate of a certain Mr- B angel stein before his recital was somewhat\nabruptly terminated. The New Year was brought into the strains of\n\" Auld Lang Sune\" and thereafter followed a night of\nmodes* celebration along with the British Combined\nServices XV. We say \"modest\" advisedly since Chris( Continued on page Z.)

The University Grants Committee of the Treasury visited the College on Wednesday 17th January. The\nCommittee visits, the colleges of the University once\nevery five years to gain some notion of how their largesse is absorbed.\nAfter a whirlwind tour of the College and a lightning lunch the University Grants Committee invited the officers of the Union to meet them. Hol ding no brief or notion of what was expected, the\nUnion officers soon regained their customary aplomb\nand for half an hour asked and answered questions of\nthe eminent men seated opp osi te them. In particular the projected extension of the Union building was\nmentioned and some time was devoted to discussing our over specialised curricula. Other topics ment i one d were grants to research workers and I.C.'s use of the University Union at Bloomsbury.\nAmong the members of the Committee is Sir Andrew McCance, the eminent metallurgist, a graduate\nof R.S. M., whose name has been mentioned as the\nprobable distinguished visitor for the 1951 Commemoration Day.\nINTER COLLEGE EXPERIMENT SOUTH KEN. LINK UP ?\nFor some time now there has been increasing aggravation for some sort of interchange of ideas between\nthe sundry faculties housed in our neighbourhood, and much support has been promised to those who have\nraised their voices. At last a tentative but concrete step has been taken in this direction, and a Committee, supported wholeheartedly by the Rector, and consisting of the Presidents and \" Social Secretaries\" of R.C.S., R.C.A. and R. C.H., has been set up.\nThis has now been reorganised to include interested and capable people who are not Officers of the respective College Unions, in order more effectively to bring about the aims of the project. These are: to promote and foster social relations as a start between the colleges concerned and others, by the arranging of debate*, reciprocal invitations to the activities of social arr d academic societies, and the organising of occasional social functions. The outcome of deliberations to date is the organising of a discussion, followed by a buffet and\ndance on Monday, 5th February. It will be held in the Gym. and Upper Dining Hall, and the topic for discussion will range around the place of music, art, and science in University education. It is hoped\nto include among the attractions an Eminent Personage\nto stimulate discussion, and this practice will be\nmaintained at future functions. It is to be hoped that readers will support this venture with the enthusiasm it deserves, and also bear in mind that the discussion will be primarily by\nand for them, and even if they' ve nothing to say, get\nup on their hind legs and say it. Write it down in your diary now, and keep an eye open for notices^ later on. .

We sat and thought, we s at, Felix jumped\ninto the editor's lap with a plaintive look in his eyes, the sports editor ran round the table and the\nrest of the board dozed off. Then one of the brig h ter among us showed us the reason for our so far empty pages: No news! Nothing had happened this term!\nThe ghost of apathy haunting I.C. nf ter the frolics of last term - the Spring of our year - the slothful genie of the brown bag was reappearing, encouraged\nand emboldened by the prospect of exams. Or could we hope that the general torpor was just the after math of Christmases too well spent?\nWhatever the reason, FELIX had then received only two letters, a few entries for Coming Events,\na piece of string and a brass button. Now this is not go cd enough for a college of cat lovers. FELIX\nexpects better treatment of f elin ophile s. If things get no better the FELIX Board will be obliged to go\nout and make their own news by burning down the\nUnion or shooting the President. At the time of writing we have received a few\nmore articles and news items and we hope that drastic action will prove unnecessary. However, we would\nurge you, our readers, to make more use of our correspondence columns. In FELIX you can air your\ngrievances, grind your axes, communicate with your\nenters, castigate your enemies or perhaps even raise a laugh. There is plenty to write about. What has\nfollowed, last term's bold words about a college mas-cot? What has happened to the Beaver Club? What of\nthe controversy over divided loyalties in sport? Has the refectory so soon - balanced its budget?\nAnd its food values? Bones of contention are simply\nlittered about the place. There are dozens of topi cs that deserve publicity and discussion. If FELIX\nis to be more than a last resting place for the\nhidebound notions of the editor and his minions, you\nmust take up your pen and write!

Apply\nBox 92.\nUNIVERSITY ARMADA( At a recent U.L. U. Council Meeting it was suggested that the University hold a Carnival Procession on the fh ames this summer. The following account has been\nwritten by a FELIX reporter well known for his prophetic writings) Fifty minutes after the procession was due to start, eager crowds lining the Embankment from Chel sea to Hungerford bridge were rewarded by sounds of music, fireworks and profane language from upstream.\nThe delay was caused by the unfortunate circumstance that the barge representing Domestic Science, normally employed by the Wandsworth Borough Council, had not, when taken over for the Carnival, discharged its cargo of refuse, and the occupants of the barges\nfollowing it had protested so strongly that its pos-it ion had had to be changed to the last place in the\nprocession, where it was towed at the end of along warp. Their steering was consequently somewhat erratic, and. it is understood that Battersea Bridge and\nAlbert Bridge will be closed to traffic for some time\nwhile repairs are carried out on the piers. The long procession was towed by the S.T.\" King Coal\". The first three barges, carrying the officers of U.L. U. plus tableau representing \"The Spirit of the University\" were completely obscured by smoke\nduring the entire proceedings. Space does not pe rmit a description of the whole fleet. There was a massed orchestra playing Handel's Water Music,though\nunfortunately the music, and eventually most of the\norchestra, were drowned by the rather ambitious fire works contributed jointly by the R.S. M. Mining dept.\nand the R.C.S. Chemistry dept.\nThe previous night the advice of a prominent\nmember of I. C.B.C. had been sought on the problems\nand rules of navigation. The gentleman concerned\nhad been in the bar at the time, and it seems that a false impression of the true facts had been ob tai ned. As a result, when, at Chelsea Bridge a westward bound string of barges was encountered, whereas\nthe Master of the King Coal altered course, rightly, to starboard, the barge manned by L.S.E. somewhere\nin t he middle of the procession, steered to port. In a few seconds the scene re ssem bled a log-gam on\nthe St. Lawrence.\nThe following brief conversation then took place between the two tug skippers:!!'\"!!!\" At this point1? young ladies on the barge representing6 he Women's Colleges fainted and were transferred to the Hospital's barge, where they were det a in ed for the rest of the afternoon. The master of\nthe King Coal castoff the remaining barges and went\nhome for tea. The Lord Mayor, officials of! he University and\nseveral M.P.s, waiting on the terrace of the Palace of Westminster, were surprised to see the procession drift past them roughly inline abreast, but agreed\nthat the change in plan had probably been made to save time. The ultimate fate of each craft taking part is unknown, but isolated, and doubtless exaggerated reports have been received. Several barges jammed acr oss the spans of the Exhibition footbridge thus causing panic at the E.E. headquarters, and were rescued\nby the river Police. The polytechnics were carried up Barking Creek with no means of propulsion. The\nWomen's barge was rescued by the crew of a South Amer i can ship berthed in the Pool and has not been heard,\nof since. One of the barges is reported to have run\naground at Southend and the occupants to have perished of exhaustion while walking towards the land. The\nU.L. B. officers, in the first barge, landed at Margate\nPier where they were mistaken for Nigger Minstrels and\nhave been drawing large crowds for the time of yee r.It is understood that next year the University plans to hold a procession from the Aldwych to Senate\nHouse, on foot.\" It seems to me the only way to be saved\nis to fly a Hag from the mast.\"\n\n"
