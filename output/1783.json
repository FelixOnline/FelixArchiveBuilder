    "content": "FRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\nSCIENCE\n9\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThis week in Science...\nLondon\u2019s air quality has improved... but not because of the\nULEZ\nImperial at COP26\nA delegation of researchers and engineers attended COP26 as representatives from the College\u2019s Enterprise Division and Grantham Institute.\nCOP26 delivered a new climate pact which was agreed to by over 190\ncountries, and an agreement that burning fossil fuels is warming the planet and causing climate change. But scientists say that nation\u2019s pledges to\ncut their emissions (NDCs - Nationally Determined Contributions) still\nfall short of reaching the Paris Agreement Goal to keep global temperatures below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Professor Sir Brian Hoskins,\nChair of the Grantham Institute said \u201cthe crucial test of all the words spoken and promises made are: will the global greenhouse gas emission curve\nreach a maximum by the middle of this decade and then start to fall?\u201d\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nUsing mechanical tools can improve our language skills\nNew company Isomorphic Labs: can it apply protein folding\npredictions to the pharmaceutical industry?\nGoogle owner Alphabet has launched a new company Isomorphic Labs\nwith the goal to \u201creimagine the entire drug discovery process from first\nprinciples with an AI-first approach\u201d. It is very hard to infer the protein\nshape and folding from a genetic or amino acid sequence. Its sister company DeepMind wowed the scientific world with its AlphaFold2 technology\nin 2020, which can accurately predict the shape of almost every protein in\nthe human body, providing a huge leap forward in this challenge. It has\nnow made this tool available on an open source basis for pharmaceutical\ncompanies and researchers. However, the move to use machine learning\nto deduce protein folding has been criticised for being idealistic, as it may\nnot perform as effectively in the real world as it has in competitions.\nBetween 2016 and 2020, there were huge improvements to air quality in\nLondon, with a 94% reduction in the number of Londoners living with illegally high levels of air pollution. The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ),\nwhere more polluting vehicles must pay a daily charge to drive through,\nonly contributed to less than 3% of the reduction in nitrogen dioxide lev-els, and negligible decreases in air particulates and ozone concentrations.\nDr Marc Stettler from Imperial\u2019s Department of Civil and Environmental\nEngineering said \u201cthe case of London shows us that (ULEZ) works best\nwhen combined with a broader set of policies that reduce emissions across\nsectors.\u201d Air pollution caused 40,000 deaths in the UK in 2019, 4,000 of\nwhich were in London.\nRayan Kamal Tech Editor\nApple\u2019s Unimaginable\nWeek\nIn 2019, researchers found a correlation between proficiency in tool\nuse and good syntax ability. A new study from researchers from Inserm,\nCNRS, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1 and Universit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re Lyon\n2 in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet in Sweden confirmed using brain imaging techniques and behavioural experiments that the same\nregion of the brain in the \u201cbasal ganglia\u201d is activated when participants\ncompleted syntactic exercises in French, and employed motor skills using pliars. They also confirmed that syntactic comprehension improved\nafter motor exercises, which could mean that one could be trained by doing the other. This could prove useful in a clinical setting, particularly\nwith patients who have lost certain language abilities.\nTraditionally giant tech companies have been known to be quite\nstringent on their rules for repairing\ndevices, which has in turn brought into\nquestion the common phrase: the right\nto repair. Many examples of this can be\nfound, one of the most notable being:\nApple charging extortionate amounts\nfor replacing cracked glass screens on\ntheir iPhone and Apple watches, some\nprices ranging to almost \u00a3600. Often\nthis is almost the same amount of\nmoney that can be spent on just buying a new phone. What\u2019s interesting is\nthat the parts themselves do not cost\nas much, which can allow repairs by\nthe third-party sector to be cheaper.\nAdditionally, third party repairs can\nallow the technology sector to be more\nenvironmentally friendly as new phones\nare not being made as a result of a lower\ndemand; due to the simple fact that\nolder phones can last longer. Thus, Apple have recently been under fire from\na range of people, including their own\nfans. However, just this week Apple\nmade a huge announcement. Something\nthat shocked everyone!\nYes, iPhone owners and product enthusiasts can now purchase their own\nparts directly from Apple to repair their\nown products. Along with the products themselves, consumers also receive\ngenuine Apple tools and a repair man-ual, which in theory should guide you\nthrough the ins and outs of many of the\ncommonrepairsthatwecoulddoinstead\nof just purchasing a new phone - such as\na battery replacement. iPhone owners\nare not the only ones, however, who get\nto experience this joyous occasion. No.\nEven Mac users can rejoice as this right-to-repair movement can involve them\ntoo. Currently Apple is offering only the\nparts and tools to repair the basics, nev-ertheless, as Lao Tzu eloquently put it: \u201ca\njourney of a thousand miles begins with\na single step\u201d.\nApple\u2019s previously have been known\nto lobby against the right-to-repair,\nciting that the lack or use of third-par-ty parts can be damaging to devices as\nthey are often not regulated by Apple or\nby the same strict regulation standards\nthat the larger companies have to. Apple also sells a subscription: Apple-care\nPlus, which offers substantial discounts\nfor many of the previous pricey repairs.\nThus, following this news, the advocates of the right-to-repair movement\nsee this as a huge win, and many of the\ntech influencers are surprised by Apple\u2019s\nunusual change in demeanour. Having\nremoved the touch bar from the MacBook Pro, something which many complained about, to changing the keyboard\non the new Macs, to improving the cameras on the new iPhone, and now this,\nthe shocks keep on coming. I know that\nwe\u2019re all waiting for what\u2019s next from\nthis giant technological conglomerate.\nImage Credits: Envato Elements, FabrikaPhoto\n\n"

In August 2020, Belarus\nheld an election widely perceived as\nrigged, where the incumbent dictator\nAlexandr Lukashenko claimed 80%\nof the vote and claimed victory for\nthe sixth election in a row,\nsecuring himself in the\nposition he has held\nsince 1994. This\nmarks the first event\ncausing a long list\nof sanctions made\nby the EU (and later\nthe US and other\nwestern countries)\nagainst Belarusian officials.\nSanctions that followed the rigged\nelection were in response to violently\noverzealous oppression of peaceful\nprotesters who came out against\nthe government\u2019s actions. The rival\ncandidateexpectedtowininafreeand\nfair election was arrested, driven to\nthe border with Lithuania, and exiled.\nBelarusian-EU relations worsened in\nMay this year when Belarusian jets\napproached a flight from Athens to\nLithuania, whilst it was in Belarusian\nairspace, and forced it to land,\nciting a bomb threat. Once landed,\nthe plane was boarded and a pro-opposition journalist was arrested\nand taken into custody. This flagrant\nabuse of power invited far-reaching\nsanctions from the US, and caused\nthose from the EU to be ramped up.\nThis has so far resulted in economic\nandtravelsanctionson166Belarusian\nindividuals and 15 entities (including\nthe aforementioned airlines),\nessentially limiting the powerful\nin Belarus from accessing Europe.\nWhat the EU have taken away,\nRussia has more than replaced for\nLukashenko. Seemlingly like a\npuppeteer, Putin is using the current\nsituation to destabalise Europe and\nstrengthen his own position. Officials\neven fear military action from Russia,\nwith thousands of troops being\ndeployed at its Ukrainian border\nover the last two weeks. The Polish\nPM said of the current crisis: \u201cit\nhas its mastermind in Moscow\u201d.\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko know\nthat European leaders fear a repeat of\nthe 2015 migrant crisis, and are using\nit unashamedly to their advantage.\nLukashenko quickly began inviting\nrefugees from countries such as\nSyria with fauxpen arms, waiving the\nneed for visas and receiving an influx\nof desperate people because of it.\nThis leads us to the current\ncatastrophe at the BelarusPoland border. 15,000\nrefugees attempted\nto cross the border in\nOctober alone (putting\nthe Channel crossings into\nperspective, these stand at\naround 23,500 this year).\nPoland has deployed at\nleast 20,000 border police\nat the border to hold back\nthose trying to cross. Belarus has been\nfunnelling people towards the border,\nwhere they meet a 3km thick wooded\nno man\u2019s land between the countries.\nThere have been reports of Belarusian\nauthorities providing the refugees\nwith wire cutters to aid their crossing.\nWithin this wooded belt, refugees\nare left with no shelter, no food, sub-zero temperatures and two borders\nbattling it out over who wants them\nthe least. At least nine people have\ndied. Poland\u2019s border police have\nused water cannons to keep them\nback from the newly-erected fences.\nThey have blocked humanitarian\naid and journalists from entering\nthe contentious areas, actions\nwhich break humanitarian law.\nBreach of international laws comes\nagainst a backdrop of contention\nbetween Poland and the EU, the\nformer refusing to accept that the\nEU\u2019s laws should superseed their\nown. As fractures grow, Putin must be\npattinghimselfontheback,hisdesires\nbeing met perfectly. Undoubtedly, a\nPoland out of the EU would receive\nmuch the same olive branch that\nBelarus did a year ago. Whether\nthey\u2019d accept it is another matter.\nThe aspect of this that truly shocks\nme is the utter lack of humanity\nshown on both sides of the border to\nfellow human beings. Saying that the\nrefugees are being used as gambling\nchips doesn\u2019t even come close to\ndescribing the malice with which\nthe world\u2019s most desperate people\nare being treated by Belarus and the\nsupposedmoralbastionthatistheEU.\nMigrants\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

Showstopper! takes this a step further,\ncreating a fully improvised musical where every song\nsung and every step taken happens that night only and\nnever again.\nThe show starts with a narrator character (sort of)\ntaking audience suggestions for settings, song styles\nand general plot points. After a slightly drawn out back\nand forth with the audience, a mermaid and pirate musical called \u201cWho Do You Think You Arrr?\u201d is decided\non and seconds later, the cast bursts out on stage ready\nto take the audience on an impromtu journey.\nThe opening song is an epic one, reminiscent of the\nLes Miserables opener, and immediately the audience\nsees that these are professionals and any worries they\nmight have had about seeing some quirky improv show\nare put to rest.\nThe story adlibbed by the actors is of Captain Abernathy sailing to mermaid-infested Tortuga in the\nsearch of fame and glory. A small joke about recording\na podcast by Lucy Trodd, quickly spins out into a full\nsubplot, bringing many laughs from the audience but\na more sinister plot of mutiny and a torrid love affair\ndominates the story.\nTrodd, a seasoned performer, does not always take\ncentre stage but every offhand comment she makes hits\na home run, and even when she is just milling in the\nbackground, she is always in full character doing some-thingthatwillmakeyoulaugh--adefinitescenestealer.\nWhen the dialogue seems to stifle, the narrator intervenes to spice things up, for example, making one\ncharacterspeakinaBrummieaccent\u2026andthenadding\na requirement that he must speak in iambic pentameter\ntoo! The musical styles are also prescribed at times by\nthis narrator, with Ruth Bratt delivering an enthralling\nperformance in the style of German composer Kurt\nWeill as the main evil mermaid.\nPopular musicals like Six and Hamilton are suggested by the audience with Adam Meggido taking on a\nmusicalrap,seamlesslycreatingawholesonginthisdif-ficult style on the fly. Meggido is able to bring humour,\nleading the troupe during a Spice Girls style opening\nnumber, as well as conveying more serious scenes when\nhis love interest with the captain comes into play, allowing the rather helter skelter plot to advance.\nImprovised shows are impressive, and this troupe\nare adding singing and dancing to an already difficult\nart form.

By 2028,\nthe scheme will have been phased out\nentirely. The money is not just being\nreabsorbed by Whitehall and will\ninstead be used to fund environmentally\nbeneficialpracticessuchasflooddefence,\ngenerating woodland, and rewilding.\nThe potential for the scheme is huge -Professor Ian Boyd, ex-Chief Scientist\nat DEFRA described some farmers as\n\u201csitting on a gold mine\u201d in terms of\npayments they could get for using their\nland to grow trees.\nBoyd\u2019s vision also includes reutilising\nland for what its best suited for. He\nclaims around 50% of British farmland\nproduces only 20% of the food due\nto it being, for example, too high and\nthereforeimperfectforcropgrowth.The\nbook Wilding highlights an example of\nwhere reutilising land can be far better\nfor society than inefficiently growing\ncrops. Land that was rewilded through\nthe introduction of more trees and\ndecompaction of soil prevented millions\nof pounds in flood damage which had\nbeenobservedatsimilarlyheavyrainfalls\nover the past few decades.\nSpeaking of trees, how about\nsome elms? Or, more specifically,\nEnvironmental Land Management\nSchemes(ELMS),theUK\u2019srevolutionary\nscheme for land management aimed at\npromoting growth of healthy food and\nrestoring nature. The Cerberus of ELMS\nhas three heads: Sustainable Farming\nIncentive, Local Nature Recovery, and\nLandscape Recovery. All revolve around\nthe same principles of reaching net zero\nby 2050, and farmers will be rewarded\nfor the following:\n\u2022 Clean and plentiful water,\n\u2022 Clean air,\n\u2022 Thriving plants and wildlife,\n\u2022 Protection from environmental\nhazards,\n\u2022 Reduction of and adaptation to\nclimate change, and\n\u2022 Beauty,heritageandengagement\nwith the environment.\nOn the surface these look like great\nideas. The issue with this change\nin scheme, as is mandatory in the\noperation of this government, is that\nits implementation has been poorly\nthought through and not prepared for.\nPutting the fact that there is no concrete\nfinancial planning for it beyond the\nterm of the current government, the\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs\n(EFRA) select committee has warned\nthat the \u201chaphazard\u201d transition between\nfunding models puts many farmers at\nrisk of being put out of business.\nEFRA recently put forward a number\nofrecommendationsthathighlightquite\nwell the aforementioned haphazardness\nof the roll out. These included that\nDEFRAshouldpublishasetofclearand\nmeasurable objectives for the scheme\nbefore the window for application to\nthe pilot scheme opens in 2022. This, of\ncourse, means that there currently is not\na set of clear and measurable objectives\nfor the scheme.\nEnvironment Secretary\nGeorge Eustice rejected\nsuggestions that\nBPS should\nbe extended\nslightly\nto help\nfarmers\ntransition\nm o r e\neasily, as\n\u201csitting\non our hand for\nfour years is not\nan option\u201d. But fear not,\nfarmers who\nare worried about bankruptcy and\ndestruction of livelihood, for on the gov\nwebsite it is stated : \u201cTo help manage\nthis transition and support you with\nyour business planning, we have created\nan online calculator\u201d. Prayers answered.\nAn odd caveat of the current plans\nis an aspect called the Lump Sum Exit\nScheme, made available to farmers who\n\u201care looking to retire or leave farming to\ndo so in a planned and managed way\u201d.\nSo subsidy for freeing up land for other\nuses, as in Boyd\u2019s dream? Alas no, as\nthis sentence is justified with \u201cThis will\nalso free up land for new entrants and\nexisting farmers wishing to expand\u201d.\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\n\n"

The decision to fund \u2018Energy\nRevolution: The Adani Green Energy\nGallery\u2019 from a company primarily\nconcerned with fossil fuel use has been\ncalled\u201creckless\u201dbycampaigners,justone\nresponse that marks a string of recent\ncriticism aimed at the Science Museum.\nFor example, in May, the UK Student\nClimate Network (UKSCN) led a\nprotest at the Science Museum over a\nsponsorship from Shell that supported\nits \u2018Our Future Planet\u2019 exhibition. It was\nuncoveredthat,intheirpartnershipwith\nShell, the Science Museum Group had\nsigned a \u2018gagging clause\u2019 that committed\nthem to not \u201cdamage the goodwill or\nreputation\u201d of the fossil fuel company.\nThese relationships have led to the\nresignations of mathematician and\npresenter Hannah Fry, and Director of\nthe Institute for Research in Schools\nJo Foster from the Museum\u2019s board\nof trustees. Professor Chris Rapley, a\nformer director of the Museum, was\nanother to resign, leaving the Advisory\nBoard due to the Museum\u2019s continued\npartnerships with fossil fuel companies.\nThe Science Museum\u2019s decision to\npartner with some of the biggest fossil\nfuel conglomerates in the world has\nbeen hailed as \u201castonishing\u201d. Jess Worth,\nCo-Director of Culture Unstained, a\nresearch, engagement, and campaigning\norganisation which aims to end fossil\nfuelsponsorshipofculture,stated\u201cTheir\nenthusiasm for fossil fuel partnerships\nhas turned controversy into a crisis of\ncredibility, and they must be held to\naccount for their reckless decisions.\u201d\nAdani themselves have also not been\nfree from deserved criticism. They\nrecently came under fire from Nedan\nfarmers and villagers in the Jalsaimer\ndistrict of Rajasthan, India, when\nnearly 990 hectares of cultivable land\nwere allocated to the organisation\nto use in a green energy project.\nSimilar occurrences have happened\nin Australia, where Adani targeted\nindigenous land for coal extraction\nprojects. On the Science Museum\nsponsorship, Adrian Burragubba, an\nindigenous leader who was made to\nleave traditional lands by Adani, said\n\u201cBy putting this company on a pedestal,\nthe Science Museum is complicit in\nAdani\u2019s violation of our human rights\nThe Science Museum\u2019s Climate Exhibition\u2014Medium for Public Awareness or\nCorporate Rebranding?\nJack Cribb Environment Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n15\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nof inadequacy is what she was referring\nto.

    "content": "FRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\nSCIENCE\n9\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPhysicists already know a lot about\nneutrinos. First proposed by Wolfgang Pauli (you might recognise him\nfrom the Pauli Exclusion Principle) by a\nletter to a nuclear physics conference in\nTubingen, neutrinos are light particles\nwhich interact only via gravity and the\nshort-rangeweakforce.Thismakesthem\nincredibly difficult to detect, so much so\nthat Pauli decided against publishing his\nideas in a paper as he disliked the idea of\ntheorisingaparticlewhichwaspractical-ly impossible to detect. It took over 20\nyears for Pauli\u2019s ideas to be confirmed,\nwith scientists nearly going as far as placing a detector next to a nuclear blast.\nSincethen,wehavediscoveredthatthere\nare three \u2018flavours\u2019 (types) of neutrinos -the electron, muon, and tau neutrino.\nThese three flavours oscillate between\neach other and understanding how they\ndo this has been the topic of research for\nmany years. In 2007, scientists at Fermilab\u2019s MiniBoonE experiment confirmed\nprevious results which showed that only\na third of solar neutrinos were detected than expected. Could this point to\nsome sort of new ghost particle? A new\nflavour of neutrino which does interact\nwith the weak force? And thus came the\nsterile neutrino.\nThe sterile neutrino is a theorised\nextremely light-weight neutrino which\nwould interact solely via gravity. The\nterm sterile comes about because it lacks\nany electromagnetic charge, colour (the\ncharge of the strong force), or weak hy-percharge. This would make them even\nharder to spot than the elusive \u2018regular\u2019\nneutrinos, as gravity is already a relatively weak force and neutrinos have a very\nlow mass. The implications of this particle could be tremendous. Since they\nhave no other interactions apart from\nwith gravity, and have non-zero mass,\nsterile neutrinos make interesting candidates for dark matter. The sterile neutrino is not predicted in the Standard\nModel, currently our best model\nfor understanding the universe,\nand so its discovery could lead\nto new physics.\nIf MiniBoonE already confirmed previous results, why\ndid we need MicroBoonE to\ncarry out further studies? MiniBoonE is a Cherenkov detec-tor, meaning that it detects\nthe radiation released\nby a particle travelling\nthrough a material faster than light can travel through it (this is\nknown as Cherenkov\nradiation). This means\nit can do a good job of\ndistinguishing muons\nform electrons, but not so\nmuch when it comes to distinguishing high energy photons\nfrom high energy electrons. This is\nwhere MicroBoonE comes in. MicroBoonE is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) - a promising\ntechnology that up until now has not\nproduced any major results. LArTPC\nis more efficient in separating photons\nfrom electrons. This is extremely useful\nas any MiniBoonE event excess could be\nmade up of photons from nuclear inter-actions, or electrons from electron-neu-trino interactions (which are the source\nof the oscillations we\u2019re investigating).\nSo what did MicroBoonE find?\nWell, the key question is what didn\u2019t MicroBoonE find. The main experiment\nconsists of firing a beam of neutrons\nand seeing how their flavour oscillates as\nthey travel. MicroBoonE gathered data\nover several years and the result published on the 27th of October showed\nno excess of electron neutrinos, thus\nindicating no evidence for sterile neutri-nos. This is a definitive result, which is\nconsistent with what the Standard Model predicts: three kinds of neutrino\u2014no\nmore, no less.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the search\nfor sterile neutrinos is dead - the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment\n(DUNE), a flagship international experiment expected to go live in 2027\nalready has more than 1,000 researchers from over 30 countries. DUNE will\nstudy oscillations by sending neutrinos\n800 miles through the earth to detectors\nat the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility. The UK Principal Investigator\nfor the DUNE experiment, and professor at Imperial College, Morgan Wascko\nis already looking forward to future ex-periments: \u201cThe LBNF neutrino beam\nthat will supply neutrinos for DUNE\nwill be the world\u2019s most powerful neutrino beam, so it will have incredible sensitivity for sterile neutrinos and many\nother rare event searches. This is great\nbecause it is possible that new phenomena are lurking just below the sensitivity levels of current experiments.\u201d There\nis also reason to be excited about the\nT2K experiment as the J-PARC neutrino beam that feeds it will be upgraded\nover the following years ahead of the\nHyper-Kamiokande experiment. Both\nof these could lead plenty of dark-sector\n(dark matter related) searches thanks to\ntheir powerful beams, and could possibly determine the nature of the sterile\nneutrino once and for all.\nAriel Flint Science Writer\nThe accelerator rings at Fermilab in Illinois, USA\nNew results from Fermilab\u2019s MicroBoonE experiment fail to find evidence for the theorised particle\nknown as the sterile neutrino.\nLeave No Trace - Sterile Neutrino\nSearch Comes Up Empty\nImage Credits: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

    "content": "Before I introduce you to the star of the show, I\nfirstly want to introduce you to the idea of what\nMidye Dolma is. Midye Dolma is the name given to a\nstreet food dish commonly eaten in the coastal areas of\nTurkey, such as \u0130stanbul, \u0130zmir and Bodrum. The word\n\u2018Midye\u2019 in Turkish means Mussels, and the word \u2018Dolma\u2019 means \u2018stuffing\u2019 or \u2018filling\u2019, so together Midye Dolma means stuffed mussels. Midye Dolmas are always\nstuffed with aromatic rice and served with a freshly cut\nlemon on the side and what you put into rice is limited\nto your imagination but typically people add salt, black\npepper, onions and tomato paste. Midye Dolma can\nalso be simply referred to as Midye.\nThe Midyeci is a newly established restaurant in the\nbustling and ever changing streets of Dalston, located\nin the cross bridge of Islington and Hackney it is easily\naccessible and close to transport links such as the\noverground (Dalston Junction/Haggerston) and bus.\nIt is roughly around 45 minutes from Imperial. The\nman pioneering and challenging the idea of Turkish\nfood being a simple and greasy late-night takeaway\nafter clubbing is Ahmet Zotkadzha. Being born and\nraised in Turkey and then coming to the UK later on\nin his life, he felt that even though London is very\nrich in culinary foods, the city had not developed and\ndiversified enough of its seafood choices. During the\nspring of 2021 he planned on doing exactly that by\nopening his very own store and bringing dishes that are\nadored by many in Turkey but not yet well known in\nthe UK.\nThe Midyeci has a humble selection of seafoods\navailable, providing different deals for those of you\nwho are not sure on what to get and those that like a\nbit of a bargain. They also serve two popular Turkish\ndrinks, one being a drink called Ayran, which is a salty\ndilutedyogurtdrinkandShalgamwhichisafermented\nturnip juice - something you either love or hate - along\nwith your standard coke and water.\nThe first dish is the Midye Dolma, which is what\nthe store is primarily known for. Coming in different\nsizes (small and large) and different add-on flavours\n(normal, spicy, curry and a house special) the Midye\nDolma doesn\u2019t disappoint. We ordered a large portion\nof stuffed mussels with each flavour, that was paired\nwith a complimentary lemon on the side to enhance\nthe flavours of the stuffed mussels. To start off, the\nMidye Dolma is eaten by opening the shell to reveal\nthe rice which is carefully stuffed into the meat of the\nmussel, and using the free shell to scoop the rice off\nthe other shell. Overall, the taste of the stuffed mussels\nwere very light and tasty due to the freshness and\nquality of the ingredients, and easy to eat (once you get\nthe hang of it!). Admittedly, the stuffed mussels were\nquiteaddicting-especiallyaswetrieddifferentflavours\nat hand. Each flavour gave the dish a nice and subtle\nkick, without hiding the natural taste of the mussels.\nBesides the add-on flavours, the mussels also don\u2019t pack\nan ocean punch either, perfect for those who aren\u2019t the\nbiggest fans of the oceany taste, but want to slowly try\ngetting into seafood.\nOut of all the flavours we tried, the most interesting\nwas definitely the curry sauce which is also uncommon\ninTurkey.Thecurryflavourwassurprisinglyverynicely\nintegrated, distinct yet not overpowering the taste of\nthe mussel, making it a joy to eat. The spicy mussels\nwere also very delicious, and for those who aren\u2019t a big\nfan of spicy food - you shouldn\u2019t be apprehensive to try\nit out as it was very easy to digest since the spice itself\nis quite mild.\nOur second meal was the Midye Burger, this unique\nbutcurrentlyverypopularrecipeisdefinitelysomething\nthat caught my eye - which is essentially mussels in the\nform of a burger patty topped with pickles, lettuce and\na slice of mild cheddar cheese, all housed in a lightly\ntoasted brioche burger bun. It also comes with a nice\nside of crisps and pickled vegetables. With your first\nbite into the burger, you are immediately welcomed\nwith a light creamy texture of the patty, along with the\nslighttasteofthemusselsalsobeingpresentbutnottoo\noverpowering.

But I digress; one aspect of the film\nthat definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint is the soundtrack.\nConsisting of 18 songs produced by Asian-focused\nrecord label and rap collective 88rising, the concept\nalbum demonstrates a fusion of Asian and American\nculture. The album features Asian- and AfricanAmerican artists, with numerous collaborative pieces\npresenting a wide range of music styles.

This is one of the many\nsongs on the album that touches on the traditional\nexpectation of Asian children to work hard, earn their\nkeep, and be able to provide for their families when\nthey grow older.\nThere are also tracks featuring Chinese, Japanese,\nand Korean lyrics. On \u2018Lazy Susan\u2019, named after\nthe rotating plate of glass in the centre of Chinese\nrestaurant tables, MaSiWei raps in Mandarin, as do\nAdawa and Shayiting EL on \u2018Baba Says\u2019.

This is the case for one\nof the film\u2019s characters as well\nas for many Asian families\nwho have spread out across\nthe world.\nThere is even a feature from\nShang-Chi himself: Simu\nLiu takes the mic on a simple, nostalgic piece fittingly\nnamed \u2018Hot Soup\u2019. There is a wistful tone, drawing\non the strong sense of family and collective pride that\nthreads through Asian societies, as some of the other\ntracks on the album do.\nThe final song, \u2018Warriors\u2019, by South Korean artist\nSeori and Indonesian rapper Warren Hue, wraps\nup the album with a bang - loud and fearless like the\npeople it describes. The influences of both Eastern and\nWestern music that permeate through all the ShangChi songs shine through in this particular piece.\nWhile the movie fails to fully illustrate the\nassimilation of Asian people and their culture into\nAmerican society, 88rising\u2019s soundtrack demonstrates\nit flawlessly, and we would recommend having a listen\nwhether you\u2019ve seen the movie or not.\n26 Music.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Rosie Millns &\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig -Arts Night by Arts\n& Entertainment @\nMETRIC, 19th November\nStop by METRIC\nto give a well-deserved listen to\nImperial\u2019s bands\n(including some\nof our own Felix\neditors).

    "content": "(ICU), who represent the student\nvoice, have chosen to support strikes on\nthe basis that \u201cstaff working conditions\nare student learning conditions\u201d, and\nthat supporting staff action for better\nworking conditions would better\nthe student experience. However,\nthis week, students are being asked\nto answer \u201cshould Imperial College\nUnion support the strike action due to\nbe carried out by the UCU during the\n2021/22 academic year?\u201d. This comes\nas a result of many questioning the\neffect that a strike may have on students\u2019\neducation, so soon after the return to\ncampus.\nOn 4th November, 55.9% of UCU\nmembers voted in the two-question\nreferendum, in which 71.7% agreed that\nthey \u201care prepared to take industrial\naction consisting of a strike\u201d, and 86.3%\nagreed that they \u201care prepared to take\nindustrial action short of a strike\u201d. 748\nof 8500 Imperial staff are part of the\nUCU. This is a little less than 9% of\nall staff. As of the referendum, 297 of\n8500, or just under 3.5% of staff, were\nprepared to take action consisting of a\nstrike.\nDespite the relatively small number\nof striking staff, this could translate to\nlonger waiting times on feedback and\nmarking even if the lecturers themselves\ndo not take industrial action, as non-striking staff may be covering for their\nstriking colleagues\u2019 tasks as well as their\nown workload.\nThe UCU strikes are part of a\nnationwide strike by university staff\ncalling on the USS to, among other\nthings, lower pension contribution\nrates. Universities such as Cambridge,\nEdinburgh and Bristol have voted\nto strike, alongside the London\nuniversities of Kings College London\nand London School of Economics. The\nUniversity of Manchester vote to strike\nwas not passed due to being one vote\nshort of the 50% threshold required for\nindustrial action.\nOn being asked why the Union\nwas choosing to hold an all-student\nreferendum this year, Lloyd James,\nUnion President stated that he\nwanted to \u201cseek the widest possible\nconsultation\u201d adding that democracy is\none of the Union values.\nVoting will take place on the Union\nwebsite, starting midday on the 24th\nof November and will close at midday\non the 26th of November. Results\nwill be released at 2pm on the 26th of\nNovember.\nFRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\nNEWS\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n5\nContinued from page 1\nUCU Strike\nSpiking boycott discourse continues\nFollowing the Union\u2019s response to\nthe demands made by the Gender\nEquality Officer (GEO) (see Felix\n1782), a further rebuttal has been\nreceived from the Gender Equality\nOfficer.\nIn response to the Union\u2019s comment\nthat \u2018Ask For Angela\u2019(AFA) posters\nhave been up in Union venues since\nbefore the suggestion of the boycott,\nthe GEO said that the boycott was to\nensure that similar messaging would\nbe continued year-round and wouldn\u2019t\nsimply be highlighted due to recent\nnews coverage. They also said that the\ncurrent posters \u201cfeed into the victim-blaming culture and relies on students\nhaving to stay alert and worried at all\ntimes in situations that are meant to be\nfun and relaxing\u201d.\nThe GEO added that the current\nsafe spaces at Union venues have failed,\nadding \u201ca member of women\u2019s football\nwas kicked out by security for being\n\u2018too drunk\u2019, while showing textbook\nsymptoms of spiking/serious alcohol\npoisoning\u201d.\nOn the positioning of the AFA\nposters, the GEO said \u201cit\u2019s pretty safe to\nassume that people who are not seated\nin the booth table have little idea about\nthe \u2018Ask for Angela\u2019\u201d, as the posters are\neither covered or only on walls next to\nbooths. They suggested that the posters\nbe placed at the bar as well.\nOn Good Night Out accreditation,\nthey said \u201cHappy the Union is looking\ninto Good Night Out, we prefer\nofficial accreditation, rather than the\nUnion claiming they meet all the\nrequirements\u201d.\nOn the demand for thorough\nbag searches and for the Union\nto have the security undergo\nconsent and anti-sexual harassment\ntraining, the GEO said \u201cWe want to\nbring the Union\u2019s attention to the fact\nthat multiple student IDs and bags\nwere not checked and searched upon\nthe entrance to the last ACC. Thus,\nmultiple people who have not bought a\nticket and might as well have been non-students took part in ACC. We also\nwant to bring attention to the incidents\nof security making comments about\na female student while searching her\nbag, saying she \u201chas a pretty face\u201d and\nasking where she is from\u201d.\nOn the demand for consent training\nfor CSP members, they said \u201cThe\nCSP consent training meeting with\nDeputy President of Welfare, Deputy\nPresident Clubs and Societies and\nUnion employees took place on the\n22.10.21. During this meeting the plans\nwere made to roll out the most basic\ntraining ASAP (within 2 weeks). It\u2019s 8th\nof November and no consent training\nin sight\u201d.\nThe Deputy President (Welfare)\nhas set up a town hall meeting for the\nsignatories of the boycott to discuss the\ntopic and outline further the actions\ntaken by the Union so far, and what will\ncontinue to be done in the future.\nThe Town Hall took place on the\n18th of November, where it was heard\nthat a security review will be starting\nwithin the next week and that changing\nthe current security company will be\na longer-term process through the\nsecurity review. This review will be led\nby the Deputy President (Welfare)\nand the Deputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties).\nThe idea of having student welfare\nwardens was promoted - these would be\npaid student volunteers with consent\nand welfare training. Such training\ncannot be provided to the externally\nsourced security staff, it was heard.\nThe idea behind this is to ensure\nthat security are the \u201clast point of\ncontact, and not the first\u201d, in response\nto feedback that security staff made\nstudents feel unsafe. This move is\nbeing justified by the reasoning that\nstudents are better placed than security\nprofessionals to be sensitive to students\nin a vulnerable position.\nOn current tasks being undertaken,\nthe Deputy President (Welfare) has had\nthe AFA posters reprinted to include a\nbyline reminder that drink spiking is a\nserious crime that can be punished by\nup to 10 years in prison, while consent\ntraining for CSPs is ongoing and to be\ncompleted by January.\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\n\n"

    "content": "with their strong personalities.\nFirst, we get a taste of the original paragon of royal-ty, Catherine of Aragon, played by the amazing Jarneia\nRichard-Nioel. Beyond impeccable vocals and a confidence which embodies the character, Richard-Nioel\u2019s\ntechnique of portraying humour or anger just by the\nway she scowled at the audience is truly the cherry on\ntop.\nNext, one of the more famous queens, both historically and in the Six universe: Anne Boleyn. Millie\nO\u2019Connell originated the role in a rather iconic way,\ngaining swathes of fans. However Cherelle Jay, the alternate during this performance, brought her unique\nquirks to the role. Jay\u2019s reinvention of the portrayal was\nvery refreshing with her more subtle ways of transmitting Boleyn\u2019s punchy and bitchy persona working fab-ulously; and in some ways this made the Tudor queen\nseem more nuanced than ever.\nThe costumes in Six, funky and modern, are all an\nintegral part of the spectacle. Jay\u2019s costume was however not the usual green Boleyn skirt, which was a bit of a\ndisappointment, but this is likely to go unnoticed and\nunmissed by most the audience.\nJane Seymour, played by understudy and dance captain Collete Guitart, took to the stage next. Her per-formancehitalltherightnotessingingaboutnotbeing\nable to spend more time with her son. This was the first\nballad in what was up to this point a highly energetic\nshow. This variation in musical styles is definitely one\nthat Six leverages to its advantage.\nThe next queen to show up is Catherine Howard\n(played by Sophie Isaacs). The characterisation of the\nqueen and musical style is allegedly based off of Britney Spears, and Isaacs voice lends itself perfectly to\nthe cute schoolgirl tones. The song is quite dark as it\ntells of men taking advantage of her from a very very\nyoung age. Isaacs does a good job at portraying a sense\nof vulnerability and sadness while still keeping things\nrelatively fun.\nThe queen who has the least to complain is next:\nAnne of Cleeves. Alexia McIntos is an expert at portraying the fun, opulent energy of this German queen.\nIn the song \u201cHouse of Holbein\u201d the band transports\nthe audience to a sort of Berlin techno club. But here\nfor once, the energy level of the queens doesn\u2019t quite\nseem to match the tempo of the song.\nFinally, the queen who survived, Catherine Parr was\nplayed by alternate: Hana Stewart. The characterization of Parr in the musical is probably the least com-pelling, but Stewart (and every other Catherine Parr I\nhave seen) makes up for it with impeccable vocals. The\nstory of the queen who survives could be given a few\nmore twists and turns or at the very least some je ne\nsais quoi.\nI would say some of the explanations about the context of the competition they are competing in was a bit\nsuperfluous and as things wrap up at the end, the constant explanations of the moral behind the show were a\nbit tiring. However, this musical is the perfect example\nof how smaller productions with a unique story, powerful songs and strong characters don\u2019t need to rely on\nbig sets or complicate dance numbers. Just a woman, or\nsix of them and a microphone can take over the world.\nUnnerving, deep and wonderfully poetic, this adaptation directed by Katie Mitchell manages to\nperform a seemingly unmanageable task \u2014 to depict\nthe complex internal monologue of a woman suffering\nfrom trauma and depression on stage.\nThe set arrangement is unlike anything I have ever\nseen before; there are four actors \u2013 Mor\u00f3nk\u1eb9 Akin\u1ecdl\u00e1,\nEleanor Henderson, Eve Ponsonby and Ragevan Vasan\n\u2013 each in black clothing that blends with the darkness\nof the setup, with nothing other than a beam of light\nilluminating their faces. Throughout the production,\nthe voices of these actors blend with one another in a\nmelodic flow, beautifully replicating the incessant chatter in the skull of a troubled individual.\nThe voices of the actors guide the audience through\na deceptively ordinary Friday in the life of an assistant,\nstuck at the bottom of the corporate hierarchy. She\nwakes up hungover, incapable of sorting out the mess\nin her kitchen, rushes to work via the London over-ground, waits for a WhatsApp message from her significant other \u2013 a mundane morning by all accounts.\nHowever, every single task is accompanied by bursts of\nher trauma bubbling up to the surface, distorting this\nmundane present with the darkness of her past. We\nhear her anxiety around the awkward greeting with\nher co-workers, her rush to get to lunch, and then to\nthe end of the day. The boring tasks of her work are interwoven with deep anxiety about her life choices. She\nquestions why she works at a job she hates, whether she\nwill ever become a successful writer; these questions really bring her character to life and portray her as a deep\nand complex human.\nAs she progresses through the day, a multitude of\nfragments from her trauma are revealed. These fragments are crisply underpinned by sound effects \u2014 the\nscratchingofhernailsagainstherskinassheself-harms,\nthe monotonous hole-punching she must do as part\nof her dreadful job. It is impossible not to get deeply\nemotionally involved when the penetrating dullness of\nthese sounds is set against the chorus of voices bringing\nup and pushing down the trauma.\nThis adaptation is not suitable for those triggered\nby rape, sexual assault, or self-harm. Furthermore, it is\ndefinitely unsuitable for those looking to leave the theatre smiling and at peace. However, if you would like to\ngo on a disturbing, yet poetically captivating, journey\nthrough the mind of a fellow human being, to see the\nworld through the eyes of someone whose worldview\nhas been shattered by trauma \u2014 this adaptation is a\nmust-see.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nARTS\nCredits: Photo/Robert Day\nEve Ponsonby, Eleanor Henderson, Moronic Akinola and Ragevan Vasan in Little Scratch (L-R)\nIn a woman\u2019s troubled mind\nReviewed by Sofia Elizarova Arts Writer\nLittle Scratch\nWhere?

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n28\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nUp until I moved to the United Kingdom last year,\nYorkshire was nothing more than a dog breed for me.\nI got to learn a bit about it via sharing a flat with two\nLoiner blokes (one of them is probably saying that he\nis actually from Huddersfield as he reads this \u2014 but we\nall know you live in Scholes, Arnav), and \u201crespectfully\ncourting\u201d a Sheffielder (her words). She dragged me to\nThe 100 Club on the Friday before Halloween to see\nthe peculiarly named Everly Pregnant Brothers (EPB),\na ukulele parody project. I know does not seem great,\nbut please bear with me and keep reading.\nTo kick off the show, Geordie comedian John\nFothergill decided to go on stage and share a little\ntoo much information about his sex life, lightening\nup the mood of the crowd composed mostly of\nGeneration Jones individuals. I do think I was the\nyoungest attendee that night, but he did manage to\nsnatch a couple of giggles from me. The band came in\nequipped with Richard Bailey and Klive Humberstone\non the ukuleles, Pete McKee on the double bass, his\nson Charley on the electric guitar and Nick Banks\n(who you might know from Pulp) on a small drumset.\nTheir first song was a parody of David Bowie\u2019s \u2018Ziggy\nStardust\u2019 about a certain man called Reggie, followed\nby the melodic \u2018Fat Twat\u2019, getting all fans to sing along\nto the diss track. After the kazoo-infused \u2018Pork Pie\u2019\nand \u2018Prescription Drugs\u2019, frontman Shaun Doane,\naccurately also known as Big Shaun, picked up the\nmicrophone from the stand and asked: \u201cAre there\nany virgins here tonight?\u201d. A courageous front-rower\nraised her hand and navigated to the centre of the\nstage. Doane turned around and grabbed a bottle that\nsat on top of the central speaker. It was Henderson\u2019s\nRelish, or Hendo\u2019s, for close friends. He put some of\nit on his palm and reached for the virgin\u2019s forehead. A\nqueue of pure, innocent souls then formed, and they\nwere baptised one by one as the vocalist murmured a\nsequence of holy words.\nEPB proceeded with another Bowie parody, \u201869\nto Rovvrum\u2019 which described the grey commute of a\nSheffielder that must take the (actually existing) bus\nline 69 to Rotherham. Funnily enough, it was the\ncalmest song in the set, as Doane vividly reenacted his\nemotions during the tenebrous drive.\nAnother noteworthy moment was the rendition of\n\u2018Dunt Tha Want Mi\u2019, where a fan, Sarah, came on stage\nfor the band\u2019s twist on the classic duet originally sung\nby the Human League, fellow Sheffield countrymen.\nThe crowd favourite \u2018Stuck in the Lidl with You\u2019, which\nwas performed shortly after, as well as the regionally\nviral \u2018Chip Pan\u2019. Assembling close to a million streams\nacross all platforms, it turns Kings of Leon\u2019s most\nfamous song into a short story about leaving Imperial\u2019s\nside dish of choice on the hob for too long.\nI must also mention the couple of occasions where\nBig Shaun just spoke to the crowd, as a short break\nbetween songs. Whether it was to talk about the ups\nand downs (but mostly ups!) of his mental health,\nhis moral dilemma on whether we should all turn\nto veganism, or to express how much he dislikes the\nConservative Party, it was possible to have a true peek\ninto his personality, as there was no layer of comedy\nduring those monologues.\nThe set approached the finish line with parodies\nof songs by widely-known groups, such as U2 and\nColdplay, with Bob Marley and the Wailers to close it.\n\u2018NoOvenNoPie\u2019wastragicomicandeasytosingalong\nto, but did leave us wanting more. EFB sounds much\nbetter in person than recorded \u2013 the instrumentals are\nmuch more captivating, and Big Shaun\u2019s radiant talent\nis under the spotlight.

The hundreds of voices singing in\nunison to a song that embodies an after-midnight and\nlonesome state of mind was an experience difficult to\nput to words.\nIn the late hours, I gradually retreated to the\noutside edge of the crowd where I stayed for a last\nperformance before having to leave. Entirely different\nto the steaminess of the front crowd, it was a relieving\nsensation to finally have some cold air and personal\nspace. Anderson invited Nadine Shah back on stage\nfor the slow classic \u2018The Wild Ones\u2019. With just an\nacoustic guitar, the delicate brokenness of his voice\ncontrasted but paired beautifully with Shah\u2019s deepness\nand magnetism.\nMy night came to an end with the bus ride down the\nhill of the venue, where I struck up a brief conversation\nwith an older fan who travelled to London specifically\nfor Suede. He expressed nostalgia for some of their\nolder songs which were not performed that night, and\nat that moment I wished time could stop and the band\ncould play forever.\nSET LIST\nReggie Sprayed Me Car\nFat Twat\nPork Pie\nPrescription Drugs\n69 to Rovvrum\nSwords\nHooverin\u2019 Up\nRovvrum\nTake Me to the Limit\nDunt Tha Want Mi\nNeets\nStuck in the Lidl with You\nTesco Express\nChip Pan\nOyl Int Road\nHammers\nVegan\nHendo\u2019s\nRammel Drawer\nNo Oven No Pie\nSuede (photo: Yunke Zhou)\nEPB (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\nEPB (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n38\nCOMMENT\nWhen I was in a summer camp\nmany years ago, a guy called\nMichelle entered my room at midnight,\nsat down on the corner of my bed and\nstarted crying. His sobs woke me up.\nI asked him politely, half-asleep what\nthe problem was. After some seconds in\ncomplete silence, he could just articulate these words: \u201cI...feel...empty.\u201d. I did\nnot understand the meaning behind\nthose words and did not know how to\nhelp him. My worries toward him were\nincreasing and in the end, I decided to\ncall an older camp member who took\nMichelle out of my room. Once he\nclosed my door, I did not know what\nhappened afterwards. Years later, with a\nbetter understanding of human psychology and more maturity, I could finally\ncomprehend his words...he felt lonely.\nAnd that was paradoxical because Michelle was one of the most extroverted\npeople I have ever met in my life. He\nwas always surrounded by people, loved\nmaking jokes and laughing. You would\nthink many things about him but never\nwould you come up with loneliness.\nBeing alone and lonely sound similar\nbut are totally two different worlds. The\nfirst is a physical state, while the second\nis a mental one. You can be alone and\nnot feel lonely! Besides, loneliness is involuntary and involves depression, iso-lation, low self-esteem, and the feeling\nof being unloved, among many others.\nBeing alone can also be involuntary, but\nthe reality is that many people seek to\nbe alone because we live in a stressful\nand cramped world. Being alone voluntary is called solitude and it is a great\nway to obtain peace and to work on\nyour personal projects. Solitude, in my\nopinion, is key to living a fulfilling life\nbecause it provides you with in-depth\nknowledge and self-awareness. It makes\nyou an interesting person, with enough\nemotional independence to enjoy your\nown company and\ntherefore, less probable to be prejudiced\nby your social circumstances because\nthere are moments\nof our lives in which\nwe are unavoidably\nalone. On the other\nhand, loneliness is\npainful and involun-tary, it will chase you\nand put you down\nin every task you do.\nLoneliness is a synonym of emotional\nvulnerability and pessimism. When\nthings are running smoothly, you do\nnot enjoy it. Furthermore, if you fail,\nyou punish yourself even harder. Lonely\npeople want to think about, or do\nthings, that can reminder themselves\neven more that they are lonely; wallowing in their own suffering.\nNowadays, the negative effects of\nsmoking such as cancer or heart diseases\nare well known even by smokers. Nonetheless, in the past, the situation was\ncompletely different, smoking inside\nhospitals and schools was something\nnormal. Cigarettes were considered\nharmless, and some doctors even recommended them to their patients. Only after several investigations, we realized the\ndangers of smoking, start restricting it\nandhelpedsmokerstogetridofthatbad\nhabit. Likewise, loneliness was underrated until yesterday because lonely people were usually associated with serious\nmental diseases or social incompetency.\nHowever, currently, we know that loneliness can assault the life of any one of\nus here present. In fact, roughly 40% of\nuniversity students undergo this mental\nstate. I am going to explain why in more\ndepth later. Therefore, loneliness can be\nas deadly as smoking, if not more. We\ntend to underestimate the importance of\nmental health and think that our mind\nis separated from our\nbodies.\nLoneliness is not\nsomething to make\njokes about, it can alter the brain structures\nand hormonal system,\nderiving in dire diseases such as depression or\nAlzheimer\u2019s. Surprisingly, people who suffer\nloneliness have got 50%\nmore chance of dying\nprematurely! Moreover,\nlonely people tend to hide their pain\nand do not ask for external help because\nthey are embarrassed to admit they feel\nlonely, which aggravates, even more,\ntheir already decadent situation. Smoking is a much easier problem to deal\nwith because there are more resources\navailable such as nicotine patches or social groups to stop smoking, compared\nto help available to tackle loneliness. A\nsmoker can be held accountable, because they can see clearly whether he is\nabandoning his smoking habit or not.\nBut a lonely person cannot as loneliness\nis abstract, non-measurable. In addition,\na smoker can consume 15 cigarettes per\nday, destroying his health but he could\nstill be happy with his life; a lonely person could never be happy.\nStudies show that more and more\npeople are feeling lonely than in the\npast. How can this be possible when\nwe have got social media and live in the\nmost connected time in human history?\nBecause hyperconnectivity just increases the number of connections, but not\nthe quality of them. Most of our friends\non social media have got little or no ex-Loneliness can be deadly.\nBetween Smoking a Cigarette per\nDay and Loneliness, Choose the\nFirst One Without Doubt\nWangGuo\nWriter\n...LONELINESS\nCAN BE AS\nDEADLY AS\nSMOKING, IF\nNOT MORE.\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Lukas Rychvalsky on Unsplash\nSolitude can be helpful but it should not be confused with loneliness.\n\n"

So are there many Chinese\nstudents on campus?\u201d. After I answered,\n\u201cYes there\u2019re some\u201d, she appreciated the\nabundance of Chinese food as well as\nthe number of Chinese students, and\nencouraged me to make as many Chinese friends as possible to not become\nlonely, a \u2018considerate\u2019 narrative I invariably attempt to escape from.\nAsaChinesewhowasbornandraised\ninWuhanforover20years,I\u2013likemany\nof my compatriots - was nervous about\nmoving to a remote and unfamiliar western country. I felt inclined to make more\ninteractions with international students\nfrom mainland China, chose a flat\nwhere large numbers of Chinese would\nstay, joined all of the overseas WeChat\ngroups I could find, searched travel and\nCovid-19 restriction tips in the Xiaohongshu app (China\u2019s Instagram equiva-lent). It was only when I was able to double check everything with my Chinese\nfriends that I felt at ease.\nHowever, many people from other\ncountries who speak English as a foreign\nlanguage seem to prefer living with flat-mates of various ethnicities from a range\nof countries - and tend to adapt well to\ntheir new surroundings. This made me\nponder why there is a tendency for Chinese people to tacitly form a united and\nexclusive community of only Chinese,\nand if there is anything wrong with always drowning in a Chinese-only community in a Western country.\nThis phenomenon can be carelessly\ndescribed as a stereotype for Chinese\ngroups \u2013 is it because Chinese people\nare afraid of speaking out? Is it because\nChinese people are introverted? Or\nis it because Chinese culture is simply\nincompatible with that of its Western\ncounterparts?\nNo. I don\u2019t think these are valid explanations for a complex Chinese community nor it should be regarded as normal.\n\u2018Stereotype\u2019, is already a cliche narrative\nthat can effortlessly evade the essence of\nthe issue. Quantities of stereotypes can\nbe seen over conversations, TV shows,\nfilms, and novels, etc. and further self-re-inforced in Chinese people. Generations\nhave been explaining and resisting ste-reotypes, but what if this time, we could\nescape out of this \u201cstereotype\u201d trap and\nreflect on the authentic reasons behind\nit?\nFirst and foremost, there is an indisputable correlation between the establishment of intimate Chinese communities abroad and language barriers.\nSometimes, my foreign friends would\nbe curious and ask, \u201chow did you get to\nbe fluent in English given that you grew\nup in China for years?\u201d. I was surprised\nby this question initially, as I know I am\nnot the most proficient English speaker\namong Chinese people who have a similar background to me, and I also wonder\nif they ask the same question to European-looking people who speak English as\na foreign language.\nNumerous Chinese people in Europe\nare both fluent in English and eager to\ndiscover more about their new communities through conversation. But\nsometimes their failure to speak natural\nEnglishresultsinbeingviewedinanodd\nlight, which only leads to a further loss\nof confidence about fully integrating\ninto their new environments. A friend\ntold me his imperfect English makes it\nharder to maintain close relationship\nwithforeigners-hewasnotboldenough\nto bother one after the other to explain\nevery word he did not understand in a\nconversation.Itwaseasierforhimtoend\nup not bothering English speakers and\nto fall back on socialising with Chinese\ncompatriots.\nDifferences in cultures and political\nsystems between China and other coun-tries, in some cases, are reasons for such\nsolidarityinChinesegroups,butwecan-not overlook how the overriding factors\nof trying to be a model minority and the\ninability to cope with the awkwardness\nof language barriers in social settings result in the seemingly Chinese penchant\nfor huddling together.\nLike my mom\u2019s perceptions in the be-ginning, ethnic and national networks\nmorph into unconscious safe zones and\ninevitably become a key impediment to\nparticipating in a diverse culture. I feel\nthe sentiments of many Chinese people\nwho strive to break out of their ethnic\ncommunities but are stuck in the natural\nChinese huddle. Presumably, these are\nhidden feelings that few people would\nexpress directly but are so critical that\nthey cannot be dismissed with a flippant\n\u201cit\u2019s just a stereotype\u201d.\nNot just the Chinese community, but\nmany other minorities in the UK might\nshare the same feeling whilst reasons of\nthis struggling have been barely told.\nI remind myself that such split feelings should never be ignored, and the\nidentity dilemmas should be visible in\nan explainable way. If all of us, no matter where we are from, can confront\nthe structural reasons behind the \u2018stereotype\u2019 of each homogenous group,\nthen enough of us may be able to break\nthrough the shackles of identity politics;\nsimply to treat each other with more understanding from a human perspective,\nand not to use any preconceptions to define any ethnic group anymore.\nA discussion on the reasons behind why some international students tend to stick within their\nethnic or national groups.\nMy Thoughts on the Spontaneous Community of Compatriots and Why Reasons\nbehind its Formation Cannot be Ignored\nWanqingChen\nCommentWriter\nis not easy, but I\u2019d hope an Imperial degree would equip us with a least some research skills).

    "content": "Comment writer Runtian Wu shares his thoughts on the pursuit of pleasure.\nRecently, the US has come up with a\nnovel idea to tackle the worsening\ndrug addiction crisis \u2014the so-called\n\u201charm-reduction policy\u201d, which basically gives drug addicts weakened drugs to\nhelp avoid diseases such as HIV spreading and potentially reduce their intake\nof drugs. Plausible as it may sound, the\npolicy reflects a messy world that people\noften overlook. Situations in other\ncountries are no better. Spain\u2019s parliament is debating legalising drugs for\nrecreational use, and, merely two weeks\nago, Luxemburg followed Canada\u2019s\nfootsteps to legalise certain drugs. Even\nin the UK, there are growing voices that\nadvocate for the commercial potential\nof drugs.\nThere is something that can give\npeople enormous pleasure that is\notherwise hard to gain. This \u201cnatural\npleasure\u201d is produced when our nervous\nsystem perceives happy things such as\naccomplishments and releases \u201chappy\nhormones\u201d like dopamine. However,\nthe so-called \u201cquick pleasure\u201d is attained by having drug molecules imitate\nneurotransmitters such as dopamine\nand bind to the receptors to generate\npleasure, which may eventually cause\nthe degeneration of the receptors and\ncerebral atrophy. Despite the dangers\nof fatal organ failure, loss of conscious-ness, and poverty, people pursue drugs\nfor sound reasons\u2014as some may argue\nthe individual\u2019s divine right of \u201cLife,\nLiberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u201d\nshown in the United States Declaration\nof Independence. However, the \u201chappiness\u201d brought by drugs is fundamentally\ndifferent from the happiness defined by\nthe Declaration. This kind of \u201chappiness\u201d, which I would call \u201cundeserved\npleasure\u201d, gives temporary relief from\nreality with harmful outcomes and is\nattained by somehow \u201ccheating the\nbrain\u201d. This kind of \u201chappiness\u201d comes\nwith consequences.\nNot many people nowadays are\ndeeply aware of how mass destruction\ncan be caused by drugs. Back in the\n18th Century, to reverse the Chinese\ntrade surplus, the East India Company\nfound an ingenious solution\u2014to sell\nopium and smuggle it into China. Not\nonly did this plan successfully bring the\nBritish Empire millions of tons of silver\nat the minor cost of growing opium, but\nit seriously impoverished the Chinese\npopulation and directly led to the\nbankruptcy of the society. Thousands\nof people, be they plebeians or nobles,\nsquandered all their money, energy, and\ntime on drugs. As a poem in the 18th\nCentury goes,\nThe smoke pipe is a blunderbuss\nInflict upon yourself and\ninjure yourself\nHow many heroes, however\npowerful or wise,\nAre forever trapped in the\ngrave of drugs\n(Translated by the author\nfrom the 18th Century Chinese\ndoggerel)\nSarcastically, drugs, which were\npreviously deemed by imperialists as\nweapons to paralyse a nation, are now\napproved by governments to satisfy\n\u201chuman\u2019s nature\u201d. Drug abuse is becoming such a trend that even in places\naround our college, there come reports\nof various kinds of spiking that highly\nalarm the officials.\nHowever, it may be easier for people\nto refuse physical drugs than \u201cmental drugs\u201d. Compared with those we\nhappily played on Nokia phones, such\nas Gluttonous Snake, digital games\nnowadays often require huge time and\neven financial commitment. The Sims,\nfor example, often causes players to\ndevote days or even months to immerse\nthemselves in the \u201cdigital reality\u201d and\nlive a life that is not true. And even light\ngames such as Angry Birds 2 appeal\nto those who devote a great amount\nof time in exchange for some \u201cvirtual\nmoney\u201d.\nFortunately, unlike drugs such as\nopium that will have you both mentally\nand physically addicted, whether you\u2019re\naddicted to digital games (or not in\nmost cases) depends on yourself. Not\nall digital games are \u201cmental drugs\u201d, and\neven games like The Sims may not be\nif you take control. It should be fine to\nplay some games for entertainment, but\ndo not let them dictate your life.\nInstead, the main pleasure we should\nlook for is \u201cdeserved pleasure\u201d, which\nI define as the pleasure that can bring\nbenefits to yourself or those around\nyou as you try to achieve it. There are so\nmany examples to say. Reading a book,\nwatching a meaningful movie with\nfriends and families, and going mountain climbing are all worthwhile things\nto spend time on.\nBut there is even a deeper question to\nthink about: should we regard our life\nas merely a process to pursue pleasure?\nIn other words, should we choose to\nsuffer? Last week, there was an article\nnamed Why We Choose to Suffer in the\nWall Street Journal, in which the author\ncited a piece of research in 2019 that\nfound some interesting correlations.\nJust as it said, \u201cIn a study published in\nthe Journal of Positive Psychology in\n2019, Sean C. Murphy and Brock Bastian asked people to think back on their\nmost significant experiences, to describe\neach one in a paragraph and to rank\nthem for how meaningful they were.\nParticipants were also asked to indicate\nthe extent to which the experiences\nwere pleasurable or painful. It turned\nout that the most meaningful events\ntended to be on the extremes\u2014those\nthat were very pleasant or very painful.\nThese are the ones that matter, that\nleave a mark.\u201d There are people around\nus that choose to study hard not for\npleasure, and there are people around us\nthat hope to be a soldier and go to wars\nnot for pleasure.\nPerhaps in reality, what we are really\nseeking in the long term is not pleasure\nbut a meaningful life.\nDon\u2019t Let Undeserved Pleasure\nDictate Your Life\nRuntianWu\nCommentWriter\nFRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\n35\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Want to read online?\nfelixonline.co.uk/section/comment\nAccess old and current content on:\nPhoto credits: Lilartsy on Pexels\nDrug use is used a quick route to pleasure.\n\n"

The trio haven\u2019t released any new songs since\ntheir debut EP Toner, released a year ago this week,\nand in that time I have seen them play the same songs\nand setlist more times than I can count in b one hand.\nIn fact, it is a testament to PVA that crowds don\u2019t get\nbored after seeing the exact same songs in the exact\nsame orders time after time, a formula that has only\never worked for Slug. Coming to the gig sober and\nsleepy, I was worried that this gig would be the day.\nIn fact, maybe it would have been if the band didn\u2019t\nmix up the way they performed the songs. The synths\nsounded ever so slightly different to normal, the vocals\nmore intense. A more polished\nversion of PVA graced the larger\nstage.\nI missed the first few songs of\ntheir set, and really they were the\nonly band I had wanted to see at\nPitchfork Festival. The age-old\nadage of \u2018never judge a book by\nits cover\u2019 rings true, with me not\nlistening to the headliner, Anna\nMeredith, in advance as I wrongly\nassumed she would be a Julien\nBaker-esque sad-folk singer. Oh\nboy, was I wrong.\nAnna Meredith is the most refreshing act I have\nseen live since The Comet is Coming, a complement\nI do not give lightly. I came from the bar to the stage\nmidway through her first song, expecting to see a lone\nfemale perched on a stool, crooning into a microphone\nwhilst strumming on an acoustic guitar, a single\nspotlight focused on her on a dark stage. What I saw\ninstead was an ensemble of instruments I had never\nseen played together before - a drummer, a guitarist,\nAnna Meredith on keys, electronics, percussion, and\nclarinet, a celloist, and a goddamn tuba.\nThe energy of the set surpassed PVA, who are one\nof the most energetic bands I have ever seen live. The\ngenres of the performed songs were eclectic, ranging\nfrom vocal-focused songs not dissimilar from Stella\nDonnelly, to fairground-esque music, to chaos-fuelled 8-bit video game music, to heavy synth-driven\nelectronic art-pop.\nMeredith made awkward quips between songs,\nstretching out an eventually overdone joke about\nbuying merchandise before discussing and introducing\neach song, in a tone that was reminiscent of a music\nteacher introducing acts at a secondary-school concert.\nMeredith\u2019scharismaticpersonalityandclumsyScottish\ncharm saved these interludes of conversation from\nbecoming jarring, even reminding me of magnetic\nradio DJs Mary Anne Hobbs and Annie Mac.\nThe band barely had a chance to put down their\ninstruments before the crowd erupted into cheers\nfor an encore, leading to the band to return with an\nexplosive rendition of Prince\u2019s \u2018Nothing Compares 2\nU\u2019, which segued straight into the chorus of \u2018Purple\nRain\u2019 as purple confetti fell from Fabric ceilings. The\nperformance truly redefined the phrase genre-defying\nand was perhaps one of the most innovative live sets I\nhave ever seen. Having listened to Meredith\u2019s recorded\nmusic since, I am disappointed to say it doesn\u2019t live\nup to the energy of her live sets. Go see her with zero\nexpectations of what you are about to experience. I\npromise it will be one of the best gigs of your life.\n\u2026something borrowed, something blue\ndeathcrash and Iceage at MOTH\nClub, 12th November\nWhen Pitchfork festival tickets\nwere released, I had the difficult\nchoice between buying tickets\nto see black midi at Southbank\nCentre, or Danish punk band\nIceage at MOTH Club. At this\ntime, I had only heard the song\n\u2018Painkiller\u2019 by Iceage, featuring\nSky Ferreira, however my friend\ninsisted it would be a gig I would\nregret missing. Based on heresay,\nmy enjoyment of the single, and\nmy love for MOTH Club, I tentatively spent \u00a324 on\na ticket and promised myself I would listen to some of\ntheir songs by the time November came around.\nNovember came around, and of course I still hadn\u2019t\nlistened to any other Iceage songs. The afternoon of the\ngig I sat on my couch with a friend who had travelled to\nLondon from Manchester just to see Iceage, wavering\nbetween skipping the gig or not. In the end, my friend\u2019s\ncommitment, the fact this was the only sold-out gig of\nthe entirety of Pitchfork Festival\u2019s London run, and\nthe \u00a324 I had spent convinced me to go.\n(Before continuing, I know it is maybe weird to\nreview a headliner before a support act, but please bear\nwith me for the sake of the order of the rhyme in the\ntitle.)\nI didn\u2019t regret going. Iceage weren\u2019t bad, per se, but\nI can\u2019t say I was blown away by their performance.\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have expected a slick and polished\nperformance from a punk band, but with 5 albums\nunder their belt from the last ten years, I expected\nthe performance to be more engaging. The lead singer\nseemed straight out of a generic Camden landfill indie-band, looking like Faris Badwan from The Horrors if\nyou ordered him from wish.com. The set sounded like\na school-band\u2019s YouTube cover of The Cribs. It really\nis astounding how far you can get as a tone-deaf singer\nbased on just looking the type. By the end of the night,\nmy ears were ringing, not from the volume (in fact the\nsound at MOTH Club is nearly always the perfect\nlevel), but from the tuneless and monotonous yells of\nthe lead-singer.\nThe silver lining of the evening was that I discovered\nmy new favourite sad-hours band. The support act,\ndeathcrash, were an act I had never heard before. The\nLondon-based post-rock band played their 45-minute\nset without even pausing between songs. I won\u2019t\nlie, their music hurt. Despite being nearly entirely\ninstrumental, their set gave me the deep-stomach sad\nfeeling that reminded me of listening to \u2018The Summer\nEnds\u2019 by American Football. Featuring lofi, math-rock\nsounds alongside early Car Seat Headrest-inspired\nvocals, or Public Service Broadcasting-sounding\nsamples, their music will leave you lying there feeling\nnumb. The best way I can describe deathcrash\u2019s vibe is\nas the soundtrack to that scene in Twilight New Moon\nin which Bella stares out of her window for months\nwhilst waiting for Edward to return.\nI think Pitchfork Festival was worth the \u00a350 I spent\non tickets to discover two new acts I probably never\nwould have listened to otherwise. That\u2019s the beauty of\nmusic festivals. There are so many fresh acts playing\nLondon all the time, and if you push yourself to go and\nsee them, you might discover your next favourite band.\n\u201c\nANNA MEREDITH\nIS THE MOST\nREFRESHING ACT\nI HAVE SEEN LIVE\nSINCE THE COMET\nIS COMING\nLondon\u2019s 1st ever Pitchfork Festival introduced me to an old favourite and three new acts\nPVA (photo: Rosie Millns)\nIceage (photo: Rosie Millns)\n\n"

Depending on what stage of your career you\nare in, this may or may not be welcome news. I started\nin the biochemistry department in 1999 and haven\u2019t\never really left (bar moving campuses occasionally). In\nthat time, I have got my PhD,\nbeen appointed as a lecturer,\nthen promoted to reader and\npublished over 60 scientific\npapers. I\u2019ve also become an adult\naccording to my students - I got\nmarried, had 2 children, and\nbought a house. More recently,\nI wrote a book - Infectious:\nPathogens and How We Fight\nThem-whichisthemainreason\nI have returned to the pages of\nFelix.\nWriting my book Infectious\nand my experience of studying,\nthen working at Imperial College are intertwined. The core\nmessage at the heart of the book is that innovation, underpinned by scientific research, has led to enormous\nbreakthroughs in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The driving force for this innovation\nare the women and men who have worked in all the different \u2018ologies \u2013 immunologists, virologists, vaccinolo-gists, epidemiologists, microbiologists, with help from\nengineers, computer scientists and economists. At\nImperial, I have been fortunate enough to work with\nexpert researchers, leading the way in our fight against\npathogens. I have also, in my time at the college, made\na tiny contribution to the training of the next generation of scientists. The framework of my book is built\non the lectures that I give to undergraduate medics and\npostgraduate immunologist and virologists. So, it is\npossible that you may recognise some of the dad jokes\nin there if you have been taught by me, and now have\nthe opportunity to not laugh at them a second time\naround.\nSo, what is the book about? It is a celebration of\nhow far we have come in our fight against pathogens.\nThe first half of the book deals with the science behind\ninfectious diseases: it is quite wide-ranging, from microbiology to diagnostics - so hopefully there is some-thingforeveryoneinthere.Iattempttoexplainthedif-ferent fields and identify some of the historical figures\ninvolved, both famous and infamous. The second half\nexamines the extraordinary\nprogress made in preventing\nand treating infectious diseases.\nAs a researcher working on im-munisation, there is quite a significant skew towards vaccines,\nbut there are also antibiotics,\nanti-virals, and even a section\non fungi for the true ID con-noisseur.\nImportantly, this isn\u2019t just\na COVID-19 book, although\nit is definitely shaped by the\npandemic because I wrote it in\n2020. The trigger for writing\nInfectious came when my lab on\nSt. Mary\u2019s campus was closed\ndue to the lockdown. I wrote in various places - different rooms around my house, trying to hide from my\nchildren and the need to home school them - and at\nvarious times - in between staring into the wall of ini-tialsonteams,wonderingifanyonewasattheotherend\nof my online lectures. All in all, writing it was a great\nexperience and\none of my career\nhighlights so far.\nBefore I started at Imperial\n- so long ago\nin the mists of\ntime that there\nwasn\u2019t even the\ninternet - I read\na popular scientific book about\nimmunolog y.\nThat book, in\npart, led me to\nwho I am today; a researcher working on the immune\nsystem. One of my great hopes in writing Infectious\nis to inspire the next generation, even if it is only one\nperson. That person could be you, so why not give it a\nread?

    "content": "On Friday 29th October, 2021,\n18-year-old Greta Thunberg\nvisited the Natural History Museum\u2019s\n\u2018OurBrokenPlanet\u2019exhibitionandhada\nlook at the recently identified beetle that\nhas been named \u2018Nelloptodes gretae\u2019 in\nher honour. As part of her visit, she also\nparticipated in a 15-minute interview\nwith BBC presenter Andrew Marr,\nwho asked her a number of questions\nspanning COP26, climate activism,\nand her thoughts on the actions of\npolitical leaders, among other topics.\nThis interview is interesting in\nthat it paints a very different picture\nof Thunberg, who is known for her\nblunt, intense speeches, and passionate,\nsomewhat antagonistic, activism. While\nher passion for her cause is still clear, she\nspeaks in a much more calm and rational\ntone than we have previously seen. She\nappears well-informed, demonstrating\nan ability to reference facts and statistics\noff the top of her head to support\nher claims, and delivering thoughtful\nresponses with minimal hesitation.\nThunberg also seems optimistic,\ndespite the depressing circumstances\nwe\u2019re in and the sore lack of critical\naction that has been taken thus far. The\ninterview concludes with statements\nlike \u2018we are activists because we are very\npositive that we can achieve change\u2019 and\n\u2018there is not a point where everything\nis lost\u2019. It is uplifting to hear her\nbelief that we can, and should, always\ncontinue trying to save our planet.\nHowever, among the positive words\nthere is a jarring line of hers: \u2018If we\nswitched our focus (away) from trying\nto create loopholes and excuses to not\ntake action\u2026\u2019. While this appears to\nbe a reference to what was supposed\nto be achieved at COP26, it rings\neven truer in retrospect, with many\nworld leaders failing to agree to the\nnecessary terms for keeping Earth\u2019s\ntemperature to 1.5 degrees or lower.\nThe effects of climate change are\nbecoming increasingly noticeable,\nand the predictions for the future of\nthe planet on its current trajectory\nare not looking pretty. With our\ncurrent emission rates, we are slated\nto reach 2.4 degrees of warming by\n2100, and with that comes disastrous\neffects, including, but not limited to,\nincreased wildfires and flooding, crop\nfailures, and population displacement.\nCOP26 may have been pegged\nto be a groundbreaking convention,\nbut it has not lived up to the world\u2019s\nexpectations \u2013 not by a long shot.\nThunberg and fellow climate activists\nUgandan Vanessa Nakate, Polish\nDominika Lasote, and Filipino Mitzi\nTan set out a list of demands for\nthe politicians and businesspeople\nattending COP, as seen below:\n1. Keeping the goal of 1.5\u00b0C alive,\n2. Ending all fossil fuel investments,\nsubsidies, and new projects\nimmediately,\n3. Ending creative carbon\naccounting,\n4. Delivering the $100bn promised\nto the most vulnerable countries,\nand\n5. Enacting climate policies that\nprotect workers and the most\nvulnerable.\nThis list also formed the basis of\nan online petition (see QR code\non next page). The petition has\ngained over 1.8 million signatures\nsince it was published two weeks\nago, with the number continuing\nto rise, but none of these demands\nhave been addressed sufficiently.\nThere have been a few notable\nagreements, including a tentative\ncooperation between the US and\nChina, and an amendment to the 2015\nParis Agreement to reconvene every\nyear (as opposed to every five years) to\nfurther discuss climate action, but the\nmajority of discussions have still fallen\nshort in committing to the desired\nsolutions for restricting global warming.\nOne of the major talking-points\nof COP \u2013 the failure to supply the\nagreed upon climate financial aid\nfor underdeveloped countries \u2013 is a\nstriking example of politicians not\nfollowing through on their promises.

It pulls me back in. It\u2019s a lifesaver of a track.\nDo you have any memories you associate with that\nsong?\nI had it on at my parents\u2019 place.

I also\nbranched into clarinet, bass clarinet and bassoon, and I\ndabble in the mystic arts of ukulele, but who doesn\u2019t at\nthis point? Alto sax is still my favourite instrument to\nplay.

The\nSRIEWG\u2019s work is now complete,\nfollowing the publication of the Report.\nFollowing the report\u2019s publication, a\nnew panel named the SRI Engagement\nMonitoring Panel (SRIEMP) was\nformed. The SRIEMP was set up \u201cto\noversee the successful implementation,\nongoing delivery and evaluation of\nthe SRI Engagement and Monitoring\nprocess, in order for the College\nto enact and monitor its Socially\nResponsible Investment Policy in\nrelation to Fossil Fuel Companies\n(FFCs)\u201d. The group\u2019s work will be\nongoing to ensure investments remain\ninline with the SRI policy, and to\nmonitor Imperial\u2019s influence on\nencouraging FFCs to decarbonise.\nThe SRIEMP will produce an annual\nreport, to be presented at a Town Hall\nmeeting, where progress on the SRI\nEngagement and Monitoring process\nwill be conveyed to the Imperial\ncommunity. The College highlighted\nto Felix that the panel included student\nrepresentation.\nThe College\u2019s SRI strategy clearly\nstates, in a FFC-specific aside, that it\nwill continue to invest in, and work\nwith, FFCs which have robust plans to\nreach net zero by 2050. When asked for\nexamples of investments that will cease\nas a result of the report\u2019s suggestions,\nthe College was unable to provide any\nas they are still in the early stages of\npolicy implementation, but that results\nwould emerge during 2022.\nShell, n\u00e9e Royal Dutch Shell, this\nweek announced that it was moving its\nheadquarters to London.\nWorld-leading plastic pollution\nscientists Steve and Dee Allen this week\ndeclined for their work to be displayed\nby the Science Museum due to the\ninstitution\u2019s links with Shell. With their\nplans to meet net zero by 2050, the the\nEndowment Fund may invest in Shell\nshould they choose.\nThe Scope of the Scopes\nEmissions are recognised under three\n\u201cScopes\u201d in industry, depending\non their point of use, according to the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1\nincludes direct use such as burning fuel\nto power a car; Scope 2 includes the\nemissions associated with, for example,\nelectricity production which is then\nused to light up your home; Scope 3 is\nthe majority of other indirect emissions\nsuch as commuting, waste disposal, etc.\nIn analysis of FFC impacts on achieving\nnet zero, the FFCs are held accountable\nfor all three scopes. So when you drive\nto work instead of cycling, that\u2019s Shell\u2019s\nfault. FFC attribution also means that\nbig emitters such as the construction\nindustry, responsible for around 39%\nof global carbon emissions, are not\ncovered by the SRI vetting process.\nCurrent Investments\nAlook at the July 2021 Endowment\nFund Holdings leaves the likes\nof Shell and BP nowhere to be seen.\nHowever \u00a33 million can be found\ninvested in MacDonalds, \u00a32.4 million\nin the copper mining company\nAntofagasta and almost \u00a33.25 million\nin CRH, construction industry\nmaterials supplier. \u00a31.77 million finds\nitself invested in Tencent holdings,\na Chinese company surrounded in\ncontroversy earlier this year when\nit emerged that it was using facial\nrecognition technology to catch\nchildren playing video games past\na curfew recently introduced by\nthe Chinese government. Felix has\ndiscovered that Tencent has filed\npatents further to their existing facial\nrecognition technology, outlining\nadjustments made to improve accuracy\non \u201cminority groups, such as Uighurs...\nand black people\u201d. The patent also\ndescribed Uighurs as \u201cspecial\u201d.\nOne of the lesser-endowed collective\ninvestment vehicles in which Imperial\nhas a stake has an ESG (Environmental,\nSocial and Governance) rating of\n1.67/10.\nConversely, some of the most well-funded funds have relatively high ESG\nratings and even contain the word\n\u201csustainable\u201d in their name.\nThere is also an extensive list of\nindirect holdings, where Imperial is\ninvested in companies via collective\nvehicles such as indexes. Ever the\nspread-better, the College also holds\nan indirect stake in the wrestling\nentertainment company WWE.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\n13\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCredits: The Foundling Museum\nThanks to the onset of industrialisation and revolution in engravings and print, William Hogarth rose quickly to become one of the most\npopular English painters of the eightenth century.\nMoving away from commissioned religious work and\nportraituremilieu,Hogarthandhisfellowcompatriots\nacross mainland Europe at the dawn of the century instead developed through their paintings a unique commentary on contemporary social life. In short, these\npaintings captured on canvas are the first impressions\nof life outside courts, reflecting instead on the common\nman and society. Street corners, balls, salons, and cafes\nbecame commonplace in art works, slowly displacing\nchurches and landscapes.\nTateBritain\u2019slatestexhibitionfocusesonthischanging tide in the mid-eighteenth century, and through a\nseries of paintings and prints focussing mostly on Hogarth\u2019s work, writes a dramatic telling of society as it existed then.\nMuch changed in eighteenth century Europe. Cities\neverywhere become the focus - and four in particular\n- became rallying points for gentry and artists! Venice\nand Amsterdam, teetering on their last vestiges of the\npost-renaissance and trading relevance; while Paris and\nLondon, were, thanks to the Age of Enlightenment\nand the impending industrial revolution, becoming the\nepicentres of Western civilisation.\nIn such a climate, Hogarth and his contemporaries painted not paysages, bridges, and piers. Instead,\nwe go for the first time, invited into the lives of eight-eenth-century folk, and confront the vibrant city life.\nThe exhibition opens with Hogarth\u2019s \u2018The Gate of Calais\u2019 and this works brilliantly in two ways. For one, it\npresents a striking allegory of the times we live in now,\nfull of vibrancy and action; but also unfortunately, that\nof rampant stereotypes and jingoism. The fat French\nmonk veers with \u2018wry\u2019 eyes on the roast beef of Old\nEngland (the painting\u2019s other name), while the women\naround\u2013commonfolk,areshowntobeindifferentand\nsuccumbed to superstition. On the other hand, it sets\nthe tone for what follows; canvases that uniquely capture city life and society, not always honestly though,\nbut full of vibrancy nonetheless.\nSpeaking of cities, one sees a lot of London here.\nBut a different London to one we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.\nThis isn\u2019t the London of Turner with the hazy fumes of\nburning Westminster and foggy bridges; This isn\u2019t even\nthe London of Canaletto with the sharpness of the\npiers and boats striking into the cold still water. This is\nHogarth\u2019s London - one that has more in connect with\nFleet Street than it does with Mall Road or the Strand.\nLondon has never been painted with such root-ed-ness. Soldiers and merry folk go about their usual\nlives, trysts in dimly lit pubs and street hawkers moving\nabout their carts are more common here than any other\naspect of London.\nThe exhibition displays the print engravings he\nmade for the papers, praising the virtues of beer drinking whilst shunning gin and tonic (which are accompanied by some swell eighteenth century shanties). Not\nyour average conversation among gentry, is it? Even\nwhen the paintings are of gentry or nobility \u2014 it shows\na tinge of wit and self-ridicule of the characters there-in. There is more honesty in these paintings than was\never entertained before with commissioned pieces.\nBut if all of these are commonplace, so too are the\nvices and the hypocrisy of the lives these paintings por-tray!\nHogarth was a man and product of the eighteenth\ncentury - and even as diversity was beginning to take\nstock in London (over 3% of the London population at\nthis time were of Black heritage), slavery and prejudice\nwas a real and malignant presence. These aspects are\nfoundscatteredacrosspaintingsoftheage,butparticu-larly in Hogarth\u2019s work. Black people, are often caricatured into stereotypes in these paintings, and stand literally on the edge of the canvas cut out of the narrative\nmercilessly. The exhibition does crucial justice to bring\nthis to the forefront of discourse, dancing the fine line\nof allowing us to reflect sans judgement of the milieu.\nIn my review of Tate Britain\u2019s previous outing with\nthe exhibition on Turner (Turner\u2019s Modern World - issue 1754), I alluded to quite offhandedly that \u2018British\nart does(n\u2019t) begin and end with Turner and Constable\u2026\u2019 It is only fair that I acknowledge here that with\nthis single exhibition, Tate Britain has shown how\nmuch more there is to it. The exhibition shows how\nonecanlearnquitealotonsocialcommentarythrough\npaintings and, more importantly, learn from them to\nbe better.\nThisfocusonsocialcommentarycanbeheavy,however; and in comparison does eclipse the technical discourse on the style of Hogarth and his contemporaries\n\u2014 one might come out of the exhibition feeling quite\nlike they have been to see a documentary! But again\n\u2013 art is storytelling, and as much as we might like, exhibitions are more about unearthing these hidden narratives than plain textbook narration. Only note that if\nfor any reason much of the narrative explored in these\npaintings about the injustice of the age seems indulgent to you \u2014 you\u2019ve more to learn than the next per-son! This is a one exhibition that is not to be missed!\nWilliam Hogarth\u2019s line(s) of beauty\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nHogarth and Europe\nWhere? Tate Britain\nWhen?

They\nworked to popularise the term \u2018carbon\nfootprint\u2019, which successfully became\nan oft-used buzzword within the\nclimate community, bleeding into both\ngrassroots activism and mainstream\npolitics. This, alongside Adani\u2019s\nsponsorship of the Science Museum, are\njustnewexamplesofthewidelypractised\nmethod of corporate greenwashing.\nToday, it is increasingly common\nto see more and more climate-related\ninitiatives, exhibitions, and campaigns\nmake their way into the public realm.\nHowever, not all of these should be\ntaken at face value. Simple interrogation\nof who is bankrolling these initiatives\nwill ensure that those mostly responsible\nfor climate change are not able to hide\nbehindthecurtainoffauxclimateaction.\nOne third of all food produced\nis wasted. With such immense\namounts of waste, there are obvious concerns over the lost resources along the\nchain of production and the inequality\nof our current system\u2019s food distribution\nas many still struggle to feed themselves.\nBut why is it so easy for consumers to\nwaste their nourishment?\nIn the developed world food is discarded along each stage of its endless\nsupply chain, however, while we have\nno control over most steps along that\nsupply chain, as consumers we have control over our own waste. Throwing out\n\u2018expired\u2019 products from our fridges and\ncupboards may seem innocent but it has\nprofound consequences. Not only does\nthis wasted food mean that input resources such as water have been unnecessarily used, but when the food reaches the landfill it emits greenhouse gases\n(GHG) into the atmosphere.\nAt the end of the 18th century the\nEnglish demographer and economist\nThomas Malthus suggested humanity\nwould reach a critical inflection point\nbetween an exponentially rising population and a food supply only capable of\nincreasinginalinearfashion.Thiswould\nlikely result in famine and war, followed\nbypovertyanddepopulation.Humanity\nwould in theory, retrogress. Fortunately,\nno such global crisis has yet occurred.\nBut just like the joke about the economists who have predicted fifty of the last\nfive financial crises, the Malthusians may\none day be right.\nIt will require some wilful reimagina-tion of our global food systems to ensure\nthe future isn\u2019t pervaded by famine for\nmany parts of the world. The figure for\nundernourishment has worryingly risen in recent years. The writer William\nGibson famously declared \u2018the future is\nalready here \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u2019 We should be looking to ensure it\nisn\u2019t one of insufficient access.\nNot only do we need to look at more\nresilient ways of growing the food\n(which is a separate discussion), we also\nneed to look at this disconnect between\nconsumersandproducers.Globalization\nand urbanisation are chief among a variety of factors that have disrupted this\nrelationship. If you only know food in\nits plentiful and accessible supply, far removed from its point of inception, you\nwill feel less guilty\nabout throwing\nawaythatextrapep-per.\nWe have a fractured relationship\nwith our food, the\nmajority of the developed world are\ndisconnected from\nwhat\u2019s on their\nplate. A food\u2019s journey to that plate is far\nout of sight and mind. Most only know\nfood from the final stage of the chain: in\nthesupermarketsorrestaurantswhereits\nsupply is deceptively limitless. Yet global\nfood prices have hit a decade high; poor\ncrop yields, labour shortages and shipping costs have added Malthusian doubt\nto what was an illusion of stability in the\nabundant supply of food variety.\nSo how do we correct this? One way\nto do this is through rekindling people\u2019s\nconnection to the food on their plate.\nThis can be done through localising\nsupply chains. Direct farm to consumer\nfood has been gaining popularity in the\nwest. The notion of building a relationship with the farmer may sound archaic\nbut just like the vinyl and the milkman\nthose things we thought were once gone\ncan sometimes re-enter the frame; sometimes for the better.\nTo fend off a new wave of Malthusian\nconcerns we need an answer that is not\njust technological but psychological.\nWe would all agree that the freezer and\nfridge technology have improved standards of living no doubt, but in spite of\ntheir prevalence the developed world is\nstill binning a large percentage of their\ncontents. Scale this consumption level\nglobally and there wouldn\u2019t be enough\nto go round. A globalization of the\nAmerican diet couldn\u2019t\nsustain itself.\nSome may think that\ntechnology can allow such\nabundance, that hydroponic city farms can increase the supply of food\nglobally. While at its best\nit may present a cornuco-pian food system to deter\nMalthusianism, it doesn\u2019t\ntackle the waste problem. If the GHG\nproduced from food waste were a country it would only be behind China and\nAmerica;itscontributionis6%toglobal\nGHG emissions, more than three times\nthat of aviation. If anything, easier and\ncheaper access to more food would exacerbate the problem. We should be\ncautious of a future of commercial west-ern-style abundance; just look at the\ndamage and diseases caused by this diet.\nLooking at our current supply chain\nsystem consumers can be forgiven for\nnot thinking about these things. Supermarkets have done wonders for increasing accessibility to a multitude of food.\nBut if we continue with this paradigm of\nwaste then the food they supply will be\nbecome more of an issue than a source of\nnutrition and celebration. We can easily\nproduce enough to feed the world, we\nmay just have to re-evaluate what goes\nin the bin. Or to paraphrase: the food is\nalready here \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distrib-uted.\nSeb Lawson Environment Writer\nTackling Food Waste at its Core:\nRe-evaluatingOurRelationshipWithFood\nTHE FOOD\nIS ALREADY\nHERE - IT\u2019S JUST\nNOT EVENLY\nDISTRIBUTED\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: mrdoomits on Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n36\nCOMMENT\nIn a previous edition of Felix, a few\nof you may have stumbled across an\narticle titled \u201cIs Modern Day Feminism\nFlawed?\u201d in the Comment section. It is\nrather fitting that the previous article\nstarts by misattributing a quote to\nAristotle that he never wrote, as it then\nproceeds to misattribute many positions\nto feminism that the movement does\nnot represent.\nIts writer attempts to argue that mod-ern-day feminism completely overlooks\nmen\u2019s issues in favour of women\u2019s supe-riority, which is a complete falsehood.\nThe writer seems to perpetuate the idea\nof feminism only addressing the systemic and societal issues faced by women,\nwhereas in reality, feminism aims to\ntackle the system of gender norms instilled in society by the patriarchy that\nnegatively affect both men and women.\nThe phrase \u2018equality of the sexes\u2019 means\njust that: equal rights, opportunities and\noutcomes for both men and women in\nall areas. Giving women more rights\ndoes not mean taking them away from or\noppressing men, something the author\nheavily implies.\nThe author also purports that the existence of the patriarchy is dubious and\nis a gross exaggeration of the wealth and\npower of a tiny proportion of men in so-ciety. In reality, the patriarchy is a system\nthat puts men in charge of society, reac-tively and proactively, rather than a system in which some men are \u201con top\u201d of\na social hierarchy. This idea is multilay-ered: permeating through inequalities\nagainst women at the legal, professional,\nand domestic levels. Upheld by cultural\nnorms, tradition, education, and history,\nthis structure of power relations is repro-duced. Because this is a societal structure\nratherthanindividualsexistacts,theidea\nof the patriarchy, therefore, accommodates how not all men actively uphold or\nbenefit from it, just as how not all women dislike it: we all participate, however\nunwillingly. For example, a woman can\nenforce the patriarchy by victimising a\nman and telling him to \u201cman-up\u201d in an\nemotionally traumatic situation. The patriarchy doesn\u2019t mean that all men have\nit easy or that the average man\u2019s life is\neasier than the average women\u2019s just by\ndefault. Instead, it means that society is\nbuilt in such a way with certain expectations based on gender and that because\nof this, men have access to types of benefits unavailable to women.\nThe issues of male su-icide, forced conscrip-tion, high incarcera-tion, and imbalanced\ndivorce court rulings\nare used as ways to\npoint the finger at feminism being \u2018one-sided\u2019\nand never standing up\nin support of men, but\nthese are all examples\nof how the patriarchy\nnegatively affects men\nas well as women. This\nis why we see the issues\npointed out by the author more prevalently in men - our patriarchal system expects men to be strong-er, more violent and more self-sufficient\nthan women. Therefore, men receive\nharsher punishment, are expected to do\nmore violent and dangerous work and\nare expected to take care of themselves\nwithout help - financially, physically or\nmentally. While men experience these\nissues, women face the opposite - being\nconsidered weaker, more vulnerable, and\ndependent on men for support. However, just because men also face social difficulties that doesn\u2019t mean they do not\nhave the majority of positions of power\nin society. It\u2019s a double-edged sword negatively affecting both genders, so when\nfeminism says they want to dismantle\nthe patriarchy, they don\u2019t mean to take\nall the power away from men and allow\nwomen to be superior/oppressive, but\nit means taking apart these gender roles\nand stigmatisations and reducing issues\nstemming from them for both\ngenders.\nInterestingly, the author also states,\n\u2018even if we were to say\nthat we have a patriarchal structure, the fundamental basis is the\nresult of proficiency\u2019.\nWe can only assume\nhe means that men are\nin more dominating\npositions of power &\nwealth because they are\nnaturally better, smarter and more deserving.\nIn truth, this sentence\nis nothing more than\na sexist and outdated\ntrope. Generalisations\nsuch as \u2018women are naturally less good at\nSTEM subjects or more nurturing\u2019 have\nlong been used as a means to further the\nidea that it is pointless to push for gender equality because it is not biologically\npossible. However, evidence has shown\nthat this is not the case. In the past, people thought that men and women had\nsignificant differences in spatial aware-ness, mathematics, and reasoning skills,\nresulting in men being found in very\nskilled & higher-paying jobs. However,\nstudies have shown that these biological\ndifferences are a fraction of a standard\ndeviation, not enough to explain why\nmen hold so much power in society. Instead, the continued discrimination and\noppression of women stemming from\ngender expectations has made them\nseem this way.\nThe article only uses one statistic to\nback up its points, and unfortunately, it\nis a woefully false piece of misinforma-tion. The inclusion of such misinformation to reinforce damaging stereotypes\nwas not just an embarrassing mistake,\nbut a serious oversight of a newspaper\nrun by the students of a world-leading\nresearch university. The 53% figure cited as the percentage of \u201cfalse rape cases\u201d represents the proportion of rape\ncases that were dropped before making\nit to court. This could have been due to\npressure from other parties, a lack of evi-dence, or simply the fear of having to go\nthrough the traumatic process of a rape\ntrial. In reality, the rate of false rape accusations is no more prevalent than the\nrate of falsifying any other crime. Next\ntime you hear someone questioning the\nvalidity of a rape accusation, I suggest\nyou ask them if they would also doubt\nthe person if they had claimed they had\nbeen mugged. The rate of rape, especially cases that go unreported, is terrifyingly high for all demographics. Perhaps it\nis time we stopped demonising rape victims and allowed them to come forward\nwith their stories without having to face\nfurther trauma.\nWe want to conclude by saying that\nyes-youwillbeabletofindwomenbelit-tling men\u2019s issues and calling it feminism\nonline. You will also find strange men in\nsuits going over the lyrics of WAP line\nby line, saying that it signals the fall of\nthe West... the internet is a strange place,\nand you need to keep your wits about\nyou.

    "content": "Over the weekend, Imperial College\nBoat Club had its first major race of the\nacademic year. The event is what is called\nin rowing a \u2018head race\u2019, which means a\ntime-trial event held on a river where\nboats are set off one after each other\nfrom A to B. This specific race was the\nFours Head, which takes place over the\nOxford-Cambridgeboat-racecoursebut\nin reverse. This means that it is just under 7 km long and goes from Chiswick\nBridge to Putney Bridge. This is a very\nwindy and technical race, with very fast\nThames current that makes it difficult\nto know what the fastest route is and is\nalso one of the longest races rowers in\nthis country take part\nin. The last time this\nevent took place was\n2019. Due to this being a \u201chome\u201d race for\nImperial, it meant\nthat they could boat\nout of their own boat\nhouse, and be cheered\non by friends, family,\nand alumni all cheering from the club\nhouse. It cannot be\ndenied the huge advantage of knowing the\ntideway as well the Imperial students do,\ndue to how technical this race is. This is\nalso the only race outside the boat race\nwhere Oxford and Cambridge crews\nrace alongside each other and where\nthey can test each other out for the first\ntime; however, this year, there was a disappointing turn out from the Oxford\ncrews, with no male crews participat-ing. There are four different categories\nof boats: either coxed or coxless, sweep\n(fours) and sculling (quads). In general,\nquads are faster than fours, and coxless\nare faster than coxed. This is an extremely large event, with 410 crews competing\nthisyearfromnumerousschools,univer-sities, and rowing clubs around the UK.\nThismeantthat,onthesamedayandthe\nsame course, school children were racing\nnext to Olympic medallists. Due to the\nnumber of boats, and the staggered start\nhaving boats going one after the other, it\nmeant that the race lead to a three-hour\nparade of boats going down the Thames.\nOver the course of this time, there were\nImperial students, alumni, and friends\nand families placed all\nalong the main landmarks of the race, cheering on each crew coming\ndown. There were twelve\nImperial crews entered,\nconsisting of eight men\u2019s\ncrews and four women\u2019s\ncrews. There were still\nImperial rowers that were\non reserve, as the club\nhad run out of boats that\ntheyhadorcouldborrow,\nattesting to the depth of\nthe squad this year. The\ncrews boated from the Imperial College boat club, aka the finish line, and\ndid the 7km warm-up paddle up to the\nstart. Due to the large number of crews,\nthe women\u2019s crews had to wait for all the\nmen\u2019s crews in front to start, meaning\nthey sat for an hour or two at the start\nin their boats, getting quite cold and\ntired before the race even started; and\nyet, despite this, they all performed well.\nThis year, due to the conditions, the race\ntook approximately between eighteen\nto twenty-three minutes. All Imperial crews finished in the top ten of their\ncategories, with five crews coming in the\ntop three of their categories. The standout performance of the day was the top\nwomen\u2019s boat, a coxless four, composed\nof three out of the four women who won\nat Henley Women\u2019s Regatta in the same\nboat this summer. The girls came in first,\nbeatingOxfordUniversitywomen\u2019sboat\nclub and overtaking three crews on their\nwaydownthecourse.Thewomen\u2019scoxed\nfour, a men\u2019s coxless four, and a men\u2019s\ncoxed four all came second in their cate-gories, and the men\u2019s quad came in third\nin their category. Outside of the Imperial news, in the recent days, it has come to\nlight that three top clubs had their crews\ndisqualified after the race due to being in\nthe incorrect category for the crew. This\nis even more interesting as all three had\nwon their category, so we can imagine\nhow painful this must be for the rowers and hope that the high-performance\ncoaches read the rules a bit more closely\nnext time around. However, given the\nfact that one of the university\u2019s had no\nboats in the previous fours head due to\ntheir coaches forgetting to get their entries on time, having only one boat disqualified could probably be seen as an\nimprovement. Despite our teasing, it\nshould be recognized that this team was\nthe most successful on the day.

When we embark on superfluous\nconversations with these people, the\nfulfilment we get from these talks are\nephemeral, they just satisfy our necessity of social validation demonstrated\nby the rapid exchange of text messages\nand emotionally hollow emoticons. Immediately after leaving our smartphone,\na feeling of emptiness invades us because we have spent hours talking with\na stranger who does not care about us,\nabout meaningless topics. This effect\nis not necessary sensed consciously but\non a subconsciously level. It is like when\nyou smoke, you do not feel the damage\non your body, but the damage is clearly\nthere. We do not need thousands of followers in social media to feel fulfilled\nsocially speaking, the followers\u2019 number just feed our ego and desire for social validation. These emotions are weak\nbecause you are making your happiness\nrely on external circumstances. Moreover, they are treacherous because they\nwill abandon you in the harsh moments,\nleavingyoufeelingmiserableorhopeless.\nSelf-esteem and perseverance are hard to\ngain but they never abandon you. Instead, they make you grow up in the ad-versity. Instead,humansonlyrequire4-5\nmeaningful connections to be happy because they provide sustainable joy to our\nlives, as well as a safety zone to feel supported when needed. In the past, establishing long-term and deep connections\nwas much easier as people do not usually\nmove away from their place of birth and\nletters were at their peak usage. These\nallowed people to establish close bonds\nwith people they have known since their\nchildhood. Furthermore, in those times,\npeople did not have smartphones, YouTube, or TikTok to entertain themselves\nin hours of meaningless information.\nOur great-great-great-great-grandpar-ents had most of their fun on the street\nwith people they had known for years.\nMeaningful connections are the main\ncure of loneliness, but we cannot rely\non them as they partly depend on other\npeople, on external circumstances outside of our control. Instead, we should\nconcentrate on just one word: proactiv-ity. Taking control of your life and starting to engage in activities you are interested in have two main benefits. Firstly,\ndoing something you relish in will fulfil\nyour life with valuable \u201cthings\u201d of life\nFOR YOU not anyone else. Hence, the\nvaluable \u2018things\u2019 of life are variable with\neach person. For someone, it could be\ntheir job because he does not like his\nfamily, but another person might be the\ntotal opposite. What makes as happy depends on our context and personality,\nwhich are unique in each human being.\nSecondly, in many of these activities, you\nwill probably find like-minded people,\nwhom you can establish interesting conversations with. In most cases, you will\nnotfindyourbestfriendorthepartnerof\nyour dreams. You do not want that, but\njust talking about topics of common in-terestallowsyoueasilytobuildarapport\nwith other person and get the sense that\nthere are other people like you. This will\nsatisfyyourneedsasasocialanimal,even\nthough loneliness would not disappear\nimmediately, but it is much better than\ncrying for your misery or staring at other\nFacebook profiles to see how their lives\nare apparently better than yours. Another way to fight loneliness is philosophy,\nhaving deep thoughts about human relationships and reality\ncan be used to weigh\nabout your current\nsituation and the value of the connections\nyou have. The philosophical approach to\nloneliness is manifold\nbut I am going to focus on stoicism, which\nbasically says that you\nshould not care about\nthings out of your con-trol. And this is utterly\ntrue. If you are a nice\nperson and you have\nno friends, why should\nyou feel sad that the\npeople surrounding\nyou ignore you? Life is\nvery short; nothing is\nmore important than\nyour own happiness\nbecause time is merciless and will depreciate\nthe value of the meaningless stuff quickly.\nWhen you are old, on\nthebrinkofdeath,howimportantwould\nthat random girl at university who literally ignores you be? Reflect on it.\nDespite living in a globalized world\nwhere it is so easy to communicate with\neachother,peoplearefeelinglonelierbe-cause the quality of connections are not\nimproving rather they are deteriorating.\nAn awesome life is constructed by your-self, not by others, by being proactive.\nBefore concluding this article, I wish to\ngive you just one more piece of advice.\nWhen you are feeling down, remember\nthat nothing can stop you to keep trying to live a happier life\u2026except death.\nEveryone will die and when that occurs,\nour companies will just be the maggots\nthat are devouring us until our flesh is\ntotally consumed. Then, all of us indiscriminately would be eternally alone\u2026\nbut never lonely again!\nPhoto credits: Adrian Swancar on Unsplash\nWe have our phones attached to our hands, yet people are more lonely than ever.\nPhoto credits: Wang Guo\nIllustration of a lone person.\n\n"

The\nalbum was a beautiful mess of genres and feelings, and\nher recipe was simple - she took personal anecdotes\nand connected them with hard-hitting lyrics full of\nuniversal emotions. Ever since Swift announced she\nwas dropping Red (Taylor\u2019s Version), remaking her\n2012 classic, anticipation has run high. The new Red\nis bigger, glossier, deeper, casually crueler, and it stabs\nyou with a razor-sharp piece of her own broken heart.\nFirst things first: let\u2019s skip to the ending. The\n10-minute version of \u2018All Too Well\u2019 turns out to be\nbetter than what we were all hoping for. Swift takes\nher own masterpiece, tears it all up, breaks it like a\npromise, shreds the tapestry of the\nsong, and rebuilds it into a new\nheartbreak anthem that is twice as\nlong and twice as brutal. \u2018All Too\nWell\u2019 is angrier, far less filtered, and\nmore explicit in every sense of the\nword. This track is a ballad full of\ndropped hands, wordless polishing\nof plates, taking off your coat but not\nbeing able to step out of the sadness.\n\u2018All Too Well\u2019 is a weaponisation\nof memory, and the devil is in the\ndetails: a lost scarf, an open refrigerator illuminating\nthe kitchen. The specificity asserts that the relationship\nwith the unfeeling, manipulative, and disbelieving ex\nhappened. But for all its hyper-personalisation \u2014\n\u2018All Too Well\u2019 is also quite poignantly about a young\nwoman\u2019s attempt to find retroactive equilibrium in a\nrelationship that was based on a power imbalance that\nshe couldn\u2019t perceive. Swift hasn\u2019t written a breakup\nsong nearly as scorching in the decade since \u2018All Too\nWell\u2019, but the song isn\u2019t about him anymore. It\u2019s about\nwhatever and whoever you still wish you could forget.\nThe challenge of Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) was how to\nremake an unimprovable original. Her adult voice adds\nnew power to the old songs, especially deep cuts like\n\u2018Come Back\u2026Be Here\u2019 and \u2018The Moment I Knew\u2019. It\nsounds different to hear \u2018Holy Ground\u2019 sung by the\nsameTaylorwhowentontowrite\u2018\u2018tisthedamnseason\u2019\nand \u2018Coney Island.\u2019 It\u2019s poignant to hear her 31 year\nold voice sing \u2018Begin Again\u2019, the song that ended the\noriginal album on a note of fragile optimism as if she\nsaw the refrigerator light at the end of the tunnel. In\nthe new \u2018We Are Never Ever Getting\nBack Together\u2019, there\u2019s a little extra\nvenom in the way she snarls \u201ctrust\nme\u201d \u2014 which might come from an\nadditional 9 years of hearing men\nasking her to trust them.\nThe new songs fit in tonally one\nway or another, like the upbeat bops\n\u2018Message In A Bottle\u2019 and \u2018The Very\nFirst Night\u2019. Her collaboration with\nEd Sheeran on \u2018Run\u2019 is very much in\nline with \u2018Everything Has Changed\u2019.\n\u2018I Bet You Think About Me\u2019, is a rowdy all-the-way\ncountry duet with Chris Stapleton \u2014 the kind of\nNashville hit she was about to leave behind, with her\ncountry twang on display. \u2018Forever Winter\u2019 masks its\nforeboding message with a pleasing, rhythmic use of\ntrumpets.\nThemostmagneticnewarrival,however,is\u2018Nothing\nNew\u2019, featuring Phoebe Bridgers, where the two artists\nworry about losing their novelty over the years. Their\nvoices are a divine combination: Bridgers is soft yet\nraspy, while Swift keeps it soothingly low key. \u2018Nothing\nNew\u2019 is extremely relatable even if you\u2019re not a globally\nrecognized musician\u2014who doesn\u2019t feel like they knew\neverything at 18, but nothing at 22? Swift\u2019s writing\narticulates that anxiety, and the nights one has spent\ncrying in their room.\nIn the 30 songs, Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) is all about\nthe fact that everyone lied, because time does not\nbring relief or make anything happen; it merely makes\nthe emotivity of mourning pass. And as a sensitive\nmotherfucker, this album makes me want to catapult\nmyself into the sun. If you haven\u2019t heard it yet, go on,\nlet blondie maim you, all too well.\n\u201c\nIT\u2019S ABOUT\nWHATEVER AND\nWHOEVER YOU\nSTILL WISH YOU\nCOULD FORGET\nGig Reviews\nComing Up to Alexandra Palace for Suede\nWritten by Yunke Zhou Music Writer\nOn 11th November at Alexandra Palace, Suede\nbrought back to life their thrilling album Coming Up.\nFans finally got to relive in-person the hell-of-a-high\nthat the album started a decade ago.\nThe night was opened by the spectacularly talented\nNadine Shah. Starting dark and brooding, Shah\naroused the audience with a twist to pieces from her\nnewest album Kitchen Sink, including heavier elements\nof bass and drums than the recorded version. With an\nincredible range, Shah\u2019s voice cut effortlessly through\nthe instrumentals, before blending into provocative\nbridges that immersed the performances with intensity\nand mysticism. The band also featured a saxophonist,\noffering sharpness that complemented Shah\u2019s strong\nhigh notes.\nPast 9pm, the entirety of the venue had already\nbecome packed with fans, and the floor already littered\nwith two hours worth of empty cups that were once\nfilled with overpriced beer. I was lucky enough to catch\na spot in the middle-front, and once the silhouettes\nof Suede\u2019s band members appeared on stage I was\npushed forward by the crowd in excitement. Without\na pause, the band broke into \u2018Trash\u2019 - the effervescent\nfirst track of the album - and the audience burst. The\nband embodied the zing of the album to its full, with\nAnderson (the lead singer of Suede, looking hot as\never) taking full advantage of his space, swinging his\nmicrophonebyitscord,andgettingonall-foursduring\n\u2018She\u2019 before approaching the ecstatic audience and\nleaning back into the mass of similarly ecstatic hands (I\nalso had an ecstatic hand, disappointed by an arm that\nproved too short for the occasion).\nThe band rocked through the album with little\npause in between songs, only slowing down for the\nTaylor Swift said \u201cwhen I see a happy bitch I floor it\u201d on her rework of 2012\u2019s Red.\nSuede headline Alexandra Palace to celebrate 25 years since their 1996 chart-topping album Coming Up\nSuede (photo: Yunke Zhou)\n\n"

The size and weight\nof flatfish vary greatly depending on the\nspecies, from the small-mouth righteye\nflounderwithitsmodestlengthof10cm\nto the 180-kilograms Atlantic halibut.\nThe lifespan of a flatfish does not usually\nsurpass 30 years. For example, flounders,\nwith their fast-growth metabolism, live\n13 years on average, whilst the delectable turbot around 23 years. Flatfish are\nlurking predators. Thanks to their flat-shaped body and camouflage, they can\neasily creep on the sand without being\nnoticedbytheirpreysuchasshrimpsand\nsmall fish. Hence, they are considered to\nbe benthic organisms, which prosper on\nthe sea bottom, while pelagic ones live in\nthe open sea.\nFLATFISH PHYLOGENY AND\nDIVERSITY\u2026\nPhylogeny is the study of relationships between different species based\non a common ancestor. For that, we use\nschematic representations called phylogenetic trees. These consist of branch-es, and the points where new branches\nappear are termed nodes. The function\nof nodes is to represent the common\nancestor from which two or more new\nspecies appear. (The bottom right figure\nprovides a comprehensive illustration of\nphylogeny). For a better classification of\nthe species, you can cluster some of them\nin a group, called a clade, according to\ngenetic, morphological, or embryological similarities, among many others.\nDepending on the number of species\nincluded, we can assign these clades as\nfollows, from the highest number of\nspecies to the lowest: domain, phylum,\nkingdom, class, order, family, genus and\nspecies. In addition, there are intermediate states between the classifications\nsuch as suborders or superfamilies.\nFlatfishes belong to the Pleuronectiformes order. This is divided into\nthree superfamilies called Citharoidea,\nSoleoidea and Pleuronectidae. This last\none is also known as the group of right-eye flounders because they have both of\ntheir eyes located on the right side of\ntheir head. Paradoxically, within Pleuronectidae, there is the Bothidae family,\nwhich makes up roughly 20% of known\nflatfish species and whose members\u2019 eyes\nare located on the left side of the head.\nThe habitats of flatfishes are important to analyse their evolutionary pro-cess. You can encounter flatfishes in all\nthe oceans of the world, but most of\nthem are concentrated in the tropical Indo-West Pacific region. However, a minority of flatfish species live in estuaries\n(a transition zone between a river and a\nsea) and rivers. This probably suggests\nthat the common ancestor of flatfish\ncomes from tropical areas and moved\nafterwards into freshwater areas. This\ncommon ancestor is also believed to\npossess bilateral symmetry and to come\nfrom the order Percomorpha. This order\nincludes a wide variety of very different\nspecies like seahorses, tuna, or flatfish.\nTHEIR EYES...\nThereasonsfortheeccentriceyecollocation of flatfish are eminently pragmatical\nsince looking at the sand beneath them\ndoes not provide any relevant informa-tion. But how do they have those eyes?\nSurprisingly, at the very beginning of\ntheir lives, flatfish larvae have bilateral\nsymmetry, which means that they have\none eye on each side of their head. The\nlarvae are translucid with protective\nspines all around the body. Contrary\nto adult flatfish, they do not dwell in\nthe sea bottom but float in the water\nlike plankton. The\ndisplacement of one\neye to the other side\nof the head is a gradual and continuous\nprocess. The trigger\nis an increase in the\nproduction of thyroid\nhormones, which regulate metabolism and\ngrowth. In the case\nof flatfish metamorphosis, they cause\na reshape of flatfishes\u2019 skulls in orderto\nmove the orbit (the cavity of the cranium that houses the eyeballs) of one side\nof the head to the opposite one; while\nthe facial muscles, very active during this\nstage, push the eyeballs to the other side\nofthecraniuminacontrolledwaythatis\nsynchronised with bone modifications.\nThe jawbones are also modified to close\nand open horizontally instead of verti-cally. As camouflage masters, the flatfish\nchanges its colours to the ones of its en-vironment, and fins movements change\nfrom left-and-right to up-and-down.\nThe head asymmetry of flatfish is\nclearly an evolutionary innovation because there is not any other organism\nwith a similar trait. Nonetheless, scientists cannot agree whether this innovation was abrupt or gradual. Some emi-nencies such as Richard Dawkins claim\nthat flatfish are an example of a \u201cdramatic evolutionary adaptation\u201d, motivated\nby environmental changes and randomness in gene mutations. On the other\nhand, a transitional fossil of an adult\nAmphistium, an extinct relative of flat-fish, which dates back 50 million years\nago shows an eye orbit near the top of its\nhead. Therefore, the evolution of flatfish\nmight be progressive.\nPERFECTION DOES NOT\nMATTER...\nIn the animal kingdom, asymmetry\nhas been largely punished by natural selection because it is usually associated\nwith diseases and weakness. But flatfish\nshow that this is not always the case because their one-sided eyes provide them\nwith a huge advantage in terms of locating both their prey and predators when\ncreeping on the sea bottom. Another\nexample of advantageous asymmetry is\nwithin ourselves. Human right lungs are\nbigger than left ones, to provide enough\nspace for our heart. As we can see, natural selection does not care about beauty\nor perfection, but about the utility of\ntraits to increase the survival chances of\nthe individual.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nA turbot camouThaging with its environment.\nFlatfish are unique in the animal kingdom because they are one of\nfew asymmetrical vertebrates.\nThe Amazing Diversity and Eyes\nof Flatfish: Image Credits: Wikimedia Commons\nExample of a cladogram FlatThsh phylogeny\nImage Credits: Wang Guo\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 2021\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFrom cosmology to quantum me-chanics, the theory of massive gravity seeks to answer a fundamental mystery about the expansion of the universe\nby weakening the force of gravity itself.\nRecently joining Imperial College, Professor Andrew Trolley\u2013one of the authors responsible for the theory\u2019s inception\u2013presented his work as part of the\nImperial Inaugurals lecture series.\nAT THE LIMITS OF CURRENT\nPHYSICS\nThe rate of expansion of the universe\nposes a major mystery to physics. It was\nfirst confirmed in 1998 that not only\nis the universe expanding, but that this\nexpansion is accelerating over time. The\nexpansion of the universe\u2013along with\nthe consequential regression of distant\ngalaxies\u2013was first predicted in 1927 by\nGeorges Lema\u00eetre, based upon his work\non Einstein\u2019s equations of general rela-tivity. This remarkable prediction was\nconfirmed just 2 years later by Edwin\nHubble, marking the start of decades of\nresearch into the rate of this expansion.\nInitial expectations were that the rate\nof dispersion of galaxies would slow over\ntime due to the gravitational attraction\nbetween them. Thus, when it was observed that the expansion of the universe\nwas accelerating, this required a new\nexplanation. The source of this accelerationhasbeendubbed\u201cdarkenergy\u201d.This\nis a feature of space itself, which creates a\ngravitational field with a repulsive effect.\nThis field is proportional to the energy\ndensity of dark energy. Since this energy density is constant\u2013and therefore\ndoesn\u2019t become diluted as the universe\nexpands\u2013this causes the expansion rate\nto be constant, ie. the time it takes the\nuniversetodoubleinsizedoesn\u2019tchange.\nIt has been proposed that this phenomenon could be accounted for by vac-uumfluctuations,aquantummechanical\nphenomena whereby particle-antiparti-cle pairs may be created and annihilated\nwithin empty space, provided that the\ntwo particles exist for a short enough\nperiod of time. However, all attempts to\nestimate the contribution from vacuum\nfluctuations obtain an energy density\nvalue which is far too large compared to\nthat expect based on the observed rate of\nexpansion.\nIMPLICATIONS OF A\nMASSIVE GRAVITON\nThe physicists behind massive gravity\nhave conceived of an approach to resolve\nthis conundrum. They propose that one\nof the assumptions implied by general\nrelativity\u2013that gravitational fields are\nconveyed by massless carrier particles\ncalled gravitons\u2013is wrong. In general\nrelativity, the strength of gravitational\nattraction falls with the inverse square of\nthe distance. This effect is due purely to\ngeometry, as the gravitational effect of a\nmass must be spread out over a spherical\ncross section, whose area increases with\nthe square of the distance.\nImbuing the graviton with a mass\nwould change this relationship, causing\ngravity to lose strength with distance\nfaster than the inverse square relation-ship. Importantly, it would mitigate the\nimpact of the hypothesised high energy\ndensity of vacuum fluctuations, by reducing their repulsive gravitational influence on distant matter.\nTHE GHOST PROBLEM\nMost modifications to general relativity which introduce a graviton mass\nalso introduce the possibility of a particle with negative kinetic energy\n\u2013 called a \u201cghost\u201d. Trolley explains\nthat this is a \u201cdisastrous\u201d result as\nit \u201callows the production of an arbitrary number of positive and negative\nenergy particle [pairs]\u201d. Avoiding this\nposed a major obstacle to a theory of\nmassive gravity.\nTrolley and his colleagues Justin\nKhoury and Claudia de Rham had originally come up with a ghost-free gravitational model where the force of gravity\nleaked into higher spatial dimensions,\nconsequently weakening it at large dis-tances. However, this model with 6\nspatial dimensions was very difficult to\nanalyse. The trio noted that from the\nperspective of a 3D observer in their\nmodel, the graviton was no longer a\nmassless particle.\nSupposedly,itwasimpossibletomove\nback to a 3D model but somehow preserve this graviton mass. Two previously\npublished papers had proven no-go the-orems, which stated that any attempt to\nconstruct a 3-dimensional massive theory of gravity would invoke the presence\nof ghosts.\nIt was only when researchers Gregory\nGabadadze, and subsequently Claudia\nde Rham, identified errors in the no-go\ntheories previously published that the\npossibility of constructing a theory of\nmassive gravity in only 3 spatial dimensions came back under consideration.\nShortly thereafter followed the team\u2019s\nbreakthrough, taking only a matter of\nweeks.\nEXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS\nThe ultimate test of massive gravity\nliesinwhetheritagreeswithexperiment.\nVarious predictions of the theory stand\nto be tested by ongoing or future exper-iments. These\npredictions include implications for the precise motion of planets, star systems and\ngalaxies\u2013including within our own solar system.\nMassive gravity also influences the nature of gravitational waves. If the graviton is massive, gravitational waves must\ntravel slower than the speed of light.\nAdditionally, massive gravity predicts\nthe existence of additional gravitational wave polarisations, giving a total of 5,\ncompared to the 2 predicted by general\nrelativity.\nPolarisation describes the way in\nwhich the waves displace particles as\nthey move through space. General relativity only permits this motion to occur\nperpendicular to the direction of the\ntravel of the wave, with the particles following an oscillating elliptical pattern\n(a). In massive gravity, additional modes\nof motion are possible, including particles oscillating in a circular pattern (b)\nor oscillating parallel to the direction of\nmotion.\nMuch of the experimental evidence\nwill come from gravitational wave detec-tors, such as the current largest ground-based detectors, LIGO and VIRGO. It\nwill likely take decades until we obtain\nconclusive evidence as to the validity of\nmassive gravity. However, this won\u2019t halt\nthe work of the theorists, as they continue to search for viable models to explain\nthe mysterious accelerating expansion of\nour universe.\nMarek Cottingham Science Editor\nMotion of a ring of particles due to the passage of a gravitational wave.
