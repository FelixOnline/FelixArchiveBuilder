Miss Carolyn\nRussell was proposed to by a Dutch gentle-man, after only fifteen minutes conversation.\nThey fia d never met previously. However,\nCarolyn was equal to the situation. Blushing only ever-so-slightly she refused in her\nmost charming manner.\nSEN NET STAFF CHANGES Paul Masterman, a Birkbeck College student who has worked on the Eveninig Standard's Student Supplement, has been appointed\nEditor of Sennet, the University Union news-paper. Peter Martin is the new Managing\nDirector. Sennet's sales in this College are\nabout 450 per week.\nNEW COLLEGE SECRETARY The Governing Body have appointed Mr.\nM.J. Davies, CM. G,O. B.E., B.A., formerly of the Overseas Civil Service, to be Secretary of the College on d Clerk to the Governors. Mr. Davies took up his duties at the\nbeginning of this term\nSKIFFY\nSURVEY\nTO ALL LEFT HANDED STUDENTS During the next week, Felix is sponsoring\na survey of Lefthanded Students at I.C, to\nhelp prove or disprove recent theories that\nmany left handed people have a tendency towards the sciences. This has only become apparent during the last few years owing to\nthe discontinuation of the practise of forcing\nnaturally lef lt handed children to write with\ntheir right hand. In connection with this survey we would be. grateful if all left handed students and any interested right handed students for comparison, would come to Committee room A on Tuesday 23rd Jan. between\n1 and 2 p.m. to answer a simple, question-aire, (about which hand they use for games\netc.) or if this is not possible, to write to\n'The Lefthanded Survey' c/o Penny Williams, Felix, via the Union Rack, stating\nwhere and when they can be contacted.\nIT'S A GIRL Congratulations to Ken and Carole Weale\non the birth of a baby girl. The child weighed\n71b.2oz. at birth and all three are reported\nto be doing fine. Dr. Weale is the Union's Honorary Treasurer and Carole is a secretary in the Aeronautics Department.\nCHRISTMAS CONCERT Towards the end of last term the Imperial\nCollege Choir gave their annual Christmas\nConcert in Queen Alexandra's House. With\nDr. E.H. Brown conducting, the Choir sang\nwith great gusto and were obviously enjoying themselves as much as the audience. The\nChoir's salesmanship was not quite equal to\ntheir singing; there were several empty seats,\nwhich is unusual for this concert.\nExcerpts from Bach's Christmas Oratorio\nwere followed by a medley of carols. The performance was spoilt by a lack of balance in\nthe hastily improvised R.C.M. orchestra.\nHowever, the concert was well worth going\nto.\nThe choice of carols showed a welcome\nlack of hackneyed favourites. All the same,\nhowever, it might be better if the audience\nwere asked to sing carols which they are likely to know.\nI.N.G. CONGRATULATIONS Congratulations to Mines President John\nFairfield and Brenda who announced their\nenga game nt over the vacation.\nPhycology?\nFor the benefit of P.G.' s and those students\nwho actually come back early, and who\nwondered who or what the h11 the PHYCOLOGICAL SOCIETY was doing at I'.C. in\nthe week before the beginning of term; Stan,\nthe Union Porter explains that it is for the\nstudy of Algae (any the wiser?). Stan has a little anecdote about all this. Apparently some\ndear lady came in and asked him where the\nPhycological Society was meeting he, thinking she had an impediment in speech, pleaded\nignorance- When another delegate asked the\nsame question, Stan thought that perhaps\nthere was a society for these people with\nspeech impediments, and again pleaded ign or ance. But when a third person came in and\nalso asked for the Phycological Society, poor\nStan gave in, and after detailed investigations,\nfound out what it was really all about.\nCOIIINfi EVENTS\nNEXT FORTNIGHT FRIDAY19 th1.

    "content": "FELIX\nh tH M to ik td J to L Dear Sir,\nWhen will Mr. Mooney learn to make decent Yorkshire Pudding! Many other Yorkshiftmen must experience the same feeling\nof amused horror when they' see this insipid,\ndna emi c4ooking mass on their plates. The\n\u2022fir pt time I saw this so called \"Yorkshire\nPudding\", I mistook it for Chelsea bun and\nit was some months before I discovered my\nerror.\nThrough these columns I will make Mr.\nMooney a bona-fide offer. If he will provide\nme with eggs, milk, flour, salt, lard and cooking facilities, I will make him a REAL Yorkshire Pudding.\nOtherwise, the Yorkshiremen of I.C. must\nunite to form a \"Society for the Preservation\nof the true Yorkshire Pudding.\"\nYours sincerely,\nJ. PORTER, PHYSICS 3\nDear Sir,\nI.C. has been publicly disgraced, and in\nanticipation of retribution to be the Rector\nsome attempt should be made to find the\ncause of the incident, though not (necessarily)\nto find a scapegoat as well.\nAlmost all of I.C. must now be aware of\nthe facts, that:\na. More than 200 I.C. students were milling around outside \"The Marlborough\" and\nat a different time, outside University College.\nb. \"The number of dustbin lids\" to quote\nthe national press as I remember consisted\nof one dustbin which rolled into the road\nfor a few seconds.\nc. Uniformed and plain clothes Police did\nnot worry about who or how they arrested,\nand any arguments with them invariably led\nto a Black Maria.\nThese are the facts that led to 42 I.C. students, appearing in court, alt he ugh strictly these facts were not the real cause of the\nincident.\nThe real cause seemed to be that I.C. students, after a rousing swimming gala\n(probably the best attended evening in recent\nyears) were not able to continue an enjoyable evening in a festive mood in the U.L. U. bar. In fact once again the swimming gala\nhas coincided with a performance of Gilbert\nand Sullivan next door to the bar.\nSi Lyle said that \"true'to U. L.U.tra d it ion, either we don't sing or we leave the\nbuildings\". It would, I think be fairer to put\nit that \"true to I.C. tradition another clash\nhas occured with U.L. U.\". The responsibility for this must lie with\nthe IC. Union Committee or more accurately last year's committee who arranged the\ndate of the gala.\nIt is shameful that 42 students have to be\narrested before a thought arises of changing\nthe Gala date to avoid a clash.\nYours sincerely,\nA.S. CHALMERS( MET. 3. R.S. M.) Dear Sir,\nHaving seen the many advertisements for\nwhat I believe are termed \"Hops\" I resolved\nto attend one of these informal functions. I can only say that what I saw and heard caused\nme much astonishment.\nI expected to hear the time-honoured compliments that bespeak gallantry and chi l vary, such as \"Madam, if your dance-card is not\nalready full, would you do me the very great\nhonour of accompanying me in the next\nminuet?\"\nImagine my amusement when the words\n'O.K. chick, let's make wh h the feet, huh l\" fell upon my ears. Where all this will\nlead I dread to think, but my thoughts upon\nthe matter are expressed below.\nFIRST THOUGHTS ON ATTENDING ANI.C. HOP Oh, like crazy on the s nog bash\nLittle John gets moving big,\nRecoups pile-wise on the hop-cash,\nMakes that cool-eyed chicken dig;\nLecture-wise he lives in Dregsville,\nSofa-wavelengths he's the most,\nCuts way out and heads for Kegsville,\nFlies his bird from Coast-to-Coast.\n/ remain, sir\nXAVIUS HEPBURN (CULTURE III)\nTo Catch a Thief\nAlfred Hitchcock in \"To Catch a Thief\"\nhas produced a comedy thriller with more\ncomedy than thriller. Set in the Riviera it is\nconcei r?d with jewel robberies from the mil-lion aires ses who find it socially correct to\ngather there during the season. Cary Grant\nplays an American cat-burglar who reformed\nduring the war, whilst working with the re-sistance, and now lives in a luxurious villa\nin the Riviera. Jewel robberies have occured\nand he is suspected as the robber who has\nused his old methods. To clear himself he\nsets out to track down the real thief. In the\nprocess he encounters Grace Kellv who plays\nan heiress and provides the love interest. The\nplot is basically a chase with Hitchcock's strange sense of humour invading the course\nand with rather too many side tracks. This\nis certainly not one of Hitchcock's best films\nalthough it would be good on almost any\nother standard, for he has not grasped the\naudience with hj s usual tense atmosphere.\nOn the other hand it does contain sufficient\nhumour to be amusing, a certain amount if dramatic photography, especially in the final\nrooftop chase, and a murder. The acting is\nsmooth, capable and expensive. Some of the\nphotography of the Riviera is very good.\nOverall a satisfying evening's entertainment\nbut a little d is a pointing for Hitchcock.\nAJ.W. SWIMMING\nCLUB\nFacts they dared not print!\nThe important facts that the National Press\ndid not print are that Guilds easily won both\nthe Linstead Cup for swimming, the Forster\nCup for Water Polo, whilst Laurie Austin,\nthe Guilds President \"won\" the Pink Pot for\nthe Presidents' Race.\nThe biggest crowd ever in the UL U pool,\nover 400 until the collection was started, saw\nsome of the finest swimming and clowning\nfrom IC for many years. The cast included\nall the IC Swimming and Water Polo Club,\nICWA representatives, the College President plus Martin Stacey, the other College\nsporting club Captains and a collection of\neels representing the Zoology Department.\nThe fast times in the I CW A races is being\nslanderous ly attributed to the presence of\nthese RCS worms.\nThe success of the Gala was due to hard\nwere behind the scenes by the swimming\nclub members and the help of Brian Allison,\nthe UL U pool chief who operated the electronic timing device. The Swimming Club\nwould like to thank all supporters for their\nattendance and for their donations, amounting to \u00a35.15.0 to the Swimming Pool Fund\nfor Spastic Children.\nThe first match of this term resulted in a win for the IC First team over Ibis S.C taking the swimming match by 28 to 20 points\nand the water polo by 4 goals to 1.\nThis augers well for the success of the club\nin the future. This term's programme includes matches against Oxford, Cambridge.\nCardiff and Bristol Universities and the\nRM C, Sandhurst whilst three teams are entered in the UL league. To meet such heavy\nfixture commit tm ents says much for the enthusiasm of the club members.\nMIXED RUGGER\nPHYS. v. MATHS. At the end of last term a mixed rug ger match was played between the Physics and\nMaths. Department.\nThe women came out onto the pitch attired in full rug ger kit, looking much cleaner\nand smarter than their male counterparts in\nthe I.C. First XV and equally as effective.\nThe sport began when ICWA were initiated\ninto the secrets of packing (the forwards all\nbeing ICWArians) Having perfected this fine\nart, they then proceeded to deal as quickly\nwith the line outs, tackling and other fine\npoints of the game, the battle commenced,\nPhysics winning the toss and kicking off.\nPhysics showed their superiority in the\nscrum, having an excellent hooker and a very\neffective second row forward borrowed from\n'Guilds', but Maths, had their share of talent\nin an extremely good full back (male) and\na very good ICWArian tackier, they also had\nthe edge in the line outs.\nMaths, won 16-8, two tries and two converted tries to an excellent drop goal and a dubious penalty try which was converted. The\ngame was enjoyed by all, and a return match\nis to be arranged.\nIt is envisaged in the near future to form\nan ICWA rug ger team which will be a serious challenge to the B4th XV( Wanderers).\nC.B. p.w.

    "content": "FELIX\nBeware\nthe international hot ch pot ch by Felix ace reporter Crunnion Lineage\nA charge frequently levelled at the students\nof this College is that they do not take enough\ninterest in the international student move-men. I would like to answer this charge by\nshowing that the international student move-ment, and in fact most corporate student\nbodies, is far from being the l high-minded\ninstitution that our critics would have us believe and that IC is fortunate in being connected with their fiendish machinations.\nFirstly, it is obvious that the officials of\nthose organisations cannot be genuine stud-ents, for the amount of time that they spend\non international congresses and Weeks of\nSolidarity and Friendship precludes their obtaining any sort of degree or diploma from\nwhatever institutions they nominally attend\nThe question then suggests itself, who are the\nofficials of those national and international\nstudent organisations? It does not take much\nthought to realise that they can only be minions of, and in the pay of, subversive political groups. The International Union of Students, for example, of which more later, is\nuniversal lv accepted as being a communist\npropaganda group, concerned only with the\nsubversion of! those immature nations that\nhave only recently broken a wav from the maternal care of the British Empire. The International Student Conference, on the other\nhand, has recently shown itself to be a tool\nof American imperialists who are seek in e to\ndo for the Latin-American nations what\nBritain has done for Africa, though it must\nbe added, with nothing like the same success.\nI have on mv desk in front of me two sets\nof documents. One set is from the IUS. outlining the programme of the Eishth World\nYouth Festival, organised b v IUS ,and to be\nheld in Helsinki this v ear: the other is from\nan American organisation, detailing the plans\nfor the same event but giving a full account\nof the opposition of the Finnish Student\nmovement to the choice of Helsinki as its\nvenue. The Finnish students in fact are going\nto have nothing to do with so-called World\nYouth Festival, although they are supposed\nto be the hosts! This ridiculous state of affairs\nis typical of the international student move-ment.\nThere is only one solution to the problem\nof these student movements. That is for Imperial College to allow IUS, ISC and all the\nrest of the international hot ch pot ch to be\naffiliated to the IC union. The World festival\nthe Solidarity Campaigns and all other i functions can then be held here, where the\ndelegates will have the opportunity of playing cricket and rugby and drinking good English beer, which will do them far more\nthan the \"meet the workers\" trips which\nform so large a part of their present cong-gres ses. The large influx of these aliens\nshould also work wonders with our balance\nof payments deficit. Under our influence\nthese misguided people will soon adopt a truly British attitude in the spirit of our Empire-building forefathers.\nNow is the time for Imperial College to\nmake this truly magna mini o us gesture; only\nwe can do this. Let us pledge ourselves to\nthe creation of a Greater Imperial College\nUnion, that will be known and respected\nthroughout the world, even, may we hope,\nas the British Empire is respected. And if\nthese rude foreigners throw our offer back\nin our faces, let us go it alone. We can do\nwithout them in any case. Remember always\nLord Beaverbrook's shining example, so\nsplendidly recorded in the pages of the Daily\nExpress. Britain owes nothing to anybody;\na United States of Europe, the United Nations, we can dispense with them all. So the\nGreater Imperial College Union will lead\nthe worlds' students, either with their backing or without it.\nCAREERS AT BRISTOL SIDDELEY\nFOR UNIVERSITY GRADUATES\nBristol Siddeley needs graduates to join a large team\nof Engineers, Scientists and Technologists engaged in\nproducing a wide range of power units and allied\nequipment.\nTHE COMPANY\nScope and interest is assured as there is virtually no\nfield of engineering progress in which this Company is\nnot concerned\u2014modernising the railways, building\nnew marine craft, supersonic aircraft, turbo-generators,\netc. We are a large company employing over 25,000\npeople, and our stability lies in our diversification, from\na wide range of aero engines, rocket motors and ram-jets, to diesel engines and gas turbines for marine and\nindustrial uses. The most up-to-date research, development and production facilities are employed by the\nCompany to carry out its vast programme of work.\nSo we have the equipment, the orders and a progressive future\u2014now we need more qualified men.\nTHE OPPORTUNITIES\nThere are many and varied opportunities for graduates\nat Bristol Siddeley and careers are offered in Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Chemistry, Technical Engineering, Production Engineering, Electronics, Metallurgy, and allied divisions. Vacancies exist at Bristol\nwhere aero engines are manufactured and at Coventry\nwhere the Company's marine and industrial division is\nbased. For many of the vacancies the graduate is encouraged to undertake a post-graduate training course,\nwhich will also enable him to qualify for membership\nof institutions, for example, Institution of Mechanical\nEngineers. In addition, there is a comparable number\nof opportunities for direct employment with training\ntaking place on the job.\nSALARY\nSalaries will be over \u00a31,000 per annum at 25 years of\nage for top class graduates while senior posts, which\nare normally filled from within the Company, command salaries of \u00a32,000 upwards.\nBristol Siddeley representatives will be conducting\ninterviews at the College on Wednesday, 14th March.\nGraduates interested in obtaining further details of the\nopportunities offered should contact the Appointments Board for details of the visit.

    "content": "- 4\nFELIX\nby COL CUT T EditauaE Comment\nWhile the recent UL U Swimming Gala held\nat UL U and its aftermath do not quite amount to a public disgrace as one of our correspondents suggests, it has certainly brought\nsome unwelcome publicity to the College and\nto one or two students personally. As for\nthe conduct oL the police, it should have been\nobvious that this was an occupational hazard of our conduct. While it was a pity that\nthe arrested .allowed themselves to be persuaded to plead Guilty, rather than deploring the conduct of the Law we would be better employed organising a fund to reimburse\nthe fines. The 42 convicted were scapegoat'\nfor all who were present after all.\nAnother l aspect of the episode that has\nnot received so much attention is that it will\nlead to an even greater antipathy between IC\nand UL U. Although the UL U executive seem\nto \"be taking a reasonable attitude towards\nthe incident, the UL U Warden, Mr. Fenn,\nhas presented the Union with a set of conditions which must be complied with if next\nv ear's Gala is to be held at the UL U Pool.\nThe conditions are such that the Swimming\nClub and the IC Executives are considering\ngoing elsewhere next year, and IC will therefor be severing yet another connection with\nUL U. Surely the Executive can get the Warden to relax his conditions so that the third\nlargest college in the University can use the\nUniversity Union facilities.\nDiscerning observers will not have failed to\nnotice that a disturbing state of affairs has\nslowly built up in the Union Executive. No\nless than three of the five members are getting married in the fairly near future. The\nquestion suggests itself, what has happened\nto lower the resistance of these three young\nmen, will it spread to the rest of IC, and\nwhat can we do to counteract it. Clearly the\ntwo sur vivo its Messrs. Stacev and McPherson, are in an extremely dangerous position\nand should be put into confinement at once,\nwhile the nature of the germ or virus is in-vest i gated. The fact that this occured in the\nNew Hostel raises grave doubts about the\ncontinued presence of the ladies on the Third\nFloor. No one wants to see the New Hostel\ndecimated by marriage and strong action is\ncalled for.\nAt the last meet of the Felix Board, it was\ndecided to raise the charge for Small Ads.\nfrom 3d. per line to 6d. per line. The increase\nwill become effective from (and including)\nthe issue of February 2nd. DUNCAN DOUGLASS We regret to report the death of Duncan\nDouglass, second year Mechanical student at\nthis College, who collapsed and died on\nThursday, January 4th. Duncan, whose home\nwas in Blackpool, was the Publicity Manager for last year's Carnival and was the\nBusiness Manager on this year's Carnival\nCommittee- He was a member of the Square\nDancing Club and contributed occasionally\nto this newspaper. To his relatives and friends\nFelix and the Union extend their deepest\nsympathies.\nIII am convinced! For years now I have\nbeen entering into, and listening to discussions as to whether we are just getting older\nor IC students are becoming more juvenile.\nI remember having a very long discussion\nwith Pewker last year to decide if a custard-pie fight at Morphy Day was a good idea.\nWe thought that it would be better to try\nto create some general interest, any interest,\nin Morphy Day, and this was one way of\ndoing it; although we felt that this idea would\nno doubt stir a lot of feeling from what we\ndescribed at the time as the more mature\nelement. All we got was a feeble little bleat\nfrom Phoenix, and the custard-pie episode is\nnow becoming an established part of Morphy\nDay. But these first weeks of the New Year\nhave finally convinced me. The Union now\npossesses a group of students who delight in\nwriting on lavatory walls, and you cannot\nget any more juvenile than that.\nThe Swimming Gala was quite eventful.\nPity Laurie gave his bowler to someone else.\nIt was rather funny waiting in the Union\nBar hearing the latest numbers of arrests as\nthe boys made their way back, especially as\nthe first question was usually \"Has McPherson been arrested?\" Wonder why there were\nso many long faces. Thinking of the Executive, is McPherson to be the odd man out?\nLyle, Fairfield and Austin are heading for\nthe altar at considerable pace, there really\nmust be something in this marriage business.\nI was very glad to see Ken Weale come\nthrough his ordeal reasonably unscathed. We\nextend very many congratulations and best\nwishes to Carole, Ken and the baby.\nThe last Council Meeting was rather am-using, I remember writing something in the\nNEW YEAR'S HONOURS The Observer Award for Relevance.\n\u2014 Sir Patrick Linstead\nThe Woman's Own NappieWashing Machine\nfor Waiting.\n\u2014 Dr. K.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 170\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 19TH1962 PRICE 4D. DSIR Grants Increase\nANOTHER VICTIM OF THE\" PAY PAUSE\" Rumours have been circulating for some\ntime now to the effect that there is to be an\nincrease in the maintenance allowances paid\nby the DSIR to graduates studying for a higher degree. Whether this will come to anything for a long time is doubtful. The Government's policy, as witness the ridiculous\ngambit of the \"pay pause\", is to be as mean\nas possible with its money, whatever the long-term effects of this may be on the country\nand its economy. Although we are short of\nschool-teachers, in some areas desperately so,\nthe Government cuts their pay increase and\nthe Minister of Education is reduced to begging mothers to return to teaching. In these\ncircumstances arguing that \u00a3400 a year is a pitiful wage for a graduate aged up to\n25, or that the country will need many more\nscientists with higher degrees in the long run,\nis unlikely to cut any ice.\nAt present the difference in remunerating between industry and study for a higher degree\nis very marked and is discouraging many\ngraduates from staying ion. Even allowing\nfor tax and holidays \u00a3400 a year at college\ndoes not stand much chance against \u00a3750 in\nindustry. The casual labourer and the graduates staying on get \u00a38 per week and the\ngraduate in his first year in industry gets \u00a311\nto \u00a313. Third year students should bear this\nin mind when deciding what they are going\nto do next year. And if you do reject the idea\nof staying on for financial reasons, why not\nwrite to the DSIR and tell them so? Other\nways in which we can get the Government\nto move itself is by writing to our M.P.s, perhaps suggesting that they asked a question\non the subject. The House might be interested to know, for example, when the present\nfigure of \u00a3400 was fixed and how much the\ncost of living has gone up since then; some\nGovernment departments may also be able\nto compare the average pay for an honours\ngraduate in industry with the average allowance for graduates still studying. \u00a3400 is the\nLondon allowance only; students at provincial Universities get only \u00a3340.\nUnless we do something of this nature the\nonly thing we can look forward to from the\npresent Government will be the 2d. off the\nprice of beer that will precede the General\nElection by a month or so.\nDec 8th \u2014 The Facts\nThe Swimming Gala at the UL U Pool was\nthe best-attended for several years and the\nresult was a win for Guilds with Mines second and RCS third. After the Gala a large\nnumber of IC students packed out the UL U Bar, next door to which is the Concert Hall.\nThe University Gilbert and Sullivan Society\nwere producing Princess Ida there that evening and we were therefore asked not to sing\nuntil the performance was over. Despite repeated requests not to start singing from UL U officials and some IC students a large proportion of those in the Bar were soon in full\nsong and eventually the Bar was closed.\nThe disgruntled singers moved on to the\nMarlborough, the nearest pub., and packed\nthat out, those who could not get in causing\na mild disturbance outside meanwhile. Traffic was held up for a short while and one\nor two dustbins were rolled across the road,\nthough these were picked up later by IC\nstudents. Inside the Marlborough the atmosphere was rowdy, but no damage to furniture etc., was evident.\nAfter two police cars had stopped outside\nthe pub for a short while the police arrived\nin force, both uniformed and plain clothes.\nSeveral entered and an inspector announced\nthat the landlord had asked for the pub to\nbe cleared: the constables .started pushing\neveryone out without any ceremony, though\nsome students were allowed to finish their\ndrinks. The police appeared to be arresting\nstudents quite arbitrarily and some at one\nstage were picking up every third one leaving the pub. Students were also arrested outside and in Tottenham Court Road.\nA total of 42 students were finally arrested\nand appeared before Clerkenwell Magistrates\nnext morning. AH were persuaded by a somewhat dubious argue ment on the police's part\nto plead guilty. All were fined \u00a32 for Insulting Behaviour and two students got an extra\n\u00a32 for Obstructing the Police. The Magistrate\ngave a short lecture of the sort that we have\ncome to expect, and the Press reported the\noccasional fully.\nIAESTE\nConference\nThe 15th Annual Conference of the International Association for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience was held\nthis year at Imperial College from January\n7th to the 11th. President of the Union, Si\nLyle, and another members of the council\nwere hosts in the Union on the 7th at the\nopening reception for the delegates and observers from various countries participating\nin I. A. ES.T.E. The conference was officially\nopened on Monday by the Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead, who is the President of\nI A ESTE( U.K.). Sir Patrick welcomed the\ndelegates and observers to the College and\nexplained how pleased the College was to\nhave the annual conference here again. MrE. LeO. Herbert, who was acting as chairman of the opening session, announced that\nthe conference had appointed the Rector\nPresident of the Conference. He then introduced the General Secretary of IAESTE, Mr.\nR.A. Beijer of Sweden. Mr. Beijer gave a brief resume of the association's activities\nsince its founding 15 years ago here at Imperial College, and pointed out that since\nthat time, the association has exchanged approximately 60,000 students. Following the\nopening session the conference got underway\nwith Prof. W.D. Wright, professor of Technical Optics, Chairman of the I A ESTE( UK)\nExecutve Committee in the chair.\nOn Monday evening the observers and delegates were the guests of Sir Patrick and\nLady Linstead at a dinner held in Ayrton\nHall. On Tuesday evening the Lord Mayor\nof London and the Ladv Mavoress received\nthe conference delegates at the Mansion\nHouse. On Wednesdav evening the Director\nGeneral of the British Council. Sir Paul\nSinker, was host at a reception held at the\nBritish Council.\nThe conference was officially ended on \u2022\nThursday with the announcement that Dr\nK. Wyneken of Germany had been elected\nGeneral Secretary and that two more countries had been admitted, making a total of\n31 countries taking part in the Association.\nDelegates from 23 of these countries were\npresent at the conference.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the delegates and\nobservers went on a bus tour of London,\nguided by a Scotsman, Findlay McPherson.\nFollowing the bus tour, some of the delegates\nand observers joined the Union Executive for\nan informal evening of discussion.\nThe conference, having completed nearly\nall the items of discussion, was deemed a success and much credit must be given to its\nChairman, Professor Wright and to one of\nits chief organisers, Mr. Nefby, for their\ntasks well done.\n\n"

However, after this introduction\nto Elizabeth no further search for candidates\nneed be made.\nElizabeth is a third year chemist, whose\nobvious charm, selfless nature has been unspoilt by the transformation from a girls'\nhigh school to the rig ours of I.C. She is a pretty petite young lady with a lively sense\nof humour and a modest, happy disposition.\nWhilst at I.C she has made many friends\nfrom those in Beit Hall upwards. In addition to an active social life Elizabeth has supported on the hockey pitch not only I. C.W. A. but also the I.C. Mixed XI. This latter experience no doubt stood her in good stead\nfor the I.C. W.S.C. v. Soccer Club \"hockey\"\nmatch last year in which Elizabeth's practised pose of demure innocence swayed many\ndecisions of the un m pires. As the centre of attraction in the Carnival procession Elizabeth's essential femininity and beautiful\nsmile will do much to increase contributions\nto the \"cause\".\nIf there is any doubt in your minds as to\nher suitability and indeed desirability this\nwould be readily dispelled by a meeting with\nElizabeth during which we have no doubt\nthat her smartness, grace and beauty will\nimpress upon you the fact that she she is\nthe ideal choice for Carnival Queen.\nJ.A.&R.

    "content": "- 8 \u2014 FELIX\nSPORT RUGBY\nThe last week of last term gave a bright\nfinish to the first half of the season with\nnine of the ten game ls resulting in wins for\nI.C. including the 1st XV' s victory over\nReading University by 12 pts. to 3, the eight\nsuccessive victory for the B3's, and the B5's255 win over Hermits making them the second unbeaten side this season.\nLast Saturday saw the start of the second\nhalf of the season and with only three victories out of nine games, it would appear\nto be a catastrophic beginning. However, a closer look at the results shows that most\nof \"the games were in fact closely fought out\nin our annual battle with one of the few\nclubs in London which can regularly claim\nto field more sides that IC., namely ESHER,\non Saturday fielded fourteen sides.\nThe 1st XV has a number of hard fixtures\nto contend with in the next few weeks, starting with last year'sU.A. U. champions\nAberystwyth University at Harlington on the\nmorning, Jan. 20th, the day of the England v. Wales international. The next day it is hoped\nthat the London Hospital Cup side will play\nan I.C. Cup side, in preparation for the second round of the University Cup, which this\nyear is against C.E.M. away. CE.M. once\nmore playing M. Weston, the English centre.\nSupporters for all these games would be very\nwelcome.\nThe arrangements for the Easter tour of\nGermany are well underway and full details should be announced soon.\nTEAM RECORDS up to and including Jan. 13th.1 st XV18891170188 Ex. 1st92605598 A.84405391 Ex. A91806998B1971118445 B2862012951B3990025412B493606376B5980117137 Last term was one of mixed fortune for\nthe Hockey Club. On the bright side was the\nexcellent undefeated run of 10 matches by\nthe 1st XI, the good record throughout the\nterm of the 2nd XI and the weather, which\nallowed all but two of the fixtures to be\nplayed. However, the 1st XI did not maintain\ntheir successful run, and did not win a single\nmatch in the second half of the term.\nThe second round cup match against\nQ.M. C. was played on a rain soaked pitch\nwhich soon resembled a tank testing range\nin mid r winter. After an early goal by Phillips\nI.C. slumped and were 2-1 down at half time.\nClarke equalise d in the second half when I.C. did most of the attacking, but by the end\nboth sides were fighting the same foe \u2014 mud,\nCROSS COUNTRY With the University again taking the cream\nof our runners, the three cornered match\nagainst Ranelagh Harriers and Birmingham\nUniversity held at Petersham resulted in us\nbeing rather defeated.\n1. Birmingham A. \u2014 30\n2. Ranelagh H. \u2014 62\n3. I.C \u2014 112\n4. Birmingham B. \u2014 119\nIt was somewhat unfortunate that this\nparticular match, that would have put our\nfull strength team to the test should have again been the subject of this continually con-travers i al matter. However, we were to show\nour true potentialities for the following\nWednesday 6th December in the 4 x3.2 miles\nBorough Road Relay held at Osterley, John\nCleator and Ted Wilkins both managed to\nget within 1 second of the course record but\ndespite the almost equally commendable performance of John Collins and Dave Hammonds, Reading University just managed to\npull it off.\n1. Reading U. \u2014 69 mins 5 sees\n2. I.C \u2014 69 mins 11 sees\n3. Birmingham U. \u2014 69 mins 30 sees\nOn Saturday 9th December the University\nof London Championships took place. The\ncourse, of 6 miles over sandy heath, proved,\nas expected, to be extremely fast. The individual title was won by Farrington of U.C.(27.59). Ted Wilkins was only 4 seconds behind (28.03) with John Cleator just behind\nin third place (28.09). John Collins running\nto his usual form was 5th, and Dave Hammonds and Jeff Greenleaf following up at\n14th and 15th made sure of I.C. retaining the\nteam championship for the sixth successive\ntime with 39 points to U.C.' s62 and 147 of\nSt. Barts- I.C. II led in by a fast improving\nsturdy little fresher from New Zealand P. Moss (29th) did well to come in 6th. This race also incorporated the I.C. intercollegiate race which was won convincingly\nby R.C.S. Guild's were second, this result\ncounts towards the sports day results.\nWith much fewer University commitments\nthis term it is hoped that the club will again\nshow the form and promise of which it has\nthe capabilities.\nand the match ended in a draw. The replay\nwill take place on Jan. 31st at Harlington.\nThe 1st XI have lost both matches played\nths term. A much weakened side lost the\nfirst match with U.C, the first defeat in the\nhands of a college side. In the second match\nagainst Old Dunstabliarte the team played\nwell until mid-way through the second half.\nHowever, they went to pieces and conceded\nthree goals.\nTh team records to date are:\nP WDL FA1st X I1675424192n d XI952228153 rd XI712410214 th XI6114424 SOCCER\nOn the whole, the results of last term were\ndisappointing. The 1st,2 nd and 3rd XI's were well-placed in their respective divisions\nof the U.L league and with luck we should\nbe champions of at least two of them. However, the results of the lower teams, with the\nexception of Ex. 7th, leaves much to be de-sired, although the 4th XI who without a win before Christmas beat St. Clement Danes\nG.S.3 rd XI,100 last Saturday, with Bennett scaring 3 and Keg 5. This followed 3-3\ndraw with the Institute of Education the previous Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, 10th Jan., failure by St.\nMary's, Twickenham, to turn up at Harlington meant that the 1st,2 nd and 5th XI's were\nwithout opposition, but a1s tv.2 nd game\nproved to be an interesting one, the 1st XI winning 7-2. John Preece scored 4 goals. A cancellation on Saturday meant that the 1st XI will now play the second round of the\nU.L. cup on Wednesday, without having had\na competitive game since before Christmas.\nThe Ex. 7th, considerably strengthened by\nthe promotion of higher team players, beat\nPolitechnic 5-1, Alan Logan scoring 3+\ngoals, while the 6th and 7th XI's lost 8-3\nand 9-1 respectively to Chelsea III and\nThomas Cook.\nOn Wednesday, the 1st three teams are\nengaged in University Cup ties and we are\nfairly confident of success.\n1st XIv.

The most obvious example is Rugger in which I.C. has\nwon the UL cup for 8 of the last 10 years,\nand has had 5 to 6 players on the UL team\nthis year. For one game last year there were\n8 IC players. In football we've won the ^up\nflor the last 3 years, and 4 members pla, re-gular il v for the 1st XI. This year our hockey\nteam is second to none and stands well in\nthe K.O. championships, while the crosscountry club leads the rest of the University.\nThe Swimming Club has just won the UL champs, and last year the Boat Club beat\nthe UL1 st VIII on more than one occasion.\nSTOP PRESS\nU.L.
