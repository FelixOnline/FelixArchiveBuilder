You are\na pilot on the side of the League of\nFree Worlds waging a guerrilla war\nagainst the Imperialist Navy. At\nyour disposal are various different\ntypes of fighter craft for a multitude\nof different missions. There are\nOVERBOARD!\nPsygnosis \u2022\u2022\u2022v2 Avast there me har ties! Shiver me\ntimbers, keel haul the mainsail!\nErm... no, I 've run out of Pirate say-in gs. Anyway, I haven't gone mad I 've been playing Overboard, a highly enjoyable and silly adventure\ninto the realm of arcade piracy.\nThe player controls a dinky little\nseveral different endings to Colony\nWars, several different ways of\nending the tyranny of the Czar and\nhis Imperialist Navy. Each ending\ndepends on the outcome of each\nof your missions, fail all your missions and the League is doomed, but in each case the story will\nalways have a beginning and an\nend.\nAfter a couple of missions the\ngame cuts away to the all-too-familiar computer generated\nmovie, which has the feel of\nBabylon 5 and Star Wars (James\nEarl Jones does his usual evangelistic bellowing for the narration in\neach cut-scene).\nThe gameplay is exhilarating,\nthose of you who have played Xwing or Tie Fighter will enjoy the\ndog-fights and will be relieved that\nthere aren't101 different controls\nto fly your fighter craft. Colony\nWars has moved away from those\nusual games set in space where the\nblack background colour usually\ndominates. Here huge frigates and\nother space war horses often fill\npirate ship, complete with cannons\nand sails, and must attempt to traverse the sixteen levels of choppy\nseas.\nEach level is enormous, and can\neasily take half an hour to complete. The basic idea is to collect all\nof the parts of the map of level,\nfound in green floating bottles.\nAlong the way are treasure chests\nand weapons to be gained. Some\nof the additional weapons are distinctly un-pirate y, especially the\nflamethrower and ground-to-air\nmissiles.\nStanding in the budding pirates'\nway are rival ships, sea monsters,\ngun emplacement, flame-throwing\ntowers and even massive spinning\nsaw blades( somewhat reminiscent\nof Mario or Sonic). However, the\nplayer rarely feels totally lost or\nhard done by, and the game certainly kept me coming back for\nWhat is it?\nIts the Microsoft SideWinder\nForce Feedback Pro.\nWhat does it do?\nIt's a PC joystick that has more\nbuttons than any sane person\nwould require.\nWhat's so special about it?\nThis little beat y comes with its\nown processor and motors to\nprovide 'force feedback'. If\nyou've ever played Sega Rally in\nthe arcade, you will be used to\nthe screen, while the odd asteroid\nflies by - space is not a black void\nin this game. There are several different types of craft with different\nabilities and weaponry, disabling a craft with an EMP weapon will\nmake it a sitting duck and easier to\nshoot down while anti-shield\nweapons can wear down your ene-mies' defenses faster than your\nnormal lasers.\nHowever the lasting appeal of\nColony Wars is limited,- as it is possible to reach one ending within a single sitting, while repeated playing is only required to discover the\ndifferent endings to the saga. This\nis a well polished game with all the\ntrimmings, animated sequences narrated by Darth Vader himself,\nanalogue joy pad compatibility and\nexcellent head-to-head dog fights.\nAnother game to get your arthritic\nfingers on.\nMagpie\nFormat: Playstation &. PC\nCheck out the website at:\nhttp://www.colony wars. com\nmore.\nThe whole game has a wonderfully engaging atmosphere, from\nthe animation of the boats and sea\ncreatures to the jaunty nautical\ntheme tune that you'll be humming for days afterwards.\nThe game is eventually let\ndown by its lack of variety in level\ndesign, and the difficulty in defeating some of the end-of-level\nbosses. A battle mode is included,\nwhich allows up to five captains to\ncompete, but this requires a very\nlarge TV (or keen eyesight) as each\nship is very small.\nOverboard! is certainly a welcome addition to any puzzle-loving\ngamer's collection, but those\nrequiring more a more cerebral\nchallenge should give it a wide\nberth (groan).\nMark\nFormat: Playstation &.

He said that carrots\ndo not make very good friends...\"\ni1 \u2022 Jonathan Trout met \"Comedy's Poet Laureate\" at the Bloomsbury Theatre before the final show in his highly popular national tour. \u2022\nHe brought Will Dugdale along to take the pictures and a handful of chocolate eggs for reasons which will become obvious j jT he deserted, expectant theatre has a strangely charged\nfeel to it as I perch on the\nstage aside John Hegley. Casually\ndressed in an open necked,\nexpensive looking shirt and cream\njeans, his timid, innocent public\npersona seemingly belied by his\ndarting eyes and unshaven chin. I hand him a coffee, the five\nsachets of sugar inspired partly by\nknowing, winky irony, partly by\ngushing hero worship but mostly\nbecause he might have been serious in naming his first book \"Five\nSugars Please\". Typically, as such\nsituations often turn out, he used\nnone. Before we started I wondered if it would be possible to\nask him to think of a poem around the theme \"Felix\".\nHEGLEY: How much?\nTROUT: just a couple of lines.\nHEGLEY: I meant how much I would get paid.\nTROUT: I 'll give you a Creme Egg\nfor it.\nI duly hand over a Creme Egg. He seems surprised, and grateful.\nHEGLEY: Yeah? Oh, all right.\nCheers mate. That's even before\nyou've heard it!\nTROUT: You get an extra one if\nit's decent. Are your poems any\ngood? Do you think so?\nHEGLEY: Erm... [laughs] I 've got\nto say, that was a very good opening question... I think that\nsome of them are. Some of them\nare even poems. Not many.\nTROUT: Why do you think people\nlike you so much? Why do you think can you fill a place like this?\nHEGLEY: Well, they are accessible,\nand people generally do like poet-ry, I think there is poetry in lan-gu age; there are lots of phrases in\nlanguage which are poetry; a lick\nof paint, legs eleven, click e ty click, people like it.\nTROUT: When did you realise that\nyou were destined for greatness,\nwho was the first person to say\n\"you're really good, you could do something with this?\"\nHEGLEY: John Peel. When we did\na Peel Session, '83, I remember\nthat was the turning point, really,\nwhen he said he liked one of our\nsongs on the radio.\nI had watched his show on the\nprevious Wednesday, in which he\nhad described his life story previous to his brush with fame. I questioned as to whether comic\npoetry had been a conscious\ncareer choice:\n\"It wasn't really, no, it drifted, 'cos\nI started out as a singer, and then\nstarted doing some of the words\nwithout the music, so it sort of\ndrifted towards that.\"\nMark Radcliffe's evening show on\nRadio One was instrumental in\nHegley's recent resurgence; I told\nhim that in a recent interview\n[Felix 1093] Radcliffe had pronounced Hegley as one of his\nthree favourite guests, along with\nfilm buff Mark Kermode and\ntransatlantic media chick Katie\nPuckrick. He was at first shocked,\nand then genuinely moved. HEGLEY: I didn't know that...\nThat's fucking great... oh, that is,\nI'm so, oh that's really fantastic...\nDid he really say that? Wow...[ Recovering] Did he mention Nigel\nat all?\nTROUT: No, he didn't mention\nNigel [Hegley's silent, miserable\nsidekick and guitarist], rude\nman... what do you think that\nexposure did for you career?\nObviously, you' d done that earlier\nstuff with Peel, but that brought\nyou into the consciousness of a whole new set of people.\nHEGLEY: Yeah, it's been very\ngood, actually, in terms of opening it out, bringing in a younger\naudience, because I was a bit\nbogged down with The Guardian;\n1 enjoyed working with The\nGuardian and younger people do\nread that but it's not hip, not hap-pen ing, is it, in that way, So it\nreally brought in a younger audi-en ce, which is fantastic.\nFrom this good position, I stupidly\nasked him how his doggie was...\nHEGLEY: Well, he's all right. He's in a plastic bag, a plastic bin liner,\nwith two others.\n[There is an embarrassed pause\nas I take my foot from my mouth]\nThat'll teach you...[ laughs]\nGently diverting the subject (did\nhe notice? I don't think so...), I ask who his favourite poet is.\nHEGLEY: There are a few good people about, but, what do you\nmean, across the board? If I had\nto choose one person's words to\ntake to a desert island, Elvis\nCostello.\nTROUT: Were you influenced at\nall by Ivor Cutler [Glaswegian surrealist poet/singer/playwright]\nHEGLEY: Ivor Costello, Elvis\nCutler, erm, [mouthful of Creme\nEgg] a little I think, yes, not being\nafraid to be absurd.\nStaying on the poetry theme, I asked how he dared rhyme \"to b bogan\" with \"maho g 'un\" [see box].\nHe laughed, then, struggling with\nhis egg, ignored the question. \"I'm trying to eat this chocolate egg\nwithout getting my thumb on the\nbit I'm eating... [then, bizarrely]\n...1 was in such a rush to get out\nof the house I didn't get to wipe\nmy arse, it's true...\". This was surprisingly hysterical, the three of us\nspontaneously falling about.\nWhether it was the delivery or just\nthe full horror of the statement I know not. After settling down I continue by asking if, as many a spite-filled poem might suggest,\nhe really hates his brother-in-law\nHEGLEY: No, not really. But he's not entirely fictional...\nTROUT: How much poetry is left\nin you, do you think?\nHEGLEY: Well the nice thing to\nthink is that the vessel refills; at\nthe moment I hope that there is\nabout one hour and forty minutes\nworth...\nTROUT: Were you bullied at\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 6 February 1998\nNews in Brief...\nNUS to Strike\nALOK JHA\nThe NUS announced last week\nthat its plans for a shutdown of\nFurther and Higher Education\ncentres across the country has\nbeen overwhelmingly supported\nby a national ballot.\nOn4 March, over 130 universities and colleges will close down. Student unions will be the centre of\nthe campaign on the day, with over\ntwo million students taking part.\nSupport will also come from other\nteaching and campus trade unions.\nThe day of protest follows what the\nNUS call a \"carefully planned battle\nof attack against the Government's plans to introduce fees\" which has,\nso far, included a day of protest\nlast November, a Week of Action in\nDecember, and a series of lobbies\non parliament.\nThe NUS claim that students\nand their parents contribute\nenough to Higher Education, and\nthat business and industry should\nnow be making a more 'formal'\ncontribution. It is hoped that the\nactions of the NUS will force a rethinking of the Teaching and Higher\nEducation Bill, which proposes the\nidea of tuition fees and is currently\nbeing passed through the House of\nLords.\nDouglas Trainer, NUS pre si dent, said that, \"this is a fight we\ncan win and we will defeat the\nGovernment. The national shut-down will show our anger. Fees\nare killing access to Higher\nEducation, they will destroy our\nuniversities and colleges just as\nthey destroy would-be students'\ndreams of higher education.\"\nGovernment figures released\nlast December revealed a drop of\n2 0 , 0 0 0 in the number of applications to universities, showing the\nconcern that many school leave rs are feeling at the idea of having to\npay for their higher education.\nMany universities are considering\nvarious measures that will allow\nstudents to pay less, such as beginning the courses in spring or reducing the total course length.\nWarning: Speakers\nUnsound\nTONY OFOR1\nOn Thursday of last week a resident of Bernard Sunley Hall was\nmugged. While on his way to col-leg e, the student was stopped on\nQueen's Gate by two men who pulled up in a white van. The driver\nasked the student whether he\nwanted to buy some cheap hi-fi\nspeakers. The student declined,\nbut the man persisted, so the student explained that he had to go\nbecause he was late for college.\nThe man offered him a lift and the\nstudent agreed, and got into the\nback of the van. Once inside the\ndriver's accomplice, who had been\nquiet until now, told the student to\nhand over his money. Due to the\nman's threatening behaviour the\nstudent obliged, but the ordeal did\nnot end there. After discovering\nwhich bank the student patronised,\nthe driver took him to a branch and\nforced him to withdraw \u00a3 4 0 from a cash dispensing machine. The student was then freed.\nThis was one success in a long\nline of attempts to con IC students\nby a group claiming to be delivery\nmen. One hall warden described it\nas \"a premeditated and organised\nscam\". Other students have also\nbeen accosted, and some have\neven purchased the speakers, only\nlater to find that they are extremely\npoor quality.\nThe scale of this fraudulent\noperation is not known for certain,\nbut it would seem that more than\none partnership is operating in the\nSouth Kensington area. The delivery men target students and tend\nto use various excuses to explain\nhow they got hold of the merchandise. The audio name on the side\nof the vehicle, along with the delivery registration form they often\nbrandish, serve to increase the\napparent authenticity of their con.\nCollege security are aware of the\nsituation and the police have been\ninformed.\nFEES REPRIEVE\nThe new university tuition fees\nintroduced by the government\nlast year have once again been\nwatered down. In an attempt to\nease the current higher education\nfunding crisis, all new students are\nbeing asked to contribute \u00a3 1000 a year towards their course costs.\nHowever, in the summer, the\nDepartment of Education agreed\nto make the charge means-test-ed, exempting students from poorer families from the charge.\nNow, students are being offered\nan amnesty period, and will not\nhave to pay until January 1999.\nDiana Warwick, Chief Executive of\nthe Committee of Chancellors and\nVice Chancellors (CVCP) who made the decision explained that\n\"Students will be invoiced when they arrive at university, and we expect most to pay immediately.\nBut those students who experience real difficulty in meeting the\nfull amount straight away will now\nhave more time to pay.\nBARTS SAVED\nSt Bartholemew's hospital was\ngranted a reprieve from the threat\nof closure on Tuesday, when the\ngovernment accepted the recommendations of an independent\nreview of London' s hospitals.\nBart's will continue as a specialist\ncentre for cancer and heart conditions, but will loose its A E role,\nas will Guy's. Speaking to the\nCommons, Frank Dobson, the\nHealth Sectretary, said \"We will\nnot countenance the closure of\nthat great hospital which has\nserved the people of London for\n875 years.\"\nThe closure of Bart's was first\nproposed in 1992 by the\nTomlinson report, and the hospital was due to close by 2001, with\nservices transferred to the Royal\nLondon.\nMeanwhile, the merger of\nHammersmith( home of the\nRPM S) and Charring Cross\nHospitals is to be accelerated, and\nis to include the transfer of Queen\nCharlotte's to the Hammersmith\nsite. Indeed, the report marks\nHammersmith out to be developed into an international centre\nof excellence, which therefore\nstands to benefit heavily from the\nextra \u00a3 1 4 0 million promised for\nthe NHS in the capital.\nPI CONSUMES\nThe student newspaper at\nUniversity College London, Pi, has\nmerged with its smaller brother\nThe Week. Pi had been losing revenue in recent years and was\nforced to rely heavily on UCL Union for support. In order to\nsave funds, it has merged with the\nunion's 'what'son' newspaper.\nThe name has been retained, and\nthe paper is now being published\nweekly.\nElection Update\nNEWS TEAM\nPapers for Sabbatical elections\ncome down today. Anyone wishing to run for a position must be\nsigned up, along with a proposer\nand twenty second ers, by 6 pm this evening. As Felix went to\npress, seven candidates had\nsigned up. David Hellard and Jon\nLambert are running for ICU\nPresident; both have been proposed and are fully seconded. There are three candidates for\nDeputy President (Clubs and Societies); Simon Cooper, Ben\nJanes and Adam Cherrington. At\nthe time of writing none of them\nhad twenty second ers, and Adam Cherrington has yet to find a pro-poser. Felix Editor is being contested by two candidates, Alok Jha\nand Ed Sexton, both of whom are\nproposed and fully seconded. Niall Darwin has signed up for\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices), but has yet to find his\nsecond ers. In a change from the dates\nprinted in last week's Felix,\nHustings are to be held on\nMonday16( ICU), Tuesday 17\n(Charing Cross) and Wednesday\n18 (St. Mary's) February. Voting is\nin all departments on Monday23 and Tuesday 24 February.\n\n"

This inevitably\nresults in some surprising omissions, including Back to the Future\nII, almost every Carry On film and\nevery Police Academy.\ntent\nsas\nmay not be having an affair with\nthe wealthy man's wife. There is a clear tension between the two men, and this comes to a peak\nwhen events conspire to place\nthem miles from civilization, relying\non one another to stay alive.\nThe plot may sound as corny as\nthe usual Hollywood thriller but this\nfilm manages to retain suspense\nthroughout. This is partly due to\nthe qualities of Hopkin, whose character strives to help Baldwin at\nevery turn despite suspecting that\nthe younger man wants to kill him\nand obtain his inheritance through\nhis wife. It is a treat to see this distinguished actor pitting his wits\nagainst the dangers of the great\noutdoors, which include a particularly ferocious man-hunting\nbear.\nIf you have already seen that\nfilm then you could do far worse\nthan try The Edge. It doesn't take\nitself too seriously and, best of all,\nthere is not a sinking boat in sight.\n\u2022 Chris\nFILM COMPETITION... T his is a French arty film,\nwhich mostly meets your\nexpectations. Clubbed to\nDeath is a love story set in the\nslightly unusual surroundings of a nightclub, where a girl accidentally\nmeets a blok e and becomes his\ngirlfriend. In addition to the\nstandard romantic script are the\nmodern elements. The leading\nmale is forced into bashing his own brother in an illegal fight, gives up\ncrack and dumps his current\ngirlfriend. The club that the film\ncentres around is a converted\nchurch at the end of bus line and\nthis combines with a barren,\nbroken landscape to create a sombre and distracted\natmosphere.\nUnfortunately I found that I really didn't care what happened to\nthe characters. I couldn'temp a this e with them even though\nthey are supposedly part of a similar youth culture to mine. A distraction, possibly due to the\ntranslation from French, is that\nthere are points in the film when\nthe conversations make no sense\nwhatsoever. This, of course, may\nbe part of the French mystical\natmosphere.\nOne of the better aspects of\nthe film was the soundtrack. A thumping selection of tunes,\nincluding Chemical Brothers and\nMassive Attack, help to give the\nfilm a unique atmosphere. Even\nEric Clapton shows his musical\ntalents in one of the most\nevocative scenes in the film. If you\ndo see this at the cinema then a good quality sound system is a must.\nFor me it turned out to be a dreary non-eventful incomprehensible waste of film. It may be worth\nwatching only when it comes on\nChannel Four or BBC2 late at night.\nIf you do, look out for that classic\npulling technique, wearing a creaking leather jacket and flip-flops. O LFB\nFILM COMPETITION. FILM COMPETITION. Win tickets for Hard Rain courtesy of\nODEON KENSINGTON\nThe next big film to open in Britain is Hard Rain, an\naction thriller starring Morgan Freeman, Christian\nSlater and Randy Quaid.\nThe action is set in Huntingburg, a small town\nwhich is evacuated when torrential rain brings rising\nflood water. The local sheriff, Randy Quaid, and the\ntown's residents and are all too familiar with the looting and petty thefts that take place in an abandoned\ntown. However, even they would not suspect the size\nof the planned heist of an armoured security van containing 3 million dollars.\nThe driver of the van is Christian Slater and he\nmanages to escape from the budding thieves who are\nled by Morgan Freeman. The film then follows\nFreeman's frantic pursuit of Slater in a fast-moving\nstyle that doesn't give you time to dwell on implausibilities.\nAs usual the Odeon Kensington has donated the\nprizes for our competition.

Douglas Adams was\nunable to write the book himself as\nhe was working on aCD ROM version of it; his publishers insisted\nthat the novel would have to come out at the same time as the game\nto enable them to sell it.

Written in the style of\nThe Hitch-Hiker's Guide, Jones\nequals Adams' quirk in ess and if\nnot, he enhances it with the naughtiness that only a naked man could\nconjure. Shoddy workmanship by\nthe Amalgamated Unmarried Teenage Mother's Construction\nUnit leads to what appears to be\nSpontaneous Massive Existence\nFailure on the dawn of the Titanic's unveiling to the universe. This is\nwhere the real story begins.\nThe Titanic lands on Earth and\ntakes aboard Dan, Lucy and Nettie.\nThey link up with The Journalist\nfrom the planet Blerontin who was\nhidden aboard the ship with the\nintention of gaining information for\na scoop about the Titanic's many\nflaws. Our characters' objective is\nto regain control of the ship. Along\nthe way they have to contend with\ninsolent Doorbots, pretentious\nDeskbots, operatic Gondolabots\nthat sing when they don't have any\npassengers, a talking bomb that\nfrequently loses count, the peaceful Yassacans with their Simulated\nDestruction weapons and shoot-to-miss policy, galactic bureaucracy and, last but not least, a parrot!\nDevilishly immature, Starship\nTitanic is going to be a love-it-or-hate-it book. One side will put forward the fact that it is just stupid\nwhile the other will say... Well,\nthey'll say that it's stupid too! If\nyou're looking for some satire, go\nread a Ben Elton novel. However, if\nyou want a short read that is essentially just stupid fun, Starship\nTitanic has got its tad ger out and is\nwriggling past the rest of the pack\nto take the chequered flag of\nbonkers comedy. Dennis\nPublisher: Pan Books.\nPrice: \u00a3 5 : 9 9\nAvailable: Now. THE UNDERGROUND MAN\nMick Jackson\nT he Underground Man is the\nfirst novel from Mick Jackson\nand was shortlisted for the\nBooker Prize last year. As you would then expect, it is an\nextremely well written book.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, it is also very\nreadable with a strong central character and a coherent and quickly\nmoving plot. The story is set in the\nVictorian era and is about the fifth\nDuke of Portland ('the\nUnderground Man') one of the\nwealthiest landowners in the co un try. Through his journal, interleaved\nwith short reports from local res i dents, the story of a shy, eccentric\nold man develops. The title refers\nto the Duke's creation of a system\nof tunnels underneath his estates\nwith great expense, where he\nspends more and more time.\nBecause of this and his social difficulties and idiosyncrasies the local\ncommunity believe him to be\ndeformed or insane in some way.\n\"His left eye was a good two inches\nhigher than the right one and he\ndribble from the corner of his\nmouth the whole time,\" was what\nthe locals believed the Duke (who\nwas completely normal) looked\nlike. The Duke, meanwhile, suffers\nfrom an absence that he does not\nunderstand and can only slowly\nunderstand.\nThis is a superb book which I would recommend to anyone. The\nDuke is a sympathetic 'hero', and\nhis story is a fascinating one. As we\nsee the story almost entirely\nthrough his journal we get a personal view and can relate to the\nDuke a great deal. The story is\nloosely based on the actual Duke\n(William John Cavendish-BentinckScott) who did build such a network of tunnels, but the book is\ndefinitely fictitious. The secondary\ncharacters, mainly the locals and\nthe Duke's staff are all well developed and entertaining. The short\nreports between chapters from\nsuch people give a more rounded\nstory, but, because of their prejudices these make us identify with\nthe Duke even more.\nThe story is above all a power-ful, yet witty, story which grabs the\nreader almost immediately. The\nending is an appropriate, but\nshocking conclusion.\nPublisher: Picador\nPrice: \u00a3 6 . 9 9\n\n"

    "content": "6 February 1998 MUSIC 15\nCLUB SCENE* ine electric c Reactivate soared in popularity. Each Reactivate release gave the\nlabel more converts to the church of techno and a bigger influence\nin the underground dance scene. This week sees the release of\nReactivate Classics, the compilation of all the previous compilations, and an excellent opportunity to either re-live or discover some\npivotal moments of history in electronic music. What's more, the CD\nhas been mixed by Daz Saund and Trevor Rockliffc, two pioneering\nD]s during the days of the rave who have continued to exert a strong\npresence in the techno scene to this day. But React isn't just about\nReactivate, as I discovered from James himself...\nIf you read this column every week then you might have picked up a recurring theme that I cover. That's right, I'm harping on about open-mindedness in music; whatever style you choose put in your stereo. I want to promote\nthe fact that as long as you believe in what you\nlisten to, it shouldn't matter whether the media\nor anybody says it's cool or not. Well, after\ninterviewing James Horrocks I realised that I have been breaking that rule myself.\nTo be quite honest with you, I always had\nthe idea that the Reactivate series was cheesy\nand too commercial. I had preferred\nto buy other React releases. That all\nprobably sound OK, unless I were to\ntell you that before Classics, I had\nnever actually listened to a Reactivate\nalbum!\nSo how did I come to such a conclusion about something I had never\nheard? Maybe from the so-called\n\"techno-elite\" or the music media.\nWhatever the reason, meeting with\nand talking to James Horrocks taught\nme something about why people like\nhim have the guts to take such risks\nand release music that, on paper\ndoesn't have a chance to compete\nwith the mass-marketed majors.\nThe first thing James talked about,\nwas his very own baby, the React\nlabel. He describes it as a \"European\nlabel\" which releases \"an interesting\narray of styles\". James runs React\ntogether with his business partner\nThomas Foley. Between them, they\nenjoy a broad range of music. This\nexplains how consecutive releases\ncan consist of deep Detroit techno\nand drum'n 'bass or handbag house\nand blunted hip-hop breaks. This also\nexplains why React has a following\namongst so many different types of listeners of\nelectronic music, and has become so success-ful.\nWith this open-mindedness there are rules\nto abide by. \"We only do something if we think\nwe can do it well. If we think we can do it justice and we can present something that people\nwill actually enjoy listening to. Otherwise we just\ndon't bother.\" explains James. This means no\nquick cash-ins on a style of music that is in fashion such as the current sound of speed garage.\nEven if certain releases haven't aged well,\nReact has been on the cutting edge in a number\nof different musical styles throughout its life.\"If\nyou believe in something, you'll work twice as\nhard for it to work.\" James subscribes to the\nview that business risks can work if you really\nlove what you are doing. It is much easier to\npersuade other people to believe in what you\nare doing if you believe in it yourself.\nHaving established the basic philosophies\nbehind React, we talked about the Reactivate\nseries. In James' own words \"When it started\ndance music had become very disco and\nhomo genis ed and clean and mainstream.\nCertain clubs were playing harder, more minimal\nmusic which was frowned upon by the record\nindustry and ignored as head banging techno\nmusic. In order for people to hear this, we put\nall the best, most popular tracks on an album so\npeople could buy it.\"\nThe series became\" more and more popular\nwith each release and the decision was taken to\nmake Reactivate Classics. Techno music that\nhad stood the test of time was chosen to fill the\nalbum. According to James, the criteria were \"Is\nthat track still a classic? Can that track still be\nplayed? Was that a defining moment of the\ngenre?\" Once the tracks had been chosen, they\nhad to be put together. Daz Saund and Trevor\nRockliffe (both respected and experienced Djs\ntoday) were chosen for this job, because back in\n1990 they had been pioneers of the pure techno sound. \"I thought they deserved the props!\"\nsaid James.\nDespite the fact that many people associate\nReact purely with the Reactivate series, James is\nkeen to explain that the label's taste are far\nmore eclectic than that. \"It (Reactivate) is just\none thing that we do.\" And that is absolutely\ntrue. Look out for an Axis compilation release\nand the legendary Live From the Liquid Rooms\nmix from Jeff Mills. The rest of Detroit is represented by True People, The Detroit Techno\nAlbum. The Artcore albums have followed the\nrising prominence of drum'n 'bass,\nwhilst eclectic music is served up by\nIbiza's Jose Padilla on the Cafe Del\nM aar series. Dope on Wax is a collection of blunted hip-hop and funk,\nand let's not forget the Mix Up series,\nthat so far focussed on a wave of\nyoung Japanese electronic DJs.\nThere's plenty more, but you'll have\nto check that out for yourselves.\nFinally, we talked about React's future objectives. James sees global\ncooperation as the future. \" We don't only want to sell our music overseas\nlike other labels do. We're looking for\nan exchange with other countries. We want to buy what they're doing. Then\nthey release what we do, we release\nwhat they do.\" He cites new artists\nfrom Asia, Russia and China.\nJames' parting shot is against the\nsometimes inward and insulated UK\nscene. \"There's a certain snobbery in\nthis country that if it comes from\nabroad then it can't be as good as\nanything from this country because\nwe are setting the scene. Which is\nactually not the case because as you\ntravel around the world you realise\nthat what we're making is not important in global terms at all. Abroad, it's all treated\nequally!\"\nMany thanks to James Horrocks, React\nRecords and Phuture Trax.\nIf you would like to win a copy of the\nReactivate Classics mixed CD, then answer this\nquestion:\nWhich famous UK DJ released his own pro-j ect, the F.A.C.T. series on React Records?\nAnswers to\na. seth i@ ic.ac.uk\nFelix office or by email to\n@l; ck\n\n"

Those new to IC may think\nthis sets the pulse racing in\nmuch the same way as a European by-election in\nCleethorpes, and usually it does,\nbut last year was less than ty pi cal. It is easy to criticise the voters for the shambles of four elections, but when faced with some\nof the clowns who stood in early\nrounds, it is hardly surprising.\nThankfully, when the dust finally\nsettled, we ended up with a pretty good set of sabbaticals, who\nhave done rather well this year.\nSome of you have already thrown\nyour name into the hat and\ndoubtless more will join them,\nso let Uncle Simon offer you the\nbenefit of his wisdom on this\nsubject. Some people stand for\nelection in order to put something back into the Union or wish\nto change things for the better.\nOthers stand in the vain hope of\ndisguising the fact they have a crap degree or can't decide what\nto do next year or quite like the\nidea of being a perpetual stu-dent. If you fall\ninto any of the\nsecond group\nof categories,\nplease don't waste our time.\nYou will lose,\nand your character will be\ncomprehensively assassinated in Felix\nby yours truly\nand others. I'm not really supposed to talk about individual\ncandidates, but forgive me this\nonce. Both candidates for Felix\nEditor, and others yet to come,\nare truly magnificent people,\nTitans among men, who will\nsurely appreciate the services of\nCD\nTO\nDQ\nCoa humble word smith. In fact,\nthey are both so good that I plan\nto commit electoral fraud and\nvote for both of them several\ntimes. Best of British to you all.\no As whining elements within\nCollege are keen to remind us, a lot of people at\nImperial smoke,\n. often in the j CR. Let's assume\nthat there are\n15,000 staff and\nf~t students at this\n} place (assume,\n(\"^ because no one\nin Sherfield\nP \"\u21221 seems to know\n' W\"m ZZ. how many are\nt SSV on the payroll).\nI~+ Probably 30-40% smoke and,\nfor sake of argument, at a rate of\n10 per day. That's a lot of bac cy, about \u00a3 3 . 2 million. In other\nwords, if everyone stopped and\ngraciously donated this money to\nthe College, it would take exactly\n12 months before the Music and\nArts Centre was paid for, removing the need for this embarrassing art-by-numbers farr ago we\nare currently enduring; it would\ntake about 15 minutes if we also\ncollectively stopped drinking.\nThough the current exhibition is\na slight improvement, in much\nthe same way as measles are\npreferable to mumps, I must ask\nif the shameless prostration of\nImperial at the feet of the\nLottery Arts Board. As I have said\nbefore, there is much very good\ncontemporary British art out\nthere, which would nicely\nembrace art and science, such as\nsome of the sculpture in Damien\nHirst's new restaurant.

The only information that passed between them at all was via a blackboard\nplaced in the dining room, on\nwhich only the Abbot may write.\nOne Monday, the monks were all sitting down for their\ndaily meal, when the abbot wrote\non the board this message:\n\"Some of our monks have\nbeen poisoned. The poisoned monks have green faces. All\ngreen-faced monks must leave\nimmediately.\"\nThe monks, being both intelligent and compliant, would not\nhesitate to fulfil the abbot's wish-es. Although they had no mirrors\nand thus no way of examining\ntheir own faces, the relevant\nmonks duly left.\nGiven that the Abbot erases\nthe message after the last poisoned monk resigned, and that\nsome monks did so on the\nSabbath, the question is:\nHow many green-faced\nmonks were there, and on what\ndays did they to leave?\nACROSS\n4 Back up, concerning developed animal (8)\n8 Highest nick is superb (8)\n9 Had Simon combined c au tion...

It\nwould be ludicrous to have five student unions at Imperial College,\nbut the student union identity is\nstill endemic in the CC Us. While\nthey are still called unions, the attitude that they should be providing\nsocial facilities will prevail even\nthough the ability to do so it far\nbeyond their resources and competence. IC School of Medicine\nUnion is the only C CU in living\nmemory that has run a 'proper'\nstudents' union, and many of their\nfacilities are duplicated or bettered\nby ICU.\nUnfortunately, the inability of\nthe CC Us to do the job they think\nthey should be doing interferes\nwith their attempts to do the job\nthey should be doing; namely, academic support and advice for stu-dents. Such support is woefully\nlacking at IC (see my rant in Felix\n1 103) and though it would be great\nif college overhauled the system,\nit's really down to the students of\nICU to take the initiative.\nLet's look at a specific exam-ple. You enroll on a new course, a difficult one, only to find that you\nlecturer is inaudible / incompetent /\nwrong / failing to turn up at all.\nWhat can you do? At present, not\nmuch. If you are fortunate enough\nto have a dep rep, then you can complain to them. If they are one\nof the more conscientious ones,\nthey inform department via the\nstaff-student committees, but the\ndepartment does nothing. The end\nof the course rolls along (assuming\nyou're still doing it), and you fill in\nthe end of term questionnaire. \" Oh dear\", say the department, \" Dr Death got a bad response this year.\nNever mind, let's give him to the\nfirst-years next time.\" And that's if\nyou're lucky. But don't worry,\nthere's always the C CU bar night to\ndrown your problems, maybe.\nClose 'em down. Get rid of the\narchaic names and crests, burn the\nregalia. We don't need half-arse d unions, we need a properly run\nacademic support service for stu-dents, people who are approachable and efficient with real powers\nto make changes in the depart-ment s. Do it now.\nAT HOME BY THE\nRIVER?\nThe poor state of IC's halls of residence is well known - I 've heard an\nestimate of \u00a3 3 million just to keep\nSouthside Hall running safely.\nThe rich state of the IC boat\nclub is also well known - They've\njust received \u00a3 7 0 3 , 5 0 0 from the\nNational Lottery.

An engine\ngroans and gains power.\nThen a gigantic mechanical\nmachine starts up and pelts\nstraight into a non-stop race to\ncrush everything in its way.\nWow. Great opening track.\nHigh hopes all round, then, that the\ndiscovery of the year has been\nmade. That Foil are THE band of\n'98. Maybe Felix will go down in\nhistory as 'The Paper that Brought\nFoil to the World.' Maybe. On to track 2. Maybe not. For\nthis song, they decided to put\nvocals over the track giving the\nvoice of a more-than-a few-years-past-it punker. Someone who thinks he is Scotland's answer to\nKurt Cobain. And the music has\nchanged as well. Straight punk\nmeets heavy metal. Still good but\njust totally different to what it\ncould, or should, have been.\nFoil's lyrics concentrate on the\ndarker side of life. Hailing from\nWest Lothian maybe you can't blame them but there are a few\ngems tucked away in here. Buried\nin the middle of the album, surrounded by ferocious assaults on silly things like soup, is a very different song. Slow and calm and\nreminiscent of Radiohead and\nVelvet Underground, the track A Place To Hide contains a beautiful\nmelody yet still retains the raw\nnaivety of the rest of this album. If\nonly more tracks were like this. In\nfact, one thing you can say about\nthis album is that it is diverse. It's not all mindless pap. There's fast\npap, slow pap, probably-more-dis-torte d than-it-needs-to-be pap and utterly-original-and-a breath-of-fresh-air pap. Perhaps slightly\nover-rated by their label ('Foil reaffirm your faith in the healing power\nof electric guitars') they were\nnonetheless signed on the strength\nof their demo tape and debut gig\nalone.\nAlso welcome is a minor hit\nfrom a year or two ago called\nReviver Gene - you'll remember it\nwhen you hear the chorus. All in all,\nif heavy metal/grunge A Vest Coast\npunk is your thing then give Foil a go. Just bear in mind that they use\nthe same producer as Elastica\nEd\nDELICATESSEN\nThere's No Confusing Some People\nOh dear - and it had such\npotential as well. What with the name Delicatessen being somewhat of a buzz word within the music scene\nof late, I really was expecting a better effort than this. Intriguing CD cover design and track titles just\nadded to this expectation, increasing the height from which it\ninevitably fell.\nLet's begin with track one,\nmore of an intro than a song really\nand it truly does set the scene for a poor show. A vocalist cross\nbetween Nick Cave and Lurch\nAddams attempts to paint a dark,\nNo Stars\nsombre and somewhat surreal\ntone, what a pity that they seem to\nhave turned to an Estate Agent's imagination to try - and ultimately\nfail - to achieve this. Through contorted vocals, Geldof skits and\nproduces second rate indie rock.\nThere's No Confusing Some People\nreaches the ludicrous Various Pets.\nIf you' ve ever thought that\nPhoebe's( from Friends) Smelly\nCats should make it to release, this\none's for you. There's more talent\nin a dead mouse.\nDespite attempts not to be\npigeonholed within a specific\ngenre, Delicatessen come across as\na drunk Ash impersonating Suede\ndoing a Blur - sounds appealing? 1\nthink not.\nThere is surprisingly an upside\nto this album - it's only thirty minutes long, and when you' ve resigned yourself to wasting an\nhour of your life with it, this is better than early parole.\nThere's No Confusing Some\nPeople is half an hour of conflicting\nsounds, dod gy lyrics, and repeated\nattempts at being something that\nDelicatessen are not. Their conscious decision not to fall into the\nsame bracket as many a rock band,\nwill surely see them fall into the\never increasing canyon inhabited by\nall those who were nothing better,\nbut thought they were. Leave this\none well alone, it'll serve better as a shelf insulator at the local HMV. Derek\n\n"

Six quality sides took the field last\nSunday to play in a league with the\ntwo top teams playing off to win\nthe coveted title. In the final\nChelsea having won all their previous games met Coults AFC. The\ngame was hard but Chelsea turned\nout the superior side. A brilliant\npenalty save by Iggy &. an own goal by Dr. Coults sealed a30 triumph for The Blues. Cheers to\neveryone who took part &. especially the organisers. Yous done\nwell!\nBest of\nmates\nLast week the Chess Club's1st team scored another win at home\nagainst Harrow, avenging last sea-son's disastrous draw.\nHarrow's top boards included\ntwo International Masters. IC's Jon Hastings was horribly savaged\nuntil IM Colin Crouch blundered\nlike a novice. Paul Georg hio u resigned but spent hours trying to\nconvince everyone he ought to\nhave won. Natasha Regan's opponent forked her rooks and Nick\nMoloney sank into a safe draw.\nGavin Knott set a pretty trap for his\nopponent, who obliged and lost\nhis queen. Chris Greenshields\nresorted to chomping bananas; his\nopponent soon lost the plot of the\ngame. Patrick Duncan was pitted\nagainst \"the most boring player\never\". Exasperated, he accepted a draw. Harrow's captain appeared\nto have Dave Tang tied in knots at\nfirst, but Dave's superior skills told\neventually.\nThe final score of 5-3 gives the\nteam 7/7 for the season so far,\nmaking them almost certain to\ntet a in the Middlesex League\nChampionship for the third year\nrunning.\nThe Chess Club is hosting weekend tournaments on8 and\n21-22 February. All standards of\nplayer are welcome. Contact Barry\nGale (b.j. gale@ic.ac.uk, or call\n0181 316 4132} for more.\nSt. George's were our opponents\nas we braved - 5 winds to embark\nin our first match of the season.\nMatch fitness proved to be less\nof a problem than first anticipated,\nalthough Hedge had warned us to\ngive the all important 200%.\nThe first goal was a while a while coming although we had all\nthe pressure; Lili the powerhouse\n(Why's our lec cy bill so high then?\n- ed.) struck the ball low into the\nback of the net. She scored again\nwithin a few minutes with another\nimpressive strike as the 3 supposed strikers floundered.\nWe started the 2nd half 2 nil\nup fx with several more layers on\nto try fx fight the nipple hardening\ncold (spectator sport?). Again we had all the pressure &. eventually\nTaffy stuck home - the first of the\nthree strikers to score. This was\nfollowed by the ' Hooded Yank',\nAnna, who broke her duck on her\ndebut.\nScrubber missed around 15 sitters ix it was all looking rather\nembarrassing until she eventually\nscored when a nice Greek bird put\nher clear through with seven minutes to go.\nThe back three were never really troubled with Mark hus, Wannabe Yank Vasso fx Sick Bird\nHacker ensuring only one goal\npassed their dainty bodies (or was\nthat a mistake by frost-bitten keeper Langrish?).\nWell done birds. On to the\nSemis!\n1CW AFC51 St George's Results\nHockey\nICHC 111 6 - I Wy e1CW HC1120 Oxford\nFootball\nICFC 1 1 - 3 Uni.

This\nyear, the seconds had performed\nheroically in the league stage and\nqualified for the superior cup com petition. Despite the daunting task\nahead of us, the seconds were ready\nfor our opponents, Kingston. Now was\nthe time for redemption.\nWith the referee needing to be resuscitated before the match, both teams\nwaited pensively for the kick-off. The initial signs looked bad, with Kingston\nstroking the ball about with gusto and IC\nlooking a bit panicked. After five minutes\nof mutual probing, IC broke from the\nback. Si received the ball on the halfway-line, turned and ran at the Kingston\ndefence. They backed away and backed\naway, leaving him the chance to have a crack from a few yards outside the area.\nThe goalie managed to get a hand to the\nshot but it wasn't enough as the ball flew\ninto the back of the net.\nThe game continued at a blistering pace with Kingston probing\nus gently but with our defence in\ncontrol. Minutes after the first goal,\na good break down the left saw\nMartin bearing down on goal.\nDespite an angle, our Tiny Tyneside\nTyke slotted the ball away at the\nnear post. Two-nil up and IC were\nplaying their hearts out.\nDespite the teams being very\nclose in terms of skill, IC's commit ment meant that Kingston were\nalways on the back foot. Not renowned for their battling qu ali ties, the seconds pulled something\nspecial out of the hat and were first\nto every ball in the first half, were\nharder in the challenge than their\nSouth London rivals and altogether\nmuch harder than the, at face\nvalue, physically stronger bod s from Kingston.\nA modicum of egalit y was attained for around ten minutes,\nbut another IC move saw Pistol\nPete charging one-on-one towards\nthe Kingston goal. From a similar\nposition to Martin, our Gaelic GoalMachine buried the ball into the net\nand broke Kingston's hearts. Threenil at half time and things were\nlooking up.\nThe second half was more even\nfor the first half an hour, with\nKingston reducing the deficit to\ntwo. But with Rob at central\ndefence winning every header and\ntackle they couldn't find another\nand as the match wore on IC found\nmore and more space to break.\nThe match was finally sealed\nfifteen minutes from time with\nanother Pistol Pete goal. They all\ncount, and despite the fact that it\nwas from one yard out, surely this\nwas the most pte cio us goal Pete\nhas scored all season.\nParticular mention must go to\nAndy Ferguson who managed to\ncombine defensive fortitude with\nattacking class and for Stevie C who stepped into the breach after\nPhil The Pill's bizarre domestic\naccident put him out of action.\nSo, Captain Loz leads an IC\nfootball team into the second round of the BUS A cup for the first\ntime in living memory. Hurrah!\nThanks also to super sub The\nMighty Robo, coming out of retirement for one final game.\nElsewhere at Harlington, the\nfirsts lost to a strong UEA team\ndespite a classy goal from Spanish\nSuperstud Alex. And to the\nfourths...\nAstheheadline once said,\n\"Glory, Glory IC Fourths\", so it\nproved today with an excellent 2-0\nwin in the BUS A shield versus\nBrunei. A professional per f oman ce from the team and a clean sheet\nwas only marred by a horrific injury\nfour minutes from time to inspirational Captain Andrew Swift.\nEpitomising the whole teams' spirit Andy launched into a brave challenge on the 6 foot 5 Brunei 'keep-er. Unfortunately the damage isn't superficial and Andy wii l be out of\naction for a long time. Everyone in\nthe Fourth Team, and indeed the\nwhole Club wishes Swift a speedy\nrecovery and we all hope he is back\nup to full fitness by the start of next\nyear. As a captain Andy was orgasmic ally magnificent, his team talk\ntoday focused his players minds\nand spirits to such an extent that\nactually the result was never seriously in doubt. For the record the\ngoals were scored by Darren and\nPerez and I would like to add that 1\ndidn't get sent off but saved a crucial penalty when the score was nil-nil. Good luck Andy; we'll win the\nfinal for you! Telephone reports from darkest\nWales suggest that the Thirds tri-ump he d32 against their sheep-shagging opponent at the Swansea\nInstitute for Guide-Dogs. Rumours\nof ginger sco users scoring are as\nyet unconfirmed, but if Jamie has\nbroken his IC duck then we will\nnever hear the end of it.\nICFC II 4 - 1 Kingston II\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB SCENE THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE MUSIC 6 February 1998\nDJ RECTANGLE\nTHE TABLES HAVE TURNED.\nD) Rectangle is from Los Angles and is little known over here I should imagine, as I only heard of the man a few weeks back\nmyself. And I'm glad I did. What is surprising is that he\nhas the most amazing CV, and is about to take the UK by\nstorm. Some of the highlights in his\ncareer are winning Box National D] search'94, world Finalist in\nDMC D) Championship'93, winning West Coast DMC DJ\nChampionship'93, and winning \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nthe American DMC Dj championship in ' 9 3 .\nDJ Rectangle has also made numerous appearances on too many radio shows worldwide to mention, including Sony' s worldwide service and BBC Radio One. He is probable best\nknown as the DJ for Warren G, and for a recent UK visit as the\nDJ for the Al ko holi cs at the\nSub terra nia club. Now for his latest mixtape. He is described as a Battle DJa producer performer and this is the perfect description.1 was looking forward to hearing this as it's been a while since I 've heard a proper hiphop style scratch mix, and I wasn't disappointed. The total control this man has over a set of decks is truly\nmind blowing, he does things that you simply shouldn't be\nable to do. For example, HOUSE' N' GARAGE CLUB SCENE SINGLES DRUM' N' BASS Seba. Connected.\n(LookingGood Rec.) 9th Feb.\nIf, it's on LookingGood Rec. You\nknow your in for a musical treat,\nand this latest offering is no disappointment. Connected is a deep\njazz roller, even beautiful, the way\nyour carried away on the strong\natmospheric s, rolling bass-line &.\ntight percussion. Anyone how thinks D& J5 isn't real music just\nsamples strung together, should\ncheck this, a master piece of beat\ntechnology. Keeping LG one step\nahead of the rest.\nDJ Ron. Quintessence.\n(Some' ting Rec.) Out Now.\nThis a triple vinyl pack for only\n\u00a310, a true bargain. Six tracks in\nall, featuring DJ Ron's Space jazz,\nand DJ Krust full length rinse out\nmix of it.\n21st Century, un-surprisingly starts\noff with 21st century fox title\nmusic, with sounds so bad that I can not understand what possessed Ron to do it, but he more\nthan make up for it with the rest of\nthe track, were thankfully it doesn't feature again. Zulu March uses\nawesome chopped up beats and\ndeep b lines, a nice dark step per. With Raid a menacing dark roller,\nto mention a few of the tracks.\nPrezioso. Raise The Power\n(Truelove) 9th Feb.\n4 mixes to choose from, all hard.\nOriginal mix start off with just a banging b line (a great way to start)\nhard 'n' fast beats, great acid beep\n&. bleeps. I could not decide which\nmix I liked best out of these, as\nthey are all so good. Knuckle\nHead z mix has definite old skool\nfeel to it, another banging 12\" from\nthe Truelove stable.\nSolar Stone. The Impressions EP\n(Hooj) 9th Feb.\nYou get three mixes of Day By Day,\noriginal is at ran cy builder, that\ndrops into a deep pleasant break-down.2 nd is a more house y num-ber, bouncy b line, driven beats,\ndeep ' n' dreamy. 3rd mix is a more\nchilled version, stronger atmospheric s&. softer beats, one for\nSunday afternoon.\nDick Dastardly & Peter Perfect.\nRydim's At Ya EP. (Confetti Rec.)\n9th Feb.\nStarts out with a looped, stretched\n& warped female vocal, beats\nquickly build up over this, with jig-ge rly keyboard stabs working in\nand out with a array of bleep 'n' beats. Groaning bass-line soon comes into play, with the clever\narrangements and an up-beat feel\nsure to go down well in the clubs.\nscratching the record that' s playing with out it skipping a beat, avoiding any talking over talking, but still rolling long mixes together. Rinsing phat beats on top of phat beats and didI mention the scratch ing that' s just to rough? He also manages to cover all areas ' n' styles of Rap / HipHop. A few of the top class lineup of tracks used are: Busta Rhymes Dangerous, Sean\" Puffy\" Combe s Big Old Butt,\nSugar Tree-While U Bullshit,\nPuff Daddy Sen on' fa,R akim/ f's Ben Along Time, Mac10 Only In California, The Lu niz Freestyle and Ice Cube Creed. The track listing on this mixtape would make for a most impressive compilation on it's own but when combined with the masterful mixing, cutting' n' scratching of the Rectangle, your taken to another level. The\nSneaker Pimps. Spin Spin Sugar.\nRemixes (Clean Up.) 2nd Feb.\nAfter it's phenomenal club success,\nit's back with even more re-work-in gs, and sounding as fresh as the\nday it was made. A classic set of\nre-workings, using the Sneaker\nPimps lyrics to full effect, these\nremixes just work so well. Sure to\nget any crowd away from the bar\nand on the floor.\nTen Years of the Roxy\nV/A( Kubin)\nDutch ep to celebrate ten years of\nthe famous Roxy club in\nAmsterdam. Three great tracks\nhere, but I head straight for\nLaidback Luke's SubConscious every time. This is infectious, uplift-ing, extremely funky and oh so ooo groovy: all at once!\nSolyent Green\nSolyent Green Z( Playhouse)\nPlayhouse is one of a small number\nof labels that is making house minimal and, dare I say intelligent.\nThree unnamed tracks create a sound that is fiendish and daring.\nNot quite Basic Channel, not quite\nRobert Hood. Sharp, precisely\nplaced bursts of sound make for a tense, stretched ambience. Playhouse has had the guts to\ncarve its own niche and that\ndeserves my respect.\ntracks are used in the environment they were made to be\nplayed in. This is a must for all bad boys&. girls out there, anyone who appreciates mixing, HipHop, Rap and anyone wanting to hear how a DJ should be\nwork it. A true performance. Look out (in Club scene8. Club Listings) for when&. where you can catch the man live ' n' direct, as a European tour kicks\noff in the next few weeks and lookout for full interview in the\ncoming weeks. I have n't seen these tapes in the shops, but you can order\ntapes&. CDs direct from Sound Chamber Recordings on01718234973, as well as a host\nover other top notch hiphop tapes and CDs. ET1CI\nJo Public\nSkyUI>- The ? EP.\n(Eye Q)16 th Feb.\nA side, is slow down beat number,\nhaunting strings, slow drum pat-tern, sad even depressing lyrics. A dark trip py track, that breaks\ndown to reversed lyrics and eerie\nlive bass taking you even deeper\nin.\nB side, is less depressing, still\ndeep ' n' dreamy, beautiful female\nvocalist is used again, this one\nmore minimal, no drums at all,\nsimply clever use of electric guitar,\npiano &. strings.\nCourtney Pine.\nTrying Times Remixes\n(Talkin' Loud) Out Now.\nYou get three mixes of Trying\nTimes to choose from &. one remix\nof Sense song by Raw Deal.\nTwo mixes by Headstrong, one\nvocal, one dub.

It has come to our attention\nthat there seems to be some animosity towards the whole team from other members of the hockey\nclub. We were unaware that our\nboyish jovial i ties were causing such\ngrief. We were shocked and surprised to be accused of being arrogant, although we'd like to point\nout that this is due to high spirits\nafter good fortunes.\nWe'd like to apologise profusely for our actions, and we hope that\nyou can find it in your heart to forgive us. We cannot, however, make\nany promises about our future con duct.\nHope this goes some way towards bridging the vert i able chasm that has developed. All our love and l airiness, IC Men's1 st hockey team,\nmainly Steve Morrell.\nBITCH ALERT\nDear Editor\nThe Great British Bulldog is\nalive in the guise of the Assistant\nAccommodation Officer.\nI had heard rumours of the\ninferior treatment other students\nhad received at the hands of this\nrude and boorish individual.\n1 had not believed any of it,\nuntil I was on the re cie ving end of\nthis woman's aggressive, hostile\nand overbearing manner.\nMy mistake was to ask for\nassistance in finding ac com mod ation in the private sector. English is\nnot my first language, like so many\nother students at l.C. I had gone to\nthis office for advice, but was treated in a dim in u at ive way. Subsequently my command of the\nEnglish Language was questioned\nand also whether I had the ability\nto be studing in this institution.\nThis incident happened a month ago, and to my knowledge\nthe situation is still going on. Anyone who has had the misfortune to come up against these circumstances please comment! Since the senior management\nhas had little to say on the subject.\nIt is time the Great British Bulldog\nwas silenced.\nC. Chan OILY INTERESTS\nDear Felix\n1 am writing as a member of the\nICU Environmental Society. A lot of\npeople may have noticed that we have been collecting signatures for\na petition to Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of the college, asking him to\nclarify his position on the close links\nbetween IC and the Oil industry.\nImperial's funding is increasingly coming from Oil companies with\na reputation for appalling environmental di struct ion, denial of Global\nWarming and links with assassinations. We would prefer to be funded through companies associated\nwith alternative energy forms and\nethical investments and through\nstate money.\nOil companies are investing a small proportion of their budget\ninto renewable sources of energy\nbut they are making no move to\nreduce overall oil consumption. On the contrary, they are planning\ncontinued expansion of fossil fuel\nconsumption in the 21st century\n(eg. By investing huge amounts\ninto exploration of new fields such\nas the North Atlantic frontier),\nwhilst lobbing persistently to\nundermine international agreements to limit greenhouse emissions. The Text of the petition is as\nfollows:\nTo Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of\nImperial College:\nWe the undersigned are concerned by the college's close financial links with the oil industry and\nhence our association with the\nenvironmental damage, exploitation of third world resources, suppression of human rights and links\nwith the arms trade which arise\nfrom that industry's activities. We do not wish our education and the\ndirection of our research to be\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\ndirected to such destructive ends.\nAs a non-executive director of\nShell Transport and Trading and the\nRector of Imperial College, we call\non you to clarify this conflict of\ninterests.\nThis is the last chance to sign!!!\nYou can sign on the Web by\ngoing to:\nwww. EarthCorp.com/enso c Suzanne Aigrain\n(s.ai grain@ ic.ac.uk)\nWHAT DO DEP\nREPS DO? GOOD QUESTION...\nDear Jeremy,\nWhat is a Dep Rep? This is a question which a lot of people\nhave been asking me recently,\nwhilst stumbling through the\nPresidential Suite, and so I'd like to\nset the record straight once and for\nall.\nTo cut out the nonsense, your\nDep Rep is your MP. Any problems\nyou have whilst you are at IC,\nwhether you are an undergraduate,\npostgraduate, first year, final year,\nor EVEN A MEDIC, your Dep Rep's job is to... well, REPRESENT you. So when you've got a problem\nwith a lecturer, you should go and\nsee your Dep Rep, who can sort\nthe problem out at staff-student\nmeetings. And when you think the\nprices in the da Vinci's are far too\nextortionate, then - tell your Dep Rep, who has a full vote on ICU\nCouncil, and can therefore... REPRESENT you. Are we getting the general\nidea? Now you may be asking who your dep rep is. Believe me, I often\nask the same question. Contact\nyour C CU( Constituent College\nUnion) President, and find out, and\nthen hassle them into doing their\njob properly. Most Dep Reps are\nvery good at their jobs, but there\nare some who leave a lot to be\ndesired. Take the power back, find\nout if you're being represented\nproperly and if not - change them.

Vandals broke\ninto the vehicle in the early\nhours of a winter's morn-ing, released the hand\nbrake, and pushed the bus\ninto the River Thames.\nThe following day, during an early morning training session, a team of\nrowers were astounded to\ndiscover their minibus had\njoined them in the water.\nThe drenched bus had to\nbe pushed back the\n500yd s it had drifted downstream,\nand was placed outside the boat\nclub, where it has taken up permanent residence.

Photo: Ian Channing\nThe boat club's minibus is not\nthe only vehicle to fall foul of the\nhooligans, a number of other cars\nin the area have suffered a similar\nfate. The incidents are symptomatic of a six month spate of vandalism in the Putney area; clothing,\npersonal belongings and outboard\nengines have all been\nstolen from several nearby\nboat clubs. The crime\nwave has even extended\nto the theft of a30ft trailer from one club.\nThe police have cond uc ted an investigation\ninto the incident. New security measures have\nbeen installed, and patrols\nin the area have been\nstepped up. The boat\nclub's coach, Bill Mason, described the act as a \"sick joke\" but was heartened by the fact that high levels of\nsecurity have limited attacks on the\nboat house to this solitary event.\ncontinues on page three\nThe\nStudents'\nNewspaper\nat Imperial\nCollege\nIssue11066 February1998 "

    "content": "6 February 1998\nSINGLES\nHurricane #1 - Only The Strongest Will\nSurvive\nA much slower and more percussive effort from\nOxford's( second) finest, impossibly mixing\nBacharach with psychedelia. On its first listen\nthis track falls short of their previous high stan-dards, saved from mediocrity only by the ever-stunning voice of Alex Lowe. However, a few\nmore plays and you're totally enveloped by the\nsoaring melody\nBeDLaM AGO GO - Season No. 5\nA relaxing mixture of trip-hop and ambience.\nThe 'Insomnia'-style vocal delivery works well to\nadd to the mood. Pearl Jam - Given To Fly\nStill going after all these years, Eddie Vedder and\nMr. McCready have lost absolutely nothing,\nexcept maybe the knack to write a song that is\neven slightly memorable. Enough said.\n'A' Foghorn\nPretty much an aptly titled song. If you were a little dinghy of a pop song you' d be wise to get\nout of the way of this battleship - a speed-thrash racket of Titanic proportions. Iceberghorn anyone?\nThe Young Offenders - That's Why We Lose\nControl\nMove over Chum b awam ba! These guys are the\nnew anarchists. And their raging socio-political\ntopic of concern? That Byker Grove isn't nearly\nas good as it used to be. May beI'm wrong. 1\njust find it hard to take a band seriously that's a kick in the knacker s away from sounding like The\nChipmunks.\nBennet - Horse's Mouth\nThey're the young indie band that's hard to\npigeon-hole, just when you think they're Suede,\nthey become Lightning Seeds. Then they're Bis\nTHA BOMB! Check it out another week, another column.\nIts time for your regular fix of R'n' B with a little bit of hip hop stuffed in. First up, those\nwho actually read my bit will recall that last\nweek's column included the Phat Selection of\n97, well this has caused quite a stir. Nuff people already been up to me and complained\nthere was loads of tunes that I missed, well I gotta set the record straight, the phat selection is a list of the top tunes, not the best\ntunes, there is loads of tracks that are\nwicked, but that no one has heard of. So y 'all\nshould just chill...saying that I gotta to admit\nto missing some top tunes, but yo I honestly\ndon't care!\nTele news - Friday night, Top Of The Pops,\nnumber one...its Usher. The boy came over\nand sang his bang in number one track live on\nstage for TOTP, the only problem was the kids\nin the crowd, they didn't seem to wanna get\nwith it. Usher should've released and just let\nit be, but he tried to work the crowd and for\nmine ended up looking like a cock. For those\nwho don't know Friday nights also has FLAVA,\nthe best music program on the box. Flava is\ntha Bomb, 30 minutes of the do pest videos,\nMUSIC\nor, erm, 'indie' sensations Catch. This song?\nAlright but not memorable. The horses in question might just be the Spice Girls.\nHowlite - Halo\nThe ultimate in obscure cult labels, Shifty Disco\nprovides just 1000 people a month with a release from different artists on its own 'totally\nindependent' label. The sheer randomness of\nthe music on offer is enough to grab your at ten tion. This track from Howlite, however, makes\nyou wish that the single was released in more\nlimited numbers.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON The Candyskins - You Better Stop\nIt starts all '60s West Coast style, but soon\nexplodes into a classic every bit as uplifting as\nMcAlmont/Butler's Yes. The Candyskins consistently provide memorable 'perfect' songs and\nthis is well worth investigation. They've been on\nthe brink of success for a while now, so their\ntime is due.\nGlitterbox - Scared Of All The World\nAn exciting mix of '80s rock and melancholy\npsychedelia, complete with A Day In The Life\nstyle piano crash ending. Nothing ground-s hak ing but pleasing enough for the occasional lis-ten.\nEther - Watching You EP\nThe return of the band with the most impossibly\ncatchy melodies and most implausibly nasal\nvocals. Play this in the morning and it's100% guaranteed to wake you up with a smile on your\nface.\nEd\nImani Coppola - Legend of A Cowgirl\nThis is the stand out track on a five-track sam-its on at 12, and one of the few chances you'll\nget to catch some smart R'n' B videos, unless\nyou got The Box (lucky muth a). While we chat-tin 'bout videos I gotta mention the new bad\nboy video for SJIry's The Limit this video been\nout for weeks, but only just saw it and its\nphat...you gotta check it. If ya seen it already\nthen you know what I'm chatting about. The\nwhole video is your usually Puffy and Biggie\nmessing about, doing their playa thang, but it\nain't them, its kids playing them. It might not\nsound great, but ya gotta see it.\nGirl bands....it's on. Oh yeah the British\ngirls are blasting into the 98, starting of in\nlate 97 we had Truce following up their earlier success wit the huge Nothin' But the Party,\nthis infectious party track blew up large. Next\nup we got the All Saints.... I can hear you saying what the fuck is this guy talkin about, but\nI kinda like them. Never Ever is a good little\nballad, they sing it pretty well, not well\nenough though. I'm not going to get into the\nwhole can they sing, can't they sing thing, just\nsay that I will reserve my decision till I 've\nheard a bit more from them. Next up is NTyce, they first turned up last year, but didn't pier. Imani displays excellent vocals, her ^ j voice is as good as any out there, un for**8 it un at ely she suffers from a limited range of\nideas, and the general song pattern is very\nrepetitive. This girl has the potential to be as big\nas Sheryl Crow, but that requires a few better\ntunes then those on this sampler.\nMUKI - Shine\nSix minutes of purely instrumental sub-Asian\nsounds, very mellow and relaxing, the only\nthough I have is that this may be useful for rev i sion, but that's about it. Basically too long and\nnot enough happens on it.\nWarm Jets - Never, Never\nStandard post Brit pop indie release with suitable rock and roll melody, this will suit the indie\nboys but that's about it.\nUnited Citizen Federation feat. Sarah\nBrightman - Starship Troopers\nThis tune perfectly encapsulates the essence of\nthe film, fun and upbeat, but ultimately pure\ncrap. Sarah Brightman lends her voice to an\nelectronic ABBA melody to great effect; the\nactual lyrics though are ridiculous. This is destined for huge chart success, even though everyone will say they hate it.\nChumbawumba - Amnesia\nTheir follow up to Tubthumping, this quite clearly doesn't live up to the up standards set with\nthat, but bounces along and will stick in your\nhead for hours. This will be much loved by fans\nof Aqua and the Human League. Top Ten,\nyes....number one....no.\nAsian Dub Foundation - Free Satpal Ram\nThe foundation were fairly quiet last year, but\nstill experienced success. This single doesn't rate up alongside any of their great stuff, but\ncertainly worth a listen. Milen\nreally do anything, into the 98 and their bringing out Telefunkin, this is a straight party\ntrack, with some pop thrown in to appeal to\nthe masses.\nInto the 98 and what are the tunes like?\nWell to tell the truth 98 has been a bit thin on\nreal tunes so far. Saying all of dat there has\nbeen a standout track, my top tune for\nJanuary Wishing On A Star by Jay Z and Gwen\nDickie. This is of course a remake of the old\nclassic, with most remakes I am normally of\nthe believe that the original is far superior,\nbut this time the remake lives up to the orig-in al. The vocals are up to it, while Jay Z does\nit again on the rap, a must have.\nSnoop drops his next single Tha\nDoggfather from the LP of the same name,\nthis is a real let down much the like the LP.\nSnoop really needs to hook up with Dre and\nbring out those old style g funk killers.... I'm waiting. At long last the Marsha track Is it\nReal gets a UK release, this did some damage\non the underground and deserves its British\nrelease. Dope bassline, check that shit out.\nShout out to the Chem Eng boyz! See ya.\nMilen\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC 6 February 1998\nCLUB SCENE THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE T he freestyle rs are a name that my not be\nfamiliar at the moment, but all that is about to change\nwith their new single B Boy\nStance storming into the\nnational charts last week at\nnumber 23. A killer track that\nhas been caned in the right\nclubs for a while now, and\nplayed extensively on Radio\nand Kiss FM. The freestyle rs are a full on\ngroup; eight people combine to\ncreate their fresh sound, not to\nmention their break-dancers (yes\npeople still break dance and few\nbetter than the thirty strong Freska\nBreak-dance crew).\nNow back to the group. Aston\nHarvey (ex-Blapps Posse) and Matt Cantor (major London break DJ)\noversee things with their knowledge and production skills. The\nother members of the group are j Rock (Scratch Dj champion) cutting\nthings up, Jo on bass guitar, Chris\non lead guitar and the hard beats of\ndrummer Clive. With vocals by the\none 'n' only Tenor Fly (Major UK\nreggae artist) and MC Navigator (a top drum bass MC, Radio 1, one\nin the jungle MC) this is quite an\nimpressive line up.\nCLUB SCENE ALBUM COLDCUT & HEX\nTIMBER. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , / 2\nThis latest release from Cold cut and Hex is out on the 9 th Feb and has arisen from their interest in live\naudiovisual mixing, where all\nthe images are directly linked to every single beat which makes for a most impressive live show. This comes as aCD Rom( char-act ers shown feature in the visual\nexperience) with visuals that are\n-one with the music and clearly display the message that is being put\nacross if you've got a computer\nthat can run it. If not, the music\nitself can stand alone. This is not a mere backing track to the visual\ndisplay but cutting edge beats,\nbreaks & samples.\nAston Plays\nThe freestyle rs have been making a name for themselves on the\nfast emerging Big-Beat scene\n(break beat with big bass-lines),\nwhich London once again seems to\nbe leading the way in. I have been\nlistening to their previous works\nover the last few weeks and believe\nme these are no one-hit wonders\nand look likely to blow up in '98.\nAston kindly took time out from\nrecording their follow up single to\nhave a chat with me about past,\npresent &. the future of himself and\nthe freestyle r s.He describes their\nmusic as an amalgamation of HipHop, Electro &. the whole BreakBeat culture. Old Skool flavour with\na new identity via a use of different\nproduction techniques.\nHe started out DJing at the age\nof 16, and around this time was\nfriends with rappers Brotherhood.\nThey had wanted to make a track\ntogether for a while, so they got\nthere ideas together and headed to\nthe studio to put their ideas down. He admits that his early\nattempts were nothing special but\nsays that, with time, as he learned\nhow to use the equipment and the\nideas came in thick and fast, the\nquality of the music he made improved. He said that he still\nlearns new tricks and ways of doing\nthings all the time so it's a continuous process.\nAston's tip for wana-be producers is to get all your ideas together\nwell before you get anywhere near\nthe studio. For example, drum\nrolls, breakdowns, bass-lines,\nFreestyle\nmelodies should all be worked out\nbeforehand. If possible take someone who knows how to use a studio with you to show you how to\nwork the equipment yourself.\nAround '91 Aston formed part\nof The Blapps Posse, making similar music as Shut 'n' Dance but they\ndidn't get hyped as much. Later on,\nin a solo project he created one of\nthe biggest tunes, a true classic of\nthose large scale rave days of 91-93, Don't Hold Back. That could be\nheading for a re-release and I'm sure it'll be a big hit again. He has\nalso worked with the first lady of\njungle, DJ Rap, before meeting up\nwith Matt to form The Freestylers.\nSo they have plenty of experience\nto call on.\nWhen asked why they seem to\nbe have such wide spread success\nwith the Freestylers, he said that\nthere is a concept behind the\ngroup, a direction and identity to\nthe music. Well there's definitely\nsomething.\nMatt and Aston, also play-out,\nDJing regularly in such places as\nMiami, Italy &. Munich as well as\nregular UK dates. Some of the\nforthcoming dates are: Saturday 7\nFeb. Project B, Milton Keynes,\nFriday 13 Feb. Middlesborough\nArena, and finally making a London\nappearance at The Clinic, on\nSaturday 28 Feb. Before they shoot\noff to Miami. Then back to London for 13\nMarch at Club Innocence, London\nBridge and Fri 20 March at Hanover\nGrand. Finally returning to London\nto rip up the Jazz Cafe, London on\n26 April. Check club listings for info\nnearer the dates. Also mixing the\nEssential Mix on Radio One, Sunday 8 Feb. One not to be\nmissed.\nThere are plans for a European\ntour over the summer to coincide\nwith the album release, which\nshould be around 8 May. And plenty of festival appearances lined up\nincluding Phoenix, Glastonbury and\nTribal Gathering. JT\\c\\ Jo Public\nTWl\n\u00a51H \u00a3\nshows the ability of these two producers to make the most amazing\nassortment of beats 'n' breaks fit\ntogether perfectly. They have cut\n'n' spliced together beat upon beat.\nThe way the remixes change pace\nand style, but seem to keep the\nsame direction, is impressive.\nAlmost every track has it's own\nindividual style, but at the same\ntime is part of the whole.\nSo all in all a most impressive\ncollection of sounds that works\nvery well on it's own, and I can't wait to see the live show, which is\nsure to blow you away.\nOne day all music will be produced this way. One Step Ahead.\nEDS Jo Public\nThis also music with a serious\nmessage, as you may be able to\nguess from the title, that message\nto \"highlight the abuse\nof the worlds biosphere and i ndige nous tribes\"\nTimber is ai.\nattempt by Coldcut h. jJ'A Hex to do something Jj\nabout it.\nTrack 1 starts out\nwith a wicked mix of ||\nsamples and beats that\nbuilds up nicely with a tribal chant\ntype vocal over samples of what\nsounds like engines or machinery\nbreaking it up. I think this could be\npart of the message, which is clear\nwhen seen with the CD ROM. Track 2 has a strong electro\nbeat thing going on that works particular well. Track 3 picks up the\npace, a full on break beat number\nthat is almost D& J5, again carrying the same\ntribal vocal as\nthe first track.\ni Excellent mishmash of\nbeats. Various\ni remixes feature\nI hear but they\nf are used in a more chilled environment and works\nJust as well. The pace is raised\nagain with a crazy fast tempo break\nbeat track with a sax thrown in for\ngood measure. Track 7 once again\n\n"

    "content": "18\nTHEATRE\nARTS 6 February 1998\nSHOPPING AND FLICKING\nMark Ravenhill\nT he scene: a room filled with\npeople newly in from the\ncold, adjusting their dress,\nchattering, turning to neighbours, all\nnicely relaxed, until - BANG! We are hit by a thunderbolt of sound, a disjointed, harsh-voiced rant\nagainst life in general, ripping\nthrough the now total blackness\nover a thudding beat. Winded so to\nspeak by the onslaught, we turn to\nthe stage, unusually sparsely fur-ni shed, and dominated by a large\nscreen to the rear, on which lighted\nlettering forms the title of the play.\nWe see a scene in the home of our\nmain characters. These three are\noccupied in picking at the\nmicrowave meals which appear\nthroughout the play, but which\nMark refuses to touch so that his\ncompanions attempt to feed him\nfrom their own plates, thus creating\nan odd parent-child tableau.\nThe plot of this play is far too\ninvolved and bewildering to attempt\nto even summarise here, and anyway that would somehow defeat\nthe object of my trying to persuade\nyou to see it, (which, incidentally,\nyou definitely should.) At Lulu's and Robbie's request, Mark relates\nthe apparently beloved tale of his\nfirst meeting with them. A stranger\nhad pointed to a nearby couple and\ntold Mark that he owned them, but\n\u2022that they were trash and he didn't want them, even hated them , and\nhe'd offered them to Mark for \u00a320.\nThey'd \"done a deal,\" and Mark had\ntaken Robbie and Lulu home to be\nhis \"slaves.\" This is where the \"shop-ping\" of the title comes in, and the\nidea recurs throughout the play in\nvarious forms, adding a really surreal (and not a little confusing,) element to the entire thing.\nAs the play progresses, with\nscene changes indicated very effectively by the lighted lettering\nbehind. Up to this point, the acting\nhad been a little slow and stilted,\nand I 've had the distinct feeling that\nthe cast are having difficulty in filling\nthe enormous, bare stage, but the\nperformances are beginning to\nstrengthen, along with the cohesion\nof the group. The first act ends on\na note of suspense, but that's as\nmuch as I can give away\nThe salvo of rapid-fire sound\nwhich hurls us headlong into the\nsecond act is no less of a jolt than\nthat at the beginning - absolutely no\ndanger of sleeping through the first\nfive minutes. As the second act\nbegins we are launched into the\nextraordinary scene of Robbie's and Lulu's home with each engaged\nin a telephone conversation, which,\nit soon becomes apparent, is phone\nsex; they are making a last ditch\nattempt to raise the \u00a3 3 0 0 0 which\nthey by now owe to Brian. During\nthe course of this, other telephones\nring, so that both Lulu and Robbie\nare holding two simultaneous con-vers at ions, juggling subject matter\nand even voices.\nThroughout the play, Gary has\nbeen mentioning a wealthy man\nwho is \"out there\" and who will take\nhim back to his luxurious home for\ngood. He goes into greater and\ngreater detail, until he is describing\na vision of being a possession, controlled completely, and he begins to\nsee Mark as the one who will\nbecome his master. Gary then\nencounters Robbie and lulu for the\nfirst time, and they agree to \"help\"\nhim, by recreating his vision. They\nmanipulate his words so that his\nvision becomes exactly the \"trans-action\" of Mark's story, and is\nplayed out in gruesome and menacing detail. This is where the \"fuck-ing\" part comes in; this is the one\nthing on which the shock value of\nthe play is said to depend, but to\nme it is shocking more for its apparent coldness, and for Gary's submission to what he believes to be\nnecessary for the enactment of his\nvision, than for the act itself. 1 find\nthe mind-games and manipulation\nsurrounding it, and the fact that\nRobbie is in fact giving Gary precisely what he has asked for, far more\nhorrifying. This scene, with its stark\nwriting and powerful acting, is to\nme the most effective of the play.\nIt is very difficult to come to any\ndefinite conclusion as to what Mark\nRavenhill is trying to achieve with\nthis play. At this point in time I would say that it is an exploration of\nideas on dependence, both on\nother human beings and on money,\nand the ways in which the dependence on one another of the members of a group affects all their lives.\nThe whole thing is certainly\nextremely thought provoking, and\nsucceeded in captivating me from\nbeginning to end.\nAbi.\nShopping and Fucking directed by\nMax Stafford-Clark.\nPlaying at the Queen's Theatre,\nShaftesbury Avenue, until 14 March.\nPrices: Mon-Thurs and matinee s, \u00a36 - \u00a3 1 9 . 5 0 .

    "content": "6 February 1998 NEWS\nShephard Fails to Excite ConS oc Flock DAVID ROBERTS\nRt Hon Gillian Shephard, Member\nof Parliament for Norfolk Southwest and former Minister for\nEducation and Employment,\naddressed a Consoc meeting on\nWednesday. She spoke briefly on the task of the Conservative party\nin opposition, which she described\nas \"asking the unanswerable\", and\nher specialist area of Higher\nEducation.\nMrs Shephard began by outlining the reasons why she felt the\nTories had lost the last General\nElection, which she saw as problems of elector tedium, splits over\nEurope, and the Party appearing\nout-dated. She anticipates a complete reform of Conservative Policy,\nled by William Hague and Peter\nLilley's 'Listening to Britain' campaign, to be launched next month.\nShe emphasised that it is important\nnot to get too heavily bogged down by policy at this stage, citing Mrs Thatcher, who had \"travelled light\"\nduring the seventies.\nMoving on to attack Labour,\nshe responded to Peter\nMandelson' s description of\nthe Opposition as \"pathetic\",\nclaiming that\nLabour them selves are to\nblame for the m trivial is ation of mgm\nrecent discussion fl H in the Commons, as they are\nattempting to by\npass Parliament\ncompletely, by \u2022 H issuing press\nreleases to I declare policy.\nMrs Shepharc\nMinisters either\navoid questions,\nor claim that the subject is 'under\nreview'. Finally, she emphasised\nthat the process of devolution had\nnot been thoroughly thought out,\nand no English voter had ever had\nthe chance to register their feeling\non the issue. Highlighting her own case, she\nclaimed that the\npeople of\nNorfolk feel no\ndesire to merge\nwith Hertford shire or Essex in\na potential new\nregional assembly for East\nAnglia.\nMoving on to the Higher\nEducation debate, Mrs Shephard added that a comprehensive overhaul\nof the University\nsystem was nec-ess ary, considering the massive increases in student numbers\nsince the issue was last addressed\nin the sixties. The key is, according\nto Ms Shephard, to ensure that\npublic money is fairly distributed \"to\nmaximise quality and choice\". She\nfeels that this would best be\nachieved by attaching funding to\nindividual students, so that they\nbring funding with them to their\nuniversity, thus increasing competition amongst HE institutions. More importantly, Mrs Shephard emphasised that a Conservative government would not have abolished the\nmaintenance grant, but would have\nmoved to cap student numbers,\nwith Mrs Shephard for one feeling\nthat any further increases in numbers would be detrimental. Her\nconcluding comments focused on\nthe need to increase the respect\ngiven to Higher Education - particularly the ' new' universities.\nSpeaking in their defence, she\npointed out that \"in my day you\ncould get a degree in sport at\nOxford. It would have been called\nEnglish or History or something,\nbut basically it would have been a degree in sport\".\nWatery Grave for Boat Eric Allsop: 'C&G Union\nClub Bedford is a Bunch of Arse'\ncontinued from front page\nHe went on to explain that this act\nof wanton destruction came as a particular blow to the club from a financial as well as a logistical point\nof view, but was certain that club\nwould \"just get on\". The bus, which\nwas estimated to be worth \u00a3 1 5 , 0 0 0 , suffered irreparable da mage as a result of rust, ruined\nelectrics and sodden upholstery.\nJules Davenport stated \"it looks\nokay, but nothing works and every\nnow and again a bit more water\nruns out from somewhere.\" The\nminibus was officially declared a write-off by insurers last week and\nplans are now being made to purchase a second-hand replacement.\nFelix has been informed that the\ninsurance company plan to reimburse the Boat Club about \u00a3 7 , 0 0 0 .\nThe Boat Club originally\nobtained the minibus under a cloud\nof controversy. The facilitating\ngrant was awarded by an IC sports\nfund known as the Harlington\nTrust, but almost immediately\nafterwards the trust decided that it\nwould no longer consider applications for club minibuses. Frank\nMurray, the sports and leisure\nmanager, justified the move, commenting \"it is essential the club gets\nto regattas.\" He went on to\ndescribe the sizeable amount of\nequipment required for the meets\nwhich are invariably held significant\ndistances away from college.\nThe Boat Club is currently hiring\nout buses through the union, which\nbrings them into line with other\nclubs and societies. Frank Murray\noutlined plans for financing a replacement minibus, suggesting\nthat a request to the Harlington\nFund could make up the balance\nafter the insurance pay-out.\ncontinued from front page\nthe root of the problem: \"The candidates stand as individuals, not as\npotential members... most are just\nafter CV points and don't realise\nthe commitment involved\".\nIf the motion of no-confidence\nis passed (or if, as has been\nrumoured, Mr Bhalla resigns) a temporary President will be elected by the OM C, until the results of\nthe C& JGU elections are\nannounced on 3 March. The newly\nelected President would then takeover immediately. It is hoped that\nthis move would provide the necessary catalyst to begin the\nprocess of renewal in Guilds. In the\nwords of Selina Vinayaga-Pavan,\nC&X. Publicity and Welfare Officer,\n\"Exec is supposed to be a team,\nand we have finally realised that to\nfunction properly we need that\nteam - but every team needs a captain\".\nLooking to the future, it is\nrealised that the problems of\nCJkGU cannot be solved immediately, and go back far beyond this\nyear - Eric All sop, former ICU\nPresident, suggested that C& CU had been going downhill since he\ncame to Imperial in 1989.\nHowever, Andy Heeps commented that whilst no overnight\nchanges can be expected, he\nwould like to see Guilds \"taking the\nfirst steps... reviewing their constitution, sorting out their finances,\nand building up a solid first step in\nthe chain of the command\". Mr Heeps promised that only if such\nsteps fail to be achieved will he\nuse his newly mandated powers to\ntake greater control of the running\nof C&X,. "

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 6 February 1998\nTHE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING A FIRST with COLIN DALE\nPart Two: Tutorials\ntraumatic stress disorder).\nThis kind of tutor often has the ability to see\ninto your soul, and can tell, the moment you walk through the door, that you haven't read\nany lecture notes since the first week of term.\nSo excuses are out. But don't worry, the situation is not so desperate that you have to rely\nonly on hard work to get you through. With\nthese handy hints, it may still be possible to get\na good reference from him without doing a single problem sheet.\nBe punctual, polite, but above all never be\nhonest. It may be true that you were prevented\nfrom coming in last week due to a crippling\nhangover and/or court summons, but a dental\nappointment generally creates a better imp res sion. Tutors do not generally write negative\ncomments in your reference, it still pays to be\non good behaviour - you do not want 'rarely\nattends tutorials' listed as a positive attribute.\nBeing asked a difficult question in a tutorial\nis a bit like running out of ideas when you're trying to write a column for Felix. You have to say\nsomething, whether it actually means anything\nor not. So you just burble on and on incoherently, mindlessly spouting the most pointless\ndrivel just to fill the awkward space. You talk\nand talk and talk and talk, but don't actually say\nTutorials represent a golden opportunity for an\ninteractive exchange of ideas between students\nand those who are knowledgeable in their field.\n(But remember you can sue them if they get too\ninteractive.). Your tutor also has a good deal of\ninput into your reference. You'd better be nice\nto them, because you don't want your career to\nbe jeo pardi sed by some evil, vindictive old lunatic (save that privilege for your interviewer).\nAcademic tutors at IC fall broadly into two main categories. Firstly, there are those who consider undergraduate tutoring to be an irrelevant waste of time; then there are those who consider undergraduate tutoring to be an irrelevant waste of time but still think it's damn good fun to make you sweat. If your tutor is in the\nfirst category, you are sorted for the whole year:\nyou have met someone who obviously feels the\nsame way as you, and there will be a kind of\nunspoken mutual agreement never to see each\nother again. The second type, who can usually\nbe distinguished by a demonic glint in the eyes,\nare more worrying, and will be dealt with below.\nIf it is your misfortune to have to see\nDr.B.L. Zebub in room 6 6 6 every week for the\nrest of the year, it would be a good idea to learn\nhow to survive the ordeal. It may even be possible to gain something from it (other than post-anything much at all. Like that.\nTo do really well in tutorials, you must master the art of floundering. Simply saying T don't know' in response to a tough question may be\nhonest, but it doesn't get you anywhere. In fact\nit is an incredibly foolish thing to do as it leaves\nthe door wide open to further probing of your\nweaknesses. Saying ' umm... err...' for a few\nminutes is a good start, but will not really buy\nyou that much time. You need to work a few\nrandom phrases into your routine, such as 'in te gral', 'four pi' or 'decaying exponential'. As you\nbecome more proficient in these tactics, you will also be able to use terms which are actually\nrelevant to what you are doing. With practice,\nyou will soon have the ability to carry on like this\nfor so long that the tutor will eventually forget\nwhat he asked you and pick on some other poor\nunfortunate to relieve his boredom. Real\nexperts have been known to stave off further\ninquisition for up to twenty minutes using this\nmethod.\nAnother aspect of tutorials is the opportunity to ask questions which are relevant and aid\nyour appreciation of the course. But 'Can we go\nhome yet?' is not likely to get the best response.\nI 'll see you next week to discuss your lab\nreports.\nCATERING NOTICE\nIN THE WEEK COMMENCING\nFEB9 TH WE WILL BE ASKING ALL\nUSERS OF CATERING OUTLETS\nIF THEY ARE IC STUDENTS,\nSTAFF OR \"OTHER USERS\".\nTHIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH\nCUSTOMS AND EXCISE\nREQUIREMENTS AND WILL NOT\nAFFECT THE PRICES YOU PAY.\nYOUR CO-OPERATION IS GREATLY\nAPPRECIATED.\nto sALON15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS \u00a3 1 5 LADIES \u00a3 1 3 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

Whether or not the protagonist was successful in his bid Ido not know, but given the old\nadage that people are innocent as\nlong as they have a better lawyer\nthan the opposition, he is probably\nstill in jail paying court costs. Some\nof you might feel rather sorry for\nthis once hopeful wretch, but I pour\nscorn on such sympathy; nobody\nwanted the damn things anyway.\nThere was once a time when\nthe hustle and bustle of the great\ncommunal tube trains was a form\nof music; the percussive \"rat-a tat-tat\" of the wheels combined with\nthe orchestral mumble of distinguished gentlemen and the hoi pol-loi alike.

It\nseems ironic that it is normally considered an advantage to construct\nequipment that does not require\nregular servicing.

For Britain,\nthe situation is slightly different.\nAmerican patriotism is defined by\ntheir declaration of independence\nfrom Britain, and along with the\nIrish-American question, there has\nalways been a slight anti-British\nundercurrent within the American\npopulation. Relations also depend\non the ideology of the respective\nleaders being similar: with ThatcherReagan/Bush there was a rapport\nbetween the leaders, and consequently the Governments. When Clinton took over from Bush in\n1992, rumours surfaced that the\nConservative Party had assisted\nRepublicans in the election campaign. As well as being a bad move\nin supporting a losing side (some-thing which -Had additionally been\nclear beforehand ) political partisanship in matters such these were\nmore than stupid. They were su ici dal. John Major and Bill Clinton did\nnot get on at all well, with Clinton\nrebuffing Major within one week of\nentering the White House.\nClinton made little effort to hide\nhis admiration of Tony Blair, pulling\nout all the stops when Blair visited\nWashington a year before the\nGeneral Election. They have hold a broadly similar position in the political spectrum, and are known to be\ngood friends as well as good col-leagues. Both leaders are extremely\nuseful to each other, with Blair's 'star'\nstatus, along with Britain's recent\n'Cool Britannia1\nimage overseas, providing some useful political capital\nfor the President. It seems Blair has\nplenty to gain from being associated\nwith the United States.\nUnfortunately for us, relations are\nusually unequal. We Britain is\nundoubtedly the junior partner in the\nspecial relationship, something\nfirst one to prepare retaliatory EU\nmeasures against the U.S. HelmsBurton Act, punishing foreign companies for investing in Cuba, Iran or\nLibya. This was done with the full\nsupport of the British Government.\nBritain has also called for the U.S. to\npay what it owes to the United\nNations, remarking that they\n\"shouldn't have representation without taxation\", which raised a few\nhackles.\nOn the situation in the Gulf, the\nU.S. and Britain are completely in\nagreement. Many Gulf observers are\nHamish Common\nWestminster Eye\nwhich was first made obvious in the\nSuez Crisis in the 50s, the first time\nthe U.S. effectively told Britain to\nhand back the colony and canal.\nThis and previous British\nGovernments have seen the U.S. as\na teacher in some senses, adopting\nand learning from measures taken\nacross the pond. This may not have\nbeen so obvious in Europe, when\neven now, the Government seems\nmore eager to lecture than to listen.\nHowever, Britain has not been\nentirely sycophantic to the States in\nforeign policy. Sir Leon Brittan, a British EU Commissioner, was the\nseriously concerned at the military\nescalation in the Gulf - the other\nthree Permanent Members of the\nUN Security Council, France, Russia\nand China, oppose military action.\nNearly every Gulf state opposes military action, with Israel being an\nobvious exception, and Kuwait\nputting up the least resistance.\nWhen one considers it in a more historical perspective, Britain has been\nrelatively pro-Arab, the U.S. pro-Israel this century. Britain had\ncolonised much of the Gulf, and in\nmany cases relations are close (the\nKing of Jordan went to RMA Sandhurst, the Army's Officer\nAcademy). Anglo-Israeli relations\nhad never been good, starting with\nthe St David's Hotel bombing after\nwar, with claims that the present\nIsraeli Government is descended\nfrom a terrorist group, Most observer comment that Israel as a state\nwould never have got off the ground\nif were not for the support of the\nU.S. Government.\nSo on an area of potential divide\nbetween the U.S. and Britain, Britain\nstands side by side, the only country\npublicly to do so. It seems that our\nGovernment has got to like a new\ntactic of standing by other\nGovernments in trouble (note British\nsupport of French nuclear testing),\nno doubt to extract a few favours\nlater. Perhaps Blair is playing the\nlong game in Anglo-American relations, one that the press don't necessarily seem to be picking up.\nThe one thing that Tony Blair\nmust be laughing about will be the\nTories' reaction to these events.\nThey are still discussing the cost of\nministers' offices' refurbishment, trying to extend the 'sleaze' image for\nas long as possible. If the public\nwish to hear this message, they\nprobably don't want to hear it from\nthe Tories. As Blair discusses the\nstate of world politics today, Hague\ndiscusses office furniture. Let us\nhope they soon provide some credible opposition, before Labour get\ntoo big for its boots. The ramifications for that would not make pleasant reading.\n\n"
