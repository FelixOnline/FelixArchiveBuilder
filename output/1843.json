You\ncan read the article by scanning the\nQR code below.\nWe\u2019d like to build on the work of\nour predecessors this year, and want\nto start by matching or exceeding\nthe number of responses received\nin 2020. We\u2019re currently at 1,600 responses for this year, but many departments are underrepresented \u2013\nso please complete the survey (scan\nfront-page QR code) and share it\nwith your friends!\nThe new logo: what\nImperial can learn\nfrom Sonic the Hedgehog\nThe view from within the Felix office\nis much the same as the wider College when it comes to Imperial\u2019s new\nlogo. The vast majority hate it, a few\nthink it is not as bad as the uproar\nwould suggest, and the remainder\nare ambivalent.\nNevertheless, it is hard to ignore\na nagging sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the\nway this debacle has unfold-ed. This is now the\nfourth time in\njust over two\nyears that\nthe College has introduced a visual\nchange to complaints of insufficient\nconsultation.\nAdmittedly, this time, unlike the\nintroduction of the ALERT statue \u2013\nwhen student complaints made international news \u2013 or the two attempts\nto put a mural at the entrance to Callendar Road, it has actually consulted\nstudents about the logo changes.\nBut the bevy of memes that the\nlogo has spawned, and the over\n2,000 people who have signed a\npetition against it, suggest either\nthat the level of consultation not sufficiently extensive, or that the wider\nCollege populus was not made suitably aware of the opportunities they\nhad to feed back on the design.\nTalking to those involved in the\nCollege\u2019s brand project, it seems that\nthe Imperial genuinely did \u2013 and still\ndoes \u2013 want to gather student opin-ion, but it prioritised the wrong platforms to reach them.\nPerhaps it speaks to a generational divide that email, newsletters,\nand a webpage were the main ways\nin which Imperial communicated the\nchanges to students.\nImperial\u2019s Instagram page has\n144,000 followers, and has recently\nundergone a transformation (shout-out to former Felix Editor Philippa\nSkett, who now manages the page!).\nThe Instagram page has garnered\nattention for its light-hearted approach to communications and the\nway in which it has captivated what,\nto be entirely fair, can be a very cynical student body.\nInstagram is an inherently visual medium and\nwould have been\nfar better suited to\npromoting the\nbrand project,\nand soliciting\nfeedback.\nYes, there is\na greater risk of backlash when something is posted to social media. But it\nis better to tease new ideas there at\nan earlier stage, when designs can be\nrevised without substantial cost, than\nto leave it to students to post memes\nabout once it\u2019s too late to change.\nThis is exactly what Sega did in\n2020. It teased the Sonic character\nmodel for the eponymous Sonic the\nHedgehog movie, and found that it\nwas met with ridicule.\nAfter revisions to the model, the\nmovie became the highest-grossing\nvideo game movie of all time (it has\nsince been surpassed).\nSex, logos, and Sonic\nEDITORIAL\nSelina Ye\npikawil100, Flickr, CC-BY-SA-2.0\n\n"

Every time you burn some-thing, you increase the heat, and if\nthis is done in a confined space, that\nincrease in heat is going to manifest\nasanincreaseinpressure.Whenyou\npass a pressurised fluid through a\nconverging-diverging nozzle, contrary to intuition, this process actually accelerates the gas, converting\nall the thermal energy into kinetic\nenergy of the exhaust gas. Multiply velocity with mass flow, you\nget thrust. And so, the main aim of\nthe engine is to take the propellant,\nextract its chemical energy and\nconvert it to thermal energy \u2013 then\naccelerate it, expelling momentum\nout of the rocket.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about throwing as much\nmass as fast as you can out of the\nrocket. The faster you can throw it,\nthe more efficiency you have.\u201d\nTHANOS-R demonstrated a new\ncooling system onboard their en-gine, called regenerative cooling,\nwhich will allow the engine to be\nfully reuseable without replacing\nany components.\n\u201cWith this engine, we use the fuel\nas a coolant first. Running a cool\nfluid about a hot chamber prevents\nthe melting of the engine\u2019s interi-or, making the engine regenerative\nwith some additional efficiency\nperks.\u201d\n\u201cWith the engine implemented\nonto a rocket right now, our altitude\ntargets are modest, but over time,\nthey\u2019re going to go up and up. Having an expendable platform, and\ntechnology that we can continue to\ndevelop, is quite nice.\u201d\n\u201cMe and Martin spent more than\na working week\u2019s worth of work.

On the weekend, people that were there did more than a\npart time job just being there and\nworking.\u201d\n\u201cMartin and I are two mechanical\nengineers, though the society was\noriginally started out of the Aeronautics department. As it\u2019s gone\nalong, the society is starting to see\nsupport coming in from Mech Eng.\nWe\u2019re actively expanding to Physics\nand EEE, with the basis that anyone who wants to join is welcome\nto join. Anybody is welcome to join\nif you\u2019re into this. Some people are\nhere for the vibes too \u2013 I\u2019m fine with\nthat, the vibes are good.\u201d\nThis year, ICLR will be participating in two competitions. The first\nis the Race to Space competition,\npurely a propulsion competition,\nwhere teams have an opportunity to\nfire their engines.\n\u201cThey call it a competition, but\nreally it\u2019s an opportunity for these\nteams to fire their engines.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only team that has a\ntest site ourselves, on the Silwood\nPark campus, everybody else needs\nto use another one.\n\u201cPart of the collaboration with\nthat is that you cannot compete\nunless you publicise all your doc-uments, we\u2019re not about trying to\nhide everything, we\u2019re about everyone trying to learn, improve and do\nthe cool stuff.\u201d\nThe main competition for the\nteam is EuRoC 2024, which will be\ntaking place in October.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there for the past\nthree years in a row; and our track\nrecord has not been great. We get\nvery close, do pretty well, but it\u2019s the\nlast little bit that stumps us.\u201d\nThe team also have ambitious\nplans to launch the first rocket of\ntheir size, type and calibre, in the\nUK.\n\u201cYou can do it in all sorts of places in Europe and North America,\nthere\u2019s just nothing in the UK right\nnow to launch liquid biopropellant\nand hybrid rockets. Potential sites\ninclude RAF bases, where they have\na lot more land. We have a lot of\npeople that need to agree to a lot of\nscary things to ask.\u201d\nFrom talking to Elliott and Martin, and all of the ICLR team members on the day of the test, their\nscientific feat is a testament to the\nunwavering dedication and collaborative spirit of the group. The\n3D-printed, regeneratively-cooled\nliquid rocket engine marks a paradigm shift in propulsion technolo-gy, emphasising sustainability and\nreusability. As they set their sights\non upcoming competitions like\nthe Race to Space and EuRoC, the\nteam\u2019s aspirations extend beyond\naccolades and competition, aiming\nto carve a niche for themselves in\nthe UK\u2019s rocket launch landscape.\nThe ICLR team\u2019s journey is not just\nabout reaching new heights in\nrocketry, but also about fostering\na community of students pushing\nthe boundaries of scientific explo-ration.\nIf you\u2019re into rocket science or\njust want to soak up the good vibes,\nconsider joining ICLR and sign up\nusing the QR code. The team are\nan incredibly friendly bunch and\nthe science and engineering they\ndo is fantastic. All of us from Felix\nwish the ICLR team the best for\ntheir future tests and upcoming\ncompetitions!\nTHANOS-R: ICLR\u2019s\n3D printed engine\nEngine close-ups\nBringing the engine and the airframe together is a\nchallenge.

For some, this can be\na call to action, an opportunity to\ncontribute to saving the planet \u2013\nwhether this comes from optimism\nthat something can be done, or\nfrustration that more isn\u2019t being\ndone already. To others, this narrative can be paralysing, making\nthem doubt that anything they do for the cause will\nmatter.\nConsidering this, it is also important to recognise\nhow many people are still oblivious to climate change\nand environmental issues, or don\u2019t understand the true\nscale of them. Students at Imperial, and particularly\nthose on environment-oriented courses, exist in a\nbubble with a skewed demographic, where it is easy to\nassume that our knowledge and supposed rationality is\ncommonplace, when in fact this is far from the reality.\nIt is equally easy to think that the general public is\nwilfully ignorant of these issues, or remains apathetic\ndespitehavingawarenessofthem,choosingtocontinue\nas normal. An article in the Financial Times highlighted\nthat, though climate policies appear to garner public\nbacklash, in reality, government popularity often increases in response to such measures. The article\nreported that, from a sample of 130,000 people in\nthe Global Climate Change Survey by the Institute of\nLabour Economics, 69% are \u2018willing to give 1% of their\nhousehold income a month to fight global warming\u2019.\nHowever, those same respondents estimated this\nfigure would be, on average, 43%, suggesting that most\npeople feel they are in the minority in their willingness\nto take individual climate action; this kind of distrust\nis not conducive to progress.\nThis idea can be extended both to how firms interact\nwith each other, and to the disconnect between\nscientists, policymakers, and the general public.\nContrary to popular belief, most large corporations\nnow have definitive net-zero targets that they are\nworking to meet in the next few decades. However,\nthe ambition of these targets depends on whether\nexecutives feel as though other firms are carrying\nout similar practices. If corporate managers sense\nthey are making costly changes to their operations\nwhile others aren\u2019t, this can disincentivise investment\ninto practices such as improving energy efficiency or\ncarbon capture to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions. Corporations are also held accountable\nby stakeholders and investors, in\nwhichcaseperceivedriskcanwork\nin reverse, and encourage firms\nto carry out carbon-reduction\npractices, because this signals to\nstakeholders that they are capable\nof making profits while staying\nin line with climate policies and\nregulations.\nThe Network for Greening the\nFinancial System (NGFS) is a group\nof banks and supervisors that aims\nto provide advice on climate-risk\nmanagement for businesses, and encourage financing\nof green practices and climate-change mitigation meth-ods. Understanding potential future scenarios and\nlevels of climate risk is particularly important for asset\nmanagement and investment in sectors such as real\nestate, because the future value of assets is likely to be\nheavily influenced by the effects of local climate change.\nClimate-scenario modelling \u2013 predicting the\nlevel of risk that companies are vulnerable to from\nclimate-change impacts \u2013 is still a relatively novel\nbranch of climate science. In a similar way to how\neconomic models must make assumptions and tend to\nignore many extraneous variables, so must most climate\nmodels.\nThe accuracy of these models is also inhibited by\nthe disconnect between physical risk (the physical\nimpacts of climate change on humans) and transition\nrisk (the potential costs of moving towards a climate\nchange-adapted society). Physical-risk models tend to\nmake more long-term, higher-level predictions \u2013 on\nthe timescale of 10 or more years \u2013 than transition-risk\nmodels do, which are most accurate on timescales of\nunder five years. The outcomes that climate models\npredict often turn out to misalign with reality. To\nimprove model accuracy, it might be useful for climate\nscientists to focus on narrower timescales that more\nclosely align physical and transition risk.\nPolicymakers often work with scientists and\npolicy researchers, who use data from these\nclimate risk models, among other sources, to make\nrecommendations on the feasibility and social\nimplications of policy proposals. However, too\noften, these recommendations are discarded by\npolicymakers, which could be attributed to distrust\nor misunderstanding of scientific data. This can also\ncause scepticism of climate policies among citizens,\nparticularly when science and policy don\u2019t appear to\nalign with each other, or when there is ineffective\ncommunication of the reasoning behind policies.\nDespite this, seeing governments establish definitive\ntargets and goals can improve public trust in their in-itiatives.\nThat being said, these targets almost lose their meaning when they frequently aren\u2019t met, which can have\nthe opposite effect and cause people to lose faith in\npolitical action. The same goes for corporate net-zero\ncommitments, and though it might not always seem\nlike it, consumers play a huge role in holding businesses\naccountable to these goals. While having strong long-term goals is important for ensuring that different\ncountries are on the same page and working towards a\nsimilar future scenario, there is an argument to be made\nfor focusing more acutely on setting, promoting, and\nachieving shorter-term climate change targets.\nThe EU has recently updated its target of net-zero\nGHG emissions to a reduction of 90% by 2040 (relative\nto 1990 levels). Although this has been shown to almost\ncertainly be an achievable goal, does this long-term\ntarget factor well into the commitments of individual\ncorporations and governments? Most market outlooks\npredict up to five years in the future, and so defining\ngoals closer to this timescale could encourage more\nambitious corporate action and a more orderly\ntransition \u2013 meaning a consistent rate of adaptation\nover time, rather than making lots of changes right\nbefore a target\u2019s deadline. This might also align better\nwith political terms, which in European countries tend\nto be between three and seven years.\nMedia coverage and analysis of climate research and\npolicies is constantly toeing the line between optimism\nand doomism, and both extremes can be detrimental to\nmaking real progress. As such, it is vital for politicians\nand journalists alike to effectively communicate these\nideas to their audiences, with awareness of potential\ndifferences between them in their understandings and\nperceptions of both climate change matters, and the\nimpact this has on people\u2019s and firms\u2019 willingness to\nAll risk, no reward\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u001d\u0018\u0017\u001c\u0016\u0018\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0010\u0014\u000f\u000e \u0014\n\n"

It focuses on the long-term survival of indi-viduals, communities, and social structures. With a\nchanging world and an annual population growth rate\nof 1%, sustainability isn\u2019t just about population growth.\nIt is about addressing the widening wealth gap and unequal consumption patterns. As demand for basic needs\nincreases, we need to adapt. Sustainability is about\nmeeting these needs within our planet\u2019s capacity, given\nwe\u2019re currently using over 1.5 times the Earth\u2019s resources annually. Addressing this involves redistributing and\nmanaging resources, understanding consumption pat-terns, and innovating solutions.\nThis year\u2019s Green Careers Fair connected Imperial\nstudents to companies which are doing all of these. It\ntook place in the evening on 6th February in Queen\u2019s\nTower Rooms. The fair was sponsored by Imperial Zero\nPollution and organised by Imperial+, Environmental\nSociety, Engineers Without Borders, Climate Entrepreneurs Club, and Chemical Engineering Society.\nThere was a total of 25 companies attending the 2024\nGreen Careers Fair. Some were Naked Energy - a company focused on revolutionising solar technology, Vertical\nFuture \u2013 a vertical farming technology and data com-pany, Mission Zero \u2013 a direct air capture company, and\nother notable sustainability-focused com-panies. (Note: All companies who attended\nGCF can be found in the GCF e-brochure\nvia www.tinyurl.com/GCFcompanies or by\nscanning the QR code)\nDuring the planning of the 2024 Green\nCareers Fair, there were two main aims/pur-poses we wanted to achieve: Firstly to raise\nmore awareness about sustainability and climate change. Secondly to give opportunities for people\nto pursue their interest in sustainability and make their\nown unique impact .\nPeople can know why sustainability is important, but\nit is only through interactions and conversations with\npassionate people working in the field,\nthat we can envision the impact we can\nhave on the planet.\nThis year, the Green Careers Fair had a\nunique reflection space to reinforce this\nhuman aspect of one\u2019s career journey. It\nallowed every participant to take a step\nback, observe their situation, and assess\ntheir progress in their abilities to successfully pursue a green career. This links closely to the second\naim \u2013 holding the space for everyone to embrace their\nunique selves and identify opportunities for unlocking\ntheir full potential.\nAs the topic of sustainability is incredibly broad,\nconsequent of its integral participation in our social\nand natural environment, it can be confusing and overwhelming to take in. Sustainability is a massive exploration site, and Imperial offers a variety of sustainabili-ty-focused societies to develop the necessary skills and\nknowledge required for a green career. Furthermore,\nImperial+ is a newly launched value-based community\nof Imperial students and staff accelerating Imperial\u2019s\nsustainability transformation. Imperial+ is cultivating\na vibrant, collaborative Imperial ecosystem geared towards a resolute alignment with sustainability objectives and the realisation of the College\u2019s Strategic Aims.\nCome and be a part of the change you want to see.\nTo be involved in organising the Green Careers Fair\nnext year, feel free to contact Milan Paczai or Colleen\nHandriani Wijaya.\nEnvironmentWriters\nCOLLEEN WIJAYA\nMILAN PACZAI\nA poster for the green careers fair Lina Rhmari Tlemcani\nParticipants and company representatives at the green careers fair Lina Rhmari Tlemcani\n\n"

Of direct relevance to our Strategy launch is\nhow we tell Imperial\u2019s story and present our plans to\nthe world.\nDuring our highly engaging institutional conversation\non our new Strategy, I was struck by how many of our\ncommunity urged that we tell our Imperial story with\nmore confidence. This was not a shallow appeal to\ninflate our worth to the world, but a heartfelt request\nto garner the recognition Imperial is due with the\nultimate goal of inspiring others to join us, partner\nwith us, back us and invest in us.\nAs a relative newcomer to Imperial, I had to agree!\nImperial is a fantastic institution, but perhaps overly\nmodest. These things matter. In a noisy, competitive\nand changing world, we cannot assume that Imperial\u2019s\nbrilliance will speak for itself.\nOur new Strategy sets out our future ambition, and\nour work to strengthen Imperial\u2019s brand \u2013 how we\ntell and represent our story \u2013 supports this effort.\nIt should deliver multiple benefits, from helping to\nattract the best talent, funding, and partnerships,\nto strengthening our global reputation and ranking.\nUltimately, it should help us compete on a sustainable\nbasis in the very top tier internationally.\nBut what do we mean by the Imperial brand?\nIt is best described as the sum total of everything\npeople see, hear, and experience of Imperial. The\nexperience people have when they visit our campuses,\nor our website, our choice of partners, the focus of\nour research, how we talk about it \u2013 all of these and\nmore shape what our university means to people.\nThe Imperial brand is much more than a shade of\nblue, a logo, or a tagline, though these elements are\nimportant. That is why we have developed a visual and\nverbal identity, rooted in our science heritage, that\nis modern, confident, and expressive. Both elements\narticulate Imperial\u2019s purpose and vision, our strengths\nand impact, all while seeking to differentiate us in\na crowded and competitive landscape. Our official\ncrest and institutional name remain unchanged, but\nother elements have evolved, as they do over time for\nmost organisations no matter how modern or ancient.\nA huge thank you to the thousands of students,\nstaff, alumni and friends who shared their ideas\nand feedback at multiple stages throughout the\ndevelopment of this work \u2013 whether through survey\nresponses and focus groups at the very start of the\nprocess last summer, or through feedback sessions\nand online responses to the initial creative in the\nautumn. The level of engagement is a testament to\nour community\u2019s ambition, creativity, diversity and\ncommitment to Imperial\u2019s future.\nI hope as many of you as possible can join us for our\nStrategy launch on 5th\nMarch.\nStrengthening\nImperial\u2019s brand\nIn a noisy, competitive and\nchanging world, we cannot\nassume that Imperial\u2019s\nbrilliance will speak for\nitself.\n\u201c\nHugh Brady, President of Imperial College London\nHugh Brady is the President of Imperial College London.

The test\nmarked one of the first collegiate firings worldwide of\nan engine 3D printed using a lightweight aluminium al-loy, AlSi10Mg.\nThe society hopes to achieve longer burns with their\nreusable engine in future tests. This is in anticipation\nof this year\u2019s European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC) in\nPortugal, where ICLR will be launching their rocket,\nNimbus.\nI was fortunate to attend the test fire on the day,\nand caught up with propulsion engineers Elliott\nBrookes-Gayton and Martin England to discuss ICLR\u2019s\nengine test.\n\u201cIt went very well \u2013 we got performance close to what\nwe expected, in some areas it exceeded the performance\nof our worst case scenario. As a preliminary test it went\nwell: now that we can prove the engine has ignited and\nthat we can show it can reach a thermal steady state\nunder our most conservative conditions, we\u2019re ready to\ngo up to full duration burn and start increasing performance further.\u201d\nICLR is a student-led team composed of undergrad\nstudents across all discisplines at Imperial. Since their\ncreation in 2018, the team has welcomed over 100 students to work on their rockets.\nMembers of ICLR are grouped into different sub-teams, each having an individual collective and goal.\nThere are seven of these sub-teams: airframe and recovery (aim to avoid rapid unscheduled disassembly\nor descent), electronics (ensure telemetry, sensors, and\nvideo cameras are installed), propulsion (responsible\nfor the engine), altitude record team (aim to break UK\naltitude record for amateur rocketry), payload (respon-sible for making payload to send on rockets in compe-titions), flight dynamics (responsible for the dynamic\nmodelling of flight), and business and marketing (spe-cialising in outreach and merchandising).\nElliott and Martin are both Mechanical Engineering students. They\u2019ve been working with ICLR for over\ntwo years. Starting off as propulsion engineers, Elliott\nis now the Propulsion Team Lead, while Martin is the\nPropulsion Technical Lead.\n\u201cIf you treat our team in isolation, our aim is to develop propulsion systems. You can have higher thrust, you\ncan have longer duration burns, and you can have more\nefficiency, realistically. For us, it\u2019s about getting higher\nthrusts, longer burns, and the regen opens up that opportunity to have much longer burns. In theory, you can\nburn non-stop provided the fuel tanks are big enough,\nbut our focus is on having more efficiency and more\nburn duration.\u201d\nTHANOS-R is a liquid bipropellant rocket engine,\nwhich uses both a liquid fuel and an oxidiser. Together\nthey mix and are burnt at high pressures in a combustion chamber \u2013 the exhaust gas generated is accelerated\nthrough a nozzle, which generates the thrust.\n\u201cIn a rocket, you have a fuel and an oxidiser, the aim is\nto burn it and release the chemical energy from the pro-ICLR celebrate record-breaking\nhot-fire test of THANOS-R engine\nSCIENCE\nImperial College\nLondon Rocketry\ntest marks one of\nthe first collegiate\nfirings worldwide of a\n3D-printed aluminium\nalloy engine.\nTHANOS-R hot-fire test: patterns seen are called Mach Diamonds which occur as a result of shockwaves produce by the supersonic exhaust gas. The velocity of these exhaust gases is approximately 2000m/s. ICLR\nScienceEditor\nTAYLOR POMFRET\nFor us, it\u2019s about getting\nhigher thrusts, longer burns,\nand the regen engine opens\nup that opportunity.\n\u201c\n\n"

Her involvement spans\nacross various realms, from active participation in the ICSM Students\u2019 Union,\nto engaging in clubs such as Light Opera, where she not only graces the stage\nbut also contributes as a choreographer.\nWith aspirations ranging from plastic\nsurgery, to public health and involvement\nin governing bodies, Lilia embodies the\nmultifaceted nature of today\u2019s medical\nstudents.\nChoreographer\nLilia\u2019s role as a choreographer for the\nfashion show goes beyond dance. Tasked\nwith conceptualising the creative vision\nfor the walk, she draws inspiration from\ndiverse sources. Last year, the \u2018Maniac\u2019\nsong motivated an 1980s athletic-themed\nwalk, complete with exercise-heavy cho-reography, and classic 80s dance moves.\nHer responsibilities extend to the opening lingerie section with a modern twist,\nas well as the Boys in Heels tradition,\na longstanding favorite involving fun,\nvogue-inspired performances.\nThe process involves significant\npre-planning. Lilia collaborates with others to create tracks, designs dance moves\nin advance, and draws inspiration from\nsources like YouTube. Teaching sessions\noccur twice a week, focusing on perfecting moves through lyric-centric instruction rather than traditional counts. Lilia\neven slows down songs to 75% speed, to\nensure everyone masters the fast-paced\ndance moves.\nThe number of participants varies\nacross different walks, with 30 to 40 in\nAthleisure, 8 to 9 in Boys Heels, and 12\nin the opening lingerie section. Coordinating with other choreographers, Lilia\nensures that their visions align, contributing to a cohesive and visually stunning\nshow. Themes span decades, including\nthe 80s for Boys in Heels and the 20s and\n60s for the opening.\nFor Lilia, the most rewarding aspect of\nbeing a choreographer lies in witnessing\nthe transformation of participants\u2019 confidence levels. Despite initial apprehen-sions, she helps individuals overcome\ntheir fear of dancing, fostering a supportive environment where students return\nyear after year. Some participants even\nexpress a desire to take on choreography\nroles in the future.\nHer Journey\nLilia\u2019s journey from Stagecoach model to choreographer was a natural progression within ICSM. Recognizing her\nteaching skills during her involvement\nin the opera society, she gradually found\nherself choreographing large shows. Her\ncompatibility with choreography within\nthe medical school setting showcases the\ndiverse talents medical students possess\nbeyond academics.\nDespite the enthusiasm and passion,\nthe fashion show choreography comes\nwith its own set of challenges. The short\ntimeline of eight weeks, the fatigue from\ndancing for five hours, twice a week, the\noccasional writer\u2019s block, and the need\nto think on the spot all contribute to the\nhardships. However, she does not give\nup. If the choreography does not flow\nwell one week, she aims to perfect it by\nthe next week, with enough time for her\nstudents to learn well.\nBoys in Heels\nBoys in Heels is not the strongest\ncohort of dancers, but hearing that\nthey practise at home a lot surprised\nand pleased Lilia very much. She mentioned that one individual in the group,\nwho never considered himself a danc-er, asked her if he could choreograph\nthe team next year. \u201cThey tell you how\nproud they are and how much they love\nworking with you,\u201d she gleamed with\npride.\nThe Event\nReflecting on the previous year, Lilia\nexpresses satisfaction with the improved\ntimeline and increased attendance at re-hearsals.

The\nevent itself, spanning 2.5 hours, demonstrates the meticulous organisation of\nthe fashion show, with carefully planned\nintervals for audience convenience.\nAs she navigates her final year of medical school, Lilia contemplates the future,\nbalancing her passion for dance with the\ndemanding schedule of a medical pro-fessional. While she may not continue\nchoreographing as a doctor, Imperial\nCollege\u2019s accessible and flexible environment has allowed her to explore her artistic side while pursuing her degree.\nLilia\u2019s journey as a choreographer at\nImperial College\u2019s fashion show highlights the intricate balance between academic pursuits and artistic passions.

The waiting staff\nand the mixologist were all dressed in\n1920s clothing \u2013 classy yet functional.\nAs we sat down in the red leather seats\nsurrounding old wooden tables, we could\nnot help but giggle at the setting we had\njust entered.\nThe cocktails were themed after famous criminals, fictional and real \u2013 Al\nCapone and Tommy Shelby as examples.\nThe menu, designed to mimic a notebook of suspects, was fun to explore. As\nthe prices ranged from \u00a310-15, we sipped\non our drinks to save not only our sober\nstates but our bank accounts. A small\ncollection of snacks were also available.\nAt 9pm, the band came out to play the\nmost enjoyable live jazz that I have heard\nin a while, and we were reluctant to leave.\nHowever, our reservation ended at 9:15,\nwhich the waiting staff upheld strictly\ndue to the packed reservation schedule.\nI am glad the owners found success in\ntheir business. I hope to return soon, and\nclaim that my deceased husband resurfaced with a vintage collection of vases.\nDetective, my flat was robbed, but all they\ntook was a letter from my deceased husband\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFood&TravelEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nEarl\u2019s Court prohibition speakeasy \u2018Evans & Peel\nDetective Agency\u2019 solves the crime of sobriety\nO\nn my usual Saturday jog, I decided\nto head west, instead of east towards\nWestminster, to explore the Thames\naround Fulham and towards Richmond\nPark. While I initially enjoyed the lack of\ntraffic, the noise of which typically surrounds the music in my headphones, I\nslowly found myself in something of a\nghost town.\nPerhaps it was the cloudy sky, or perhaps it was the suburban structure of the\nneighborhood. Nonetheless, the emptiness was only filled by the faint unified\nchants of the nearby football stadium, and\nthe occasional Saturday jogger.

It just seems that most information that we hear and see day to day, can\nmake us feel hopeless and demoralised. But the choices\nyou make always matter. As Dr Jane Goodall says: \u201cWe\nmust not give up hope. Every single day that we live, we\nmake some impact on the planet. We have a choice as to\nwhat kind of impact that is.\u201d\nHere are eight pieces of recent happy news to fill your\nheart with ecology hope!\nReshark\nDid you know that sharks have been on earth for over\n400 million years (longer than trees!), over 500 species\nof sharks exist worldwide, and some species living up to\nover 400 years long? They are vital for balancing aquatic ecosystems and many efforts towards repopulating\nendangered species are underway. For example, the organisation ReShark is working on restoring endangered\nzebra sharks in Indonesia. Zebra shark eggs are distributed to various aquariums globally where they are\nnursed and raised before being tagged and released into\nprotected ocean areas. With over 500 sharks currently\nin care, we hope for successful results. Other shark species await the same programme.\nSpeedy coral\nA single coral reef is capable of harbouring thousands of different species. By acting as a natural filtration system, corals captures carbon dioxide, and protects coastal areas from harsh waves. The problem is,\ncorals are highly sensitive to ocean acidification which\nbleaches corals when exposed to low pHs. Coral Vita has\ncreated a technique to grow corals up to 50 times faster\nthan normal, whilst also building the corals\u2019 resilience\nagainst ocean warming and acidification. Pieces of coral\nare harvested and split before being planted a calculated\ndistance away from each other in an aquarium. Previously attached pieces have memory of each other and\nfight to be as close together again as possible, therefore\ngrowing at much quicker rates. The coral can then be\nplanted into degraded reefs.\nSeagrass boom\nSeagrasses are heroes for our planet. They trap mi-croplastics, capture carbon and provide food, shelter\nand nursing grounds for baby fish. Despite only covering 0.1% of the seafloor, seagrass beds capture 10-18%\nof the total ocean carbon. In recent years, over 92% of\nseagrass beds around the UK have been lost due to industrial development, pollution, and disturbance of the\nocean floor, for example via bottom trawling. A project\nto restore seagrasses in Kent started this January, with\ndwarf eelgrass seeds being planted across three sites.\nLearn more about it on projectseagrass.org.\nAfrican elephants on the rise\nPopulations of endangered African elephants have\nstabilised in South Africa. Their increase in survival\nis due to improved habitat connections and reduced\npoaching. A 25-year long study monitoring 290,000\nsavannah elephants pointed to a growth rate of 0.16%\nper year, accredited to conservation efforts across 70%\nof Africa.\nActivists win in Norway!\nThis is proof that what you do matters! Young Friends\nof the Earth and Greenpeace Norway won a court case in\nJanuary, against the exploitation of three large oceanic\noil and gas fields. Despite the projects being approved\nin 2021 and 2023, and production commencing in October, Norway\u2019s climate activists appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, under the circumstances\nthat the projects were a breach of human rights during a\nclimate crisis. The court ruled in favour of the activists,\ncalling the exploitative activities illegal and halting all\nfurther development.\nCigarette roads\nCigarette butts are the most abundant form of plastic\npollution, with over 4.5 billion individual butts on Earth\nright now. They also contain toxic substances, including\narsenic and lead, which can easily seep into the ecosys-tem. Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia has become the\nfirst city in the world to use cigarette butts as a replacement for asphalt in road construction. Bins specific for\ncigarettes are abundant around the city and during the\nrecent Christmas markets, special containers suitable\nfor collecting vapes were also trialed. This not only removes the harmful environmental effects of cigarettes\nbut also tackles the pollution caused by concrete man-ufacturing.\nHap(bee) with solar farms\nThere has been growing concern about the effect of\nsolar farms on biodiversity, especially the loss of native\nhabitats. However, recent studies in the US found that\nby planting a carnival of native wildflowers amongst\nthe solar panels, a three-fold increase in insects was observed and native bee numbers jumped by a factor of 20.\nThis was also positive news for crops planted nearby as\nmore pollinators were around to promote their growth.\nPoland\u2019s fabulous forests\nPoland\u2019s beautiful forests are safe under new climate\nminister Paulina Hennig-Kloska, who has protected\n20% of Europe\u2019s most ancient and biodiverse wood-lands. In recent years high logging rates have been destroying habitats that are already under pressure, causing a disappearance in threatened species such as bison,\nbrown bears, and grey wolves. The protection of these\nforests is also a good thing for the climate as forests perform important roles as carbon sinks.\n8 triumphs in\nEcology\nENVIRONMENT\nEnvironmentWriter\nBELLE PUGH\nPoland\u2019s forests are now protected by law Adobe stock images\n\n"

This led the scientists\nto conclude that some element of the dead virulent\nbacteria was modifying the\nlive non-virulent bacteria and\nmaking it deadly.\nAfter a series of experiments\nwhich used different enzymes to\ntarget and denature specific molecules\nin the viral bacterium, the researchers found that only\nthe enzymes which destroyed DNA prevented the mice\nfrom getting sick. This meant that DNA was the cause of\nthe mice\u2019s illness.\nLater experiments such as the 1952 Hershey-Chase\nexperiment, which used radioactive forms of DNA and\nproteins to show that viruses only transmitted DNA to\nthe targeted cell, helped solidify the conclusion that\nDNA was responsible for modifying the genetic makeup\nof cells. However, it was a very controversial discovery,\nwhich took a long time to be accepted.\nProbing the role of DNA and proteins\nAt the time, biologists believed that DNA had a much\ntoo simple a structure to execute such an important\nrole. Proteins on the other hand were complex and mis-understood, which meant that they held a lot more potential for advanced functions.\nProteins are still excessively difficult to study. The\nfragile mesh of inter-molecular bonds are often disrupted by a cocktail of harsh chemical treatments before\nthey can even be analysed. However, we have finally\nbeen able to identify some of the roles of proteins. From\nacting as a viral binding site on the membranes of cells,\nto forming complex globular enzymes to catalyse the\nformation of ATP, the purposes of proteins are\nfar-reaching.\nHowever, with so many different protein structures to\nstudy and analyse, perhaps we should look\nto our forefathers for\ninspiration and focus\non more simple molecules.\nCellular lipids, for instance,\nare an understudied group of\nmolecules which could fulfil unanticipated functions.\nMaybe the cytoplasm contains the key to understanding how viruses so successfully infect their vic-tims. Maybe proteins aren\u2019t the only important mole-cules.\nDiscovered 80 years ago: DNA\ncarry genes, proteins do not\nScienceWriter\nYASMINE MARENZI\nYasmine\u2019s new column\nexplores the history\nof science, the field of\nmicrobiology, and the\ndated obsession with\nproteins.\nPictured from top to bottom are geneticists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, who demonstrated that DNA contained\na genetic element. First two: Public domain, last: Marjorie McCarty\nAt the time, biologists\nbelieved that DNA had\na much too simple a\nstructure to execute such an\nimportant role.\n\u201c\ncleanpng.com\n\n"
