Time\" put aside for clubs or societies may\nalso be cut or moved to\ninconvenient times. The controversy is further heightened by\nthe wish of the college to open up\nthe centre to the general public even\nmore. In a written note from\nGordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, referring to the 'Kensington\nSports Centre', he says that the\nCollege intends to make the centre\nself financing if not profit making.\nThe manager of the Sports Centre\nsaid that he understood that the\n\u00a3300,000 renovation would be\nfinanced by a loan from College but\ndid not deny that prices to students\nwould rise. The Athletics Clubs\nCommittee ( ACC) said that it\nbelieved that Mr Coleman was not\nremotely interested in student\nfacilities and had said so on more\nthan one occasion.\nSecurity at Imperial College is to\nbe tightened up with the installation\nof electronic pass card doors. The system will be put in place in the\nearly part of next year if approval\nis given by the heads of departments\nwho are currently reviewing the\nproposal. The system will provide\neveryone at IC with an identity card\nwith their details encoded upon it\nand this will act as a pass key to all\nor most areas of College outside of\nnormal hours. During the course of\na normal working day the cards will\nnot, as yet, be required. The card\nwill enable the system to record the\nmovements of students and staff\naround the college and possibly\nhinder particular individuals' movements by programming their\nnumber into a computer. Mr Briley,\nCollege Security Officer said that\nthe precise details of the system\ndepended on which one College\nchose. Jonathan Griffiths, Deputy\nPresident, said that 'I can't see how\nit can be detrimental to anybody.'\n- (see issue 917)\nForged \u00a310 notes have been\npassed to Union facilities in the past\ntwo weeks. Andy Flanagan, Union Bar Manager, said that such notes\nare presently flooding many parts\nof North and West London. Police\nsaid that the forgeries had no\nconnection with the \u00a35M haul of\n\u00a310 and \u00a350 notes made in Harlow,\nEssex, in the last few days and no\nsimilar reports had been received\nfrom traders in the South Kensington area.\nThe ICU Dramatic Society won\na \u00a33,000 lighting desk following\ntheir entry into a prize draw while\nrunning Theatre West End at the\nEdinburgh Fringe.

After the incident\nthe person informed the Deputy\nPresident who called College Security, they in turn called in the\nPolice. The suspect was searched\nbut the Police found no illegal\nsubstances, and he claimed that 'it\nwas a joke'.\nViolence flared outside Southside\nlast Saturday when four people\nattempted to leave the bar. Helen\nRoberts said that she had left the bar\nwith three friends and been\nconfronted by about ten men. The men hurled abuse at Ms Roberts\nand her friends and then attacked\nmembers of her group. One of them\nsuffered injuries of the face and\nstomach and the other was pinned\nto a car and punched in the back.\nA disgruntled College employee\nthrew a beer barrel through the\nwindow of a car last Wednesday\nand later trashed the car owner's office in the Sherfield Building. The\ncrime wave continued with theft of\npersonal items, a Naga computer\nprocessor worth \u00a31800 from Civil Engineering, a resuscitator and\nphials of amyl nitrate ('liquid gold')\nfrom the College ambulance, four\nbicycles and an attempted theft of\na motorbike.\nDr Jaafar Dhiah Jaafar, a former\nresearch assistant at IC is suspected\nof being a major force behind Iraq's nuclear weapons program as he\nholds the position of Vice President\nof the Baghdad Atomic Energy\nCentre.

The majority of\nthe companies, including Price\nWaterhouse, Rolls Royce, and\nBritish Telecom, thought very\nhighly of the event which had an\nestimated attendance of 5,500\nstudents.\nHolbein House residents are\ncomplaining of the state of disrepair\nof its accommodation including the\nfurniture and fittings. One postgraduate student said that 'we\nare expected to live like squatters'.\nThe College plans to close the hall\nat Easter for the rest of the year. Mr Graham Daniels, Residences Area Manager, said that he is considering\nHolbein a priority case and will be\ninitiating a project to 'rectify major\nfaults in showers' but admitted that\nfaults cannot be fixed over-night, a point proved in Holbein for at least\nthe last seven years.\nImperial College's Caroline Fox,\nDirector of Personnel, unveiled a document on the College's Equal\nOpportunities Programme which\nlays down policy on the advertising\nof job vacancies and interviewing\nprocedure.

An ambulance\nwas called and the Police interviewed the witnesses to the\nevent. After being taken to hospital\nthe leg was operated on twice. The incident has called into question the\ncurrent state of mascot ry at IC and\npreceded a meeting on the subject.\nIt is expected that from now on\nmascot ry between the CC Us of the\nCollege will take part upon campus\nonly. The Police have reported the\ndriver for reckless driving and\ndriving without due care. Mr Dorman asked the Police not to\npress charges and said that people\nin his view took mascot ry far too\nseriously.\nStudent loan applications have\nrisen since last year and has caused\na long waiting list for interviews\ncurrently lasting up to November\n25th. Last year students across the\ncountry borrowed an average of\n\u00a3338 under the loan scheme, but to\ndate 30,000 people have applied for\n\u00a3570 or more.

They\nroam the streets, but they never\nsteal or break the law (well not the\ngood laws anyway). They prey on\nsympathy, and they get it in the\nform of steamy Grey Ellison (Kelly\nLynch), a cold-hearted lawyer, after\nstaging an accident in a parking lot,\nwho buys them a meal. Alas, along\ncomes her boyfriend and that's that,\nuntil Bill later gets knocked down\nfor real, by the same person. Grey\nsuccumbs to a little voice in her\nhead (that's right, she gets\nsuckered), and she takes them\nhome.\nThe film centres around he\nrelationship with them, and slowly\nbut surely a bond grows. Trouble\ncomes in the form of Grey's boyfriend who isn't too hot with the\nsituation. This is your classic rags\nto riches, lost to love tale. Told by\nJohn Hughes (who directed and\nproduced such wonders as Home\nAlone, Uncle Buck and Ferris\nBuellers Day Off to name a few).\nThe cast is exquisitely chosen.\nAlisan Porter being one of the most\ntalented youngsters I 've ever seen,\nand the film will really make a name\nfor her, as Home Alone did for\nMacauly Culkin. Everything John Hughes touches\nseems to have an air of magic\naround it. He has made quite a name for himself and he never\ndisappoints. Curly Sue is no\nexception and is destined for fame,\ncurrently No1 in the box office in\nthe States and is bound to be just as\nsuccessful here. It doesn't really try\nto be as funny as his previous stuff.\nCurly Sue doesn't try to make any\npretences about itself\u2014but it's heartwarming stuff and has John\nHughes stamped all over it.\nThere is one problem with Curly\nSue\u2014sometimes it can get a little\ntoo sweet and mushy for your\naverage University students, I'm warning you here\u2014if you really go\nfor this (and I must admit to being\ninclined to) then you'll lap this up.\nYou' ll get a lump in your throat,\ntears will come to your eyes. If you\ndon't or if you decide to go with\nsomeone who doesn't, you' ll have\na shit time. There's always room\nfor another John Hughes film,\nespecially around this time of year\nwhen everyone goes a bit soft.\nGreat for the family, but if you're\nhard, give it a miss.\nPoo. The Liar Witches Abroad\nThe sleeve says of Adrian Healey\n' He loves the delicious Hugo\nCartwright, but is loved by the less\nthan app et ising Pigs Trotter'. These\nare the main influences on the late\nadolescent life of a boy who\nStephen Fry seems to enjoy\nimplying is typical of one in public\nschool. True or not, he'd know\nbetter than I. His tastes include fine wine, toast\nwith lemon curd, an impressive\nrepertoire of sexual deviance s( and\nalso with other boys) and cricket.\nAll this hardly is preparation for\nthe time following his expulsion\nfrom school including rent boys,\ncocaine and cheating at the noblest\nof all games. Even worse, he is then\nled into university, a lost piece of\npornographic Dickens, violent\nmurder, international espionage and\na college fellowship.\nIt's a book which is annoying for\nits chronological fragmentation and\nexcessively self-indulgent language.\nAlso it may be a little too blatant for\nsome homophobic types. Otherwise\nit's hilariously funny, unpredictable\nand frequently very cringe worthy. Certainly worth reading.\nRomeo. The arrival of a new book by Terry\nPratchett is always greeted with glee\nby his fans. The most recent,\nWitches Abroad, is no exception.\nThe novel treads familiar ground\nfor those conversant with\nPratchett's work, using several\ncharacters and situations borrowed\nfrom the earlier books. The plot is\nsimple; three witches must travel to\nprevent a mad fairy godmother\nfrom warping the life of a poor\nkitchen drudge (Emberella). The humour is dispensed with a heavy\nhand and if the jokes fall flat at least\nthey come in large numbers.\nDedicated followers of Pratchett's work will no doubt rejoice in all the\npan to style gags and in-jokes but the\ncasual reader my derive less\namusement from the tired, stale\nformat and weary reworking of\nother stories. This book bears all the\nhallmarks of a bored author\npandering to an uncritical audience,\nparticularly sad considering the\npromise of the first books in the\nDiscWorld series and the impact\nthey had. Avoid this novel unless\nyou are willing to suspend critical\nfaculties and reread the earlier stuff.\nNicholas Farrow. \u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

With the\namount of dialogue, it is really the\nTo a London student a market is a lifeline: cheap food, clothes and\ninexpensive presents can keep you\ngoing when the cash refuses to. To make the most of your one day\ntravel card we tour London's best\nknown markets.\nPortobello Road is situated near\nNotting Hill Gate Tube Station and\nis most famous for its antiques\nmarket. This is held on Saturdays\nand due to its fame is also packed\nwith tourists.\nThe antiques market is at the\nsouth end of Portobello Road sells\na range of tacky 'antiques' and\nsilverware at reasonable prices but\ncashing in are bus kers and other\ntourist stalls. This part of the market\nis also crowded with pickpockets,\nso be careful!\nThe further north along Portobello road you go, the more\nlike an ordinary market it becomes,\nselling fruit, ve g and second-hand\nclothes. At the top of Portobello\nroad the stalls merge with those\nfrom Westbourne Grove market.\nThe atmosphere is good but if you\nlook anything like a tourist, prepare\nto be ripped off.\nPortobello Road also has the\nElectric Cinema half way along, as\nwell as 'Strange Attractors', a shop\nmusical of 1874, an operetta.\n'No-one likes a bat,' but it was\nas a bat (die Fledermaus) that Dr Faulke was disguised, had rather\ntoo much to drink and was left to\nsleep it off under a bush by his\n'friend', Eisenstein. The Doctor\nwas then left to return home\npublicly in costume to much jeering. This is the story of his\nrevenge...\nEisenstein is due to be\nincarcerated for five days on a charge of insulting a ticket inspector\nwhilst his wife's ridiculous court er is perched precariously on the sill\noutside waiting for his moment to\ndedicated to the art of chaotic\nmathematics. The market is open\nevery day except Thursday and so\nis always good for a visit.\nOne of the world's best known\nmarkets is Petticoat Lane but has\nbecome over popular with tourists\nwhich has changed its character, to\na series of souvenir stalls.\nThe first thing to remember about\nPetticoat Lane is that it doesn't exist, it is in fact Middlesex Street\nand the streets off it and is only\nopen on Sunday mornings. The nearest Tubes are Liverpool St. and\nAldgate, at the north and south\nrespectively of the market.\nDuring the winter, the market\ndoesn't really open until ten o 'clock\nbecause it's cold and the store\nowners can't be bothered. When it\ndoes open, beware the Tourist stalls\nselling Union Jacks and false\npoliceman's hats. Past this there is\na fruit and ve g market and some\nsecond hand army and navy wear\nat good prices.\nThe leather market which makes\n- ENO\nleap into his sweetheart's arms.\nEisenstein's wife, Rosalinda, is\nperplexed by her sonorous suitor,\nbut seizes her chance for a night\nwith him by allowing her maid,\nAdele, the night off to visit her\n'dying' aunt. These deceits are just\na ploy, by all, including Eisenstein,\nto secretly attend the ball that night\nheld by Prince Orlofsky. As may be\nsupposed, much comic foolery and\ndeception ensues as husband and\nwife unknowingly flirt with their\npartners and assumed identities flow\nas freely as the champagne.\nThe production is everything that\nstars are born for. Feathered\nchorus-girls abound as does the\nglitter and, of course, the\nchampagne. The audience do not\nescape this pantomime. The Prince's pet gorilla certainly startled\nmost people in the front rows.\nFenella Fielding (yes, that's her real\nname) provided an enlightening\ninterval course in ' How To Prepare\nApfelstrudeT (...and here is one I prepared earlier, with the obligatory\nwine - or was it Wien?) and we\nwere cajoled through a game-show\nboard into wearing masks. It was\nonly to hide our identities and\nprevent incrimination following the\nPetticoat Lane famous is at the\nAldgate end of Middlesex street. It\nis a marquee covered with leather\nand sheepskin wear as soon as you\nenter the sellers will descend on you\nusing the greatest hard sell tactics\nin the world to make you buy their\nclothes. Stay cool and ignore the\nblatant sexism if you're female,\nremember they are desperate to sell\nto you, not you to buy from them.\nRemember to hide your A to Z again; if anyone thinks you are a tourist the prices double. Also, as\nstudents you look like you're poor;\ntry and bargain or pretend you don't have enough money, it can be worth\nit.\nIf you are in Petticoat lane then\nif you walk a little further east you\nwill arrive at Brick Lane market.\nHere there is no way you would be\nrecognised as a tourist; all that\npeople want is your money. Brick\nLane runs parallel but further east\nof Petticoat Lane. The tubes, again\nnorth and south of the market, are\nShoreditch and Aldgate East.\nparticularly wild party that ensued.\nSome dreadful character, having\nthrust empty bottle into every nook\nand cranny of a figurine's anatomy,\nhad gone so far as to graffiti a moustache and glasses on her fair\nform. As may be imagined, everyone drinks plenty of alcohol\nand becomes VERY good friends.\nThe famed Lesley Garrett sings\nAdele. The prison officer, at least,\nwas enticed by her high C's and she\nstrips willingly for him - only to\ndemonstrate her aptitude for acting,\nof course. Her voice is lively and\nexcitable, if a little forced in the\nlower register thus making for a still\nmore 'musical' operetta. But the\nheroine was Vivian Tierney( Rosalinda) with her outrageous\naccent and infallible voice. Also of\nnote, if only for his shoddily\ndisappointing entries, was the\nsinging teacher (Anthony Mee),\nwhich made the character all the\nmore hilarious. The orchestra was\nindeed danced throughout under\nAdam Fischer who made the\ninevitable waltz intoxicating as the\ngirls and pony pranced on.\nThis is a wonderful show for an\nevening of laughter - don't forget\nthe champagne!\nDie Fledermaus continues until\nFebruary 10. Tickets cost from\n\u00a36.50 to \u00a343 but standby tickets are\navailable on the day of the\nperformance at \u00a34.\nThe market proper extends east\nand west of Brick Lane, with its\nmain body selling standard fruit and\nve g and some furniture.\nThe East side is like a junk\nmarket with scrap yards and\nchildren selling their old toys in the\nstreet. There is also a large number\nof people selling very cheap items\nfrom large bags. These are not all\nentirely legal but if you want a very\ncheap cigarette lighter then take\nyour own risks.\nThe west side contains a lot of hardware and sweet stalls. If you\nfind it, there is also a large bike stall\nwhere the bikes are very cheap\nindeed. This may be due to the fact\nthat most of the bikes are stolen but\nthat could just be cynicism on my\npart.\nAnother reason to go to Brick\nLane is the number of very cheap\nIndian Restaurants and sweet shops\nbut these are not open on Sunday\nwhen the rest of the market is.\nJonty The A&G King.\nBricks & Petticoats\n\u2014 9 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "1\n1 December1991 Felix 920 Feature\nSeasoning of Good Will\nby Alison Pool.\nSpare a thought for the festive\nseason's most prominent victim this\nChristmas.\nThe turkey is a relatively late\naddition to the list of factory farmed\nspecies, but now represents the\nlargest 'growth industry' amongst\nmeat products. Once considered a luxury, turkey has become a convenience consumer product,\nlargely since it was discovered that\nwith added colouring and flavouring\nit will take the taste of almost any\nkind of meat, and is cheaper to\nproduce. In the 25 years up to 1988\nannual turkey production in the UK increased from three million to 33.5\nmillion. Last year the Christmas\nmarket consumed 16.5 million\nbirds.\nFor those familiar with the\nconditions under which most table\nchickens are kept, the situation for\nturkeys is very similar. In the most\nmodern units approximately 20,000\nbirds are reared in one building,\npartitioned into four sections of5,000 birds. Typical stocking\ndensities are 1.25sq ft per turkey up\nto 8 weeks old, 2.5sq ft up to 16\nweeks and 3.5sq ft over 16 weeks.\nThese cramped conditions are\nnevertheless slightly better than\nthose for chickens. This is mainly\nbecause turkeys do not scratch\naround in the litter which will\ntherefore degrade more rapidly.\nThe litter is not changed once over\nthe full 26 weeks.\nThe foul ammonia-ridden litter\ncauses burns and ulceration s. 'Genetic improvements' have led to\nfaster growing and greedier birds\nwhich are fed on a high protein diet\nbased on soya and grains. Often the\nbirds' skeleton does not keep up\nwith this rate of growth, to the point\nthat 8 0 % of male breeding turkeys\nbecome lame, suffering irreversible\ndiseases of the hip joints. Weak individuals are frequently trampled\nto death.\nDue to this highly unnatural\nenvironment, turkeys, like chickens, take out their frustrations\non their neighbours. Left to their\nown devices, they will devour each\nother. Instead of addressing the\ncentral problem, the factory farmer\nsimply adds to the cruelty. Turkeys\nare routinely de beaked at five days\nusing a red-hot blade. Sometimes\nthe upper mandible is cut back so\nseverely that the nostrils are\ndamaged. No anaesthetic is used\nand the process, even if carried out\nproperly, is thought to cause\nimmense pain both during, and for\na long while after. Breeding turkeys\nsuffer the same agony a second time\nat 14-18 weeks. Where de be a king is not carried out, the birds are kept\nin near darkness in order to pacify\nthem.\nThe modern genetically improved\nmale turkey is so heavy and broad-breasted that it is no longer even\ncapable of mating with the much\nsmaller female. Insemination is now\nalmost entirely carried out\nartificially, causing much pain to\nboth sexes.\nAt the end of their short\n'commercial life' (a maximum of 26\nweeks for a table turkey) the birds\nare transferred to the 'processing\nplant'. Simply being uprooted from\nsuch a fully controlled environment\nis a shock in itself. The fragile birds\nare insensitively packed into crates\naboard lorries which sometimes\noffer no protection from the\nweather and which may travel\nunlimited distances.\nAt the processing plant turkeys\nare hung upside down by their legs\non a shackle line, and taken on a conveyor belt system to their\ndeaths. The law allows turkeys to\nbe hung in this way for up to six\nminutes. An average breeding male\nat the end of its 'useful' life weighs\n601bs, equivalent to an eight or nine\nyear old child.\nEventually the birds reach a stunning apparatus. This usually\nconsists of a water-bath charged\nwith a low level electric current.\nSome ten to thirty seconds after\nimmersion in the bath the birds pass\non to the (usually automatic) throat\nslitter, before finally being dropped\ninto a scalding tank.\nThere is widespread concern that\nmany birds are not adequately\nstunned. Even though im mobilised they may still be sentient. Low voltages of80 to 90 volts are used\ndeliberately because producers\nargue that birds do not 'bleed out'\nproperly if they die before their\nthroats are cut. Slight differences in\nsize or minimal movement by the\nbirds can prevent them from being\nstunned at all. For the same reasons\nthe throat slitter may miss altogether, or cut across the skull.\nWith more than 1000 turkeys\npassing through each hour, the\nback-up killer is unlikely to notice\nall of these 'accidents', which are,\nto varying degrees, everyday\noccur en ces. It has to be assumed\nthat thousands of birds came to an\nagonising end in the scalding tank.\nIntead of wrestling with your\nconscience over the roast this\nChristmas, why not try one of the\nalternatives? The most ethical\nsolution is, of course, the traditional\nvegetarian yuletide feast\u2014the nut\ncutlet. For those of us not prepared\nto go so far, there remains the\noption of free-range turkeys.\nThough most suffer the same\npainful end, the quality of life\nleading up to this moment is vastly\nsuperior.\nMost supermarkets do at least\nstock frozen free-range turkeys at\nChristmas. The most highly respected brand for free range\npoultry at the moment is probably\n'Label Rouge' from France.\nAnyone interested in animal\nwelfare issues should contact the\nEnvironmental and Appropriate\nTechnology Soceity or the\nfollowing organisations:\nCompassion in World Farming, the\nRSPCA or, regarding poultry in\nparticular, Chicken Lib. A recipe\nfor nut cutlets is displayed on the\nENTS noticeboard.\n\u201413\u2014\n\n"

In the\nimproved cell thin layers of semiconductor material only 50 atoms\nthick are added to the surface to\nform 'quantum wells' which trap\nhigher energy electrons than\nnormal. The process is so effective\nthat a cell with 50 quantum wells\nis twice as efficient as one with 30.\nThe Rag total is now \u00a312,700 and\nmany people are suffering because\ngrants from Local Education Authorities ( LEAs) are late. More thefts occurred including another\nNaga computer, and still no\nconnecting evidence has been\nfound.\n9 ir Friday\nI01 November\nA fire started in a lift in Southside\nat about 2am last Saturday is being\ntreated as arson by the Police who\ninvestigated the incidence. It is\nbelieved that this incident is the\nthird attempt to cause a serious fire\nin the building in the same location\nand possess a serious threat to the\ninhabitants of the hall. A letter from\nthe warden of the halls, Dr John\nHassard said that if the fire had been\ndiscovered five minutes later it\nwould not have been extinguished.\nIn this instance one end of the hall\nwas filled with smoke from burning\nplastic. Residents are said to be\nfurious about the lack of safety in\nthe hall which is a culmination of\nfaulty fire alarms, missing fire\nextinguishers and the presence of\nonly one security guard.\nA dispute has arisen between\nsome of the clubs and societies\ntreasures and the Union because of\na document that they must sign\nmaking them liable for fiscal losses\nincurred by their organisations. One\ntreasurer has resigned and three\nother people have yet to sign the\ndocument which also includes the\nhead of each group.\nFollowing the accident last week\nduring a mascot ry attempt all\nvehicles are banned from being\nused during such an event. A meeting of the CC Us about the\nincident concluded that since\nvehicles are 'harder than even\nrugby players' they should be\ntotally excluded from mascot ry. Various other changes have been\nmade to make the matter more of\na sport rather than a battle and\nimprove the situation rather than to\nend it, as proposed in a letter from\nSir Eric Ash.

The changes which meant overall voting\ncontrol lay with Management\nnominated representatives only was\nfound to be technically illegal under\nthe Government Health and Safety\nregulations. The procedure was\nseverely disliked by the trade unions\nwithin college who threatened to\nbreak away and form their own\nsafety council. Management said\nthat the council only 'advised' the\nRector so any changes had no real\neffect. This reaction was hotly\ncontested by the unions who\ndeclared that 'Safety is not\nnegotiable'.\nAt the U GM held yesterday less\nthan 30 students attended posing the\nthought that 9 9 . 6 % of the student\nbody are totally content with the\noperation of the Student's Union.

In a letter sent\nto staff by Mr Marshall he stated\nthat due to a 'need to modernise\nsystems' the College was proposing\nto 'contract out of the whole of this\narea of operations'. Derek Dollard\nof the Manufacturing Science and\nFinance Trade Union( MSF) called\nfor the unions to 'shut down this\nplace on the day of the Governing\nBody meeting(4 th December) subject to the result\nof a ballot, of course.' No consultation has yet taken place\nwith the unions or staff and\nalthough the proposal is now open\nto discussion for a period of one\nmonth it was stated that College is\nunlikely to change it's decision,\naccording to Marketing Director\nSteven Newbold. Staff may be\nredeployed within college or the\nUniversity of London, allowed to\ntake voluntary redundancy or have\ncompulsory redundancy forced\nupon them. Sue Sharp, IC MSF Secretary, said of the situation that\n'it didn't look hopeful.\nThe Fire Brigade were called out\nlast Friday when Departmental\nSuperintendent, Colin Rogers, set\noff a fire alarm to clear the\nMechanical Engineering Building.\nMr Rogers was manning the\nmessengers desk while a trade\nunion meeting was taking place and\nset the alarm off to clear the\nbuilding prior to locking up for the\nweekend. Sherfield security was not\ninformed of his method before-hand\nand assuming a real alert called the\nfire services. Mr Rogers told Felix\nthat 'he did not think anything when\nhe saw the fire engines, since fire\nengines are continually driving up\nand down Exhibition Road' and\nadded that on reflection he was\n'acutely embarrassed' and would\n'do it better next time.'\nThe final stages of the Claypond\nsite is to be sold to Imperial College\nResidences PLC( Impress - a BE S scheme) when building is completed\nin about two weeks.

The Rector was accompanied by Angus\nFraser, Gordon Marshall, John\nArcher and Steven Newbold, all\nfrom the College hierarchy. People\nasked about the financial stability of\nthe college which was described as\n'stable' although the reserves were\n'zilch' ^and they questioned the\nreplacement of security staff. The Rector would not be pressed on this\nmatter and would not pass it on to\nany of the other directors. He said\nthat student numbers country wide should be increased and that some\nworking through college was a good\nidea, as in the States, adding that\nstudent benefits over the summer\nwere diabolical.\nStaff members of the major trade\nunions have voted for strike action\non the date of the Governing Body\nmeeting on the 4th December to\nprotest against the colleges proposal\nto contract out security and other\nservices. Many academics have\nbegun to support the dispute and\nsome, including Professor Bruce\nSayers, Dean of City Guilds College, have sent letters to Angus\nFraser, Managing Director, and the\nRector.\nFollowing allegations of drug\npeddling in Bernard Sunley House\na janitor faces disciplinary proceedings.

    "content": "1\n1 December1991 Felix 920 Reviews\nThe35 th London Film Festival\ncame to town during mid November, loaded with over 200\nfilms from all around the world.\nWell, so many films so little time,\nand not enough do sh. There are big\nnames, including Point Break and\nFrankie and Johnny, but the jewels\nof the Festival are probably obscure\nproductions.\nLet's kick off with what must surely\nhave been one of the best films at\nthe festival\u2014Urga, directed by\nNikita Mikhalov. Urga is a FrenchRussian co-production, filmed in\nMongolia. Mikhalov weaves a goofy tale in which little of\nconsequence ever comes to pass.\nAnd yet it captures the imagination\nlike few other films I have seen. It\nreally is a strikingly beautiful\nA treat for Hindi film fans must\nhave been the appearance of demi-god Amita bh Bach chan, interviewed by the rather bland\nDerek Malcolm from the Guardian,\nBachchan did his best to enliven the\naudience. Ah, but Amitabh, we\nmust surely be eternally thankful for\nyour very presence!\nA lot of film critics (yes, we had\nspies in the Press Tent) voted Raise\nthe Red Lantern as their favourite,\nand so did I( Su). This new film\nfrom Chinese director Zhang Yi mou resembles his last,\nacclaimed, film (Ju Dou) in the way\nthat both of them depict how\nwomen were suppressed under the\npatriarchal Chinese society during\nthe early 19th Century. The story\nis set in the reputable Chen clan this\nif it were not for 'Life on a string'.\nCompared with Raise the Red\nLantern, Life on a String is not as\ncommercial, but viewers will\ncertainly be captured by the\nstunning photography offered by\ndirector Chen Kaige. It's about the\nmagic of believing and the\nemotional struggles of being highly\nrespected. The film, however, over\nuses symbolism, but this is really\nnothing compared with the\nmagnificent scenarios. For someone\nwho wants a feast for their eyes.\nIf Martial Arts is your favourite\nthing, then Once Upon a Time in\nChina should not be missed. It's a typical action-packed film from\nHongKong, with surprisingly,\npolitical and satirical undertones\nand is about the legendary\nwith his family intending to\nintroduce him to his son. Except for\nsome open gay sex scenes, this is\nmore suitable for the small screen.\nThe Grass Arena is a real gem and\ncertainly looks like a real film.\nAdapted from the fascinating\nautobiography of John Healy, it\nstarts with his youth as a boxer\nbecause of influence from his\nviolent father, then switches\nbetween his descent into alcoholism\nand his rehabilitation, and finally\ndetails his career as a successful\nchess player. With an unusual lifes tory, some outstanding performances and a neat direction,\nthis film stands out miles ahead of\nthe others. Highly recommended.\nFrench film lovers should be\nsatisfied with the varieties of French\nLondon Film Festiva\nfilm\u2014Mikhalov making full use of\nthe undulating Mongolian landscape\nand adding his own flighty images\nand dreamscape s. In a lesser league, but very much\nknowingly so, stands Nicholas De Jacob's The Refigerator. A spoof\nhorror movie complete with\nmorality twists, it concerns the all\nconsuming desires of are fig era to r(i.e. the American or capitalist way\nof life). Eileen and Steve Bateman\nmove into their apartment in a seedier part of New York, hoping\nto 'make it' without falling into all\nthe associated traps of 'success'.\nBut very quickly Steve and Eileen\nare changed by the city, and their\nrelationships are distorted by the\naforementioned appliance...( coming to an ICA near you).\nTwo films from which one might\nhave expected more were John\nSayle's City of Hope and Errol\n(Thin Blue Line) Morris's The\nDark Wind. Sayle's film (which\nmay be compared un favourably with Do the Right Thing) tackles the\nissue of race relations in a crumbling American city. The film\ntends to ramble since Sayle insists\non representing every member of\nthe community and thus diluting the\nwhole effect. Morris's film just fails\nas a good thriller.\nA guy on top form, though, was\nPaul Cox, with his follow-up to The\nGolden Braid\u2014A Woman's Tale.\nThe film deals un sentimentally but\nwith complete passion with the\nadvent of old age.\nMira Nair's superb debut (Salam\nBombay) was followed up by her\nHollywood debut\u2014Mississippi\nMasala with tons of groovy music,\nexcellent script, big names (well,\nDenzel Washington) the film should\ndo very well at the box office.\ntime, where Songlian (played by the\nstriking Gong Li again) is sent as\nFourth Mistress to the master, and\nthe film continues with the rivalries\nbetween the mistresses and the\nmaster's favourite until a shocking\nclimax when one of the mistresses\nis found committing adultery.\nInstead of the wonderful contrast of\ncolours like in Ju Dou, director\nZhang Y mou this time uses space\nand decor to create the tense\natmosphere in the BIG house. Sex\nhas never been depicted in such a subtle but revealing way before, for\nexample, when the camera focused\non the facial expression of Songlian\nwho,is imagining herself being foot-' massaged by one of the maids. A sophisticated thriller with an\nexcellent cast.\nIn fact, it may be the film from\nChina to be nominated for the best\nforeign film in the Oscars next year\nCantonese hero who has been\nportrayed in more than 90 Hong\nKong films since the late 40s. Brilliant entertain ent and it's already a box office smash in Hong\nKong. This year's Spanish box office hit\n(according to the producer himself),\nis also in the Festival. Lovers (aka\nAmantes) revolves around a young\nofficer's relationship with his\nfiancee Trini (Maribel Verdu), who\nis still a virgin and his landlady\nLuisa (Victoria Abril), who offers\nhim wild sex and love. Eventually\nhe surrenders to Luisa and kills\nTrini to help Luisa to kill his\nfiancee. But then this is a real life\nstory. Victoria Abr il was awarded\nbest actress in Berlin for this film,\nthough in my opinion, Maribel\nVer du offers a more remarkable\nperformance. The Dutch film An\nIndecent Woman is another erotic\ndrama who tells the affair of a married woman with a stranger.\nThe special point of the film is that\nthe story is told from the woman's point of view, and therefore there\naren't any moral judgements which\nare always expected in other films.\nThere are also some made-for-TV broadcast films including The\nLost Language of the Cranes and\nThe Grass Arena. The former is\nabout a family with a gay father\n(Brian Cox), who is a university\nlecturer and has been in the closet\nfor many years, his secretive wife\n(Eileen Atkins) and their son Owen\n( Angus Mac Fay den). Strong performances are offered, particularly Brian Cox, when he is\nconfronted with the truth that his\nson is also gay. The story however\nbecomes a bit hilarious when the\nfather deliberately invites his\nyoung, straight colleague to dinner\nfilms offered, including Aux Veux\nDu Monde and Merci La Vie, both\nof which feature the up and coming\nactress Charlotte Gainsbourg. A special mention about the film Aux\nVeux Du Monde (directed by Eric\nRochant) is that its main character\nis one of the best anti-heroes\nportrayed in film history so far. He kidnaps a school bus and thinks this\nwill impress his girlfriend! The kids\nin the film offer a livening atmosphere to the film.\nSomething that has to be said\nabout the Festival is that there are\nmany substandard films like The\nSoultaker and Liquid Dreams. The only good thing about The\nSoultaker is its quotes: ' Led Zeppelin was wrong. There is no\nstairway to heaven'. It's even a compliment to say it's a piss-take\nof Ghost. Liquid Dreams has some\nstylish decor, but is let down by a poor script.\nEnough bad words said about the\nquality of the films chosen. Here\nare some other films which have not\nbeen covered, but have very good\nhypes during the festival:\nBetty's Brood (Scotland)\nA Brighter Summer Day\n(Taiwan)\nDelicatessen (France)\nHearts of Darkness\u2014A Film\nMakers Apocalypse (USA)\nProof (Australia)\nToto the Hero (Belgium)\nI nearly forgot to mention the\nbrilliant trailer of the Film Festival\ndirected by Mike Leigh. Hopefully\nthe London Film Festival will be\neven better next year.\nI.H.A. Limb with\nEx D.J.S. Su.\n\u2014 7\n\n"

Both during the\nday and night, there's much to do\nand see and a place which is\nbuzzing with sound and energy is\nthe Jazz Cafe on Parkway, which\nis open every night and offers\nweekend lunches, with the beat of\nfunky music and live acts whilst you\nenjoy the buffet lunch. The owner\nJohn Davner has done a brilliant job\non the resurrection of the venue and\nmost rate it along with Ronnie\nScotts, but in my opinion it's a 'where it's at' or 'the happening\nplace' and to support this, I spent\nSaturday lunchtime there eating and\nloitering to the music of The Hip\nJoints (who incidentally have played\nat IC), in their two afternoon\nsessions.\nThe band have been together\naround nine months and are very\nfunky in sound where each member\nis inclined to his own rhythmic\nmovements and noise, which all\njoin to form a unique beat and bass\nfunk.

    "content": "Editorial Felix 920 1\n1 December1991 editorial\nThis issue has been a complete\nnightmare to bring out. Everything\nthat could go wrong has -particularly the front and back cover\nwhich was aston kingly good idea\nbut had problems in execution as\nyou may notice. Having visited the\ncircus troupe ' Ar chaos' this week\n1 have been sorely tempted to run\naway with them and meet a fire y but\nglorious end by flame thrower.\nThe primary intent of the centre\npage 'Son Of God' section was to\nentertain, not to cause offence,\nthough I'm sure it has done the\nlatter as well. I tend to be an\nextreme follower of the notion of free speech - that nothing is too\nsacred to make fun of. This does not\nnecessarily mean that I have no\nrespect for people with religion,\nthough it does mean I have no\nrespect for religion per se.\nReactions from religious people to\nsuch blasphemy - as they see it - can\nrange from the acceptance that other\npeople have different views through\npraying for my soul to the totally\nridiculous second hand rhetoric and\nbible quoting which is indicative of\na complete lack of original thought.\nI hope that you find it fun.\nOh What A Hat He's Got\nFleming Heino has very kindly\na quire da small cotton baseball cap\nfor me to eat. I am working through\nit tiny piece by tiny piece as\nanything larger than four square\ncentimetres at a time gives me\nindigestion.

I shall be calling in my\ndebts when I 've finished it.\nRevenge of the Fir Cones\nThe College management has been\nheavily criticised in the national\nmedia recently. In addition, the fact\nthat the security situation went to a strike is highly indicative of a confrontational approach on their\npart. Two letters from concerned\nacademics have found their way\ninto the Felix office, the general\ntenor of which indicates that\nCollege management acts in a heavy\nhanded and overbearing manner.\nThey seem incapable of accepting\nthe validity of any other point of view. Sir Eric Ash told me that in\nhis view the generalised criticism\nwhich has come his way is of no use\nas it addresses no specific points.\nI feel that it is fairly obvious what\nthese specific points are: the\nCollege administration rarely\ncommunicates with the lower\nechelons of College and when it does\nit ignores them. Proof? The halls of residence have needed better\nsecurity for a long time. A year or\nso ago there were a series of rapes\nin other college residences, and an\nattempted rape at a St. Mary's hall\n(Wilson house I believe it was). The\nwardens have been asking for more\nsecurity as a major priority for ages.\nAnd nothing happens. At the\nbeginning of this year a lift was\ndeliberately set on fire in Southside\n- we don't know whether it was a resident or somebody from outside,\nand nor shall we because there were\nnot enough security guards to keep\nunwanted visitors out. The college\nday - when the administration was\npersuaded to hold a student\nreferendum they completely ignored the result. The Management' s responsibilities obviously include fiscal management, but not to the\nexclusion of all else.\nFelix dinner\nIt seemed like a good idea to\narrange this year's Felix dinner in\na country pub somewhere - at the\nmoment the prime location is\nChalfont St Giles at the northern\nend of the Metropolitan line in\nSouth Buckinghamshire - and as I would like to recon no it re the pub\nbeforehand but do not have time to\narrange things before Christmas, it\nwill occur, if it occurs at all, at the\nbeginning of next year, and it is\npossible that the price of the meal\nwill be sub sidi sed with the option\nof a mini-bus there and back for\nthose who require it and a youth\nhostel nearby for those who don't.

Captain Rax Muthoo took some\nextraordinary measures for the\nspecial occasion. He drove the\nminibus carefully (staying well\nclear of diesel pumps), drafted in\nfootballing supremo Dave Buckle to\nreplace the injured Nigel Clough\nand even convinced the referee to\ngive a pre-match team talk.\nThe game itself had a peculiar\nbeginning, with Imperial's vintage\nleft-back Stuart Miller experiencing\na Van Goghian moment of folly.\nNot content with blasting the ball\ntowards his own goal, he passed it\nto an oncoming opposition player\nafter goal-keeper Steve Shilling had\nsaved his suicidal shot. It took a defective net, a firm referee and a conjuring trick from canny Eamon McCann to deprive St Mary's of a legitimate first goal. However, the\nopposition's cynical football style,\ntypical of medical schools, coupled\nwith a loud and hostile crowd (later\nbooked by the referee), put the most\nintellectual team at IC under\npressure and eventually gave St\nMary's the lead.\nIn the second half Imperial gained\nconfidence and composure with\nSimon Barry scoring two goals. But\nthe team dramatically weakened\nsoon after, when Buckle suffered a bloody head injury. He was\nsandwiched between two opposition\nskulls and had to leave the\nbattlefield clutching his bucket. IC\nwere still shocked by the loss of\ntheir heroic warrior when St Mary's grabbed the equalise r. Shilling pulled off stunning saves,\nRichard Burrows and Ian Finnerty\ndefended with authority, and Tellis\nBotzios fought hard in midfield\nenabling Imperial to keep the score\nlevel till the end. After the game\nsome members of the opposition\nkindly offered to medicate Buckle's injury but this was'politely declined\ndue to the apparent state of\ninto x if i cation of the former. Ironically, the matter was\neventually stitched up at the St\nMary's Hospital casualty department.\nThe 2nds were back at Harlington\non the following Saturday. They\nmaintained their unbeaten run of\nseven matches by defeating\nGoldsmiths College III by 6-2 in the\nquarter finals of the UL U Upper\nReserves Cup. It was a classic game\nof two halves with the score\nstanding at 5-2 at half time.\nThere was a forceful performance\nby Chris Collinson, while the\nrecovered Max Duckworth and\nNigel Clough were a welcome sight\non the.field. McCann was a catalyst\nin many passing move which\nbrought back memories of Holland\n1974. Muthoo scored a goal, Jason\nDevoys got two (including a superb\nlob) and Barry managed his second\nhat-rick of the season. Once again\nhe experienced the magic of the\nCup, and the road to Motspur Park\nis just round the corner.\nEmphatic Fourths? Conquering VI\nLast Saturday saw IC IV complete\nthe double over IC V in emphatic\nstyle. Piyush scored an absolute\npeach of a goal from just outside the\narea giving IC IV the lead early on\nin the first half. The game saw new\nfirsts with Fem mi Davis managing\nto get a shot on target and a pre-match talk from the captain that\neveryone understood.\nI CIV sat on their lead in the\nsecond half rarely venturing into the\nother half. Some players such as D Buckle resorted to time wasting, by\npretending to have a heart attack.\nBut this proved to be unnecessary\nas IC V only managed to get one\nshot on target, despite their\nterritorial advantage.\nOver the curry at the end of the\ngame, the team decided that victory\nwould have been even easier had the\ncaptain included himself in the two\nsubstitutions made at half time. The\ncaptain just smiled to himself and\nmade a mental note of the number\nof penalty points that would be\nneeded at the club dinner.\nLast Saturday IC VI conquered\nRoyal London Hospital II to gain\nonly their third league victory this\nyear. Disregarding previous defeats\nlike 17-0 and 6-1, IC VI played well\nto overcome a weakened 10-man\nopposition. Even with a damp team\nkit Omar Jamal and Sam ' The Greek' Karam managed a hat-rick\neach while Roy Ok el also scored\ntwo; Ray displayed an amazing\nreluctance to ever pass the ball once\nhe had obtained it, as did James\nWilton Ely. The defence played well throughout most of the match,\nalthough one outstanding moment\ncame when Tom Parker placed the\nball superbly past his own goalkeeper, Dave M cCl use, to\nscore his first (own) goal of the\nseason.\nSPORTS RESULTS\nFOOTBALL\nULU Challenge Cup:\nIC I71 Kings College Hosp.\nULU Upper Reserves Cup\nIC II 6-2 Goldsmiths III\nLeague:\nIC II 2-2 St Mary's Hosp.\nIC IV 1-0 IC V IC VI 8-2 Royal London Hosp.\nIC I23 UC I IC II 7-1 MXUCH I IC IV 6-2 QMWC IV\nIC V41 KCH II\nWOMEN'S FOOTBALL\nUAU:\nDribblers VIII 0-7 Sussex XI\nCANOE POLO\nCompetition;\nIC 0-6 Nottingham\nIC 2-3 Bangor\nNETBALL (League)\nImperial 32-29 RHBNC\nICU Bookstore-M/ fj starts 6 Jan 1991\nLeague Proposal\nO yer the past term, member\nsocieties of the Overseas Students\nCommittee have been playing each\nother in friendly 11-a side football\ngames. As a result of these matches,\nthe OS C decided they would\nattempt to organise a league for next\nterm, encompassing all the OS C societies that would be willing to\nparticipate. And from funds\navailable, they would provide a trophy and medals for the winners.\nHowever, upon hearing this, I thought it may be an idea to open\nup this league to all members\nsocieties of Imperial College Union\n(with the obvious exception of the\nfootball club). If such a league is set\nup, it may then be possible to entice\noutside corporations to sponsor it.\nThis would go some way in\nalleviating some of the setting up\nand running costs of such a league,\nwhilst also offering the sponsor(s) a good opportunity to gain a lucrative advertising market.\nThe league would most likely\nconsist of two groups, with the top\ntwo teams from each group playing\nit out to find out who would be\nChampions. At present we have\neight OS C societies interested in\nparticipating. Hence there is room\nfor more teams.\nSo if you think your society\npossess a brilliant football team and\nwould like to get involved in such\na league next term, then please\ncome forward. All you have to do\nis to get in contact with me before\nl pm Tueday 17th December.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 920 1\n1 December1991 The issues surrounding the continuing contretemps in the\nMiddle East continue to rumble on.\nIn the recent past the IC Anti War in the Gulf Society (now the 'Just\nPeace in the Middle East Society,\nICJPME) hosted a debate on the\nsubject between Mr John Gee, a member of the PLO-sponsored\nPalestinian Solidarity Group, and\nBassem Al Jamal, a member of the\nPalestinian Liberation Organisation\n( PLO). Lee Matthews, treasurer of\nICA WIGS, entered the\nconversation in a letter to Felix in\nissue 918.\nTheir interesting use of the word\n'debate' is axiomatic of the double-attacked by Iraq and not to fight\nback.\nYassir Arafat said last January:\nsay welcome, welcome to\nwar...Iraq and Palestine represent\na common will. We will be side by\nside and after the great battle, God\nwilling, we will pray together in\nJerusalem...the Iraqi fighters and\nthe Palestinian stone throwers have\nan appointment with victory.'\n(Associated Press, 27 January\n1991)\nArafat's support for Hussein\nshould come as no surprise to\nanyone. When thousands of Chinese students were mown down\nat Tiananmen Square he said to the\nThe Politics of War\nMichael Factor,\nof the IC Jewish\nSociety,\nintroduces us to\nhis views on the\nMiddle East\nsituation.\ntalk, distortion and outright lies\nwhich the PLO use to legit i mise their message of hatred and violence\nthrough their sponsored pro pog and is ts in the media and on\nuniversity campuses.\nMr Matthews compared the PLO with the African National Congress\n( ANC) and Yassir Arafat with\nNelson Mandela; comparisons that\nare highly offensive to every\nAfrican and indeed to every human\nrights sympathiser.\nIsrael is outside the Gulf, of\ncourse. It is somewhat ironic that\nthe IC Anti-War in the Gulf Society\nshould host speakers from the one\norganisation to support Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and should go\nto such lengths to condemn the only\ncountry in the Middle East to be\nChinese Communist Party General\nSecretary:\n'On behalf of the Arab\nPalestinian people, their leadership,\nand myself, I express the warmest,\nmost sincere congratulations to you,\ndear comrade, on your appointment\nto General Secretary of the\nComunist Party of China, and take\nthis opportunity to express extreme\ngratification that you were able to\nrestore normal order after the recent\nincidents in People's China. I wish\nyou, close friends, more progress\nin your endeavour to achieve the\nhopes, goals, aspirations, stability\nand security of our friends, the\nChinese people.'\nAnd during the recent attempted\ncoup d 'etat in the USSR: 'Congratulations. ..to the new and\nlegitimate leadership of the Soviet\nUnion...success in your fight\nagainst the reaction is m which has\nbeen present until today in the\nUSSR and against imperialism.'\n(Corriera del la Sera, August 22\n1991).\nOf course Yassir Arafat's support\nfor brutal anti-democratic regimes\naround the world doesn't make him\na terrorist. Neither does it in any\nway de legit i mise him from being\nacknowledged as the only and true\nrepresentative of the Palestinian\npeople. The man of peace who\nrecognised Israel's right to exist in\n1988 and whose organisation, the\nPLO have given up their cowardly\nattacks on synagogue worshippers\n(Rome), kindergarten children\n( Me tull a), athletes ( Munich Olympics), American invalids\n( Leon Klinghoffer aboard the\nAchille Lauro) and so on.\nI wish I could believe that the\nPLO has given up such actions.\nUnfortunately in several interviews\nsince, Arafat has made his\nstandpoint only too clear:\nT did not mean to renounce...\nActually, I only repeated what our\nPalestine National Council had\naccepted...Iam still now committed\nto what I said in Cairo in 1985'\n(Venice TV, December 19, 1988).\n'The PLO will not stop the armed\nstruggle. I did not ask anybody to\nrefrain from military operations'\n(Associated Press, Kuwait, June 6\n1989).\nI would wholeheartedly agree\nwith the ICA WIGS that it is the\nright of residents of the West Bank\nand Gaza to choose their own representatives. The PLO( in\ncommon with the Governments of\nall Arab countries) were not\ndemocratically elected. Until recently no Palestinian dared to\noppose the PLO. Those delegates\nwho met with Israel in Madrid live\nunder death threat.\nAs long as Arafat will use the\nmethods he used on Anwar Sadat of\nEgypt (Oct 6th1981) or earlier this\nyear to remove Salah Khalif, the\nformer number two man in the\nPLO, he can claim to enjoy the\nsupport of all Palestinians.\nThe PLO are committed to the\ntotal destruction of the State of Israel. Quoting from their\nconstitution, the so called Palestinian National Charter:\n'Commando action constitutes a nucleus of the Palestinian popular\nliberation. Palestine, with the\nboundaries it had during the British\nMandate, is an indivisible territorial\nunit.\n'The partition of Palestine in\n1947 and the establishment of the\nState of Israel are entirely illegal,\nregardless of the passage of time,\nbecause they were contrary to the\n\u2014 10\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 920 1\n1 December1991 Arab Eats Babies Student Loan Moan\nDear Adam,\nI am worried by the increased\nnumber of pro-Israeli students in\ncollege who are feeling threatened.\nFirst there were Gaby Pell's repeated expressions of concern\nover the invitation of a PLO speaker\nto a college event. Furthermore, an\nincident on Thursday28 th November made me realise the\nscale of the problem.\nWhile manning the Friends of\nPalestine stall in the J CR, as part\nof the international week organised\nby O SC,I was thinking about some\nresearch I am currently doing.\n'This is in Israel' I heard someone\nsay. I raised my head and saw a young student (seemed like a fresher) holding up a hand embroidered bookmark and waving\nit in my face. By the time I had\nmanaged to blurt out 'sorry?', he\nwas asking;\n' Are you claiming this?' For a fraction of a second I thought he\nwas talking about the\nbookmark...' 'cause if you are, then\nIm very distressed!'.\nThen it all fell into place. The bookmark, which was no longer\nbeing waved around, had Jaffa\nembroidered on it, with two\nPalestinian flags either side of it. He was concerned that our society took\nthe stance that Israel should be\ndestroyed, and that even the parts\nof Israel recognised by the UN, like\nJaffa, should be taken over by\nPalestine.\nBy that time one friend had\noffered to call him an ambulance,\nwhile another suggested that he\nsaved his breath until the peace talks\nresumed in Washington. He left,\npresumably as distressed as he was\nat the start.\nWhat he had failed to notice was\nthat the whole exhibition avoided\npolitical stances, especially in the\ncurrent state of flux in the Middle East, and concentrated on culture\n(crafts, music, food etc) and the\nhuman rights issues, such as health,\neducation and imprisonment without trial. (The offending piece\nof material, which was promptly\nremoved, was part of the Medical\nAid for Palestinians catalogue, a charity for which Pauline Cutting\nwas working when she was in the\nPalestinian refugee camps in\nLebanon.)\nThat being our objective, which\nI think the exhibition achieved, we\ndid not want discussions with\ndistressed students on the day, but\nI think the issue must be raised, in\nthe interest of student welfare in the\ncollege.\nA couple of points to Mr Pell,\nbefore I reveal the frightening truth.\n1. You say that the PLO has\nnever been voted for by the\nPalestinians, could it perhaps be\nbecause the Occupying Israeli\ngovernment, in all of its love for\ndemocracy, has not allowed elections?\n2. You say '...that in the large\nmajority of cases, the killing of\nPalestinians has been carried out by\ntheir own kind, for collaboration,\nrather than by Israelis.' In a situation of military occupation,\nsuch as was the case with German\nforces in France throughout WorldWar II, what do you suggest is the\npercentage of deaths of civilians due\nto suspicion of collaboration, 5 0 % ?\n7 0 % ? 9 0 % ? Even the, stupid as\nyour unconfirmed statistic may be,\nhad there been no occupation by\nIsrael, do you not even entertain the\nthought that the life expectancy of\na Palestinian may have been slightly\nhigher?\n3. Under military occupation law\nin the West Bank and Gaza, a12 year old boy may be jailed for no\nreason, and most have been. The current Israeli prime minister is a self-confessed terrorist. Given those\nfacts, I suspect that being imprisoned in Israel has little to do\nwith the murder of innocent\nCivilans.\n4. As regards the re-establishment vs the creation of a state, don't be such a pedantic g it. You can argue till you are blue in\nthe mouth that there never was a Palestinian state. The fact that there\nhave been Palestinians, as a majority of the population for\nlonger than there has been a state\nof Israel in the region. This does not\nmake Israel non-existence, it is here\nnow as a state, with UN recognised\nborders.\nWake up, and forget the dogma\nthat you have been spoon fed. Israel\nwas not established solely on some\nlegitimate claim, and divine promises; people had to be\nmurdered or forcibly removed from\ntheir homes, politicians manipulated, and UN peace\nnegotiators blown up. Let us face\nthe reality of the situation, and save\nthe whole region further bloodshed.\nEnough of those stupid historical\narguments.\nAs for the frightening truth about\nour claims, and the distress they\ncause, you can make the obvious\nconclusions from that piece of\nembroidery. It can only mean one\nthing.\nWe are an evil bunch of mad\nDear Adam,\nI would like to raise a point about\na very widely discussed issue\u2014that\nof Student Loans\u2014that doesn't seem to get too much publicity.\nIt would seem that, short of a revolution or possibly a general\nelection, student loans are here to\nstay. They are going to become a fact of life if they are not so already.\nHowever, the major problem\nfacing most students is not having\nto pay back a loan, but having\nenough money to survive on. It is\ncertainly the biggest pain in my\nneck at the moment. So why not\nmake more money available in the\nform of loans, such that students,\nin the short term, have a feasible\namount of money instead of the\npurely hypothetical amount they\nhave at the moment, yet the\ngovernment can satisfy all those;\ndoctors and stockbrokers out there\nDear Sir,\nWe feel it has become necessary\nfor us to publicly explain our\nposition over the recent resignation\nof the Rag Chairman, Marc Ellis.\nDespite the overall success of\nRag this year there have been many\norganisational problems. Prior to\nRag Week, the Chairman was\ntalked but of resigning and stated\nthat he would communicate more\nwith the committee and would\ndelegate tasks to them.\nDuring the course of the next few\nweeks it became clear that none of\nthese problems had been resolved.\nWe again met with the Chair to\ndiscuss with him what the problems\nwere. The meeting ended by the\nArabs, who would do anything to\ndestroy the peace loving and\ninsecure state of Israel. We have\nnever in our hearts accepted the\npresence of Israel, and will fight on\nuntil the last child to destroy it. We are so vicious in fact, that Israel\nneeds to poses s nuclear weapons as\nan ultimate protection against our\nterrorist attacks on civilians. We produce such inge nous evil leaders,\nones who will destroy Israel by\nblowing up places, and invading\nother Arab countries. Plots so\nobviously well hatched to destroy\nIsrael, it is surprising none of them\nhave worked so far.\nAll Arab students in this college\nare on a secret mission to acquire\nthe know-how to destroy Israel.\nby maintaining that the money will\nbe repaid?\nOf course, this means greater\nshort term expenditure (so I 've\nprobably just answered my own\nquestion) but no increase in long\nterm spending other than the\ninflationary one already present. An extra \u00a3500 or so would probably do\n(fat chance, I know) and\nconsidering that everyone who\ngraduates earns fat wo d ges of cash\nwithin days (honest, they do) an\nextra \u00a32000 over a four year course\nbecomes fairly trivial against an\nexpected debt of \u00a36-7000 which will\nbe with undergraduates in the\nfuture.\nI dare say I'm not the first to try\nto publicise such an idea, but\namongst all the unleashed rage it\nseems to have been overlooked.\nYours idealistic a i ly, Paul Davison, Physics 2.\nChair saying that he would officially resign the following day.\nIt was clear to us that evening that\nhe would not change his mind nor\nwould it be a good idea either for\nRag, or for him, to continue in his\nposition. It was for this reason that\nwe did not sign the letter from the\ncommittee asking him to reconsider\nhis position. We feel that if Marc Ellis were to be reinstated the\nsituation would again degenerate, to\nthe detriment of Rag.\nRag meetings are continuing as\nnormal, and Rag will continue its\nactivities throughout the year.\nYours faithfully,\nWill Stallard, Acting Rag Chair,\nSarah Goodchild, Rag Treasurer.\nBack home our families breed more\nterrorists to send them against the\nhopelessly outnumbered Israeli\narmy, so that we can recover Jaffa,\nand swim in a sea of blood, since\nwe obviously enjoy that sort of'\nthing, being Arabs (I personally eat\ntwo babies every day).\nBetween you and me, Israel is\nbeing far to gracious in actually\nmaking an effort to talk to us, and\nonly using tear-gas, plastic bullets,\nlive ammunition, and a policy of\nbeating and terror to stem the flow\nof our violence. The ultimate\nsolution is for them to round us up,\nand...\nYours sincerely,\nAmin El-Kholy, Doc PG.\nRag Resignation\n\u201422\n\n"

When such a peace is\nmade, Israel is required to withdraw\nits armed forces from territories it\noccupied during the 6 day war - not\nfrom 'the' territories, nor from 'all'\nthe territories, but from some of the\nterritories. The withdrawal from the\nSinai following peace with Egypt\nboth proves that, having secured a peace treaty, Israel is prepared to\ncompromise on territory, and\nfulfills all its obligations under\nInternational Law. The1979 withdrawal from the Sinai, returned\n9 0 % of the land captured in 1967\nto Arab sovereignty.\nLieutenant General Thomas Kelly, the director of US Joint Chief\nof Staff, said during the Gulf War( Nov 5th1991) that 'it is impossible\nto defend Jerusalem unless you hold\nthe high ground...I look onto the\n'West Bank' and say to myself 'If\nI'm the Chief of Staff of the Israel\nDefence Forces, I cannot defend\nthis land without that terrain.\"\nWhat Kelly was saying is not\nnew. A1968 report by the US Joint\nChiefs of Staff maintained that\nIsrael could not be defended unless\nit controlled a major part of Judea\nand Samaria. And in 1988, 100\nretired US generals and admirals,\nincluding some of the most\nillustrious in the American military,\nasserted that the territories were\nvital to Israel security.\nOf course Messrs Wong and\nSchrag were absolutely right in\nstating that there have been more\nPalestinians killed in the last three\nyears than Israelis. The PLO have\nclamped down hard on collaborators. In fact, over 500\nPalestinians have been killed by\nfellow Palestinians. That is more\nthan the total number of Palestinians\nkilled by Jews and Jews by\nPalestinians since the so-called\nintifada began. They are right in\nsaying that it is the State of Israel\nwhich should renounce violence and\nstate terror against unarmed Palestinian civilians.. .perhaps they\nare referring to the way King Hussein of Jordan massacred\n20,000 Palestinians in their uprising\nof Black September 1970 which\nIsrael, along with all other countries\nthat value human life, did condemn.\nIsraeli soldiers in Gaza, Judea\nand Samaria are armed with tear\ngas, plastic bullets and too\nr \u2014\n0\nThe West Bank\non the same scale\nwater cannons, the same 'weapons'\nused by European countries to\ncontrol football hooligans. Under\nthe Geneva convention any\noccupying power has to maintain\nlaw and order in the territories it is\nadministrating. Israeli soldiers have\nto contend with boulders, petrol\nbombs, daggers and in some cases,\nbullets. If, to safeguard their own\nlives, they fire live ammunition,\neven into the air, or are accused of indiscriminate use of plastic bullets\nthey are arrested and court-marshalled.\nJewish settlers have as much right\nto settle on Jewish-owned land on\nthe 'West Bank' as they have to\nsettle anywhere else in the world.\nAny attempt to limit Jewish\nsettlement on Israeli Government\nowned land would be an attempt to\nrecreate the state of affairs in Arab countries today, and what was the\nstate of affairs in Europe before the\nwar, i.e. that of Jew-free zones, and\nJewish reservations \u2014 ghettos, something no democratically elected Jewish Government could\naccept and be re-elected.\nWe should address ourselves to\nthe plight of Palestinian refugees,\nand indeed to all deprived people.\nThe conference in Madrid will\nhopefully signify a new chapter,\nwith Israeli Government officials\nmeeting with Jordanians and Palestinians. It would appear that\nprogress will be made towards\nsome sort of compromise position\nmutually acceptable. If Jordan\nmakes peace with Israel, territorial\ncompromise is a serious possibility.\nThis is to be the last article on the\nsubject of the Middle East that\nwill be published in Felix this\nyear. This includes letters. I understand that the whole issue\ncauses strong feeling, but only\namongst a small number\npersonally involved people. It is\nprecisely because of these two\nreasons that all 'debate' on the\nsubject tend to be irrational,\nvitriolic, rhetorical and very, very\ntedious.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nis far too complicated and too\nintractable for it to be given\njustice in a dil let ante multi subject newspaper like this one. The only\npeople who read articles like this\none have almost certainly made\nup their mind and either\ncompletely agree or completely\ndisagree. I don't honestly think\nthe vast bulk of IC students could\nbe bothered to read it.\nThis article was written rather\nbadly as well as by hand.\nTherefore I do not accept any\ncriticism of spelling or semantic\nmistakes.\n\u2014 1\n1 \u2014\n\n"

I left school after ' A' Levels, I had a lot of fun busking,\nbut it's hard work, and the money's grim, you live hand to mouth, so I wrote these songs, and found the\nmusicians, and that's it and we got\njust like a massive live following,\nand every record company under\nLa's. I think they're something\nspecial. But s lagging other bands\noff is dead unproductive.\nWhat do you think of the\ncurrent music 'scene'?\nShite. It's grim, isn't it? Grimly fiendish.\nDo you have any favourite\nbands at the moment?\nErr, no. I like older bands, Van Morrison, Bruce Springstein, The\nJam, The Clash, The Waterboys,\nBilly Bragg. I don't think there's any real personalities left in pop\nmusic, so we're trying to put a little\nof that back into it, and that's the\nmain thing, a bit of vibe, a bit of\nlife and a few good fucking tunes.\nDo you have your eyes on the\ncharts?\nGrimlv Fiendish\nthe sun was phoning us up and\nsaying 'send us demos' and we said\n'no, if you're interested in the band\nyou're going to have to come and\nsee us.' And they all came, and\nsome of them put offers on the\ntable, and M&G' s was the most\nright down the line, 'cause they let\nus design our own sleeves, and\nchoose our own B sides and\nproducers. They gave us a free\nartistic hand, and enough money to\ndo what we wanted to do, which\nwas go out and tour and play\neverywhere.\nDo you think that there's a Liverpool scene, like with the\nFarm and that?\nThe Farm are shite. I 've got no\ntime for The Farm at all. The only\nLiverpool band I really like are The\nJ Yeah, for fucking sure. We don't want to piss around being an indie\ngroup. We want to be fucking\nworldwide, like, 'cause we feel as\nthough we've got something to\noffer, lyrically as well as musically,\nall of our lyrics actually stand for\nsomething.\nThe first single was a vehement\nanti-royalist song, well, more anti-aristocracy more than royalist. It's not based all on this little fucking\ndaft dance beat, it's got substance\nin it, and you can still dance to it.\nDo you incorporate politics like\nthat into all your songs?\nNo,I just write completely\nnaturally, just whatever comes to\nmind, like Raid The Palace was\nwritten in ten minutes, I just like\nspewed it out. A lot of the songs in\nthe set and on the album are going\nto be love songs. They just come\nout, it's just natural.\nHow long do you see the band\nlasting.\nWell, it's difficult, but we hope\nit's 'going to have some sort of\nlongevity, that's why we won't conform to any musical trends,\nbecause trends die out. If we don't do that, if we just stick to our guns,\nsooner or later the pendulum's going to swing round to our way of\nthinking.\nFreddie Mercury\nOne of my best friends is a massive\nQueen fan, and I always really\nreally hated Queen, and he got\ntremendous ribbing, he had the piss\ntaken out of him all the time, 'cause\nI thought they were shite, pompous\nrock, and like Freddie Mercury was\nsuch a posing bastard, but when he\ndied, I realised that I didn't actually\nhate him, I don't like a lot of other\nmusic more, I just thought it was so\nsad, and he was so brave, admitting\nthat he was dying of a disease you\nshouldn't be dying of. I think it's so grim, and tragic.\nDo you think Queen will be\nChristmas number one?\nWhy not Queen, I mean, he did\nit for twenty years, and if Freddie\nMercury hadn't been a rock ' n' roll\nstar he probably wouldn't be dead\nnow. I hate Queen's music, but I 've\nmellowed in my attitudes towards\nthem as people. We' ve had people\ns lagging us off because they\ncouldn't understand why we had a violin, and a Hammond organ,\nwe've had people say that we're shit\nbecause of that, but you've got to\ntake that on board, as a socialist,\nand you've got to give everybody\na fair crack of the whip, except for\ngre bos and Tories.\nSo you don't like the Levellers\nthen? I thought they'd be one of\nyour influences.\nI 've never heard them. A lot of\npeople have said 'you sound a lot\nlike the Levellers', but they've\nnever been one of my influences.\nDo you think that the\nHammond organ's a bit of a cult\nthing?\nThe organ itself is a pain in the\narse, because it's so big. They' re a pain to transport, but nothing else\nsounds like them, and ninety\npercent of bands who say we've got\na Hammond haven't, they've just\ngot samples. It's just so natural. It's cool. We'll still have it in ten years,\nthey'll probably have moved on to\nglockenspiels or something.\nTell me about the album.\nThe album is out in March, and\nno word of a lie, it's fucking great.\nThere'sa track called Megalomania, that'll be the second\nsingle, that's going to be the end of\nJanuary.\n\n"

I'd rather have half an hour\nof them than 2 hours of Bad\nManners any day. Shame that most\nof you lechers were there for\nNick o's legs, and not for the tunes.\nStill, never one to shun it's readers,\nFelix has a treat for you on page 14,\n'cause at least you were there. A lovely, early Christmas presENT, and I'm talking about Pele, you per vs. Lise Yates.\nDan (vocals, guitar) and Matt\n(Bass) and Ian (guitar) are\nbackstage at Thames Poly.\nWhat do you want us to talk about?\nI dunno, just chat away.\nTell them about the new album\nYeah, tell me about the new\nalbum.\nWell, when we've released the first\nsingle, then we'll do the album.\nHow about that time when To by got off with that blok e?, suggests\nDan, and he took his clothes off and\nJoan Jett, and all that?' adds Matt.\nI think it was Jefferson Airplane,\ncontinues Dan, and then, in an\nattempt to confuse me completely,\nsays Remember that time when my\nY Fronts were written on by the\nbrunettes, and then the next day, I forget I had them on, and I was in\nmy mum's room and she saw them\nand said 'Where have you been\nwithout your clothes on?'\nAt this point we're interrupted\nby the return of Toby and Ian\na clue what you're on. You' re hopeless, a hapless fuck wit. What about Matt on Thursday\nsuggests Dan. This girl came up to\nMatt after the gig and said ' how much are the T shirts?', seven quid,\nand she said T haven't quite got\nenough', and then ' How about four\npounds and something special\nthen?', and Matt spunk ed in his\npants Matt furiously denied this.\nI never did find out if she got the\nT shirt.\n4 Pounds & Something Special\nLise Yates\nInterviews Herb\nit was a woman. I begin to suspect\nthat this is not a completely true\nstory. When Toby comes back, ask\nhim something really deep, like\nabout 1992 and all that.\nWhat about Freddie Mercury then? he continues, Let's do\n'Freddie's Dead'( by Fishbone)\ntonight. It's a bit sad really. To by( drummer) used to be in Queen, you\nknow.\nWasn't it the Blackhearts, you know\n(guitar) from McDonalds. Ian\ndoesn't say much. Toby, on the\nother hand, never one to keep\nquiet, says...\nWe saw the posters on the way up.\nThey've got written on it 'Herb, the\nband who should have supported the\nBanderas'. Hey, what's that funny\nlittle tape recorder doing? Is this our\ninterview? You bastards, you started without me.\nHe picks it up, and shakes a burger wrapper at it.\n\u2022 \u2022 He T to What do you think about 1992,\nToby?\nI dunno, it's like the year after this\none, isn't it? I 'll haven't really\nthought about it yet, cos it hasn't happened yet, has it? I haven't got\nMatt is in the toilet now, and\nIan is banging on the door.\nDon't bang on the door, Ian, says\nDan. I remember you did that once\nwhen I was about to ejaculate, and\nI said I'm getting a blow job, can\nyou go away. Where was this?\nAt his house!\nThat's not very sociable, is it? says\nToby.\nNot as unsociable as banging on the\ndoor. Are you recording this? You bitch!\nAnd then on Saturday there were\nthese two girls, Dan continues.\nMatt was looking at these two girls\nall through this gig, but they fancied\nTo by, and they went up to To by after the gig, they were going, 'can\nwe have a free T shirt?'\nAnd I was saying ' no, no, no,' continues Toby and then Matt\ncomes up behind me and says\n'Hello girls, how about some Tshirts for free?'\nYou were well out of touch in the\nlast song on Saturday, To by, says\nDan.\nWell, he responds, that's because\nyou were all over the shop. It's alright for you, you just sing\n' Wooohoooooaaaah'\nThere's no one in the crowd,\nsays Ian. There's no-one there at\nall. He said when Rain played it was\nfilled up.\nRain? interrupts Matt, we supported Rain. There only getting\nthe gigs because of those tits on their posters and because they're on\nPolydor.\nI told you it would be like this,\nsays Toby. We thought of ringing\nup and saying, you know about this\nMonday, well Matt doesn't like\nplaying on Mondays, so can we do\na Saturday instead.\nHow about a Monday, and\nsomething special, volunteers Dan\nWe won't get as many as we did\non Saturday, continues Toby, We had a laugh then. There was this girl\nat the door, and she said ' You' ll have to pay two quid to get in.' and\nwe said, we're the band, you can\ntell from our accents, we're Essex\nboys.\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"
