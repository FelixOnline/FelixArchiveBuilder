I\nam not a homosexual, but I am not\nashamed to say that I shed a few\ntears when that orange saviour\nplaced his tiny hands on the bible\nand the liberals started to weep.\nThere were no alternative facts in\nsight on that most magnificent of\ndays: the gays, the abortionists,\nthe vagina-havers, the Latinos,\nand the Blacks will finally suffer\ntheir due. Too long have they\nexperienced the leniency of\nBarack HUSSEIN Obama and\nhis administration. FInally we will\nfeel the fist of power. A strong,\npowerful fist will penetrate right\ninto the hole that the democrats\nhave left, reaching around to try\nand grab at the stragglers that\nhave previously been inside this\nhole. Trump is that fist.\nOf course whenever someone\nthat the liberal contingent dislikes\nis democratically elected, it means\nthat they will line the streets and\nplay some African drums, eat\nsome kelp bullshit, and cry. No\none on the right did anything\nlike this when Barack HUSSEIN\nObama was re-elected. Sure we\nmade a few signs where Obama\nwas an African witch doctor, and\nwere convinced that he was born\nin Kenya, but we did it in small\ngroups. I don\u2019t get why the women\nand the minorities feel like they\nhave to disrupt to such scale. Don\u2019t\nthey have abortions they need to\nget to? With that said, however,\nI did attend the protest. Not to\nactually protest, but with binoculars from a rooftop bar so that I\ncould see the proletariat weep as\nthey realised that it would not be\nanother four years of hand-outs.\nThere is nothing sweeter than the\ntears of butt-hurt liberals \u2013 if they\ncould find a way to milk them for\ntheir essence and bottle it, I would\nbuy a gallon every day.\nI can\u2019t wait for this wall either.\nFinally being able to stop the\nMexicans from entering the rear of\nAmerica is the first step to making\nit great, but why stop there? We\nshould be building walls around\neverything \u2013 if you build a wall\naround abortion clinics, whores\nwill no longer be able to have a\nget out of jail free card. Build a\nwall around Mosques and then no\nterrorism related incidents will ever\nhappen again. Build walls around\nHillary and she can finally be\nimprisoned for being technologically incompetent. WALLS WALLS\nWALLS WALLS.\nO\nbviously\nsomething\nhappened last\nweek on Friday,\nbut of course if\nsomething bad\nhappens, the best thing to do is just\nignore it and hope that it resolves\nitself. I take the same approach\nto medicine \u2013 instead of putting\nunnatural additives onto my body,\nI just hope that lotus flower extract\nrubbed onto my genitals will\narrange the tai chi of the infection\nand leave my penis un-rotting. It\nmay take a few more flowers, but I\nthink that little Jon is getting there.\nAnyway as I was saying, absolutely nothing happened last week,\nspecifically at 5pm Greenwich\nMean Time. In other news they\nannounced the Oscar nominations\n\u2013 unfortunately my own black and\nwhite film which is three hours of\na camera zooming into my own\nasshole didn\u2019t get nominated. Not\neven for best hair and makeup\nin a motion picture. I mean monkeys can get that award. I liked\nLos Angeles Los Angeles Land,\nespecially the joke about George\nMichael\u2019s passing, but I can\u2019t help\nbut feel that maybe there should\nhave been more than one black\nperson in a film about jazz. Also\nthere should have been more use\nof the sitar \u2013 If they plan on doing\na sequel, I just want to shout out to\nRyan that I\u2019m in perpetual state of\nunemployment/writing my novel\nand would happily appear on the\nfilm for a fee.\nOf course you all know what\nevent didn\u2019t actually happen.\nSomething happened in America.\nJust between Maryland and Virginia. I don\u2019t think we need to talk\nabout it though. I mean what else\nhappened this week? Well there\nwere all those Women\u2019s Marches\naround the world for no particular\nreason. Even though I am not a\nwoman, I decided to make myself\nthe centre of attention at this\nparade and lead chants and tweet\nangrily when people made body\nshaming signs about Trump\u2019s tiny\npenis and hands. Fuck I mentioned\nit. Trump. OK FINE. DEATH TO\nTHE WEST. COMMUNISM MUST\nRISE AGAIN. THE HAMMER AND\nSICKLE WILL SLIT THE ORANGE\nTHROAT OF THE WOMAN-OPPRESSOR. I watched the entire\ninauguration in some sort of\nstate of self-harm whilst sobbing\nviolently into my favourite block\nof tofu. I later masturbated at the\nphotoshopped picture I made of\nHillary spending her first day in\nthe White House, spending millions\non Native American heritage, and\nrenewable energy programmes. It\nwas the saddest but the best thing\nthat happened to me last week.\nIf we ignore all the\nbad things that are\nhappening then they\u2019ll\njust go away\nJonathan Masters has much\nbetter things to talk about than\nwhat happened last Friday\nIf we can\u2019t actually\nimprison them, we\ncan just build a wall\naround them\nMonathan Jasters is finding the\ntears of the liberals a pleasant\naddition to his week\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nGrupo\nCementos de\nChihuahua\n\n"

    "content": "Friday 27 January 2017 13\nculture.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nfelix\nC U L T U R E\nT\nhe first feeling I had\nwhen viewing the\ntrailer for Jackie\nwas a familiar\nweariness: here\nwas a story that\nsounded interesting, but was\nand forth between the assassination itself, Jackie\u2019s 1962\ntelevised tour of the white\nhouse, and meetings with various characters in her life.\nThe supporting cast is\ncomprised of many fine\nperformances, with a particular highlight being Peter\nSarsgaard \u2013 who is endlessly\ncharismatic and mercurial\nin any role he is given \u2013 as\nJohn F. Kennedy. The film\nalso features Greta Gerwig,\nRichard E. Grant, John\nCarroll Lynch, and John Hurt,\nwhose Irish priest character\nseems to be unsure in what\naccent he is supposed to be\nspeaking. Since most of the\nfilm is spent in Boston and the\nwider Massachusetts area, it\nis inevitable there is an Irish\npriest, but Hurt\u2019s accent seems\nto slip from Dublin, back to\nhis own, and then somewhere\ntheme is echoed throughout\nthe film.\nIndeed, this is found within\nthe excellent Under the Skin\ncomposer Mica Levi. First\nof all, it is refreshing to find\nthat the composer is not a\nmiddle-aged white man or\nJustin Hurwitz. Levi is the\nfirst female nominee since\n2000, and one of only three\nwomen to have been nominated for scoring a film. The\nmusic hauntingly combines\nboth synthesised keyboards\nand strings, and \u2013 like all\ngreat film music \u2013 works\nas a unique piece of art by\nitself. Even if you remember\nno melodies at all from the\nsoundtrack, you will remember the hair-raising string\nleitmotif that starts the film: as\nthe strings descend, they slur,\nalmost out of tune, but eventually find a solid note upon\nwhich to remain transfixed. In\na lot of ways, this main theme\nseems to be emblematic of\nJackie herself. Her inner turmoil manifests externally as\nrambling about how Lincoln\u2019s\nwidow had to sell all their\nfurniture and died alone, but\ntowards the end of the film,\nas she dictates what may and\nmay not be published in LIFE,\nwe see her move past the\ngrief to find her stability.\nAs the credits started to roll,\nand everybody remained in\ntheir seats for just a moment\nlonger, there was one line\nthat echoed through my head:\n\u201cI have grown accustomed\nto what people believe and\nwhat I know to be real\u201d.\nJackie is an immersive examination of the dichotomy of\npublic and private personas,\nbut above that, it is a complex\ninterrogation of grief and\nwhat the living must come to\nterms with once the dead are\nburied.\nJonathan Masters\nChilean director Pablo Larra\u00edn\nmakes his English-language debut\nwith Jackie, a simmering biopic\nof first lady Jackie Kennedy,\nplayed masterfully by Natalie\nPortman, in the days following\nher husband\u2019s assassination\n\\\\ Noah\nOppenheim\u2019s\nscreenplay is an\nextremely impressive\npiece of writing,\nexpertly weaving\nmultiple timelines\nand interactions into\na straightforward\nstory \\\\\nin-between.\nLarra\u00edn displays a huge\namount of control and\nreserve in his depiction of the\nassassination and its brutal\naftermath. It is a perfect\ndemonstration of the effectiveness of controlled violence,\nwhere the explicit gore lasts\nmerely seconds, but stays with\nyou long after the scene ends.\nFrom the opening scenes,\nLarra\u00edn manages to maintain\na pace that never feels self-in-dulgent. Each interaction and\nevery shot of Portman feels\nimportant in creating this\nemotional landscape, and at\nno point in its one hour and\n40 minutes\u2019 running time did\nI feel bored. The camera is\nprimarily focussed on Natalie\nPortman\u2019s face, allowing us\nto see every quiver of the\neyebrow, every pursing of\nthe lips. At times Stephane\nFontaine\u2019s cinematography is\nalmost claustrophobia-induc-ing, and in the most emotional\nscenes it seems almost too\ninvasive, making you wish\nthat the camera would step\naway from Jackie.\nNatalie Portman\u2019s performance is a masterful one,\nwith every vocal tic, nuance,\nand the breathy lilt of Jackie\u2019s\nvoice being captured in a\nhauntingly perfect inter-pretation. There have been\nmany reviewers who have\ndescribed her performance\nas camp and alienating, and\nin all fairness, there are a few\nlines where the theatricality\nand archness of her delivery\nseem almost overacted. With\nthat said, this is clearly inten-tional: Larra\u00edn shows us how\nJacqueline Kennedy, the wife\nof a former congressman, has\nbeen thrust into the spotlight\nwith no obvious desire to\nbe famous, and as such has\ncreated this public persona as\nan extension of her husband\u2019s\npolitical persona. The way\nshe trips over her words\nduring the white house tour,\nor the nervous darting of\nher eyes, casting around for\nsupport, add up to create a\nwoman whose entire identity\nwas contained within her husband and his career. From the\nmoment she was left grasping\nthe splintered fragments of\nher husband\u2019s skull, this duality was shattered, and this\nNatalie Portman, whose pitch-perfect Jackie\ncaptivates \\\\ 20th Century Fox\nThere will\nnever be\nanother\nCamelot\nto be packaged in a 3-hour-long portentous montage\nof shots of Natalie Portman\nlooking sad out of windows.\nWhat I am happy to report,\nhowever, is that Jackie \u2013 the\nfirst english-language film\nby Chilean director Pablo\nLarra\u00edn, probably best known\nin the UK for his Gael Garc\u00eda\nBernal-starring 2012 film NO\n\u2013 is a wrought, tense, and\nimmensely powerful drama,\none that has not left my mind\nfor days.\nThe screenplay by Noah\nOppenheim is an extremely\nimpressive piece of writing,\nexpertly weaving multiple\ntimelines and interactions\ninto a straightforward story.\nThe narrative straddles\na number of timeframes,\nbut is underpinned by an\ninterview for LIFE Magazine,\nconducted a week after her\nhusband\u2019s assassination\nby Billy Crudup\u2019s unnamed\njournalist. From the front room\nof Jackie Kennedy\u2019s house in\nMassachusetts, we flick back\n\\\\ Natalie Portman\u2019s\nperformance is\nmasterful, with\nevery vocal tic\nof Jackie\u2019s voice\nbeing captured in a\nhauntingly perfect\ninterpretation \\\\\n\n"

With the end\nof 2016, we were eager to turn\nover a new leaf, start anew with\nstarry eyes full of hope for the\nfuture. But since Trump\u2019s inauguration last Friday, it\u2019s\njust been an onslaught of bad news, dumb news and\noutright ridiculous news. Since Friday, the Donald\nhas broken Obamacare, has withdrawn from the\nTranspacific Partnership, has reintroduced the Mexico\nCity Policy which effectively strips federal financial\nsupport from any NGO lobbying for reproductive\nrights, revived the Keystone XL and Dakota Access\npipelines, ordered the construction of a Mexico wall,\nallowed six journalist to be charged with felony for\ncovering the anti-trump protests from last week, frozen\nscience grants from the Environmental Protection\nAgency, and removed any mention of the LGBT\nmovement from the government\u2019s website.\nAlso jumping on the bandwagon, every\n>>insert descriptive term of choice<< in the US is\nproposing backwards bills such as bills \u201cto repeal\nthe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s most\nrecent rule for new residential wood heaters\u201d\nor bills proclaiming \u201ceach human life begins\nwith fertilization\u201d or bills requiring \u201cpipelines\nregulated by the Secretary of Transportation to\nbe made of steel that is produced in the United\nStates\u201d or God knows what.\nMeanwhile the Brexit saga is dragging on\nand on.

That being said, I\nam thrilled that the Academy\nhas recognised Mica Levi for\nher haunting score, following\nher noted omission for Under\nthe Skin a few years ago.\nShe is only the third woman\nto be nominated for scoring\na film, and she more than\ndeserves to win the top prize.\nThe most noted omission,\nfor me, is Antonio Campos\u2019\nChristine, which tells the story\nof depressed TV presenter\nChristine Chubbuck. As\nalready mentioned, I feel that\nHall should be up for the Best\nActress award, but it would\nalso be a well-deserved\nnominee for Best Picture, Best\nDirector or Best Screenplay,\nas well as any number of\nother awards for its pitch-per-fect 1970s production design.\nSo, what will happen come\nFebruary 26th? My prediction \u2013 and everyone else\u2019s\n\u2013 is that La La Land will take\nhome most of the awards.\nBut what do the Academy\nAwards even mean? Not that\nmuch really. This might be\nthe most obvious of hot-takes\nfor anyone who follows the\nworld of film, but looking\nback over the last decade\nor so of ceremonies, and a\npattern becomes clear: how\nlittle we really care about\nthe Oscars after everything\nhas died down. How many of\nus can say that we regularly\nwatch The King\u2019s Speech?\nOr argue that Slumdog\nMillionaire really represents\na masterpiece of modern\ncinema? For me \u2013 and I know\nthis isn\u2019t an opinion shared by\nothers \u2013 it seems unlikely that\nI will watch La La Land again,\neven if it wins top prize on\nthe night. But I will make sure\nto watch the ceremony itself.\nI might disagree with the\nnominees, I might disagree\nwith the winners, I might even\nagree with the entire ethos\nof artistic competitions\u2026but\ndamn if it\u2019s not fun to take\npart, even for an evening, in\nall the pomp of Hollywood.\nIn the run-up to the Academy Awards, felix will be\nrunning innumerable articles\non the nominees. If you\u2019re\ninterested in letting us know\nwho should win Best Picture,\nwho has been overlooked, or\njust how sick of awards you\nare, drop us a line.\nG\norillaz are\nback \u2013 and\nthis time\nthey are as\npolitical as\nthey are\nwhacky. Having teased a\nnew album through Instagram\nand SoundCloud releases\nover the past few months,\nGorillaz released the\nbrand new track Hallelujah\nMoney (ft. Benjamin\nClementine) on the eve of\nTrump\u2019s inauguration. The\nDamon Albarn-led virtual\nband described the track\nin their own words as a\n\u201ccommentary on a politically-charged, historical moment\u201d.\nThe track itself heavily\nfeatures the deep, powerful\nvoice of Clementine, which\ndominates the track with an\nomnipotent, commanding\naura. The lyrical parts sung\nby Clementine imitate the\nvoice of Trump with eery\nlines such as \u201cThank you my\nfriend/for trusting me\u201d and\nthe sobering \u201cIt is love, that is\nthe root of all evil\u201d. Further to\nthis, the music video and lyrics\nare littered with references\nto current affairs with the\nimagery of \u201cscarecrows from\nthe far east\u201d and \u201cI thought\nthe best way to perfect our\ntree / Is by building walls\u201d.\nThis is all underscored with\nthe most standout trait of the\nsong \u2013 a hypnotic underlying\nbeat, marked by an arrhyth-mic beeping which persists\nthroughout the whole track\nlike an incurable sickness.\nThe verse builds up into an\nexhausting chorus calling for\n\u201challelujah money\u201d, which\nis backed by an innocent\nsounding choir, contrasting\nClementine\u2019s deep vocals.\nThe resounding message of\nthe track follows succinctly\nwith Albarn\u2019s melancholic\nvocals which question how\nwe can know \u201cwe are still\nhuman\u201d in this new era of pol-itics. Albarn\u2019s speaker-tronic\nvoice also humbly asks \u201cHow\nwe will dream?\u201d and \u201cHow\nwe will love?\u201d in this new\nsystem.\nArtistically, the face of\nGorillaz is still recognisable\nsince their last commercial\nouting in 2010. Interestingly,\nthis is not a marked official\nGorillaz release - the song is\nnot a single and can only be\nfound on the YouTube channel\nof culture site uproxx.com.\nThe song comes with an\naccompanying music video,\nwhich is nowhere to be seen\non the recently revamped\nGorillaz website, suggesting\nthe piece is not something\nfrom the body of work of the\nupcoming album.\nAlthough rather half-handed\nin the nature of it\u2019s release,\nHallelujah Money is an excellent piece of work, teeming\nwith signature Gorillaz quirks.\nWhilst the track offers loads\nin itself, it\u2019s only one side of\nthe coin, with the accompanying music video providing\nthought-provoking visuals on\ntop. Whilst Hallelujah Money\nis intentionally separate from\nthe upcoming album, if it were\nconsidered a sign of the music\nto come, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad\nthing at all.\nHallelujah\nMoney\nBy Sam Wood\n\\\\ Gorillaz (@gorillaz)\nCould Isabelle Huppert become the third\nf\no\nr\ne\ni\ng\nn\n-l\na\nn\ng\nu\na\ng\ne\nw\ni\nn\nne\nr\no\nf\nt\nh\ne\nB\ne\ns\nt\nA\nc\nt\nr\ne\ns\ns\n\\\n\\\nP\ni\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\nh\no\nu\ns\ne\nE\nn\nt\ne\nr\nt\na\ni\nn\nm\ne\nn\nt\nOur Culture Editor, Fred Fyles,\ngives you the run-down on the\nAcademy Award nominations for\nthis year, from the meteoric rise of\nLaLaLand,tothepossiblesuccess\nof Moonlight, and all those films\nthat they missed along the way...\nT\nhe announcement\nof the nominees for\nthe 89th\nAcademy\nAwards this\nweek marked the\nbeginning of the\nend of the year-long awards\nprocess, which begins with\nthe Cannes Film Festival\nin May, and ends with the\nOscars, 8 months later. As\nusual, the list of nominees\ncontains few surprises, with\nthe Academy of Motion\nPicture Arts and Sciences\nchoosing to stay on the\nstraight and narrow, throwing\nout very few left-field choices.\nDamien Chazelle\u2019s musical\nromp through an imagined\nHollywood, La La Land, leads\nthe pack, with 14 nomina-tions; a record-tying haul, this\nputs in on par with Titanic\nand All About Eve as the\nmost nominated film of all\ntime. The raft of nominations\n\u2013 which includes Best Film,\nBest Actor, Best Actress, and\nBest Director \u2013 is unsurpris-ing; there is nothing more\nthat the Academy loves more\nthan a film which indulges\ntheir romantic fantasies about\nwhat commercial film-mak-ing can achieve. One only\nneeds to look back to 2012\u2019s\nceremony, when The Artist\nand Hugo, both in thrall to\nthe \u2018magic of cinema\u2019, took\nhome five awards apiece.\nTaking this into account, the\nsuccess of La La Land \u2013 which\nessentially functions as a love\nletter to Hollywood \u2013 is not a\nshock.\nThe question is whether\nLa La Land can continue\nthe run it\u2019s had this award\nseason, which peaked with\na record-setting night at the\nGolden Globes, or whether\nMoonlight or Arrival\n\u2013 each with eight\nnominations \u2013 can\nknock it off the top\nperch. If either had\na chance, it would\nbe Moonlight,\nwhich has been\npicking up critical\nacclaim since\nits premiere at\nTelluride. (Arrival,\nwhich has the bulk\nof its nominations\nin the more technical\ncategories, is likely to\nfill in the Gravity/Mad\nMax/Grand Budapest Hotel\nspace, with a high number\nof wins, but none of the \u2018big\nones\u2019.) Online, there seems\nto have been a rumbling of a\nmajor categories. Casey\nAffleck already seems to be\na shoe-in for the Best Actor\nprize, with his emotionally\nunderstated performance\nas a man consumed with\nsilent grief. The Best Actress\naward, meanwhile, is a more\nopen field: Emma Stone (La\nLa Land), Isabelle Huppert\n(Elle), and Natalie Portman\n(Jackie) have all been picking\nup gongs, and Ruth Negga\u2019s\nperformance in Loving could\nalso get some traction. The\ninclusion of Meryl Streep\non the list \u2013 for the\nunderwhelming Florence Foster Jenkins\n\u2013 leaves a nasty\ntaste in the mouth,\nespecially considering that Amy\nAdams (who delivered two great\nperformances\nthis year in Arrival\nand Nocturnal\nAnimals) is not even\nnominated. I would\nhave also loved to see\nRebecca Hall rewarded for\nher performance in Christine,\nwhich \u2013 for me \u2013 has been\nthe best performance I\u2019ve\nseen all year.\nThe Best Director category\nOur Academy Award #hottake\nbacklash against La La Land \u2013\nafter months of being told that\nit was a masterpiece, those\nwho went and found instead\nan empty-hearted, reactionary imitation of past greats\nwere sorely disappointed.\nManchester by the Sea\nhas also had a good run,\nbeing nominated for six\nawards, all of which are in\nseems to be a breath of fresh\nair, if only because Alejandro\nG. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu decided 2016 was\nmiserable enough without him\nreleasing another film (thank\nGod). The last few years\nhave seen mainly big-budget\nspectacles getting the Best\nDirector prize, but of the list\nthis year, only Hacksaw Ridge\nseems to fit the traditional\nmacho mould (it remains to\nbe seen whether Mel Gibson\u2019s\nprevious racist and homophobic behaviour will stand in\nhis way). I would argue that\nArrival is more of a cerebral\naffair than an SFX-flick, and\nLa La Land might be grand in\nscope, but its set pieces are\nnoticeably more musically-in-clined than previous winners.\nWhat is grating with this\nyear\u2019s list is the lack of\ndaring. Tom Ford\u2019s Nocturnal Animals, a deep, heady\nthriller, only gets a nod for\nMichael Shannon in the Best\nSupporting Actor category;\nAmy Adams\u2019 performance\ngoes unrecognised, and so\ndoes Ford\u2019s direction and\nscreenplay. Similarly, Jackie\nonly has three nominations,\nfor Best Costume Design, Best\nScore, and Best Actress. It is a\nfar more audaciously daring\nManchester by the Sea has\npicked up six nominations \\\\\nAllStar/Studio Canal\nLa La Land, a love-letter to Hollywood, wins massive acclaim from Hollywood industry \u2013 shocker! \\\\ 20th Century Fox\n\n"

We never\nfelt any connection to our\nPok\u00e9mon. In the Pok\u00e9mon\ngames, we could pick certain\nPok\u00e9mon, battle with them,\nand raise them. In GO, it\nbecame just about catching\nthem and discarding them for\nmore candies.\nBattling is a big part of\nPok\u00e9mon; the competitive\nbattling scene is really strong\nand can be as complex as\nchess. In Pok\u00e9mon GO, gyms\nare the only place you can\nA\nh, Pok\u00e9mon\nGO. What it\nwas and what\nit could have\nbeen. It was a\nsensation that\ngripped so many people only\nto come crashing down.\nLet\u2019s think back to early\n2016 when Pok\u00e9mon GO was\njust an innovating idea. One\nthat got people excited. It\nwas touted to be an AR game\nwhich would essentially be\nthe closest thing to Pok\u00e9mon\nin real life. Given the popularity of the original games\nand how many people have\nwatched the anime over the\nyears, it was something many\nof us were really looking\npeople in other countries\nhack their phones to play it.\nThe app isn\u2019t exactly like a\nPok\u00e9mon game and has its\nown mechanics. You basically\nwalk around, looking for\nPok\u00e9mon and have to catch\nas many as possible. To\nevolve them, you need to\ncatch more of the same rather\nthan battle. So the game gets\none of the great things about\nPok\u00e9mon right, the catching\naspect. Wanting to catch all\nthe Pok\u00e9mon and evolve the\nones you have gets everyone\nin a frenzy to walk down\nevery possible street and try\nand see how many critters\nthey can catch.\nUnfortunately, there is\nnothing more to Pok\u00e9mon\nGO. That\u2019s it. If you aren\u2019t\nwilling or able to go on two\nhour walks around pok\u00e9stop\npopulated areas, the game\nbasically becomes unplay-able. This is because it\u2019s the\nonly way to get pok\u00e9balls\nand it is the only way to\nget health recovery items\nwhich you need to level up\nor fight at gyms. Also, a lot\nof features from the original\ngames are absent in GO. You\ncan\u2019t form a good team and\nhave strategised battles, you\ncan\u2019t battle gyms and collect\nbadges, there\u2019s no story to\nindicate progression, and you\ncan\u2019t even battle or trade with\nother people.\nThese are all crucial elements that made the original\nPok\u00e9mon games so popular.\nThough there was hope that\nNiantic would expand on\nthe GO concept and add on\nsome of the missing elements,\nit didn\u2019t, and without them\nthe novelty of Pok\u00e9mon GO\nwears out fast. There weren\u2019t\nreally any rewards or stories\nbattle your Pok\u00e9mon against\nthose of other players. The\nbattles are just about tapping\nthe screen, which spams your\nbasic attack, until you build\nup enough charge to hold\ndown on the screen to charge\nup an advanced attack that\ndoes more damage and\npauses the battle to play a\ncut scene. This mechanic is\ndull, infrequent, and does not\ncompare to the more intense\nand strategic battling of the\nNintendo games.\nThe novelty of Pok\u00e9mon\nis catching them, but GO\u2019s\nmechanism manages to\nmuddle that up. In the original\ngames, catching them all is\nvery possible, provided you\nput in the time and effort.\nYou also need to battle\nPok\u00e9mon before you catch\nthem which makes the act of\ncatching more intense and\nmore satisfying. In GO, all\nyou do is throw pok\u00e9balls,\ntaking away some of the\nappeal. Also, only certain\nPok\u00e9mon are common, the\nrest vary between rare and\nnon-existent. You need to go\nto all sorts of areas and really\npush yourself just to complete\na fraction of the Pok\u00e9dex and\nget your beloved Charizard..\nIf you \u201cgotta catch em all\u201d but\nyou actually physically can\u2019t,\nwhat\u2019s the point?\nAnd now? Well, Pok\u00e9mon\nGO is dead now. It didn\u2019t\ngo down overnight, it was\nmore of a gradual decline as\nThe ballad of Pok\u00e9mon GO\npeople started to get bored\nand realize there really\nwasn\u2019t anything left to do.\nEven the rivalry between the\nthree factions couldn\u2019t keep\nit going. The rivalry was\nreally just people insulting\neach other on the internet.\nAnd sure, updates might be\ncoming out soon introducing\nnew Pok\u00e9mon and features\nbut honestly, it\u2019s too little too\nlate.\nIt\u2019s a real shame, Pok\u00e9mon\nGO could have become\nsomething really special.\nUnfortunately it jettisoned a\nlot of what made Pok\u00e9mon\nspecial with the end result\nbeing a mediocre game\nwhich was constantly plagued\nwith server issues. Maybe\nin the future it will make a\nresurgence and regain its lost\nglory, but until then, I\u2019ll play\nPok\u00e9mon Moon.\n\\\\ There weren\u2019t\nreally any rewards\nor stories to keep us\ngoing \\\\\nforward to.\nSkip ahead to July:\nPok\u00e9mon GO is released and\nis an instant hit. It becomes\nthe most downloaded app\ngame; even people who have\nnever had anything to do\nwith Pok\u00e9mon start playing\nit. It gets to the point where\nBlasted surver issues again \\\\ Skinny Casual Lover\n\n"

I\u2019m having second thoughts about my decision of voting Donald Trump for US President. I was totally\nbehind him. Like sure, he\u2019s not exactly charismatic or attrac-tive. He doesn\u2019t have good skin, or great hair. And I wouldn\u2019t\ncall his eyes kind. I mean I can\u2019t actually see them through all\nthose flaps of eye-bag skin. But the way he says SAD always\ngets me.\nBut I digress. I\u2019m second guessing my vote because I got\nupset after his waterboarding comments. I mean I have\nto draw the line somewhere and torture is kind of a deal\nbreaker for me. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really conflicted.\nWhat do you think?\nYours,\nKathrin Kim Karchner\nDear Kat\nCan I call you cat? Personally I\u2019m not a massive Trump fan. It\u2019s not about the looks, let\u2019s be\nhonest under the right lighting you couldn\u2019t tell\nhim and Hillary apart.\nIt\u2019s about policy. And I just can\u2019t get behind\nthis executive order rage. Like ok, maybe\ndon\u2019t wait seven years until you stop caring\nand start signing executive orders (you know\nwho you are *cough* OBAMA *cough* \u2013\nwow coughing is a lot less discreet when it\u2019s in\nwriting), but you\u2019re a democratically elected\nofficial not Kim Jong Un.\nAnyway as I was saying. I care about policy.\nNot whatever it is he likes to do in bed. I mean\nsure, waterboarding is not exactly my cup of\ntea. I mean ew. I can barely handle my own\nwee let alone someone else\u2019s. Truth is I\u2019m really\nHOROSCOPES\nvanilla. Like a friend once gave me edible\nunderwear and\u2026 well hm.. Actually I don\u2019t\nthink I ever spoke to Tom again after that.\nSee?\nSo to summarise; Though your decision to vote\nTrump is indeed deplorable, the fact that him\nmaking some prostitutes pee on a bed is\nmaking you rethink that decision is even worse!\nSo grow a backbone and if you\u2019re gonna\nmake bad decisions, at least stick with them\nuntil the bitter end. There\u2019s nothing worse than\nthe lack of conviction (other than the lack of\ncondoms when you really need one).\nBig luv,\nChris xxxx\n\n"

Male\nfruit flies were paired with\n10 different females flies of\ndifferent genetic strains. With\nas many as 2700 trials using\ndifferent combination of male\nand female fruit flies, it was\nfound that males were able to\npick out females that are most\nlikely to produce the maximum amount of offspring.\nThe males were also found\nto be consistent in their\nchoices, choosing females\nranking higher in the hierarchy over the others. For\nexample; if female fruit fly\nA is the highest in rank, followed by B, C, D and so on,\nmales, when given a choice\nbetween A and B, always\nchose A. Similarly when given\na choice between B and C,\nthe males chose B. The ranking ranking of a female fruit\nfly relates to the amount of\noffspring it is able to produce.\nSimilar experiments were\nconducted but, after impairing either the sense of smell\nor the sight of the male fruit\nflies, their mate choosing\npattern remained unchanged.\nHowever, when both their\nChoosing mates using logic\nLizzie Riach gives an overview of new robotic technology designed to help keep the heart beating\nafter heart failure\nA\nso-called \u2018soft\nrobot\u2019 has\nbeen invented\nto help keep\nthe human\nheart beating.\nDeveloped by researchers\nfrom Harvard University and\nBoston Children\u2019s Hospital,\nthe robot fits around the heart\nand helps it pump blood. This\ncould mean a significantly\nhigher quality of life for people that have survived heart\nattacks but suffer from heart\nfailure, a growing population in this day and age. The\nrobot itself does not come into\ndirect contact with the blood,\nreducing potential risks such\nas blood clotting. Instead, the\nheart is encased in a sleeve\nwhich mimics the outer layers\nof cardiovascular tissue,\nallowing the material to act\nin a similar way to the heart\nwithin it.\nAround 41 million people\nsuffer from heart failure\nworldwide, which is termed\nas \u2018the inability to pump sufficient blood to the body\u2019. Up\nuntil now, the only option for\npeople with severe cases has\nbeen heart transplants, but\ndonors are thin on the ground\nand many die whilst on the\nwaiting list. Previous devices\nto help heart function, known\nas \u2018ventricular assist devices\u2019\n(VADs) are limited, and are\nused mainly as life-prolonging\ntherapy. VADs work by interacting with valves to increase\nblood flow, whilst patients\nhave to take blood-thinning\nmedications. Despite this,\nclots often occur and cause\nsevere problems in up to 20%\nof patients.\nThis new soft robot is\ncomprised of a silicon sleeve\nthat takes inspiration from the\nheart itself and is designed\nto simply enhance heart\nfunction by closely mimicking\nit. There have already been\nin vivo results on a pig heart.\nThe robot itself is customizable depending on which\nside of the heart is weaker\nand therefore needs more\nhelp to pump blood. Despite\nproblems such as inflammation at the device-tissue\ninterface, these preliminary\ntests look promising. In the\ncurrent model, the device is a\ntethered implantable system\nthat uses wall-compressed\nair supply to allow the robot\nto work. Future models will\neither have to be made\nsmaller or, like other devices,\nbe worn around the waist of\nthe patient. A lot more testing\non live models and in animals\nwith chronic heart failure\n\\\\ The robot does\nnot come into direct\ncontact with the\nblood, reducing the\nrisk of blood clots \\\\\nWearing your heart in your sleeve\nwill have to be tested to look\nat the long-term effects of\nwearing this heart-saving\nsleeve, as well as finding new\nways to attach it to the heart\ntissue (the current methods\nare not good for long-term\nimplantation).\nThis is an exciting step in\nthe field of applied robotics.\nIt looks like robots that can\neasily interact with and mimic\ntissues is the future could\nhave a firm future within the\nmedical world. Perhaps one\nday it\u2019ll be the norm to have\nrobotically-enhanced tissues\nkeeping us alive?\neyesight and sense of smell\nwere impaired, the males\nfailed to detect the ranking\nhierarchy in females, leading\nthe scientists to conclude that\nthe choices made earlier were\nbased on a combination of\nvisual and olfactory cues.\nMaking decisions based\non logic has always been\nassociated as a trait unique\nto humans. This study turns\nout to be among the first of\nits kind, providing evidence\nthat some species besides\nhumans may also be capable\nof rational decision making.\nprocesses.\n\\\\ Ellen Roche/Harvard SEAS\n\\\\ More testing\nwill have to be\ndone to look at\nlong-term effects of\nimplantation \\\\\n\\\\ stoppestinfo\n\n"

Will\nit lead to change?\nIn a liberal democracy, political dissent by citizens can\ntake the form of writing letters,\nlobbying, or voting representatives out at the ballot box.\nThese act through intermedi-aries. Direct action \u2013 boycotts,\ndemonstrations and strikes circumvent these. Street protests\nare a way of physically manifesting a group\u2019s opposition to\nan idea \u2013 letters can be thrown\nout, elections come around\nevery four years or so, but\nlarge groups of people shutting down streets in response to\nReal change\ncomes from\nreal action\nGiacomo Boscaini-Gilroy is\ndismissive of Saturday's protests\nan issue are harder to ignore.\nO\nh, you went on Saturday\u2019s march? You must\nhave the moral high\nground now. You 100%\nchanged the world by\nwalking around with a\nsign. Here\u2019s a reality check: the only way\nto influence the nation is through gov-ernment. You didn\u2019t make any tangible\nchange, you sent a letter of complaint: 'Hi,\nI think you are meanies and this is how angry I\u2019m going to get if you continue.\u2019 How\noften does a head of state listen to a pro-test?\nS\nV\nIt\u2019s not always about the\ninstant gratification of legislative change. After all, doctors\nprotested for months last year\nto little avail, student fees\nwere raised despite protest,\nand troops were deployed to\nIraq despite protest; however,\na slow attrition of opposition\ncan eventually lead to a sea of change.\nWomen\u2019s suffrage was achieved by pro-tests, and protests advanced civil rights for\nethnic minorities, addressed AIDS funding,\nand led to the overthrowing of autocracies\nin favour of democratic elections. Successful campaigns of change are built on\nsustained organised dissent, but they rely\non the spark of protest on the streets to\nbring the issues into focus. Demonstrations\nensure that those in power know that their\nproblems won\u2019t be going away. It\u2019s no coincidence that the first thing on a despotic\nagenda is to limit the rights of people to\npeacefully assemble.\n\u201cWhite moderates\u201d, wrote Martin Luther\nKing Jr, were the greatest hurdle to the\nblack Americans\u2019 goal of equal rights. His\nwords are just as applicable to other types\nof moderates \u2013 the kind of person who is\n\u201cmore devoted to the absence of tension\nthan to the presence of justice\u201d. Some of\nthose who railed against the Women\u2019s\nMarches agree with the need for equality,\nbut question the \u201cmethods of direct action\u201d.\nDr King writes that these are the people\nwho believe they \u201ccan set the timetable\nfor another man\u2019s freedom\u201d, \u2019allies\u2019 who\npreach waiting \u201cfor a more convenient\nseason.\u201d\nThere will of course never be a \u2018convenient season\u2019 for any sort of protester \u2013 any\npublic show of opposition is bound to bring\ntension and disrupt traffic. Likewise, single\nprotests cannot solve all the world\u2019s prob-lems. A protest about equal pay in the UK\nis unlikely to do much for oppression in\nSaudi Arabia, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s\nworthless; there isn\u2019t some pot of equality\nthat will run out. If you disagree with the\nideals that those in power broadcast, it\u2019s\nnot enough to stay at home and voice that\ndisagreement in private or via Facebook\nlikes. It behoves you to turn up and keep\nturning up \u2013 to write letters, make calls,\nand to vote (even in the boring elections);\nto be visible in your dissent.\nLet\u2019s be honest, people go on demonstrations for their own self-indulgence. It gives\nthem a good feeling when they see others\nwho think the way they do. It gives them\nconfidence and hope in a world of hate.\nSo it\u2019s a shame that it doesn\u2019t make any\ndifference in the real world, and they\u2019re\nhelping themselves rather than others.\nChanting \u2018Fuck Tory Scum\u2019 is preaching\nto the preached. Everyone there knew that\nalready. But what do you think Theresa\nMay\u2019s thoughts on your choice of wording\nare? FOX News viewers and Daily Mail\nreaders are those who you should really\nbe communicating yourself to, but you\u2019re\nnot going to get through to them that way.\nI got proper fired up by the Brexit protests\non 24th\nJune and in the days after. It makes\nme seethe. If you cared so much about staying in the EU, why didn\u2019t you do anything\nwhen, say, it actually mattered? Do you\nreally think going for a stroll because your\nmate asked you will change something?\nI\u2019ll grant you that in isolated\ncases, protest itself can make\nchange. UCL\u2019s rent strike was\ninfluential because it affected\nthe university\u2019s income, and\nthey can\u2019t ignore a lack of\nfunds. But if you do nothing\nmore substantial than going\non a march and you think the\nwork is done, you\u2019re wrong.\nSo what more do I suggest\nthat people do? Get out there\nand prompt others to develop\ntheir views. Start controversial\nconversations with people you\nknow, friends, family, stand\non a soapbox at Speakers\u2019\nCorner. Ask questions to tackle\nissues like consent and the pros\nand cons of tuition fees. Discussion is key. There are also ways\nto make your voice heard in the\nmedia or in the political sphere.\nJoin a political party and be\ninvolved in its policy-making.\nI\u2019m not perfect but I went to\nthe EU parliament in Brussels to\npresent a petition to save Erasmus in Britain. I also wrote to\nmy MP to show my distaste at\nTheresa May\u2019s treatment of our\ninternational students when\nshe was Home Secretary. Let\u2019s\nhave real change, and that\ncomes through real action.\nSo you went\nto the march.\nWhat's next?\nMadeleine Webb discusses how to stay\npolitically engaged now that the world\nhas exploded\nP\nrotesting was the\neasy bit. Sorry to\nbreak it to you, but\nthe Women\u2019s March\nwas not the finale,\nit was the opening\nnumber, and the rest of the\nshow is no fun at all. I hate to\nruin the mood because I was\nthere on Saturday so I understand how intoxicating it can\nbe \u2013 screaming \u201cI\u2019m mad as\nhell and I\u2019m not going to take\nit anymore\u201d is satisfying, but\nit doesn\u2019t actually change an-ything. It\u2019s important to recognise that the fight is only\nstarting because you can\u2019t win\nfights you aren\u2019t in. So what\ncan we do?\nHelpfully, the Women\u2019s\nMarch London has launched\n10 Actions in 100 Days, providing a list of ten things we\ncan all do to channel our\npost-march energy. The first\nstep is writing to your local\nMP or Theresa May herself, to\nencourage her to reaffirm the\nUK\u2019s commitment to human\nrights when she meets with\nDonald Trump. There is even\n\\\\ It's important to recognise\nthat the fight is only starting\nbecause you can't win fights\nyou aren't in \\\\\nan email template for you to\nuse on their website. Easy.\nStay Informed\nDon\u2019t get your news from\nFacebook or Twitter. Please.\nOne of the biggest stories\nof 2016 was the ridiculous\namount of fake news flying\naround social media and\npeople not fact checking the\nstuff they retweet. And yes, the\nleading political commentators\nprobably won\u2019t be sharing stories about Hillary Clinton being\na murderer/paedophile/ lizard\nperson, but a little thing called\nconfirmation bias means even\nif you\u2019re following the 'honest'\npeople, you\u2019ll only be getting the side of the story you\nalready agree with. Odds are\nif your sources are websites\nlike True Conservative News\nor The Liberal Review, you\u2019re in\na bubble of facts some people\nmay consider to be 'alterna-tive'. Reliable sources are the\nsafest way to not become\n'that friend' on Facebook\nwho constantly posts political\ngarbage. Sticking to BBC,\nC-SPAN, and the fact-based\nsources should do the trick.\nDonate\nYou\u2019re a student, you don\u2019t\nhave any money, and I get it.\nHowever, even the smallest\ndonations can make an impact,\nespecially since governments\nboth at home and in America\nare cutting funding to nonprofit organisations; it\u2019s time\nto put your money where your\nmouth is. However, charitable\norganisations don\u2019t always\nwant your money. Healthcare\nclinics need escorting staff for\npatient safety, homeless kitchens often need volunteers, and\nrefugee charities take clothing\ndonations for those who have\nlost everything. Also, research\nthe charities your giving to,\nas some are more effective\nthan others at bringing about\nchange in the world. If you\u2019re\nspecifically looking for feminist\ncauses close to home post-march, Reclaim the Night,\nRosa, and The Feminist Library\nare all great projects based in\nLondon.\n\\\\ Being honest\nabout your own\nbiases is also\nkey: you are not\nexcluded from this\nstep \\\\\n\\\\ Screaming \"I'm\nmad as hell and\nI'm not going to\ntake it any more\"\nis satisfying, but\nit doesn't actually\nchange anything \\\\\nCall people out (including\nyourself)\nA lot of the institutionalised\ndiscrimination in the world\nis cultural; the way different\ngroups are represented (or not\nrepresented at all) in the media\nand wider society reinforces\nstereotypes and cultivates igno-rance. And although it feels\nlike the world is full of it, calling\nout bullshit when you see it can\nactually help. Trump\u2019s election\ndoesn\u2019t mean sexual assault\nis a joke \u2013if you know people\nwho think that it\u2019s 'locker-room'\ntalk, correct them. Thoroughly. I\nknow it\u2019s awkward and terrible\nbut laughing with them isn\u2019t a\nsolution. As for less gross political disagreements, calmly and\nrespectfully talking about why\nsomeone may be misinformed\nor why you disagree can be\nproductive. Most people will\nrespond thoughtfully even if\nthey don\u2019t change their minds.\nBeing honest about your own\nbiases is also key; you are\nnot excluded from this step.\nFor example, the Women\u2019s\nMarch was hailed (rightly so)\nas a show of political force for\nwomen globally and for men\nwho support gender equality.\nBut this doesn\u2019t remove the\nuncomfortable fact that 53%\nof white women voted for\nTrump despite (or more worry-ingly, possibly because of) his\nopposition to women\u2019s healthcare rights, pay equity & his\nwell-known \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d\ncomments. Other people have\nwritten far more eloquently\nabout the issues around mainstream 'white feminism' but\nrecognising your own blind\nspots and doing your best to\neducate yourself can only help.\nEmpathise\nOK, so this one is for the\npeople who thought the march\nwasn\u2019t a big deal and we\u2019re\nall just being overly dramatic\nor competitively 'woke' or\nwhatever. I\u2019m not going to try\nand convert you to the cause\nbecause I\u2019ll just be wasting\ncolumn inches and my breath.\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with\nme, or the rest of the people\nwho marched. But millions\ndid march worldwide, so\ndismissing everyone who was\ninvolved as 'sensitive snow-flakes' is an ignorant move\nto begin with. Whether you\nthink their feelings are justified\nor not, in the world of Trump\nand Brexit, people are scared.\nIslamophobia has never been\nso obvious than the online\nabuse Linda Sarsour, one of\nthe organisers of the Women\u2019s\nmarch, has faced, including\nfalse accusations of anti-Sem-itism and terrorist links. We\nlike to think discrimination of\nminority groups was a problem we left behind us, in the\n20th\ncentury, but the data just\ndoesn\u2019t back that up, the success of the Trump campaign\nconfirms it. I think being told\nyou have 'privilege' whether it\nbe male, white or straight provokes such a strong response\nin people because it implies\nyou\u2019ve had it easy. The truth is\nvery few people have it completely easy. But really, it just\nmeans that other people have\nhad to deal with obstacles that\nyou haven\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t mean\nyou have to feel bad, but in a\nworld of instant outrage and\npolitical polarisation, empathy\nto those who are different from\nyou is invaluable.\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nM I L L E N N I A L S\nFriday 27 January 2017 25\nmillennials.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/millennials\nAvocado for breakfast? So #2k16\nFiredog is on a mission to revamp\nthe hipster breakfast, causing\npanic amongst avocado growers\nworldwide. Enter a morning realm of\ngrilled halloumi, Sujuk and Lor.\nM\nezze.\nA word\nmeaning a\nselection\nof small\nappetizers.\nAnd a word that I have\nrecently started noticing\nfollowing a sharing plates\ntrend that has finally hit the\nLondon food scene. After\nsome hearty meals, I have\nadjusted my taste buds (and\nstomach) to this wonderful\ndining culture home to\nTurkey, Greece and the\nMiddle East.\nFor me, the beauty of\nmezze is to watch the dishes\non the table grow into a\nparty of flavours, textures\nand colours. Not only that,\nbut the hours of cheerful,\nrelaxed socializing and\ndrinks that come with it.\nLast week, an invite landed\nin my inbox from Firedog\nto try their breakfast mezze\nmenu. Firedog is a new\nAegean inspired restaurant\nnear Tottenham Court Road,\nboasting of their unique\nmenu of dishes influenced\nby Greek and Turkish\nculture, and their mission of\nreinvigorating the morning\ndining scene with their \u2018no\navocado\u2019 policy.\nI\u2019m always up for trying all\nthe new restaurants popping\nup in London, but waking up\nto a feast of these delicious\nsmall plates? YES, please!\n(They did say to eat breakfast like a king.)\nSo one bright, sunny\nmorning a few days later,\nI hopped along the quiet\nNewman Street to Firedog.\nPushing open the dark,\nwooden doors, I was lead to\na surprise \u2013 bassy, electronic\nmusic, a bar, and their logo\nin bright neon lights in pink,\nblue and red on the wall. I\ninstantly fell in love with their\nunique vibes.\nThe waiters were just laying\nthe table with the mezze\ndishes as I walked further\ninto the restaurant. Just\nseeing the tiny terracotta\nplates and tiles was enough\nto get my adrenaline rush-ing. Even the slab of butter\nhad its own mini tile. I was\nnot the only one \u2013 the whole\nroom was filled with gasps\nand sparkling eyes set on the\ntables.\n5-minutes later we were all\nseated and excited to start.\nOur eyes were bombarded\nwith the burst of colours, the\nvariety of food and textures:\nAegean olives, grilled\nhalloumi, freshly made Lor\n(a soft, Turkish curd cheese),\nSujuk (a dry, spicy sausage),\ntomatoes with purple basil,\ncucumber with specks of\npoppy seeds, clotted cream\nwith honeycomb\u2026 and of\ncourse, a bowl of flatbreads\nto share and to mop up the\ntahini.\nThe spread was an adventure for my taste buds,\nfrom my normal western\nflavours to a hit of spices,\ningredients, and flavours.\nThe tomatoes and cucumber\nwere refreshing, balancing\nout the cheeses and Sujuk.\nMy favourite was their house\nchilli eggs, that is, scrambled\neggs with harissa \u2013 it was\na delicious change from my\nusual scrambled eggs on\ntoast.\nAnd when we thought we\u2019d\neaten enough to ditch our\nlunch boxes and cancel our\ndinner dates, we were also\nflavours in the form of staple\nbrunch dishes.\nThe baked eggs came with\nherb yoghurt, chilli oil, the\nsweetness from the charred\npeppers and the strong,\nenticing smoky flavours from\nthe smoked tomatoes.\nThe Sujuk hash starred\nchunks of the sausage itself,\ncombined with sweet roasted\nonions, spinach, potatoes,\nand a runny poached egg\non top.\nThe Ozdemir Pasha II was\nlike a mini mezze selection\non a plate, featuring grilled\nhalloumi, the tasty smoked\ntomatoes, fried eggs, and a\nbeetroot hummus that was a\nbeautiful purple colour.\nWhat\u2019s a breakfast menu\nwith a sweet option? How\nabout a jaw-dropping presentation of toasted brioche,\njuicy chargrilled plums,\nkaymak (clotted cream),\npistachios and honey? I\u2019d\nhappily replace my French\ntoast with this lighter, yet\nequally indulgent and\neggless version.\nIt\u2019s customary in the Mediterranean and the Middle\nEast to not let your guests\nChristy Lam\nintroduced to the four all-day\nbreakfast dishes, an option\nfor those who (sadly) can\u2019t\nfit the breakfast mezze. The\nplates were again a burst\nof colour, offering a taste\nof Aegean ingredients and\nleave without a 3-month\nfood baby \u2013 and neither did\nFiredog. This breakfast was\nindeed a creative, contemporary and delicious twist\non the traditional Aegean\nrecipes for anyone who\u2019s\ntired of their boring crushed\navocado on sourdough!\n\\\\ Just seeing the\ntiny terracotta\nplates and tiles was\nenough to get my\nadrenaline rushing.\nEven the slab of\nbutter had its own\nmini tile \\\\\n\\\\ Their mission:\nreinvigorating the\nmorning dining\nscene with their \u2018no\navocado\u2019 policy and\ninstead having you\nwake up to\na feast of small\nplates \\\\\n\n"

Among the signs about\npussies and abortion rights, there were a\nfew that stuck out like sore thumbs, no more\nso than the one that read \u201cClean Coal is a\nMYTH!\u201d At the time it seemed incongruous,\nbut today it seems eerily prescient: over his\nfirst five days in office, Trump has not only\ndecimated global abortion rights by signing\na gag bill, blocking US-funding overseas, but\nhe has lied about how many people attended\nthe inauguration, reinstated the Dakota Access\npipeline, and started planning his border wall.\nHis team even coined the idiotic neologism\n\u2018alternative facts\u2019, which would be laughable if\nit weren\u2019t so terrifying.\nSo to see environmental protesters at the\nWomen\u2019s March wasn\u2019t only to be expected,\nbut to be celebrated. Those opposing Trump\nare now faced with two choices, given the\nwide range of targets he has taken on: either\nwe can spread ourselves too thin, trying to\ntake on way too many topics at one time; or,\nenvironmentalists, civil rights activists, and\nfeminists of every colour and creed can unite\ntogether to resist any moves that Trump tries\nto make. Based on last Saturday, when it is\nestimated up to 100,000 people marched, the\nlatter route is being taken. I can only hope that\nthe momentum is kept up long enough to enact\nreal, tangible change.\nR\negardless of whether you believed\nDonald Trump meant what he said,\nthere was little doubt that he had\nmade some shocking statements.\nIn my eyes, this left two possibilities for those who voted for him in\nNovember; either they agreed with his state-ments, or they voted for him despite of them.\nAnd I was satisfied with neither.\nI marched because I feared that the election\nresult would legitimise comments of this nature,\nand in particular for my concern over the President\u2019s seeming dismissal of issues concerning\nsexual harassment.\nSadly less than a week in his presidency\nour worst fears have turned out to have been\nprophecies.\nFred Fyles\nHelen Money-Kyrle\nProtesting Trump | The Women\u2019s March through the eyes of Imperial students\nWe talked to some of our editors, contributors and readers about their\nparticipation in the weekend\u2019s anti-Trump marches. Here are their hopes,\ntheir fears. Here are their thoughts. Here are their testimonials.\nI\nasked myself a question the first time I\nheard about the Women\u2019s March: Is it\nnecessary? The answer is yes. I joined\ntens of thousands of people because I\nneeded to share a message too. It was not\na complaint. We advocated tolerance and\nrespect for everyone, after all, women\u2019s rights\nare human rights. I marched because I could\nand some could not \u2013 as one placard read,\n\u201cI raise up my voice so that others can be\nheard\u201d. And it mattered because it was part of\na movement.\nHope was the predominant feeling\namongst all kinds of supporters. Carrie\nFisher\u2019s Leia was one of the leaders of\nthis rebellion, portrayed alongside the\nwords \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the resistance\u201d. All of us, we are the resistance.\nI will keep on marching so that little\ngirl who was by my side knows that she\nis powerful, that when the world turns\nupside down, we rise up. I am not afraid\nof the future, because democracy will\neventually listen. Because we will build\nbridges instead of walls. Because love\ntrumps hate.\nT\nhe march was fantastic! It was\nprimarily the atmosphere that\ndid it because despite it being\nthe Women\u2019s March all sorts of\ncauses came up to join us. So it\nfelt rewarding and inspiring just\nto be surrounded by SO many people who\nreally believed that the world deserved better\nand the \u2018power of the people\u2019 would help\nit become that. Personally, I do have strong\nfeelings about equal rights and peace and\nI want to stand up not just for my friends or\nmy sister/mum but for women from around\nthe world who are mistreated or who aren\u2019t\ngranted the basic human rights we all deserve.\nOn hearing of an event to primarily campaign\nfor these issues I couldn\u2019t not go.\nThough the march was centred around\nTrump, that didn\u2019t seem to make it feel more\npolitical. It didn\u2019t take away the feeling of\nsolidarity.\nIt felt very empowering and exhilarating to\nwalk through central London (especially in\ntights, a thong and a pair of balloons) and\nthere was a strong sense of togetherness. In\nthe end I came out of it feeling like there was\nmore hope in the world especially after seeing\nmasses and masses of people walk by me;\npeople who believed in the same things as me,\nas all of us. It was great to actually voice my\nopinions!\nAna Villanueva\nEsther Maltby\n\\\\ Esther Maltby\n\\\\ Esther Maltby\n\\\\ Indira Mallik \\\\ Indira Mallik\n\\\\ Piramol Krishnan\n\\\\ Tom Hartley\n\\\\ Indira Mallik\n\n"

    "content": "felix C U L T U R E\n20 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 17 January 2017\nTerrains of the\nBody is a bold\nbut beguiling\nshow\nJ\nohn Berger once\nwrote, 'A woman\nmust continually\nwatch herself,\u2019\nThe writer and\ncritic who died\nearlier this month continued,\n\u2018she is almost continually\naccompanied by her own\nimage of herself.\u2019 There\nis never a situation where\nBerger\u2019s words don\u2019t shed\nlight on complex ideas, but\nthese lines have heightened\nrelevance in regards to\nTerrains of the Body, a\ncollection of photographs\nfrom the National Gallery\nof Women in the Arts,\ncurrently being shown at the\nWhitechapel Gallery.\nThe show \u2013 deliberately\ntaking place opposite a Guerrilla Girls exhibit highlighting\nthe lack of women in the arts\n\u2013 attempts to pack a legion\nof narratives within a small\nspace, connecting works from\n17 artists working across five\ncontinents. The linking thread\nis that all works attempt\nto deal with how women\nphotographers deal with the\nfemale form in their work.\nIn some works, this is crystal\nclear: Nan Goldin\u2019s piece\nfrom The Ballad of Sexual\nDependency, which charted\nher life in New York of the\nearly 1980s, perfectly captures the heady combination\nof celebration and tragedy\nwhich defines her work. Similarly, Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s photos\nare taken from her Beach Portraits series, which show teens\nposing on a beach; Dijkstra's\nwork speaks of the awkward\ntransition point between child\nand adult at which the subject\nis placed.\nIn Anna Gaskell\u2019s masterful\nwork, Eraser \u2013 a highlight\nof the show, and the only\nvideo-work on display \u2013 a\nnumber of schoolgirls tell the\nstory of her own mother\u2019s\ndeath in a car accident.\nThroughout the video, the narrative voice changes, through\nfirst, second, and third\nperson, until the boundary\nbetween performer and audi-ence, surveyor and surveyed,\nis completely distorted.\nThis blurring of voices mirrors Gaskell\u2019s photographic\nwork: entitled Untitled #104\n(A Short Story of Happenstance). The image shows a\nwoman\u2019s legs, sticking up and\njuxtaposed against a backdrop of woodland trees; the\nimplication is that something\nhas gone horribly wrong, but\nthe viewer is caught in the\nmiddle of the story, left unsure\nabout what is happening or\nwhy. Interrupted narratives\nare further explored in Justine\nKurland\u2019s unsettling works.\nFred Fyles\nOne shows pregnant women\nand young children frolicking\nby a waterfall, while the other\nfeatures two girls lying on\na raft, being dragged by a\nthird, possibly into the sea.\nThese images present the\nfemale form in a way that\ndenies the viewer the satisfaction of a complete narrative.\nHellen van Meene\u2019s works\ncombine this unsteady storyline with a heady mix of\nsensual textures and colours.\nHer works are celebrations\nof surface, with Vermeer-light\nlike dappling across her sub-jects, bringing an incredible\nsense of tactility. Janaina\nTschape\u2019s work shares this\nobsession with tone, and both\nher and van Meene\u2019s works\nare reminiscent of Francesca\nWoodman\u2019s haunting self-por-traits, albeit with less of an\nemotional punch.\nFor other artists, photography can be an opportunity to\nexamine the structures present\nwithin the art world itself as\nan institution. Kirsten Justesen\u2019s piece, which draws on\nher previous work in the feminist art movement, sees the\nartist herself transformed into\na work, as she climbs into a\ndisplay case of small statuary.\nJustesen, who trained as a\nsculptor, is simultaneously the\ncreator of art and a work of\nart itself; she both represents\nand is represented. Justesen\nis no doubt aware \u2013 as the\n\\\\ While multiple\nmeanings can be a\ngreat thing to expe-rience, the exhibition\nis let down by the\nlack of explanatory\ncontext for many of\nthe works \\\\\nTerrains of the Body is on at\nthe Whitechapel Gallery until\n16th April 2017\nFree entry\nHellen van Meene, Untitled (79), (2000) \\\\ Hellen\nvan Meene and Yancey Richardson Gallery\nGuerrilla Girls point out \u2013\nthat many galleries would\nmuch rather hang images of\nwomen on their walls than\nworks by actual women. In a\nsimilar theme, as part of her\nR\u00e4umer series, Candida H\u00f6fer\nshows the empty hall of the\nPalazzo Zenobio in Venice,\nbut retains a reflection of\nherself in a mirror, making her\npresence fully known.\nOne of the highlights of\nthis show is the multiplicity of\nvoices on display. The name\nof the show itself reflects\nthe multiple domains within\nthe works: \u2018terrain\u2019 can be\na representation of nature,\ntracing the lineage of the\n\u2018earth mother\u2019 iconography;\nbut it also links in with power,\nasking who has the right to\ndefine what constitutes a\ncertain territory.\nBut while multiple meanings\ncan be a great thing to expe-rience, the exhibition is let\ndown by the lack of explanatory context for many of the\nworks. This is most obviously a\nproblem in Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2019s piece, The Hero: originally\na video-work dedicated to\nher father, which featured\nher singing the Yugoslavian\nnational anthem from the time\nof General Tito, in this exhibition it is only a still, meaning\nwe miss out on the full power\nof the original. Similarly,\nNikki S. Lee\u2019s pieces, from\nher series Projects, depict her\nimmersing herself in different\nAmerican subcultures until she\nis accepted \u2013 like Cindy Sherman gone method actor \u2013 but\nthe audience is never made\naware of this.\nThroughout Terrains of the\nBody there are moments of\nclarity, where everything\nbegins to come together,\nbut these are too often\ninterrupted with pieces whose\nlack of contextual information\ndistorts their meaning and\nlessens their impact. If you\nwant to get the most of this\nstrange terrain, I\u2019d suggest\nbringing your own map.\n\n"

Britain will \u201cwelcome agreement to continue to collaborate\nwith our European partners on\nmajor science, research, and\ntechnology initiatives\u201d, chiefly\nbecause without this collabora-tion, UK universities just aren\u2019t\nas attractive to students and re-searchers.\nSlightly more concrete plans\nUnion launches 2017-20 strategy\nBut where did all the measurables go?\nLef Apostolakis\na new team of Sabbatical\nOfficers every year might not\nbe the best plan for moving\nforward effectively. With such\na short term vision and a lack\nof long term measurables, it is\neasy to lose the ball especially\nwhen most changes require\nyears of lobbying.\nOn the plus side the students\ndid get a series of positive\nannouncements including a\nlong overdue 10% increase in\nClubs and Societies spending\n(which has been lagging\nbehind inflation for a number\nof years), as well as the\nrefurbishment of the Charing\nCross common room.\nAccording to a Union\nsource that would like to\nremain anonymous, the lack\nof detailed action proposals\nmight be due to current\nstaffing problems. There\ncertainly has been a lot of\nmobility recently, with several\nstaff members leaving the\nunion and reshuffling within\nthe organisation over the last\nyear. The union has refuted\nsuch claims though.\nT\nhe Union launched\na new three year\nstrategy last week\nin Metric, at an\nevent that was the\nculmination of a\nsix month effort to meet (or\nat the very least express) the\nneeds and wants of Imperial\nstudents. Despite vigorous\nconsultation though, student\nreaction was luke-warm.\nThestrategyisacollaborative\neffort between the Officer\nTrustees and the Management\nof the Union. Efforts first began\nlast March and involved\nmultiple public consultations,\nsurveys and interviews.\nDuring the launch, welcome\nspeeches were given by Union\nPresident Nas Andriopoulos\naddressing \u201cthe young minds\u201d\nof Imperial, followed by the\nChair of the Board of Trustees,\nNeil Sachdev, and the Union\nManaging Director Jarlath\nO\u2019Hara.\nIts five main \u201caims\u201d and\n15 \u201cobjectives\u201d can be\nsummarised in increasing the\nUnion\u2019s reach, its support\ncapacity, enhancing student\nenjoyment and \u201ctalents\u201d,\nempowering students and\noverall ensuring a smooth\nrunning Union.\nThe strategy might look nice\non paper, however there is\nnot much information on how\nthe Union aims to achieve\nits objectives. Undeniably\n\u201cdeepening, firing up and\nextending democracy\u201d is a\nnoble (and meme-inspiring)\nambition, though some\nstudents felt that the lack of\nmeasurable strategic points\ndetracted from the sentiment.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just hold an event\nfor deepening, extending and\nengorging. Where is the rest\nof the strategy?\u201d said Theresa\nDavey, a materials PhD\nstudent who\u2019s spent nearly\na decade at Imperial. \u201cFive\nsets of bullet points and three\nstudent testimonials are not a\nstrategy that you can have a\nparty for.\u201d\nThis becomes particularly\nobvious when comparing the\nnew strategy to the previous\none. Although the 2013-16\nstrategy had very similar aims,\neach aim had not only more\nobjectives but objectives which\nwere much more tangible.\nFor example to improve\nthe student experience, the\n2013-16 strategy clearly\nand concisely outlined eight\nmeasures to be adopted by\n2016 such as \u201censure that\nthe Union delivers at least\nthree key contributors to the\nCollege\u2019s Graduate Attributes\nproject\u201d or \u201cincrease the\nnumber of students employed\nby the Union in each year of\nthe plan\u201d.\nSimilarly to build the student\ncommunity the union would\ntry to \u201cpublish an annual\n\u2018Advocacy to Action\u2019 Report\u201d\nand \u201cdevelop, publish and\ndeliver a Campus Outreach\nPlan\u201d by 2016. These are parts\nfrom two specific proposed\nactions from a list of seven.\nThe new strategy on the\nother hand aims to \u201cenhance\nthe enjoyment and talents of\nour members\u201d (i.e. enhance\nstudent experience in 2013\nlingo) by \u201c[providing] systems,\nstaff support and funding for\nvolunteers to enable them to\nmaximise the impact of their\nRoles\u201d and \u201c[being]\nrecognised as leaders for the\nvalue that our activities add\nto students\u2019 personal and\nprofessional development\u201d.\nThese are two full objectives\nfrom a list of three and quite\nliterally amount to almost a\nfifth of the strategy.\n\u201cThe 2013-16 and 2017-20\nstrategies are intentionally\nvery different in their style\nand composition,\u201d says\nAndriopoulos. \u201cThe 2013-16 strategy, Our Plan, had\nthe task of transforming\nImperial College Union after\na challenging period, and\nit did so by setting specific,\nmeasurable targets \u2013\nconsolidating our strengths\n(such as Clubs, Societies &\nProjects), creating specific new\ninitiatives (such as the Student\nAcademic Choice Awards,\nImperial Plus, and Give It A\nGo), and focusing on financial\nviability.\u201d Andriopoulos refers\nto the disastrous 2011 Summer\nBall which made a loss of\nover \u00a3100,000, effectively\nbankrupting the Union.\nYet it\u2019s not quite as\nstraightforward to tell what\nwas actually achieved during\nthe 2013-16 plan. There is no\ncomprehensive report on the\nstrategy. Instead there are\nplans \u201cto publish a review of\nOur Plan 2013-16 later this\nacademic year.\u201d Andriopoulos\ncontinues by saying that \u201cwhen\nthe plan was in effect, there\nwas an annual Operational\nPlan which set out that year\u2019s\nspecific targets, and the\nperformance of staff teams\nwas assessed against these.\nWe also published updates\nin our Impact Reports, as well\nas extensive communication\nto students and internal\ncommunication to staff.\u201d It\u2019s\nunclear however what the\npolicy makers learned from the\nprevious strategy and whether\nthey\u2019ve implemented it in this\nround of policy making.\nThe Union claims its strategy\nto be in line with best practice\nfrom the charitable sector,\ndrawing comparison with\nthe strategies of Amnesty\nInternational and Shelter,\nwhichhaveannualoperational\nplans with more concrete,\nmeasurable goals. The Union\ndoes suffer an annual brain\ndrain due to the electoral\nprocess though, so coming up\nwith an annual operational\nplan and handing it over to\nBEEP BEEP BEEP | Brexit update\nMore optimistic than you getting a 2:1 degree?\nMatt Johnston\nicines Agency, predicted to\ntake itself and its 700+ jobs to\nanother European location. A\nsimilar UK board may emerge\nin its place to try and pick up\nboth the jobs and the role, but\nthat might be a little too much\nplanning and foresight for Jeremy Hunt.\nSo what can we expect in the\nnext few months? Well aside\nfrom the actual negotiation of\nBrexit, the Supreme Court dismissed the Government\u2019s appeal of the High Court\u2019s ruling\non the process of triggering\nArticle 50. What it all boils\ndown to is that a bill needs to\nbe passed that then allows the\nGovernment to trigger Article\n50. Tory MPs in favour of Brexit are looking to fast track the\nbill as soon as possible (likely\nbefore the end of February)\nbut opposition MPs may try\nand amend/stall the bill on its\nway through. Put simply, barring a massive shock, this bill\nwill go through the House of\nCommons and likely through\nthe House of Lords too. Any\nattempt to block the bill after\nthe referendum will probably\nspark chaos. Chaos that could\nrange anywhere from the Daily Mail getting a bit upset, to\na general election or even the\nabolition of the House of Lords.\nStay tuned.\nT\nhe sun keeps on\nrising, the world\nkeeps on spinning\nand the Brexit debate rages on. Last\nweek Theresa May\nmade a speech at Lancaster House which outlined her\ntwelve point plan for the UK\u2019s\nnegotiation plan as she looks\nto trigger Article 50 and leave\nthe European Union for good.\nThe main headline is, if the\nPM gets her way, the UK will\nbe pursuing a \u201charder\u201d Brexit,\none in which the UK leaves the\nsingle market. This is in tandem\nwith the UK planning to forge\nnew trade deals with the wider\nworld, likely the topic of conversation as May meets with\nPresident Trump next week.\nWith the UK leaving the single market (or at least planning\nto), freedom of movement is\nalmost undoubtedly going to\ndiminish, but May still wants to\nmaintain the Common Travel\nArea within Ireland. Having\na land border with the EU is\ntricky to say the least, especially with the mantra \u201ccontrolling\nour borders\u201d being brought up\ntime and time again. Speaking\nof the constituent countries within the union, May has promised\nthat when powers are brought\nback from Brussels, the relevant ones will be devolved to\nScotland, Wales and Northern\nIreland. How much is devolved\nremains to be seen though. This\nis also a little tricky in Northern\nIreland at the moment as the\ntwo parties in power are having their own fight over heating\nbills (like you and your house-mates) and have called a set of\nelections in early March to try\nand restore order again.\nThe PM also announced a\nbit more transparency with\nregards to her strategy, but\nwould not be revealing the\n\u201cblow-by-blow details\u201d (that\u2019s\none for all you playing Brexit\nbuzzword bingo at home). It\nwas also announced, unsur-prisingly, that a new free trade\nagreement with European markets is being pursued after we\nleave the common market, as\nwe try and pick and choose as\nmuch of the good stuff of EU\nmembership whilst avoiding\nall the downsides. Easy, right?\nThe final proposal will be put\nto a vote in both Houses at the\nend of it all, but it\u2019s likely that\nthis vote will go through in the\nCommons at least, due to the\nConservative majority.\nScience and innovation was\nalso brought up in the speech,\nare to be laid out in a \u2018white\npaper\u2019, essentially a more formal statement of government\npolicy going forward. This will\nbe a statement of intent from\nthe government and gives opposition parties (and indeed\nopposition within her own par-ty) a chance to scrutinise the\nplans in full.\nOne scientific institute that is\nlikely to leave sooner rather\nthan later is the European Med\\\\ With the UK\nleaving the single\nmarket (or at\nleast planning\nto), freedom of\nmovement is almost\nundoubtedly going\nto diminish \\\\\n\\\\ Britain will\nwelcome\nagreement to\ncontinue to\ncollaborate with our\nEuropean partners\non major science,\nresearch, and\ntechnology\ninitiatives \\\\\nGlobal Britain or Little Britain? \\\\ Jay Allen\nBrexit (noun): Brexit \\\\ felix\n2017-20 is a lot more sparse on the details and a lot more vague (Left: 2013-16 Strategy, Right: 2017-20) \\\\ felix\n\\\\ \u201cDeepening, firing\nup and extending\ndemocracy\u201d is a\nnoble (and meme-inspiring) ambition \\\\\n\n"

Lil Wayne | Tha\nCarter V\nCast your mind back to June 2008. Lil Wayne and Birdman were still best mates and Wayne had just dropped his critically\nacclaimed sixth studio album, including four top 20 singles, and went on to be Wayne\u2019s most successful to date, selling 3.6 million\ncopies and winning the Grammy for \u2018Best Rap Album\u2019 in 2009. Since then, a lot has happened in Lil Wayne\u2019s personal life, including\na prison sentence and the threat of retirement. It\u2019s fair to say that Lil Wayne\u2019s career has stalled in recent years. In 2013, Wayne\nannounced that Tha Carter V would be his final album. It was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, however a messy contract dispute between Lil Wayne and Birdman has meant that fans have been starved of Tha Carter V for more than two years.\nThe Come Up Show \\\\\n2016 was an outstanding year for hip-hop and urban culture, with all the major players dropping\nprojects. Even artists like J. Cole and Frank Ocean rediscovered their ability to actually release\nsome music. In the UK, the grime and urban scene continued to flourish. It seems like an impossible\ntask for 2017 to top last year but, after only a month, we\u2019ve already been treated to new material\nfrom Wiley and a \u2018playlist\u2019 from Drake on the horizon, we have plenty to look forward to.\nA$AP Rocky, the leader of the A$AP Mob, hasn\u2019t released a solo project since his second studio album: 2015\u2019s At. Long. Last. A$AP. The\nalbum was brilliant and definitely one of the best projects of that year, but his releases have been sparse ever since, with Rocky preferring\nto instead focus on his other interests, like Kendall Jenner. He\u2019s recently been pictured in the studio with the likes of Lenny Kravitz and Jim\nJonsin and, if the experimental style of his last album is anything to go by, it will be interesting to hear what\u2019s being cooked up.\n8. Jay Z\nJay Z is undeniably a living hip-hop legend and doesn\u2019t need to prove himself to anybody. However he hasn\u2019t released a classic album\nsince his epic collaborative effort with Kanye West- 2011\u2019s Watch the Throne (2013\u2019s Magna Carta Holy Grail was solid but nothing\nspecial in my opinion) and it feels as though we fans are owed one more classic album from this true hip-hop great before he retires.\nJermaine Dupree and Vic Mensa have both hinted that this album does in fact exist and is not just the stuff of legend. With his superstar\nwife Beyonc\u00e9 effectively releasing a Jay Z diss album in Lemonade last year, Jay has a lot to address on this album, not least the infidelity\nrumours. Will he tell us who \u2018Becky with the good hair\u2019 really is?\n\\\\ Matthew Harrison\n7\n. Vic Mensa\nI was a big fan of Vic Mensa\u2019s EP, There\u2019s a Lot Going On, which he released last summer and it whetted fans\u2019 appetites for his\ndebut album. Vic is a frequent collaborator with the likes of fellow Chicago rappers Kanye West and Chance The Rapper and features heavily on Chance\u2019s early mixtapes (his verse on Cocoa Butter Kisses is breathtaking). There are many similarities between\nVic and Chance, but where Chance paints an optimistic and hopeful picture with his gospel-inspired raps, Vic\u2019s music has a much\ndarker message. Vic\u2019s raps also carry a very political message, addressing matters ranging from police brutality to systemic\nracism in America. With Donald Trump beginning his presidency in earnest, I\u2019m sure Vic has a lot to get off his chest on this album.\nMost anticipated hip-hop albums of 2017\n9. A$AP Rocky\n6. Joey Bada$$ | A.A.B.A.\nJoey Bada$$\u2019s debut album B4.DA.$$ was a low key banger and one of the best projects of 2015. He\u2019s been very quiet since its release,\npreferring to focus on his acting skills (he has a recurring role on Mr. Robot) and dropping just a handful of tracks in the meantime. His\nfollow up album A.A.B.A. was originally scheduled to drop on 8th\nNovember 2016 (U.S. Election Day) but was delayed for \u201cperfection\u201d. He\nseems to be wanting to take a more political approach with his music and dropped a freestyle called Land of the Free on 20th\nJanuary (his\nbirthday and Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day). If you are a Narcos fan or if you just want to hear some pure heat, listen to his track Front & Center,\nwhich samples the theme tune.\n\\\\ The Come Up Show\nAndy Djaba\n3. Migos | Culture\nAtlanta rap trio Migos first started seeing major success in 2013 when they burst onto the scene with the Drake-assisted Versace.\nThey swiftly followed this up with hits like Fight Night and Hannah Montana, but the buzz around Migos had seemingly died down in\nthe last couple of years. That is, of course, until they dropped Bad and Boujee. Its success saw it reach number one and brought with\nit a fresh wave of widespread appreciation of Migos. This went as far as a shout out from Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) at\nthe 2017 Golden Globes award show, where he thanked Migos for making Bad and Boujee, describing it as \u201cthe best song ever\u201d\n(I couldn\u2019t agree more!). Quavo, the 2016 king of features, is complemented well by Offset\u2019s staccato delivery and Takeoff\u2019s crazy\nad-lib game, making Migos the perfect blend of high energy trap music. Culture is scheduled for release on 27th\nJanuary and they\nhave recently released more tracks to promote the album. Most notably, they released T-Shirt, the visuals for which are cold, and\nCall Casting, the video for which was recorded in Nigeria, where they gave what looked like a truly incredible performance.\n\\\\ Brett Weinstein\nThe Come Up Show \\\\\n4. Big Sean | I Decided\nBig Sean\u2019s fourth studio album, I Decided, is scheduled for release on 3rd\nFebruary and he\u2019s already released two singles Bounce Back and\nMoves to promote the album. Both tracks are impressive and are further proof of Big Sean\u2019s continued progression as an artist. The concept\nbehind the album centres on how making the correct decision at important moments can completely change your life. Big Sean has also\nconfirmed that Eminem is featured on the album and, following a co-sign from Andre 3000, I can\u2019t wait to hear this album.\nm.shattock \\\\\n2. Drake | More Life\nI am of the opinion that Drake actually releases too often and it diminishes the impact of his music. Having said that, Drake had a phenomenal 2016 and you simply can\u2019t ignore him or deny his ability to make bangers. Therefore, when he announced on 24th\nOctober that\nhe would be releasing a \u2018playlist\u2019 called More Life in December, I was naturally excited (and intrigued to know the difference between a\nplaylist and an album). Nineteen85, producer and member of OVO R&B duo dvsn, revealed that Drake will use More Life to \u201cintroduce new\nmusic and new artists to the rest of the world\u201d. More Life is expected to be heavy on features, with rumoured guests including Bryson Tiller\nand J. Lo, and Drake has already released three tracks in support of the \u2018playlist\u2019: Fake Love, Two Birds, One Stone and the 21 Savage-assisted\nSneakin\u2019. Drake delayed its release to the \u201ctop of 2017\u201d, so we could be listening to More Life in the very near future.\n1. Kanye West | Turbo Grafx 16\nIn the last few months of 2016 alone, Kanye West went through enough drama to fuel multiple albums\u2019 worth of material to comment\non. His wife, Kim Kardashian, was robbed at gunpoint in Paris and this traumatic event seemingly triggered a downward spiral which\ninvolved the cancellation of the remainder of his Saint Pablo, saw his public rants become even more erratic and confusing and\nculminated in his involuntary hospitalisation due to exhaustion and stress. Nobody knows what kind of mental state Kanye is in right\nnow, but we do know that the last time Kanye went through emotional turmoil and receded from the limelight, he returned with My\nBeautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a classic album which is widely regarded as his best work. It\u2019s impossible to know what to expect\nfrom Kanye\u2019s next project, which makes its release all the more exciting. I am firmly in the I miss the old Kanye camp and, in my\nopinion, his first two albums, The College Dropout and Late Registration are topped only by My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Will\nthis album see the return of the old Kanye? Could we will finally get an explanation for that infamous meeting with Donald Trump? The\nfantastic The Life of Pablo was one of the highlights of 2016 and, if Kanye can follow it up with an album of comparable or even better\nquality, then we are all in for a treat this year.\n\\\\ Gage Skidmore\n5. Travis Scott | Astroworld\nTravis Scott had an incredible 2016, releasing his stunning sophomore album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, which went to number one\nand was one of my favourite albums of 2016. The simple fact is Travis Scott\u2019s music is pure fire and, if his past solo albums, Rodeo and Birds,\nare anything to go by, we can safely say that Astroworld will be lit.\n\\\\ The Come Up Show\n\n"

Now more than\never, he suggests, minorities\nneed to speak out and resist.\nSouth Asians especially\nhave traditionally been\nunder-represented in media,\nand whether by chance or for\ncultural reasons, any distinct\nSouth Asian voice has been\nvirtually non-existent in the\nzeitgeist.

These are\nshows that explore the South\nAsian voice with grace, subtlety and, most importantly,\nreserved ferocity. For the\nlongest time, any defences\nof \u2018brown\u2019 culture had to be\nmade timidly, as if making the\ndefence itself was some sort\nof indication of guilt. Those\nlike Ansari and Riz Ahmed,\nhowever, are no longer afraid\nto flaunt their identities. Following the paths laid down by\npeople like M.I.A, Ansari and\nAhmed speak boisterously,\nunafraid to hold society to\naccount.\nAnsari\u2019s Master of None,\nhopefully returning for its\nsecond season this year, deals\nwith his difficulty getting work\nas an Indian actor, and the\nway western media tends to\nreduce them to stereotypes.\nSimilarly, The Night Of deals\nwith the uphill struggle young\nMuslim men face just to not\nbe presumed guilty. To his\ncredit, Ahmed has long been\nproducing work that explores\nalternative minority narra-tives, such as Four Lions and\nThe Road to Guantanamo.\nUnfortunately, these didn\u2019t\nhave anywhere near as much\nattention as they deserved.\nAhmed\u2019s participation in\nRogue One and the hiphop duo Swet Shop\nBoys seems to be\nchanging all that.\nHip-Hop was\nconceived as a\ntriumphant voice\nof rebellion.\nThere is no need\nto be timid or\ndefensive, and it\ndemands the full\nembrace of any\nculture that uses\nit as a voice. If any\nmedium would lend\nitself to the protest we\nneed, it is this. Thankfully,\nRiz Ahmed and Heems, of\nDas Racist fame, have seen fit\nto give us exactly that. Swet\nShop Boys fuses and covers\nevery niche of South Asian\nculture, and flamboyantly\nflaunts them.\nRiz, a Pakistani Muslim,\nChange rarely comes from where you expect it \\\\ Tyler Ross\nand Heems, a Hindu Punjabi, blend their individual\nidentities and loudly shout\ndown the casual racism often\ndirected towards brown\npeople.

Throughout the course of the rest of\nthe album, Riz and Heems\nweave a tapestry of ear-worms and bangers that\ncatch the attention of any lis-tener, simultaneously filing\ntheir grievances with an\nunsuspecting audience.\nEchoing the Public\nEnemies and Blackstars of the past,\nSSB channels\nthe frustrations\nand concerns\nof South Asians\nthrough a virulently pervasive\nmedium.

According to the\nOffice for National Statistics,\ndeaths linked to new\npsychoactive substances (the\ncatchy government-approved\nname for legal highs) rose\nfrom 82 in 2014 to 114 in\n2015, so it\u2019s easy to see\nwhy politicians wanted them\nbanned so quickly.\nAfter the first three months\nof the ban coming into force,\nnearly 200 people were\narrested due to some form\nof involvement with legal\nhighs. If nothing else, we can\nsay for certain this has put\nan increased strain on our\nalready creaky police depart-ment. Additionally, hundreds\nof shops have also shut down\nor stopped selling legal highs.\nSo much for the government\u2019s\ncommitment to help small/\nlocal businesses.\nThe National Police Chiefs\nCouncil\u2019s lead on New\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug\nuse, visit talktofrank.com\nPsychoactive Substances,\nCommander Simon Bray, said\nin a press conference that\nnearly 14,000 nitrous oxide\ncanisters (commonly known\nas laughing gas) had been\nseized by the Metropolitan\nPolice since the introduction\nof the act on May 26th\n2016.\nHe said this in a rather glum-faced serious manner. Maybe\nhe should have had some\nlaughing gas before he went\nup to speak.\nBefore this new legislation\nwas introduced, suppliers\nof legal highs could often\nskirt around existing rules by\nsimply tweaking the chemical\nformula of the substance.\nOnce upon a time, when the\ngovernment was made aware\nof a new chemical composition they would outlaw that\nunique molecular structure.\nAs a result, manufacturers\nwould then simply tweak their\nproduct to bring it into line\nwith the law. The government since has since become\ntired of this cat and mouse\ngame, which has led to the\nintroduction of the current\nlegislation. Basically, \u201cthe\nlaw can\u2019t be outwitted in\nthat sense anymore because\nif it\u2019s psychoactive, it\u2019s\npsychoactive full stop\u201d, said\nour old friend Commander\nSimon Bray. Therefore, this\nallows the police to criminal-ise vast swathes of young\npeople under the blanket ban\nautomatically. Perhaps not\nsomething very in touch with\nthe democratic underpinnings\nof the United Kingdom.\nIt is notable that this doesn\u2019t\napply to alcohol, caffeine and\ncigarettes, which are exempt\nfrom the new ban, despite\nthis in mind would it not be\nlogical to, you know, perhaps\nresearch them? Coming from\nImperial College, an almost\nall-science university (Business\nSchool I\u2019m looking at you),\nit is inherent to us to perform\nresearch. I can\u2019t imagine the\ngrade I\u2019d get if I shit out a\nlab report without doing any\nform of background research,\nexperimental research, or\njust any kind of research.\nBut that appears to be the\nof these drugs, however,\ncocaine has been banned for\nmany decades and that stuff\nstill hasn\u2019t disappeared.\nWith the government continually waging an all-out war\non drugs, it appears that we\nwill never see the day when\nthese potentially innovative\nsubstances could be used\nin research. But then again,\nwhat do you expect when the\nPrime Minister has a degree\nin geography?\n\\\\ What do you\nexpect when the\nPrime Minister\nhas a degree in\ngeography? \\\\\n\\\\ I can\u2019t imagine\nthe grade I\u2019d get\nif I shit out a lab\nreport without doing\nany background\nresearch \\\\\nChristopher Haigh\nalso having psychoactive\neffects.

With\nState for Health and Lord\nChancellor and Secretary of\nState for Justice all having\nstudied philosophy, politics\nand economics at Oxford this\nconfirms my suspicions. When\nso many of the leaders of our\ncountry studied basically a\ndegree in banter, it\u2019s hardly\nsurprising that they\u2019re immune\nto the benefits, or methods, of\nresearch.\nWith the new law banning\nall psychoactive substances\ncoming into effect only eight\nmonths ago we are yet to\nsee its full effects.

The survey (which admittedly had a small sample of\nonly 48 participants) revealed\nthat users found booking appointments with Career Services very hard (3.9/5) with 30%\nof participants having tried\nand failed to secure appoint-ments.\nCareer Services employ 17\nmembers of staff of which only\nsix are career consultants.\nThe equivalent services at LSE\nStudent calls out Career Services\nUnion pushes for resolving funding and staffing issues\nLef Apostolakis\nspokesperson told felix\nthat \u201csupport is available\nto students throughout the\nyear, including during the\nsummer vacation, and we\nencourage students to begin thinking about their\ncareer plans as early as\npossible\u201d\nFurthermore we were informed that when demand\nis high Imperial also recruits freelance consult-ants, while the Services\nalso offer a full range of\ngroup support through daily workshops, seminars, interactive sessions streamed\nworkshops through Panopto. Whether these services\nare insufficient or simply\ninadequately advertised\nwill be debated during the\nlong lobbying process that\nis certain to come in the\nfollowing months.\nemploy twice as many career\nconsultants, an additional six\nCV consultants and eight freelance career consultant presumably for seasonal spikes.\nConsidering that Imperial College has 17,000 students while\nLSE has approximately 9,000\nstudents, the quality and quantity of career advice at Imperial is significantly lower.\nThis might come as a surprise to many, as Imperial is\nrenowned for producing highly employable graduates. According to The Times and the\nSunday Times\u2019 Good University Guide 2016, Imperial is\nranked 2nd\nin terms of graduate prospects. This discrepancy is thought to be due to the\nsupport departments give out\nthemselves though.\nWeekly Career talks are for\nexample routine practice in\nthe departments of Earth Science and Engineering. Similarly the Science Communication\nMS offered by the Department\nof Co-curricular Studies is well\nknown for facilitating the networking of students with industry giants through seminars\nand internships.\nOther departments are less\nlucky. Industry oriented career\nevents in the department of\nLife Sciences are notoriously\nfew and far between with student looking to follow \u2018greener\u2019 paths such as Ecology often left to their own devices.\nThose coming from such less\ncareer-oriented departments\nface a mediocre service.\nThe testimonials from Suen\u2019s\nsurvey don\u2019t paint a flattering\npicture\n\u201cThey always say \u201cvery\ngood\u201d to CVs and rarely give\nany good advice.

Buitendijk has been working\non redefining the teaching\nstrategy and one of the\nkey elements of her plan\nhas been identifying pockets of good practice within\ndepartments and trying to\napply them across the College.\nWhen asked about the\nstudent dissatisfaction surrounding Imperial\u2019s Career Services, a College\nMental Health Officer joins Union roles\nLef Apostolakis\nU\nnion Council has\nvoted to introduce a new liberation officer,\nrepresenting students struggling\nwith mental health issues. Appropriate steps will be taken\nfor the position to be created\nin time for the elections in\nMarch.\nLiberation officers exist in order to represent and campaign\nfor underrepresented students\nand support the Deputy President for Welfare. Currently\nthere are seven roles. There\u2019s\na Disabilities Officer meant\nto represent the needs of students with disabilities (both\nphysical and mental) but there\nalso are LGBT, Ethics and Environmental, Gender Equality,\nInterfaith BME, Campaigns,\nand International officers.\nDespite the existence of a\nrole meant to deal with mental\nhealth, the paper proposing\nthe introduction of the new\nrole suggests it is not enough.\nArian Sadr-Hashemi, chair of\nMentality and author of the\npaper believes that the current role \u201cdoes not provide\nappropriate representation\nfor all students with mental\nhealth issues\u201d, that its duties\nare \u201ctoo broad\u201d and that it is\nnecessary to bring \u201cshort term\nmental health issues [such as]\ngrief and stress\u201d to the Union\u2019s\nattention.\nDuring her presentation on\nTuesday, Sadr-Hashemi said\nthat \u201cwe are at a very weird\npoint at mental health, where\nit\u2019s becoming more acceptable to struggle with mental\nhealth issues\u201d, however she\nstressed that despite positive\nsteps, some mental health issues receive a very different\npublic treatment to others.\n\u201cWe have to push that [sic] all\nmental health issues are acceptable\u201d. While addressing\nCouncil members, she stressed\nthe need to represent all minorities and urged the Union\nto \u201ckeep up\u201d.\nThe role would provide a\npoint of contact for students\nwishing to get in touch with the\nDisability Advisory Service,\nDepartmental Disability Officers and the Mental Health\nAdvice Service. It would also\nliaise with Mentality (a ICU\ncampaign raising awareness\nfor mental health) to \u201cfacilitate\nengagement of students with\nmental health issues in Union\nactivity\u201d.\nConcerns of the constitutional inclusion in the role description of Mentality as a point of\ncontact were shut down using\nthe LGBT Officer as an example who is constitutionally\nmeant to liaise with Imperial\n600 and IQ, imperial\u2019s network for LGBT+ staff and students respectively.\nStill there are valid concerns\non what happens once the role\nis created. It\u2019s not uncommon\nfor Liberation Officer positions\nto remain vacant after the first\nor even the second round of\nelections. At the moment, such\nis the case with the Disabilities\nOfficer. We will have to wait\nand see whether the Mental\nHealth Officer position proves\nto be more attractive.\n\n"

The crowned\ndiet gurus so charismatical-ly persuade you to convert\nto these superior versions.\nGod forbid refined sugar.\nNo dairy. No gluten. Capri-Sonne? What\u2019s that?\nI don\u2019t hate these things,\nand one of each healthy dessert category a week (give\nme a warmed vegan apple\ncrumble cheesecake anytime,\nfriend) could do my sweet\ntooth and insulin levels some\ngood. Some may also turn\nto these options for ethical\nreasons, to avoid animal\nproducts. But something is\na little fishy when trends\nbecome obsessions, and\nobsession turns into fear, and\nfear spurs total elimination of\nfood groups. This health consciousness does have a rather\nugly truth.\nJust recently, I had the personal privilege of watching\na pretty newly-released BBC\ndocumentary, hosted by the\nclever and amusing Giles\nYeo, who sharply and fluidly\nshuts down all nonsensical\nnutrition theories promoted\nby today\u2019s social media-cum-pseudo-health gurus such as\nthe anti-grain Hemsley sisters,\nsweet-potato-head Deliciously\nElla (Ella Woodward), and\nalkaline diet king Dr. Robert\nYoung. I implore you all to\nwatch the documentary yourselves for a more hard-hitting\nimpact than my black and\nwhite words, but a few key\npoints I did find intriguing and\nsimple enough to relay right\nhere.\nLet\u2019s start with the alkaline\ndiet, championed by Dr\nYoung. He proposes the idea\nthat more alkaline foods such\nas most fruits and vegeta-bles, soybeans and tofu, will\nbalance the pH of our slightly\nacidic blood, all in the context\nof disease supposedly being\ndown to the environment\nin which the bacteria are\nin, not the pathogen itself.\nEffectively, this is a big slap in\nthe face to the founders of the\ngerm theory of disease, such\nas Pasteur and Koch, who\nacknowledged the bacteria\nor virus as the causative\nagents, not the environment.\nThis sounds slightly horrific\nin the context of science\nand medicine, as it is germ\ntheory which forms the\nplatform of our biomedical\nunderstanding. Yeo called\nit \u2018anti-intellectual, anti-fact\nand anti-evidence based\u2019.\nAnother popular diet nowadays is the gluten-free diet,\nwhich only has an effect\nif you\u2019re born with coeliac\ndisease, or an intolerance to\nthis particular food group.\nGluten itself is the main\nprotein of wheat, and proponents of this diet such as\nthe sparkly Hemsley sisters\nargue that gluten increases\ninflammation and enhances\nall sorts of nasty infections.\nThe science behind this? Dr.\nYeo went behind the scenes\nto meet scientists researching this effect. The idea\nis that gluten creates gut\npermeability thanks to its\nprotein component, \u2018gliadin\u2019,\nand this consequently allows\nmore foreign substances\nthrough, enhancing infection\ninfiltration and sustained\ninflammation. Though it\ndoes make sense, this, once\nagain, is not properly scientifically backed, and you\nmay already be born with a\nleakier gut, a faulty immune\nsystem, or simply have a\ngenetic predisposition to\nintolerance of gluten.\nOh, and the whole\nno-grain fad? Dr. William\nDavis, author of Wheat\nBelly, argues that a\ncompletely grain-free\ndiet supports a healthy\nimmune system since there\nare apparent connections\nbetween grain and some\nauto-immune diseases.\nHowever, gastroenterologist\nAlessio Pasano, who ironically inspired Dr. Davis with\nsome of his studies in the first\nplace, does not agree. In fact,\nthe popularized book \u2018Grain\nBrain\u2019 argues that less than\n50g of carbohydrates a day\ncould have a positive effect\non a whole host of diseases\nsuch as tourette\u2019s, ADHD,\nmood disorders and epilepsy.\nI hate to admit it, but this\nis the zenith of unnecessary\nharm. All around us there\nare just scintillas of truth. The\ncurrent proliferation of too\nmuch and too far should be\nstemmed, and maybe you\nshould put your feet up and\nrelax with a real brownie. If\nyou\u2019re one of those who feel\nanxiety around a piece of\ncake, acknowledge the fear,\nbut try and see how these\nfoods actually effect your\nbody, as everyone is different.\nThink about what\u2019s really\nwrong here: your choice, or\nfalse information?\nF\nact: You can get\nglow-in-the-dark\nice cream.\nYou might have\nheard somewhere\nthat Tonic water\nglows under UV light, but\nthe story of the glow-in-the-dark ice cream takes all that\none step further. Its jellyfish\nflavoured!\nUsing the physics of\nfluorescence, animals can\nproduce light by a phenomenon called bioluminescence\n\u2013 they produce proteins\nwhich absorb light and\nthen emit it in a particular\ncolour, making them glow in\nthe dark to attract mates or\nwarn off predators. Jellyfish\nare some of the most famous\nbioluminescent creatures,\nsince the \u2018green fluorescent\nprotein\u2019 (GFP) made by them\nrevolutionized biological\nexperiments by allowing\nscientists to mark specific\nproteins in cells and thus\nwatch them under a fluorescent microscope.\nThe company \u2018Lick Me,\nI\u2019m Delicious\u2019 has now put\nthat same protein in an ice\ncream, so when the protein\nis warmed up and exposed\nto the ions in your saliva it\nbegins to emit light \u2013 or to\nput it simply, it glows when\nyou lick it. Awesome? Yes.\nExpensive? Yes: \u00a3140 per\nscoop to be precise.\nPerhaps more insane, the\nsame company made a\nflavour of ice cream called\n\u2018The Arousal\u2019, which contains 25mg of Viagra per\nscoop and tastes like cham-pagne.

It\nis very much like trying to\nescape a really, REALLY tight\nhug. Here, most competitors\nagreed not to use any chokes\nor strangles; let\u2019s all play nice\nand friendly.\nThe session started with a\nwarm up led by QM instructor Alex Macaulay, involving\nthe usual running around:\npush ups, sit ups, squats and\nburpees, but also climbing\nover and around each other,\nbecause why not? Forget all\nnotions of personal space\nonce you start any kind of\ngroundwork, the more up\nclose and personal you get,\nthe better. In fact, to keep\nyour opponent pinned to the\nground you have to put them\nin a hold they cannot escape,\nusually by putting all your\nweight on top of them (gets\na bit more difficult to breath\nif you do that on their chest),\nor applying some kind of\njoint lock. As you go up the\ngrades you can learn more\ntechniques, holds, and locks\nsuch as the ones Imperial Jiu\nJitsu affectionately nicknamed\n\u201869\u2019 (officially \u2018yoko shiho\ngatame\u2019) or \u2018the mount\u2019\n(officially \u2018tate shiho gatame\u2019,\nanother mouthful) because,\nwell\u2026it becomes evident\nwhen you see them.\nIn this type of competi-tion, fights can start from a\nsitting position or a standing\nposition (officially for green\nbelts and above). If starting\nfrom a sitting position, the\ntwo opponents are initially\nback to back, legs straight,\nfeet together, and hands on\ntheir thighs. The fight starts\nwhen the referee says the\nword \u2018hajime\u2019 (Japanese\nfor \u2018begin\u2019) and ends when\none of the opponents pins\ntheir adversary\u2019s back to the\nground for 20 seconds, which\nis an awfully long time when\nthe person underneath you\nis thrashing like crazy and\ntrying to wiggle out of your\nhold. It can also end if one\nof the participants taps out\n(because they were in a joint\nlock or feel they can\u2019t escape\na hold) or if time runs out. The\nrounds here were two minutes\nper fight, plus one extra\nminute if there is no defined\nwinner. If neither opponents\nmanaged to hold the other\nfor 20 seconds or made them\ntap out, the winner is decided\nbased on their pro-activity\nand control. The referee must\nsay \u2018yame\u2019 (\u2018stop\u2019) to officially\ncease any fight.\nIf starting from a standing\nposition then the opponents\nare face to face and try\nto throw each other to the\nground, ideally making both\ntheir adversary\u2019s shoulders\n(the famous \u2018ippon\u2019) touch the\nground, or at least one, with\ncontrol from the tori (the one\nthrowing) over the uke (the\none on the receiving end), to\ndeclare a win. The referee\njudges if the throw was clean\nor if the round needs to be\nreset. Here rounds were\nalso of roughly two to three\nminutes, and as before the\nwinner is chosen based on\ntheir initiative and control if\nneither manage to throw the\nother.\nAs rounds are very short,\ngenders and grades were\nmixed during the competition so all could enjoy as\nmany fights as they wanted\nand fight with everyone.\nThe participants were still\nroughly separated by height/\nweight class, as it is still a\nvery important parameter in\ngroundwork: there\u2019s not much\nyou can do if somebody twice\nyour size is sitting on your\nchest\u2026maybe tickle them? Hit\nthem in the- wait no, that\u2019s not\na legal move.\nTo finish on a nice and\nfriendly note after all that\nrolling around on the tatami\nmats, Imperial Jiu Jitsu organised a great (and cheap)\nsocial in a fancy Korean\nrestaurant in Soho. Eating as\nmuch Korean barbecue as\nyou want, mostly paid for by\nthe club. What more could\nyou ask for?\nImperial Jiu Jitsu is going to\nhave more friendly regional\ncompetitions with other\nLondon universities before the\nbig Randori Nationals at the\nend of February in Northampton, so watch this space! Jiu\nJitsu is an amazing discipline\nopen to all in which you can\nprogress really quickly if you\nset yourself to train regularly,\nand you\u2019re constantly supported by your peers and\ninstructors who want to help\nyou learn and get the best out\nof every training session.\n\n"

Every year, each\none of us remembers that Azerbaijan is a\ncountry, that all the best pyrotechnics are\nfound in Europe, and wish that hopefully\none of the novelty countries like Australia\nwins. Even with post-Brexit Britain, millions\nof people will tune in, with many more illegally streaming it on iPlayer because who\nactually pays the license fee? It is an aged\nTrident's\nrenewal was\nbased on lies\nAvirup Banerjee thinks Trident is\nan expensive accident waiting to\nhappen\nthem can write, let alone write\nsongs.\nThe vast array of European\nentrants all send pop stars\nwith at least meddling level\nof popularity in Europe, and\nmost of their songs embrace\nthe fact that the competition is\na little bit silly, that the songs\nshould be fun and joyful, as\nevidenced by Sweden\u2019s pastiche of how to win Eurovision.\nEngland does not embrace\nthis attitude and instead decides to put its lot in with po-faced misery and half-hearted\nmelodrama. You only have to\nlook at the fact that Engelbert\nHumperdinck, a seller of over\n150 millions records and a renowned (I guess?) artist a few\nyear's ago. His song was a lan-guishing, stolid piece of boredom and he came second to\nlast. The thing England needs\nto decide is whether or not it\nactually wants to whole-heart-edly try. If not, then stop wasting the money, stop making\nus listen to beyond-mediocre\nsongs, and stop getting our\nhopes up.\nI\nn the small town of Goldsboro, North\nCarolina there lies a casual road sign\nsaying that it is a site of a \u201cnuclear mishap\u201d. If that's not an understatement,\nwhat the hell is? In 1961 a B52 bomber carrying two nuclear bombs blew\nup mid-air, dropping the nuclear payload\nwhich came excruciatingly close to deto-nating. The surprisingly long list of barely averted accidents involving nuclear\nweapons has gained a new member. Last\nweek it was revealed that Britain's nuclear\ndeterrent experienced a catastrophic test\nfailure in which unarmed Trident missiles\nwere fired on the coast of Florida in the\nsummer of 2016 before being aborted.\nWhilst they were unarmed, it does dispel\nthe idea of \u2018smart weapons\u2019 \u2013 the missiles\nwere targeted on West Africa instead of\nNorth America, so were only off target by\na few thousand kilometres. Furthermore,\nwhat is outrageous was the inexcusable\nconcealment of the important failed test results from MPs before parliament voted in\nfavour of a \u00a3100 billion multi-decade commitment on the next generation of Trident.\nEven the government\u2019s excuse of secrecy\nin the name of national security does not\nhold weight considering that nations usually inform other nuclear powers, especially their rivals, before conducting nuclear\ntests to prevent dangerous misunderstand-ings. In 2012, the last time Britain conducted nuclear test, Russian ships monitored\nand even congratulated the Royal Navy\nafter carrying out the successful tests.\nHowever, perhaps most worrying is the\nnear-universal acceptance of the need\nto expand the British nuclear arsenal\namongst the political elite. Gone are the\ndays of the 1980s when hundreds of thousands around the world marched for nuclear disarmament, forcing right-wingers\nlike Nixon, Thatcher and Reagan and their\nSoviet counterparts to commit to arms reduction treaties. Whilst it would be naive\nto unilaterally disarm, what is worrying\nis that the last ten years experienced the\nslowest world wide reduction\nof nuclear weapons since the\n1970s \u2013 weapons which even\nfive-star general and US Secretary of State Colin Powell\nadmitted to being unusable.\nToday we no longer face an\nideological, antagonistic nu-clear-armed state in the form\nof the Soviet Union. The real\nthreat posed by Russia or China in our globalised economy\nis cyber-warfare targeting the\ntheft of intellectual property.\nTrident ballistic missiles are\nalso useless against non-state\nactors committing terrorism,\nwhich instead requires counter insurgency. Should we not\nspend our limited resources on\ndefence measures we actually\nneed rather than relics of the\ncold war? Maybe the time has\nfinally come to pressure our\ngovernment to eliminate the\nillusion that there is a widespread consensus that we must\nrecommit to a new generation\nof Trident. And perhaps the\ntime may come again that the\nworld truly begins the process\nof universal disarmament.\ntradition to listen to Graham Norton creatively talk nonsense and use the most abstract of mathematics to try and calculate\na way that the UK could ever finish on the\nleft of the leader board. Why is it, how-ever, that every year Britain puts the least\namount of effort into selecting their act?\nEvery year the shadowy organisation\nknown as the BBC tries to put the least\namount of effort and expense into selecting a competitor which has brought us\nsuch delights as Jade Ewen, Molly Smitten-Downes, and the dream haunting\nScooch. Just in case you didn\u2019t recognise\nany of the previously mentioned names,\nthere is a reason for this: the UK doesn\u2019t\nsend anyone famous. Indeed all the singers are talented at \u2013 well at the very least\ntechnically, as it seems unlikely that any of\n\n"
