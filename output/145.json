    "content": "CAL US TORR B \u00a7\nThe English translation of Francoise Sagan's latest naval has ju ct been published.\nIt's title APMEZ-VOUX BRAHMS?\ngives little indication of it soon tents. Needless to say, the author\nhas stuck to her usual theme, of that\nmuch overworked eternal interminable\ntriangle on which 30 many novelists* ely. The book is sold at the attractive pr loe of S/6d, The story oo ul d hardly be more\nsimple. A mature \u2022 artistic woman,\nPaule, verging on forty has a well established lover of roughly her own\nage. This lover is unfaithful to her quite regularly with younger\ndamsels in order to boost his ego.\nShe meets a virile young lawyer,\nand they gradually become entangled.\nFELIX\nHe displaces the older man in her\naffections and so they set up in partnership. They both feel the\naffair e cannot last long, which proves\ncorrect. Paule realises that she\nmust go back to her original lover,\nand leaves the young man in despair.\nThe book closes on lover number one\ntelephoning Paule to tell her he has\na business dinner and cannot see her\nthat night. He's off again!\nI find the story lacks any twists or o lever situations and just goes\nalong its straight forward way allowing\none to anticipate every move that is made. Francolse Sagan h.a always\nenjoyed an extremely high reputation,\nwh i oh she undoubtedly deserves for her\nfirst two novels, but I feel that here\nin this case, she is r. ther relying on that reputation Instead Of the\nmerits of her writing; If you are an ardent fan of the\nauthor's and enjoy her style of writing she, indeed, has an unerring talent\nin writing of her character'3 emotions\n- you will probably like the book,\nbut I do not think that it cannot be\nhighly commended.\nA quartet of novels, THE ALEXANDRIAN QUARTET, has just been completed\nby Lawrence Durrell. These four books,\nJUSTINE, BALTHAZAR MOUNTOLIVS and\nOLEA ( all at l6/)r deserve the utmost\npraise and indeed have got it'.\nThey make Mile. Sagan's novel look like a schoolgirls attempt\nat an essay.\nThe quartet is the result of a very successful experiment by the\nauthor. He has attempted to look\nat the same series of happenings in all four books from entirely different viewpoints. He attempts to show that\ncharacters and situations are seen\nin quite different lights by diff e rent people.\nThe four books deal with the\nwriters beloved city of Alexandria.\nThe story is woven in an entrancing way\ngiving a wonderful description of this town of mystery and enables a reader\nwith no experience of Middle Eastern\ncivilisation to build a most colour-ful mental picture of it. In Justine he looks back into the\npa3t and recreates the people, events\nand love affairs of the story from\nhis own memory. In Balthazar, he is forced to sec the same story from\nBalthazar's viewpoint, which alters his considerably. Mountalive is in the third person and discloses an\nunexpected political plot, while\nClea is a sequel used to tie up the\nloose ends and finish the story\nneatly.\nThis i3 an extremely interesting well written set of books by one of\nour leading novelists which should not\nbe missed.\nNA NOOK AND THE MINERS The chill blast of the icy Arctic wastes was soon transformed to a glow of\ninner contentment as travel weary and\ngold heavy-miners in search of revelry\ndescended on sleepy Dawson City last Friday night.\nThe latest ship io ad of dollar-eyed\ndollies, gathered from all parts of\nEngland clung to the weather beaten a A of the fortune hunters as t ne soft lights, and Carnival atmosphere tooK their\neffect.\nThe mighty t nir st was upon these\nsons of the soil, and the oust in their throats was set tied by three hundred,\npints of free beer provided by the man-age ment. The house was drunk dry by\nthe time the sheriff closed the bar in the early hours of the morning.\nThe excellent music makers provided\nstrange rhythms from many lungs as revelers trod the measure around the floor and in a back room upstairs a group\nbrought forth strange and ezo it ing sounds\nin a sneak preview of a new kind of music\nyet to be invented called \"ja\u00abs\". The eskimos fearing the hi?h spirits of the Miners returned to their icy homes\nand none Were present at the revelry.\nA3 one a.m. approached people dr if ted from the surrounding rooms to Black\nJake's saloon for the floor show, The\nlights that had not been shot out were\ndimmed and three delectable Hiawathas\nhired fr m the local reserve started the\nshow v' with one of the most amusing and\nentertaining sketches yet seen. The\nfact that Trevorina Scarratt had been\nshot with an arrow whilst bending over\nthe cooking pot seemed to cause her no\ndiscomfort. ' It is said that she had\nsome difficulty in explaining away the\nred war paint, which she could not re-move, at an interview the next morning.\nAndalusia wran klin and Michaela\nMathews, who introduced some foreign dish called \"crabs\" completed the\nexcellent trio. Smooth Master of Ceremonies, John\nEgan, specially imported from Chicago,\nthen introduced a scene familiar to all; the fight for a woman's hand using the\nlead law of the Weat. The bullet3 ana\nbodies were fast and furious, and it is presumed that Black Jake Goodman should\nhave been shot by hero Bob Baird for the\nhand of f he only female miner in the\narea, Carolyn Russell. However his gun\nwas rusty.\nKoboay knows where the chorus line for. the next act came from although it is rumoured that one of the members,\nseen occasionally poking his head between\nthe arms of the others, was on oe the\nsecretary of some minin c college in England.

The expedition hopes to unravel\nthis puzzle and send any animals it captures back alive to the London Zoo.\nTheir main \u2022concern is with the reptiles, amphibia and insects as there are no\nlo j own large mammals on the island. The most impressive and mysterious\nFeature of St. Kitts is Boons Misery,\nits brooding peak, which is eternally shrouded in cloud, Overlooking a large\nvolcanic crater. The height of thi3 Eak i s3till not known a curate ly and to tabl i3 hits true height is one ofthe\nbit ions of the party. Continuous\ntorrential rain has crumbled the basalt\nrock into a treacherous surface and\nHount Misery promises to present a ian gero us challenge.

The coast itself, fringed by a coral reef, has sandy beaches extending\ninto a long, semi desert sand spit with\nlarge salt lakes, at it3 tip, in the\nsouth of the island. The spit is isolated from the mainland, by St. Timothy'\nMount, a conical rock barrier across its width.\nThe expedition arrives at Sassterre\nthe island's only town, in late July, after the rains, and they will be there\nin the hurricane season.

CARNIVAL During the first week in May the\nCollege is organising a week's Carnival\nactivities with the de ola red intention of obtaining funds for World Refugee\nlear. Humour has it that there are\nother intentions to this carnival,' but\nthey cannot be declared ( after all, losing7 for doesn't encourage early declarations). We can promise a good\ngame, however, -with a really good bat ting side and, if mixed metaphors are\nallowed, many strings to our bow.\nFortunately the game will be played\nmainly in the evenings (with flood lig h? in necessary) 30 that everyone will be\nable to attend. To cope with these unusual hours of play the Boards of\nControl involved have agreed to allow\nplay on several days, so that note\n(especially chess e players), the big game extends over the periods April3 OW1 to May 7th.

The best thing to do is heavily mark .that week in your diary,\nma ice no other arrangements and, when the\ntime comes, allow yourself to be s or bed into the game. In that way you can be\nsure of being free of brown it is. Of course, if you have a particular mania about brown it is then you may feel that the precautions recommended so far are insufficient. In that oas e you may\nfavour im munis ation. Now im munis ation is a relatively simple procedure^ all. you ha v^ to do is to breath the atmosphere which surrounds the wicket. Obviously .this is most easily done bj t helping\nto prepare the wicket for the game.\nThe doctors concerned (they also go\nunder the pseudonym of Chairman of Colleee\nCarnival Committee) are:-Chris Leech (C&G) Geoff Nicholson (H.C. S.) Harvey Richards (S.3.M.), and if you can type or erect floats, they will welcome you in their surgeries.\nIn other words the I.C. Carnival\nneeds you. And let me stress that this is an I.C. Carnival, not a nebulous\nLondon University Carnival, so give all your support to I.C. If you have any bright ideas for floats for the procession, siu e shows\nfor the fe te, publicity stunts or any\nother methods for raising money for the\nW.R. X., let us have them now.\n\n"

The southern semi-final of the 5th annual National University Jasz contest\nwas held in Reading Town Hall on the\nevening of Aednesday 17th February 1960.\nThere were ten bands competing - two\nfrom Reading, four from Cambridge and\nfour fx fim London, including two from\nImperial College. The judges were Alun\nMorgan and Benny Green. The result was\ntab Cambridge Big Band, 2nd University\nof London Jazz Band, 3rd Dave Gelly\nQuartet (Cambridge). They are the\n{acts.\nThese are a few personal views.\nIn my opinion it is almost impossible- to\nget a fair result from such a contest.\nNot only were there traditional, mainstream and modern types of jazz, but\nthe modern section contained atrio, iwo\nquartets, and octet and a dect et te. The musical standard of all was very high\nand I would have thought that they could\nnot have been compared without a large\namount of personal ta3te entering into\nthe matter. I must point out that this\nis not a personal bias brought about by\nthe fact that the Jazz Gardeners were i not in the first three. The Gardeners\ngave an absolutely faultless performance,\nmarked by, complete relaxation and perfect\nbalance. It nas been said that their stage presentation was probably the best\nof the evening and the basic inherent\nswing which they attained was certainly not bettered by any of the other groups.\nThe way in which the whole audience\nconcentrated whilst the Gardeners were\nplaying, and the way in which they snapped into applause at the end of the set\nmade the trip well worth while for the\nthree I.C. musicians.\nBut this is no reason why the\nGardeners should have been placed in the\nfirst three. The musical standard of\nthe other groups was equally as high and\nthe only way in which a definite result could be obtained was to let personal\ntaste decide. Which is^ presumably'\nwhat happened.\nHad I been judging I would have\naimed at selecting a variety of styles\n(assuming the musical standard to be\nsufficiently high) with the accent on\noriginality. It will be noted that no\ntraditional band has got through r from this semi-final. I consider thi3 wrong.\nIn his remarks Benny Green dismissed all the traditional bands by saying that a banjo cannot make up for a piano. What\nhe should have said was that it was his\nown personal narrow minded view that a banjo cannot make up for a piano. All the traditional bands had banjos and no\npianos. None of them got through.\nEnough said?\nThe placing of the Cambridge Big\nBand wa3a big mistake in my opinion.\nThe band had good musicians (though many\nwere not jazz soloists) and indeed the\ntenor player was the best on tn is in s tru ment in the contest. But their arrangements were exact copies (phrase for phrase, note for note, instrument for instrument) of arrangements by Gil Evans\nand Marty Paioh. They featured a bearable vocalist who sang note for note\nlike Mel forme whilst the band played\nthe Marty Paich arrangement note for not\nThis was the rock bottom in originality. The sound achieved by the band couldn't help but sound pleasant but it tended to\nbe stodgy and the r by fc ibm team dragged.\nGiving first place to this \"dance band\"\nwas a gross error by the judges.\nThe University of London jazz band\nwas without a doubt the best of the even-ing. This octet, built around an uel eus of the U.C. band, featured a flu gel horn\nplayer of quite amazing capabilities. Obviously the band was built^ around him\nand he was a great inspiration, to the\nother musicians. But every member of\nthe band was a very competent soloist. The rhythm team produced a good dr ivo and the clever punchy arrangements gave\nthe band a driving, fresh and original sound. But they had to be content with\nsecond place - let us hope that this is changed in the final. The Dave Gelly quartet deserved a place in the first three, for Gelly blew\na nice alto and the rhythm section were\ncompetent*I; But I couldn't help think--i hg that these alto led quartets are\ngetting far too numerous and far too\nStereotyped.\nThe I.C. traditional band under\nKen Gibson's lea aer ship t po \u00bbt some time\nto warm up and there were far too many\nfluffed notes in the first two numbers.\nBut when they settled down they played\nwell. Unfortunately, like the other\ntr ad bands, they fell victims to Benny\nGreen1\n3 dislike of banjoS i Anyone who has read the jazz column\nin the Observer will have guessed that\nBenny Green gave us an amusing time when\nhe commented on the bands. Unfortunately I haven't space to relate all of his\ncomments, but typical was his comment on\nthe Jazz Gardeners. he acc usd them of\nnot playing the correct tune of \"But not\nfor me\" (a completely irrelevant fact), made some pathetic remark about Gershwin\nturning in his grave, and suggested that\nthe Gardeners bought the 3he et music.\nThis was greeted with a chorus of cat-calls, boos and other pleasant ex clam a st ions from every corner of the hall. Benny Green's continual reference to hims elf as a musician (he played baritone\nsaxophone with Lord Rockinham'3 XI)\nbecame a little tiring to my ears at\nleast.\nAlun Morgan was surprisingly quiet\nthroughout the whole proceeding; it appeared as if he was quite bored by the\nwhole thing. Let us hope he snaps out\nof it by the final or else the British jazz critics will probably add to their ever growing opposition.\nMay I stress that these view3 are\naimed at the inadequacy of the method of\njudging as a whole; there is no personal\nbias involved at all. The jazz club\nwould Tj ke to thank ail those who show\ninterest in our activities and especially\nthose who took the trip to Reading.\nTo finish on a pleasant note I am\nable to report that the I.C. rad it ional band has reached the final of the London\nUniversity jazz competition for the\nColyer Cup. The final is at N.E^C. on\nMarch 2nd and tickets may be obtained\nfrom Richard Hushton.\n\n"

Harris Cloak attendants\n(Chem l) Dear Sir, In your issue of January 29th, you published an article entitled \"What do you think?\", in which you\nattempted to arrive at a conclusion\nas to which-form-of education\n(i.e. public or grammar school) best\nsuited an individual to university\nsocial life. The author of this article came to the conclusion that\nit was the pub lio schoolboy, with all his \"independence, self-confidence ani\npolish\", who ran the social rat race\nmore successfully than his more\nlowly bret heren. We would not go as far as to\nsay that all public schoolboys are\nbrash and over-confident but it does\nseem :that they are typified by \"plum\nin the mouth\" accents, fancy waist coats and umbrellas. Apart from thi frankly\" U\" style of dress and department he has no advantage over the\ngrammar soho ol boy, who not having\nbeen cloistered in a \"monastic\" way\nof life throughout the formative year\nof his childhood does not have to exhibit himself in such an osten ta tic When it comes to the criterion of self-confidence and independence,\nit must be realised that the grammar\nsoho ol boy has, as like a,s not,\nspent several summers: canoeing, o amp i or hit oh hiking on the continent,\nwhilst his opposite has retired to hi father's go un try residence.\nAs we believe in.constructive\nor it io is m and abhor all that w hio his totally destructive, we should like to state that in our opinion, ex-soho ol boys whether public or grammar\nare equal. If however one has an\nadvantage over the other with regard\nto entertainment value it is more\nlikely to be the ex-grammar\nschool boy, as it is odds on he's sea.\nmore of life, though the other may ha-experienced more discipline. However as the main topic of\nconversation of both, as fresher s, seems to be what they did at soho ol01 where they went the previous Saturday\nnight, we believe that neither, until they have \" lived\", can run a social li \u2022successfully. In order to do so an\nindividual must have experience of liv ing with all types of people and\napart from this, be an entertaining an\nnot too exacting conversationalist.\nAfter all it is far more interesting to hear how old so-and-so got to\nIstanbul than to listen to a dissert ation oh Pott's biology master.\nPerhaps one of the contributory .\nfactors to the more stimulating social life of any of the Oxford or Cambridge Colleges than that of I.C. is that both of the former, until late\nonly accepted post-national ser vio e men. If I.C. were only to accept\nundergraduates with a year of\n\" living\" prior to college perhaps we\nwould have less apathy towards our\noo lle ge functions. It is food for thought.\nYours faithfully, G.M. Harris ( Civil U) Diane M. Harris (Ohem\\,;\n\n"

    "content": "fCC i THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 145 Friday February 26th,4 d BACK HOME AGAIN IC RF.C. WIN GUT TE RIDGE CUP BY DEFEATING VET S130I.C. won (and LOSTJ j the Gutteridge Cup at Motspur Park last Saturday,\nbut this was almost incidental in a day of many strange scenes. The large\ncolourful, partisan crowd was entertained by the final of the seven a side\ntournament which dragged on like a Scottish dirge for fully forty minutes\nbefore Woolwich clinched the game.\nImmediately afterwards the crowd\nwatched at fever pitch as Mike Ba.rr on led on the Presidents XV for a scintillating display of fast open rugby.\nThe idea was to boost the morale of\nR.V. C., so that the game might not be\ntoo one sided; unfortunately the quality of vigour depressed them even more.\nThe day will long be remembered for a brilliant try by Rushton, running at\nan angle of 45*, dummy ing his way past\nevery flag, before grounding the ball to the right of the posts, despite a late tackle by his own full back.\nWith typical generosity, Rush dai ned to\ntake the kick himself, but since the\nopposition had fled the team lined up\nto be presented to the Pretender to\nthe Duchy bf Gloucester (Les Allen) and \"Lady Dorothy\" (Sue Coombs). The\nensuing ovation o on tin u ed as I.C., led by captain Mike Bregazzi lined up\napposite Vets, to be presented to Sir Douglas Logan, Chancellor of the Unive rsi ty. And, so to the game.\nImperial rapidly made their way\ninto the vets twenty five, and . a blind side break by Wyn Davies only\njust failed to bring a \u2022try. Continued\npressure brought reward, when after five minutes, on winning the heel the pack\nsplendidly carried the ball over the\nline where it was grounded by Otto Gil bert\" Bregazzi's kick from the to u ohl in oj j oared grandly between the uprights\nand all hopes of a quick try were realised. Vets, were not to appreciate the\ndifficulties they faced and retaliated preaching the I.C.25. That they on-did this once more in this half was\nh real measure of I.C. superiority.\nHalf time came thus with I.C. leading\nby 5 pts. - 0, Bregazzi having only\na arrow iy failed with a35 yd. penalty.\nVets, helped by a following wind,\ngradually came more and more into the\npicture in the second half, but through-put, their three quarters took up posit ions normally occupied by wing forwards\nand their sole attacking idea consisted\npf the kick ahead and swift following\nUp; however, fearless marking, brilliant tackling and faultless catching\nv v the I.C.+ defence foiled all their. f forts. The end came virtually early in the\nsecond half, when just after Vets having\nfailed to convert* a penalty in front of\nour posts, Ray Milward following up quickly a kick from Wyn Davies amazed a lethargic full back by his turn of speed\nresisted the temptation to pick up on\nthe run, and dribbled over the line to\nscore in the corner. Breg. failed to\nconvert, but I.C. looked comfortable\nwinners at thi a stage.\nVets, continued to FIGHT,(indeed,\nboth Tom Banks and Dai Howell, falling to blows more worthy of Ingmar Johanssen\nt:> an rugby players), but cool defence,\nswift covering and tight play kept the\nI. C.line intact. Once, however, after a rare mistake, the line looked at Vets\nmercy, but a brilliant pick up on the\nrun,^a dazzling run, and a fantastic40 yd.\" touch by Randal Peart was a high\nlight of the game.\nJust to emphasize their forward\nsupremacy 1.0. made the score 13 - 0\n\"With another push over try attributed\nto John Bridges. A great cheer went, up\nfrom the supporters as Randal Peart took\nthe kick, and the noise was redoubled\nwhen he o on verte d. The final score v.a's fully justified for I.C. had played cool, intelligent rugby throughout. No one person could\nbe singled out for extra praise, everyone played their part and all deserve\ncredit for a great team performance.\nThe best kept secret was that\nGordon Margretts had broken his arm in a tackle during the opening minutes.\nThe* SH offer: their best wishes to the\nSoccer and Hockey Clubs in their bids\nto make this a triple year.\nT. G.B. BBSBS\nKM9/ UNDERGRADUATE SURVEY As I.C. expands, the gap which\nalready exists between the governing\nbody and the students, becomes larger.\nIn the past the only means of bridging this gap have been the contacts established between I.C. Council and the\nRector. These contacts have been\nvery useful in putting forward the\nUnion's point of view, but this is not.\nnecessarily the same as that of in divi dual students. In fact the only means\nthe Rector has of determining the opinion of students is via I.C. Counoil,\nvia a Union Meeting. Everybody knows\nthat I.C. Union meetings fire poorly\nattended and that individual students\nput forward their own views all too\nrarely. To try to rectify this position the Rector has organised an undergraduate\nsu, vey in the form of an exhaustive\nquestionnaire. Questions range from\nGeneral Studies to Food, Hostel\nAccommodation to Parking, with the last page devoted to the Union. The idea\nis not to pry into a student's private affairs but to gain information v rh ich will be used in planning future student\nfacilities. The details of each\nparticular student's private life will be confidential and only the stat is t ical analysis ' . ill be published.\nThis is your chance to help the\nfuture students of I.C. and I hope that\nall of you will take it. The questionnaire will appear in the College letter racks on Monday Feb 29th and the\nclosing d. te will be March ?th.\n\n"

Three which have transformed\nthem from self conscious school children\ninto capable, qualified adults.

He did so after only 6 of the 8 races had\nbeen run but his lead was so decisive\nthat the series w, as conceded to him.\nWell done\nOther members of the club have\nalso been doing very well in the Points\nracing. David Pentz, a first year\nJil Tech. student, hs sailed consistently well to place one of the College\nboats first in the \"B\" points s s ries and he is now working hard to improve\nthe placing of this boat in the \"A\". It now seems pro bab lv that the 1st and\nEnd.boats in the \"B\" series will be from\nI.C., thus carrying off the double.\nOn Saturday 6th February I.C.2 nd team went to sail at Heading on a flooded Thames. The match was very\ninteresting with strong currents and\nlight winds. It was a change to sail hard through the water yet still water\nthe land going the other way!\nTowards the end of the race the\ndown stream bouy broke loose and David\nPentz was last seen chasing it downstream in a desperate attempt to round\nit. It is rumoured that David,\nunable to sail against the current,\nreturned to London by Firefly but Reading University don't seem to have lost one of their boats. I.C. lost29 pts to Readings 42^.\nOn Saturday and Sunday the 5th and\n6th March I.C. Sailing Club has entered\ntwo teams in the : inter-collegiate.,\nteam match for the Castaways Cup.\nOpinions vary but the general census\nof opinion is that I.C. have their best chance ever of winning this event,\nThe next issue of Felix should tell us the result.\nHATTRICK AT LYMINGTON SOCCER \u2022.\u2022una, iii,i ng one or n is regular\nvisit*, to the Royal Lymington Yacht\nClub, won the Christmas open Firefly meeting last va o ation. Against very strong opposition he\ncarried away his3 rd pot from Lymington\nafter sailing the series in howling gales.\nHe must be especially congratulated\nfar beating the Jardine twins into 2nd place; Adrian Jardine is an Olympio\nprobable for the British dinghy team.\nSince their resounding defeat\nof U.C. in the U.L, Cup semi-final\nreplay, the 1st XI have been extreme-ly inconsistent. In league games\nthey appear to be too keen and play\nwith tremendous spirit. Witness their62 trouncing of Mannheijn University\nafter being 2-1 down at half-time\nand very good 3-2 defeat over Christ\nCollege, Cambridge who included two\nEngland Amateur Internationals in their side as well as several blues.\nIn a league game with Chelsea\nPoly, 1,8. allowed this very moderate\nside i jo draw 4-4 with them and thus\ntake 3 points off them in the league\nchampionship wh i oh they do not deserve\nand which I.C. can ill afford.\n\u2022Having defeated U.C. in the cup,\nI.C. approached the league game with\nthe same opponents too casually and\nwere soon i narre aro. It was not\nuntil the latter stages of the game\nthat I.C. woke up and played football\nworthy of them, by which time it was\ntoo la1;e and they eventually lost21. The 2nd XI, after leading their division for much of the season have\nin recent times been slipping and\nafter their36 defeat at the hands\nof astron\" L. S.E.2nd XI have slipped\nto third place.\nThe 3rd XI, which for much of the\nseason have been bottom of the same\ndivision made a supreme effort and\ndefeated both C.E.M. and Woplwieh\nPolv in critical lei gue games. However the oli a a x was reached against\nU.C. when the 3rd XI excelled th sT n selves and won 1-0 on a very heavy\nsnow covered pitch although they had\nonly 9 fit men. A rapid deterioration has set in3 ince and fu thar\nleague games have been lost 2-0 and\n10-1 (the latter due to the a oo e ncea? their captain and the centre-half\nfor the day!!!). Their relegation\nprospects are again unfortunately\nominous.\nThe 4th XI, have now completed\ntheir league programme and are at\npresent lying2 nd in the division. However the iroh ances of promotion are\nvery slim as several teams have still games to play.\nThe results of the 5th and 6th XI\ngames have been lost in the chaos\ncaused by half-session exams. There\nhave been rumours, however, that some\nof these have been deliberately lost and that the opponents cf these teams\nhave been regularly celebrating double\nfigures. However the P. Buvies\n\"Sport\" XI has been functioning\nregularly and has recorded it3 first win of the term. They defeated a representative Rugby XI or XV (.not\ndefinitely known which) 10-0 and\nthus maintained their record of being\nalways involved in a match in wai oh double figures have been scored.\n(Arnott in goal, for the first time\nafter a game did not complain of back\nstrain!)\nThe Club wu ld also like to take\nthe opportunity of congratulating the\nRugby Club on winning the U.L.

Eight coll\noo lle ges took part, each having 5 models\nto illustrate the theme \"Student Fashion\"*.\nMonsieur de Barrone made a most, engaging\ncom per e, in spite of comments from fellow\nbasketball players in the audience.\nHe first introduced Kristine Bragiel\nwho wore a blue angora winter coat, over\na grey mohair slim skirt and white sweater*\nNext came Joan Kingston, showing red\no or du roy slacks, with a blue paisley over\nblouse, as casual wear. Sheenagh Wallace\nwore a more formal green jersey costume.\nJudy bright was dressed in a blue figured\nnylon evening dress, which was enthusiastically received. Brenda Taplin brought\nthe show to a close, appearing in a quilted cherry coloured housecoat, over\na pink baby-doll night dress. At this\npoint the com per e wished the assembled\ncompany goodnight and sauntered off, arm\nin arm with the last model.\nGoldsmith's team oe rta in ly deserved\ntheir- win.

The Ee.g le, \u2022\u00ab nigH performance two seater, arrived just in\ntime for fresher s day, and it was seen\nrigged in Prince Consort Road by many\npea ple. Changes at Lasham, where we have\nbeen operating, have made training\nthere prohibitively expensive, although\nflying is still possible. While hoping\nfor an alternative site, we spent twa\nenjoyable week-ends at Oxford before\nChristmasj but we have now moved to\nRedhill where training is by aer b tow' in the Eagle.

To go through the matches in chronological order and give details would be rather uninteresting but the\nsecond team's victory over the formidable U.C. team must be mentioned. A splendid fight by everyone concerned\nput the second team well in the running\nfor top of the league.\nSuccess too is the byword of the\nmixed team's progress and unofficial reports maintain that it shares the\nexalted position of league leaders with U. O. and L.S.E. The first team have finished their league commitments and will'probably\nfinish second in their division, although there is a chance of championship honours.\nHowever, the season's activities are not drawing to a close with the\nend of league matches in sight.\nThere remain away fixtures with Oxford\nWoodpeckers, Southampton and Reading,\nTHE CLUB TOURNAMENT ON MARCH 2nd and\n5th at Nine Elms Baths, and several\nother friendly fixtures. Hopes for a portable court for use in the c en cert hall are at present\nhigh although the matter is still under consideration b the student\nfinance committee. If the necessary\nj rant is' forthcoming, facilities next\nseason should be much improved and the\no lub will be able to cater for a greater number of members.\nLastly, a mention of the annual\ndinner and theatre outing. This,\nheld on 15th Jan, was very well supported and Mr. Mooney served an\nenjoyable dinner to44 club members\nand guests.
