    "content": "It is impossible to not realize\nthat the National Health Service\n(NHS) was already facing\nchallenges and a decline prior to\nthe Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.\nOne of the main challenges we\nhear about is the shortage of\nstaff. This shortage has been\nheightened in recent years\nby an exodus of migrant\ndoctors, particularly\nthose from the European\nUnion, due to uncertainty\naround their future\nimmigration status\nand the overall\npolitical climate.\nAdditionally, an\nincreasing number of UKtrained consultants are\nleaving the NHS for better-paid\nopportunities in the Middle East\nand Australia. As of 2021, the NHS\nhad a shortfall of around 100,000\nstaff across all categories including\nnurses, doctors and support staff.\nIncreasingly, inadequate funding\nin the face of heightened demand has\nbeen suffocating the NHS. Despite\nbeing one of the most well-funded\nhealthcare systems in the world, the\nNHS has been struggling to keep pace\nwiththeincreasingdemandforservices\nand the rising costs of healthcare. In\n2020 it was estimated that the NHS\nwas facing a \u00a330 billion funding gap.\nThe NHS budget for 2021-22 was\n\u00a3134.9 billion, an increase of 4.5% on\nthe previous year. Increased funding\nduring the pandemic was intended\nto help support the increased need\nfor pandemic-related healthcare.\nFurthermore, this is less than the\naverage increase of funding over\nthe past decade (around 4.8%).\nIthasbeenmadeallthemoredifficult\nfor the NHS to recruit and retain staff\nby the rising cost of living for NHS\nstaff.In2016,anMPrevealedthatonly\n50% of all Metropolitan Police officers\nlived in London, a trend which the\nincreased cost of living is exacerbating.\nFurthermore, there have been\nconcerns about the\noverall efficiency and\neffectiveness of the\nNHS. The growing\npopulation with\nincreasingly complex\nhealthcare needs has\nput a strain on the\nsystem, and there have\nbeen concerns about\nlong waiting times, bed\nshortages, and a lack of\ncapacity in some areas. The number\nof patients waiting more than four\nhours in A&E departments increased\nfrom 1.9 million in 2018-19 to 2.3\nmillion in 2019-20. In August 2022,\n42% of patients waited for more than\nfour hours in A&E departments.\nThere have also been concerns\nabout the quality of care provided\nby the NHS. The NHS has been\ncriticized for not providing the same\nlevel of care as in other developed\ncountries, particularly in terms of\naccess to cutting-edge treatments\nand technologies. This is partly due\nto the lack of funding and partly due\nto heightened demand for healthcare\nservices as UK life expectancy climbs\nand the aged population increases.\nDespite these challenges, the\nNHS was able to adapt and provide\ncare during the pandemic and has\nbeen widely praised for its efforts.\n2\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNot Hating Secession\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "FRIDAY, 13TH JANUARY 2023\n3\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWhen I first found out that the\nviral chatbot ChatGPT could\nwrite poems about any topic in seconds,\nmy poet self had a lot of thoughts,\nincluding the obligatory oh-man-am-I-going-to-be-replaced ones. So you\ncan imagine my relief when I went on\nChatGPT and found that its poems\nwere, to say the least, pretty lacking.\nBut then again, AI is constantly\nimproving, and finding new ways to be\nmore like us in its creative expression.\nAnd ChatGPT\u2019s not the only poet-bot\nout there trying to prove its worth. So\nthe question remains: how good is AI\npoetry really? And can an AI-generated\npoem do the same things that a human\none can?\nAs I said before, ChatGPT\u2019s on-de-mand poetry is pretty lacking. I asked it\nto write a love poem, and was met with\nthe following excerpt: \u201cWith you by my\nside, the world is a better place,/Your\nlove is the sunshine that brightens my\nface./I'll cherish you forever, my dear,/\nYou are the one I hold so dear.\u201d\nAh, welcome to Sappy Town. For\nall its speed, ChatGPT doesn\u2019t seem\ncapable of using anything other than the\nmost clich\u00e9 of phrases and metaphors.\nAnd yet, there\u2019s something to be said for\nits grasp of language\u2019s musical elements,\na core aspect of poetry. With the exception of a few slip-ups, its poetry rhymes\nquite consistently, and has a good sense\nof rhythm as well. They might not be\nthe best poems, but they\u2019re nevertheless\npassable poems\u2014to be honest, they\nremind me of the poetry that my 10- or\n11-year-old self would write, the sort of\nbeginner\u2019s poetry that emerges before\none learns to write more skillfully.\nAnd then there are the other AIs that\nseem to have more effectively made\ntheir mark on the world of poetry.\nOne of them is Ai-Da, the world\u2019s\nfirst robot artist, who performed her\nAI-generated poetry at the Ashmolean\nMuseum in 2021. After being given\nan English translation of Dante\u2019s The\nDivine Comedy, she used her data bank\nof words and speech pattern analysis\nto produce a response poem to Dante\u2019s\nwork. In a news video from the BBC,\nshe\u2019s seen reciting some of her verse: \u201cI\nwept, silently, taking in the scene. I wept\nbecause they had lost something I had\ntook for granted.\u201d Here the poem seems\nunnervingly human: the verse flows\nbeautifully and naturally, and evokes a\nsense of poignant longing.\nThen there\u2019s the AI poet known\nsimply as \u201cthe Algorithm\u201d, which was\ngiven lines from over 100 contemporary British poets, and learned using\nfeedback from experts from poetry\norganizations. An excerpt from one of\nits creations reads: \u201cI close my eyes and\ntry to remember what I was./he says it\nwas an important and interesting day,/\nbecause I put in his hands one night/the\nbox of light that had been a tree.\u201d\nThe phrasing is rather disjointed, to\nbe sure, and the excerpt has a sense of\nflatness that can\u2019t seem to be shaken\noff. But the part about the box of light\ncreates a strikingly beautiful image in\nthe reader\u2019s mind, and the idea of the\nbox once being a tree is an original\none that allows for meaning-making:\na representation of the passing of a life\nand the memory that remains, perhaps.\nTracey Guiry, director of The Poetry\nArchive, says of the program, \u201cThe AI\nwould produce something that made\nyou think. It wouldn\u2019t produce or\nreproduce what a human would write\nbecause that\u2019s an incredibly subjective\nresponse, the lived experience was perhaps not there. But certainly, it would\nproduce two lines that would then cause\na human to think on more things.\u201d\nI think it\u2019s foolish to say that AI\npoetry will never be as good as that of\npeople. In terms of skill and technique,\nit\u2019s already surpassed beginner\u2019s poetry\nand is comparable with more advanced\nwork\u2014and as AI continues to learn\nand receive feedback, its skill will only\nprogress in catching up with ours. Evoking emotion, appealing to our aesthetic\ntaste, enlightening the audience\u2014AI\npoetry can already achieve many of the\nsame functions our poems can. It\u2019s a difficult truth no doubt, but it\u2019s ultimately\none we\u2019ll have to accept.\nBut then, what\u2019s left for us creators?\nI\u2019m personally consoled by the idea that\nAI can only work with a pre-existing,\nand limited, corpus of thoughts and\nexperiences\u2014which ultimately can\u2019t\nencompass the rich entirety of each\npoet\u2019s lived experiences, and the novel\ncontributions which those bring to po-etry. Yes, AI can create distinct combinations and reworkings of existing ideas\nand creative expressions, which is new,\nbut it\u2019s not the same kind of new which\nstems from one\u2019s personal way of being\nwith the world, and the unique ways of\nexpression arising from that. AI poems\nmight be able to rival ours in terms of\nquality, but our poetry will always have\nsomething distinct to offer that AI\ndoesn\u2019t.\nAnd there is another\u2014and I think\nthe most beautiful\u2014aspect of poetry\nwhich AI can\u2019t replace, and that\u2019s the\nreading of poetry as an act of compas-sion. When I write a poem, many poetic\naspects\u2014the use of abstraction, the\npotential for multiple messages within\none phrase, the tone set by language\u2019s\nmusical qualities\u2014allow me to express\nthoughts and feelings that regular\nwords can\u2019t. Poetry, and other kinds\nof creative work as well, allows one to\nbe vulnerable, to open up in ways that\nweren\u2019t possible before.\nAnd when a reader takes a look at my\npoem, it\u2019s like a need is fulfilled\u2014that\nhey, someone else knows and might\neven understand how I feel. And that of\ncourse runs the other way: hey, this poet\nunderstands just how I, the reader, feel\nas well. To read a human poem\u2014and in\ngeneral observe human art\u2014is to think\nand feel and admire, but it is also to be\nkind and to receive kindness. With AI,\nwhich has no needs to express, that last\npurpose is gone.\nIn a society where creative works are\nso often depicted as something to be\nconsumed, it\u2019s easy to forget about the\nreception of poetry\u2014and other art\u2014as\ncompassionate acts. I\u2019ve heard some\nexpress their hope that AI will make\npeople better appreciate the human\ncreativity behind people\u2019s art. I hope the\nsame, but I also hope it makes us appreciate the human connection behind it\nas well.\nAngie Lo Science Editor\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience\nAs good as ours?

    "content": "debut that somehow manages to be both carefree and\nintense throughout.\nNOT TiGHT by\nDOMi & JD BECK\nGiven I only discovered NOT TiGHT right at the\nyear\u2019s end, the fact that it so swiftly rose to being one\nof my favourite albums of the year is testament to\nyoung jazz duo DOMi & JD BECK\u2019s near virtuosic\ntalent and originality. The pair\u2019s musical abilities are\nperhaps no surprise given the years they\u2019ve worked to\nmaster their instruments \u2014 keyboardist DOMi had a\nfull scholarship to study jazz at Berklee while BECK\nbegan playing drums aged 8 \u2014 but this makes their\nability to deftly dance across their instruments within\na super-tight dialogue no less mesmerising. On their\ndebut NOT TiGHT, the duo successfully expand their\nimpressive instrumental jazz fusion with several well-chosen collaborations ranging from Thundercat to\nSnoop Dogg and Mac DeMarco. For those into jazz or\nlooking for a fun way into the genre, NOT TiGHT is a\njoy to behold.\nOnce Twice Melody by\nBeach House\nLong-time Beach House fans hoping for a\nchange of pace from the Baltimore dream-pop duo\nmight not be so enthralled to hear seemingly more of\nthe same on Beach House\u2019s eighth full-length LP \u2014 a\ndouble one, at that. However, for relative newcomers\nto the band, myself included, Once Twice Melody\nseems more like the pinnacle of the potent, ethereal\nsongwriting the band has been honing for close to\ntwo decades. Across four \u2018chapters\u2019, OTM not only\nhighlights that Beach House still have plenty to say\nwithin the dreamy musical syntax they\u2019re best known\nfor, but also features some of the band\u2019s finest work.\nOn the songs that most stood out to me \u2014 including\nthe title track, \u2018Superstar\u2019, \u2018New Romance\u2019, and closer\n\u2018Modern Love Stories\u2019 \u2014 Beach House pair their\nbewitching atmosphere with memorable melodies in\na way that maintains originality through considered\nproduction and songwriting. Though many of the\nalbum\u2019s highlights are concentrated in the first half,\nOTM as a whole is a dark but beautiful sonic fairytale\nthat is once again set to take you someplace else.\nbeatopia by beabadoobee\nIn the follow-up to the 90s-inspired teenage\nruminations of her debut album Fake It\nFlowers, beabadoobee steps away from grungier tracks,\noffering a collection of gentler, more acoustically\ncentered songs. Although these tender love songs and\nlilting lullabies might not have the same intensity as\nthe heavier cuts from her\nprevious record, beatopia\u2019s\ncontinued coming-of-age\nthemes,longingatmosphere\nand comforting melodies\nare delivered with an\naesthetic consistency that\nhad me continually coming\nback to it, earning it a place\namongst my best of 2022.\nZanna Buckland\nUncanny Valley by COIN\nA slow-burner, Uncanny Valley is exactly\nwhat it sounds like, an album about human\nnature and love while\nreflecting on slightly\nunsettling ideas\nregarding technology-based relationships\nand our growing\ndependence on the\nonline world. It is\ntruly a work of art,\nborn in the pandemic\nand delving deep\ninto COIN\u2019s feelings\nabout the new world order of technology. Despite the\nlink to technology and use of electronic effects, they\nremain a shining example of alt rock/pop, and the\nNashville-based band stays true to its roots: upbeat\ninstrumentals paired with introspective vocals. COIN\nbeing my favourite band, I\u2019m inclined to love anything\nthey do, but I really feel this is an album for everyone to\nenjoy. I adore \u2018Take the Stairs\u2019, a short and sweet track\nfor which their guitarist, Joe Memmel, specially learned\nthe trumpet, and that has the ability to instill you with a\nconfusing mix of confidence and existentialism.\nStill by Bryde\nWelsh artist Bryde poured her heart and soul\ninto Still, another pandemic-inspired album. It is a\ncollection of songs\nthat detail the\ndifferent kinds of\nrelationships one\ncan experience,\nand each song\nseemstohavemore\nfeeling in it than\nthe last. Bryde\nhas appended the\ntitle of each track\nwith a word for the kind of relationship it describes.\nWhile sometimes more knowledge about the context of\na song can ruin its magic, as with the unfortunate case\nof \u2018Blurred Lines\u2019, in this form it serves to add a layer\nof understanding that complements your listening,\nelevating the lyrics to another level of meaning. Bryde\u2019s\nvocals are airy and soulful, and I love the way she\ncombines band sounds with other sound effects to bring\ntracks to life. \u2018Hill I\u2019m Dying On (unrequited)\u2019, which\nhas a beautiful chorus and is very poetic, is the track I\u2019ve\nhad on repeat recently.\nHow to Let Go by\nSigrid\nSigrid has been hugely successful since early on in\nher career, and, like the rest of the music industry,\nhas released an album that was created while living at\nhome in Norway during the pandemic. How To Let\nGo contains a variety of songs, ranging from anthems\nlike \u2018It Gets Dark\u2019, to dance pop like \u2018Thank Me Later\u2019\nand \u2018A Driver Saved My Night\u2019, and ballads like \u2018Last To\nKnow\u2019. Sigrid has an amazing vocal range and capacity\nto hold a note, so her vocals can be overpowering,\nbut are always controlled and anchoring. She also\nincludes some fun vocal runs and has mastered the art\nof the catchy chorus. Personally, I like \u2018Risk of Getting\nHurt\u2019 for its balance: quiet and loud, vocals and\ninstrumentals, and containing elements of different\nstyles of songwriting.\nConditions of a Punk by\nhalf \u00b7 alive\nAnother favourite band of mine, half\u00b7alive have just\nreleased their second full-length album. Despite being\naround since 2017,\nwhen they released\ntheir first EP, the band\nhasn\u2019t been overly\nliberal with new\nreleases, which means\nthat what they have\nshared is thoughtful\nand well-developed.\nConditions of a Punk\ndisplays their full\nrange of songwriting and captures their essence: an\never so slightly edgy indie rock band that could hold\nits own in the mainstream. The songs on the album\nhave a lightness that makes them easy listening, while\nalso showing off their experimentation. Although a\nnumber of the tracks had been released as singles and\nan EP before the album materialised, they still manage\nan impressive track list of 18 songs. \u2018Never Been Better\u2019,\nwhich features Orla Gartland, has a nice, optimistic\nsound \u2014 a welcome feeling at the moment. One of my\nfavourite tracks, \u2018Everything Machine\u2019, has to be one\nof the catchiest singles off the album and is one of its\nmore accessible tunes.\nHarry\u2019s House by Harry\nStyles\nReleasing this album a couple of months\nbefore summer arrived was the best marketing move\nHarry could have made, as its infectious dance\npop sound is perfect for the hot season. One of my\nfavourite memories of 2022 would have to be lying\nby the Princess Diana fountain in Hyde Park in the\nmiddle of June and listening to Harry\u2019s House. The\nmellow vocals and synthesizer melodies embody\nthe warmth and laziness of a summer afternoon\nbut do just as well on a crowded dancefloor or in a\nnoisy kitchen. The album also maintained Harry\u2019s\nreputation for range, offering a mixture of fast,\nenergetic bops and slower, melancholy ballads. \u2018Love\nof my Life\u2019 has got to be one of my top tracks from\nthis one \u2013 unashamedly joining the other millions of\nfans who listen to it imagining it\u2019s been written solely\nfor them.\nAmbika Bhardwaj\nMidnights (3am version) byTaylor\nSwift)\nMother has a shimmering return to pure pop\nFRIDAY 13TH JANUARY 2023\n11\n\n"

The title means\n\u201cThe house that isn\u2019t one [a house]\u201d and the\nwhole album feels ethereal and dream-like\nin a way I\u2019m really obsessed with. Whether\nthrough the drones or strategically-placed\nsynthesizers, it\u2019s a beautiful, musical, and\nstrange experience, like a trance or the vague\nmemories of a dream that don\u2019t make sense\nonce you\u2019re awake. \u2018Dulcimer\u2019 is a lovely\nblend between Parrenin\u2019s folk upbringing\nand her more modern avant-garde ideas,\nfor instance. Really, really lovely stuff.\nPompeii by\nCate Le Bon\nI still think it\u2019s really funny how this\nprevented me from listening to Ants\nFrom Up There (likely featured in loads\nof other places in this section) for 2\nweeksifnotmore.It\u2019sjustbetter,Ilike\nit more. I already wrote the extent of my thoughts in\nmy review earlier\nthis year,\nb u t\nwhat has stuck out to me in the almost-year since its release has been the half-awake clarity that it\nkeeps in its writing.\nThe tracks are\nscattered with obscure\npoetic references and\nmetaphors, but the\nidea behind each one is clear as day.\nPicking favourites is hard here, but\n\u2018Remembering Me\u2019 and the title track\n\u2018Pompeii\u2019 are both bangers.\nAnd In the Darkness,\nHearts Aglow by\nWeyes Blood\nI wasn\u2019t quite ready for this album to\nbe as *real* as it turned out to be. My\nexperience\nwith Natalie\u2019s\nmusic before\nhad been\nthe lush and\nl i s t e n a b l e\nT i t a n i c\nRising, the\nfirst in a planned (?) trilogy of albums\nby the American singer-songwriter. And\nIn the Darkness is narrated by a woman\nwatching society collapse around her,\nand the first song sounds almost\nrelieved: \u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\nit\u2019s everybody.\u201d As\na whole, the\nalbum\nconcerns itself with everyday life in a\nworld on the brink and the ways we\nescape the reality of our situation. It\nkeeps Titanic Rising\u2019s ease of listening,\nand adds so much that\u2019s musically\nfascinating to listen to as well.

High as Hope, the\nlast F+tM record was such a letdown it\ndepressed me to no end. Florence Welch\nis back though, and remains melodic\nand graceful but keeps grounded in the\nfiery feelings that guide her music. It\nfeels distinctly different and new while\nstrengthening the things the band\ndid well in the past. There\u2019s plenty of\ntimes for Welch to ascend into glorious\nfalsetto and plenty of times to show her\nskill in belting. My favourite track is by\nfar \u2018My Love\u2019, also one of the singles. It\u2019s\ncatchy as hell, the vocal performance is\nexcellent and always a great pick-me-up\ntune.\nMia Brown\nI Love you Jennifer B\nby Jockstrap\nWiththreeEPsreleasedoverthespaceof\nfour years, a debut album from Jockstrap\nwaslongawaited-forbymany.ILoveYou\nJennifer B is a genrejumping pop album,\nwith a loveable madness, made by the\nculmination of Georgia Ellery\u2019s effortlessly clear vocals and poetic lyricism,\nswelling orchestral motifs and synths,\nwhich are all brought together by Taylor Skye\u2019s experimental electronic pro-duction. \u2018Jennifer B\u2019 and \u201850/50\u2019 are two\nhighlights, both more dancey and great\nto sing\nalong to,\nand I\u2019m eternally grateful for that extra\none minute thirty in the extended mix of \u201850/50\u2019 that perfectly wraps\nup this vibrant and exciting album.\nDragon New Warm\nMountain, I Believe\nin You by Big Thief\nIndie-folk band Big Thief graced us\nwith their fifth album, an eighty-minute-long\ndouble LP,\nwhich I never\nskip a second\nof. There is so\nmuch beauty\nin everything\nthat Adrianne\nLenker touches. Her songwriting,\nalongside the single-take recording\nstyle, makes this album so organic and\n(to be clich\u00e9) the imperfections are\nwhat make it so perfect. \u2018Spud Infinity\u2019\nis\none\nof my\nfavourite\ntracks, with a theme\nof acceptance of self. It has\na bouncy country feel, and the\nfiddle joined with the frog-like boing\nof the jaw harp makes it infectiously\njoyful, as is Lenker\u2019s scream at the end\nof the wonderful and optimistic \u2018Little\nThings\u2019.

Ants\nFrom Up There was released shortly after\nIsaac Wood\u2019s exit from the band, whose\na m u s i n g\npop culture\nreferences to Charli\nXCX in the \u2018Basketball\nShoes\u2019 and Billie Eilish in \u2018Good\nWill Hunting\u2019, are scattered through\nthis album that is otherwise highly\nemotional.

    "content": "There are few people who can write about grief as\nprecisely, articulately, and beautifully as Joan Didion has done in The Year of Magical Thinking. The book\ndetails the period between Christmas 2003 and 2004,\nduring which Didion\u2019s daughter Quintana Roo Dunne\nwas hospitalised twice: once for pneumonia which developed into septic shock, and again several months\nlater, after falling and hitting her head whilst disembarking from a plane at Los Angeles Airport. In addition to this, and in fact the central thread of the book,\nis the sudden death of Didion\u2019s husband John Gregory\nDunne, just five days after Quintana\u2019s first hospitalisa-tion. Despite the intensity of trauma that Didion un-derwent, the memoir is poignant, introspective, and\nfrank, as well as her farewell to 40 years of marriage.\nStructurally, The Year of Magical Thinking takes a\n(mostly) chronological approach, looking at each major event in the timeline of a year, as they occur, relying\non memories of the marriage, and occasionally straying from this formula to recall anecdotes from friends\nor from her career. It is excellently written, and well-paced: I read it in a weekend over a few hours. Didion\u2019s years of experience as one of the key figures in\nNew Journalism are apparent as she crafts a vivid but\nnot graphic, emotional but not skewed narrative. Didion writes with feeling \u2014 feeling that could be seen as\nself-indulgent but is completely justifiable. It takes a\ncertain level of self-assuredness to write about grief and\ntraumatic situations, but Didion makes it work without leaning too much towards self-pitying. She balances her narrative voice so she sounds neither pitiable nor\nself-indulgent,andthereadercanfeelgenuineempathy\nfor her.\nDue to the intense medical complexity of Didion\u2019s\ndaughter\u2019s condition, the book runs into some dense,\njargon-filled passages that, for me, were a bit of a slog\nto read at times. Of course, they have their purpose, as\nDidion articulates, but the pace slows down significantly during the middle section of the book \u2014 it does\nbegin to read like a medical case study, to its detriment.\nWhat Didion is most successful in achieving is creating a celebration of her marriage to Dunne. Forty years\nof what Didion presents as a successful relationship are\namongthehighlightsofthebook\u2014wegetinsightinto\nwhat Didion misses, and what the loss of her husband\nmeans to her. She highlights her vulnerability from\nlosing her husband, as well as picking out key parts of\nher marriage in a rich tapestry of memories. Even so,\nDidion doesn\u2019t make the mistake of looking back with\nexcess sentimentality \u2014 there is mention of fighting,\nand the marital issues that happen with any normal relationship \u2014 and that\u2019s part of what makes the premise so appealing.\nIt\u2019s a chance for\nsomeone to cherish their normal,\nmundane, loving\nrelationship. It\u2019s\nwhat makes the\nbook so emotionallyengaging\u2014it\nis something very\nreal and relata-ble. What makes\nit even more so\nis that Didion\ndoesn\u2019t overdo the recollection \u2014 we get some can-dour, but not enough to blur the barrier of parasociali-ty; the reader sees what Didion wants them to see, and\nthere is a sense of reservation surrounding what Didion is revealing \u2014 but what she isn\u2019t is due to wanting\nprivacy. It\u2019s refreshing to get just a glimpse, an intimate\nsnapshot into their 40-year marriage.\nIn summary, The Year of Magical Thinking amplifies\nthe feelings we all will face or have faced, with a clear\nvoice, into something one can absorb and reflect upon,\nand something one doesn\u2019t have to face alone. And\nfor its frankness regarding a topic that is often tiptoed\naround and ignored culturally, it deserves applause.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 15\nThe Year of Magical Thinking: A Masterclass\non Articulating the Unspeakable\nBook Review\nMohammad Majlisi Books Writer\nFRIDAY 13TH JANUARY 2023\nWhite Teeth winning the 2000 Whitbread Award\nfor First Novel, Commonwealth First Novel\nPrize, and the Betty Trask Award (albeit in \u201901, but understandable for its status as the first work of the since\nacclaimed and Grammy-winning\u2014?!\u2014author) surprisingly turns out to be casual. 447 pages, strung with\neffervescent storylines and a colourful roster of actors,\nliterally and metaphorically, White Teeth is a long and\nthorough postmodern experiment on capturing the\nanxieties of anticipating a new day, month, or year ap-proaching. But first, you need to be able to finish the\nnovel for this to make an iota of sense.\nIt\u2019s a Great novel (with an onerous, American capital \u2018G\u2019), offering the reader an expansive post-coloni-al assessment of what it means to start life in another\ncountry, the country being England. And just as a year\nis, White Teeth necessitates using a bundle of contradictions to attempt to describe it. It can run and it can me-ander, simultaneously, as it tells the story of two World\nWar II veterans with grudges: one of them English\nwith a grudge against life, the other Bangladeshi with\na grudge against life in England. But that depends on\nwho\u2019s telling the story. Because Zadie Smith, with her\neclectic voice and prose, skims and sears through topics like femininity, generational\nconflict, (cultural, religious, professional, Smith could\ncover it), and identity crises much like life itself, with\nperfectly timed joyous and tragic moments.\nAll the characters in White Teeth are walking fearfully towards their futures. Forgotten existence. Apocalypse. Cultural insignificance. A scientific conference.\nEven the year 2000 itself. But amidst that anxiety,\nthe novel is interested in what people do in the inter-im: they people. And for all its excesses, that\u2019s exactly\nwhat Smith really captures\u2014a feat which, still today is\nquite ambitious to aim for, and astonishing to actually\nachieve in a novel.\nTurning Over the Metaphorical Page By\nTurning the Pages of White Teeth\nBook Review\nFiyinfoluwa Oladipo Books Writer\n\n"

The album is set around a\nco-dependent relationship that the narrator\nis in denial of, and their deep emotional\nturmoil due to this. As the album progresses, it\nbecomes more difficult to decipher whether the\nrelationship is a romantic one, or one between\nartist and audience. Cathartic ballads such\nas \u2018The Place Where He\nInserted The Blade\u2019\nare at contrast with\nthe chaotic waltz\n\u2018Concorde\u2019, or\nthe percussive\n\u2018Snow Globes\u2019,\nyet there is never a feeling of\nwhiplash as the band crosses genres\nduring the album, or even during\ntracks. It is hard to imagine how the\nensemble will continue to reinvent\nthemselves and reach new musical\nheights,butIhavenodoubtthattheirthird\nalbum will be as ambitious and skilful as AFUT.\nWe know it\u2019s 2023, we know we should\u2019ve done this last\nyear, but we control this section (and we forgot) so here\nis your comprehensive guide to the best music released last year.\nWe\u2019ve got everything you could need, including a playlist with\nthe top songs from all of our top albums and a leaderboard of\nthe top albums by number of writers who rate them. If you dis-agree, up our sample size and write for us next year, but for now,\nsit back and enjoy the Felix Music team\u2019s top albums of 2022!\nI Love you Jennifer B by\nJockstrap\nFusing folk, dubstep, and pop, Jockstrap\u2019s Georgia Ellery\nand Taylor Skye soar on their debut album I Love\nYou Jennifer B. The electro thrumming baselines\npersist through lyrical orchestral segments and folk-y\nwhispery vocals in a way that should make the album\nnightmarishly chaotic, if not simply esoteric, but\ninstead combine in the perfect way to create a fun\nalbum with songs that could be played on the aux at\na party or alone on an angsty Tube ride. Highlights\ninclude \u2018Greatest Hits\u2019 and \u2018Glasgow\u2019, though the track that summarises\nJockstrap\u2019s genre mashing capabilities best is undeniably \u2018Concrete Over Water\u2019.\nFlood by\nStella Donnelly\nIt is hard to believe that it was only three years\nbetween Perth singer-songwriter Stella Donnelly\u2019s\nesteemed debut album Beware of the Dogs and Flood.\nHer development as a songwriter in this period\nis already stark, with Flood featuring some of her\nmost confident instrumentals yet, and continuing\nto feature her astute and witty lyrics. The best\nmoments on the album are when Donnelly introduces\nthe flugelhorn, on tracks such as \u2018Restricted Account\u2019 and \u2018Oh My My My\u2019.\nOnce Twice Melody by\nBeach House\nBaltimore dream-pop duo Beach House returned with their 8th studio album\nOnce Twice Melody in February, to universal acclaim. The 85-minute-long album\nwas released in four chapters across three months, and\nwith 18 tracks it is difficult to tire of Victoria\nLegrand\u2019s ethereal vocals and Alex Scally\u2019s\ncinematic hooks. My personal favourite\ntrack is the deeply atmospheric \u2018Runaway\u2019,\nwhich sounds as if it could have been lifted\nstraight from the soundtrack of Twin Peaks.\nFeeding the Machine by\nBinker & Moses\nFeeding the Machine is the most recent endeavour by free-jazz duo Binker Golding and\nMoses Boyd. It is dark, moody,\nand discordant, with Golding\u2019s\nscreeching sax and Boyd\u2019s restless\nand jittery drumming. The duo\nis joined only by Max Luthert,\nwho electronically manipulates\nthe improvisations of the duo\nthrough tape-loops and modular synths. The height of\nthe album is the fervent \u2018Accelerometer Overdose\u2019, though\nall six tracks on this ambitious release are worth a listen.\nFRIDAY 13TH JANUARY 2023\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n10 Music.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nJoe Riordan\nangel in realtime by\nGang of Youths\nGang of Youths manage to perfectly knit together\ntheir past few years of living in Angel (get it, angel\nin realtime), weaving the intensely personal tales of\nloss and love and loneliness into relatable, emotional\nanthems. The overarching story told by the album is\nthe death of lead singer David Le\u2019aupepe\u2019s dad and\nthe subsequent revelations about his family\u2019s past.\n\u2018brothers\u2019 sets these\ncomplex, shattering\ndiscoveries to a simple\nmelody, setting focus\npurely on Le\u2019aupepe\u2019s\nemotions, leaving the\nlistener feeling the\nsame gut-wrenching\nguilt and sadness.\nNavigating this heavy\nloss is tough enough\nat home, but \u2018the\nangel of 8th ave.\u2019 narrates the challenges of doing this in\na new town, a new hemisphere, as the band had moved\nacross the globe from Sydney to London. This track\nis the best song on the album and vies for the top spot\nfrom my whole top 5, it\u2019s a love song for Le\u2019aupepe\u2019s\nwife and again, even with this close, personal meaning,\nit manages to be relatable. Throughout the whole\nalbum, you feel exactly how Le\u2019aupepe wants you to\nand he accomplishes this with ease. Take an hour and\nleave yourself to his mercy: it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s anthemic,\nit\u2019s angelic.\nAnywhere But Here by Sorry\nI saw Sorry in June;\nthey played a few\ntracks from Anywhere\nBut Here but by this\npoint, only one or two\nhad been released.\nThe months between\nthe gig in June and\nthe album release in\nOctober were the\nmost excited I\u2019ve\nbeen for a record.\nI couldn\u2019t wait to hear tracks like \u2018Closer\u2019 and \u2018Tell Me\u2019\nagain. Anywhere But Here is a breakup album on the\nsurface but at a more fundamental level it\u2019s an album\nabout loneliness. Emphasising how losing your favourite\nperson is even harder when you\u2019re in a city as big and as\nuncaring as London. My favourite track on the album is\n\u2018Step\u2019. It has an Annie Wilkes quality, trapping the feelings\nthat come before you\u2019ve reached the acceptance stage of\ngrief, illustrating the delusions of movie scene occurrences\nhappening to undo the recent heartbreak. Even though I\u2019ve\nbeen in London for 3 years now, it can still feel daunting at\ntimes and Anywhere But Here perfectly encapsulates these\nfeelings.\nAnts From Up There by Black\nCountry, New Road\nI think Black Country, New Road\u2019s Ants From Up There\nbeing on nearly half of our lists is a justification in itself,\nbut let me have a go\nat convincing you\nthis album deserves a\nplace up here just in\ncase you don\u2019t think so\nalready. I saw the band\nperform at Wide Awake\nfestival in Brixton\nin 2021 before the\nalbum was released but\nwhen they performed\nonly unreleased songs\nfrom the album. I didn\u2019t know the songs, I didn\u2019t know\nthe words, I didn\u2019t appreciate at all what I was seeing\nand hearing. I would give a lot to see that set again after\nlistening to the album tens of times, especially now the\nband don\u2019t perform any of the tracks anymore after lead\nsinger Isaac Woods\u2019 departure. The album flies between\ngenres while always sounding coherent so it\u2019s tough to\npick a top song from the album but some honourable\nmentions have to go to \u2018Good Will Hunting\u2019 and \u2018Basketball\nShoes\u2019. This is possibly the most emotive album on my list,\nWoods being the only person able to convey these feelings\ncorrectly.\nBeing Funny in a Foreign\nLanguage by The 1975\nBig fans of this section\nmight remember a few\nissues ago I slighted this\nalbum. I retract most\nof what I said. I still\nthink Matty Healy is\nsometimes annoying, I\nstill think some of the\nlyrics are cringey and\nare just going to fuel a\nnew angsty generation\nof teenagers to replace\nthose from 2013 when the band released their self-titled\nalbum, but I have to admit Being Funny in a Foreign\nLanguage is a great album. As I said before, the production\nis sublime \u2014 I spot new, intriguing ideas on every listen. By\nthis point, if you have any social media presence you will\nhave seen a video from one of The 1975\u2019s gigs. Some are\nfunny, some are pretentious, some are questionable. I think\nthis complete inundation of content has finally flipped my\nopinion.\nGuitar Music by Courting\nI hate to pit northerners against each other \u2014 we have to\nstick together down here \u2014 but Liverpool-based Courting\u2019s\nGuitar Music has just\nedged in front of Leedsbased Yard Act\u2019s The\nOverload for a spot\nin my top 5 albums\nof 2022. An initially\nconfusing mix of post-punk and hyperpop\n(I\u2019m sure someone has a\nmore niche genre to put\nthem into), Guitar Music has grown on me. Listening to the\nalbum while sitting still is impossible because every track\nmakes you want to dance. While bands like Sports Team can\nfeellikethey\u2019resometimesforcingthenarrationofmundane\ndaily life, the Seinfeld of post-punk, Courting\u2019s imaginative\nproduction blends glitches with guitars to brighten these\nthemes, best heard in \u2018Uncanny Valley Forever\u2019. This is the\nmost exciting and intriguing album on my list so if you\nlisten to any of them, listen to this one and then try to wait\npatiently for wherever Courting are going to head next.\nNeel Le Penru\nBlue Rev byAlvvays\nAlvvays\u2019\nthird LP\nis another masterful\npiece of indie rock/\ndream pop retro-nostalgia. Building\non the best elements\nof the band\u2019s previous\ntwo efforts \u2014\ncarefully crafted tracks\nthat interweave jangly\nguitars and analogue\nsynthesisers behind Molly Rankin\u2019s elegant, pining\nvocals \u2014 Blue Rev sees the band explore a slightly more\nbrazen side, with layers of sounds awash in distortion\njust as much as the reverb and echo that suffused\nthrough their previous work. This might not be a sonic\nrevolution, but after nearly 5 years it\u2019s a very welcome\nand invigorating addition to what Alvvays do best. I\u2019ll\ncertainly have it on repeat through much of 2023.\nA Light for Attracting\nAttention by The Smile\nSome Radiohead fans may be disappointed that the\nwait for another LP from the Oxford 5-piece only\nlooks set to continue, while others might argue that the\nThe Smile\u2019s first album is effectively the same thing, or\nat least the closest we\u2019ll get for some time. Comprised\nof Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood,\nand Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner, The\nSmile\u2019s sonic identity\nnaturally bears many\nof Radiohead\u2019s\nhallmarks, most\nnotably the equally\nferocious and blissful\nbalance of Yorke\u2019s\nhaunting vocals\nwith Greenwood\u2019s\nangular, rhythmically\neccentric guitar.\nWhile the band even\npick up unreleased Radiohead tracks (e.g. \u2018Skirting\non the Surface\u2019), Skinner\u2019s kinetic drumming and\npulsing synth lines bring a new dynamic to Yorke and\nGreenwood\u2019s writing, leading to a distinct, versatile\nsound. This, coupled with the creative freedom of\na new project\u2019s lack of expectations, results in 13\nidiosyncratic tracks that seem to effortlessly switch\nfrom beautiful to unsettling or vigorous \u2014 a strong\n\n"

Carner discusses themes of\nanti-Black racism, growing up mixed-race, and relationships with his own\nfather. It\u2019s not surprising that Carner\ncontinues to excel in his poignant\nstorytelling, especially in \u2018Blood On\nMy Nikes\u2019, featuring a speech from\nyoung activist Athian Akec, in\nwhich Carner retells a\nmurder he had\nwitnessed at\nj u s t\nsixteen. The final track, \u2018HGU\u2019, uses a\n\u2018loyle carner type beat\u2019 that was found\nonYouTube,\nand Carner\nbeautifully\nd iscusses\nending the\ncycle of hurt\nby forgiving\nhis own\nfather, so\nthat he can be a better dad to his son.\nI often shed a few tears to this song\nand cried when it was read as a poem\nlive.

We even catch JID singing\non some of the more beautiful, vocally\ncarried cuts, like \u2018Kody Blu 31\u2019, while his\nrapping remains disturbingly effortless\nand more entertaining than ever.

Eerie sound\npalettes, gentle piano keys and distorted\nsynthesisers create an incredibly pretty,\nnostalgic and ethereal, but at the same\ntime blood-curdling and anxiety-inducing vibe, complementing the two\nrecurring emotions on this record \u2014\nunbearable loneliness and aggressive\ndesperation \u2014 incredibly well. Out of\nevery artist on this list, Quadeca has\nundeniably shown the most artistic\ngrowth this year, making me really\nexcited for what he has in store next.\nCave World by\nViagra Boys\nCaveWorldisanimpressiveseriesofdirty,\ninfectious, punk rock bops that have\nmade me fall in love with this band big-time. With many allusions being made\nto lower, ape-like lifeforms, the album\npaints a rather pessimistic account of the\nh u m a n\ncond ition,\nurging the likes of\nanti-vaxxers and QAnon\nbelievers to remove themselves\nfrom society with incredibly humorous\nlyricism, while combining this with\na perfect dose of self-deprecation,\npreventing\nthe project\nf r o m\ns o un d i n g\nlike a\npretentious\nexercise in\nelitism. The\nhooks on\nthis album are genuinely amazing, from\nthe cartoonish and insanely catchy\n\u2018Troglodyte\u2019, to the abrasive \u2018Ain\u2019t No\nThief\u2019 and the country, hip-hop blend\nthat is \u2018Big Boy\u2019. With this project,\nViagra Boys have solidified their unique\nsoundandstyleevenfurtherandIreally\nhopemorepeoplestartpayingattention\nto them, as very few bands manage to\npull off the goofy and playful aesthetic\nas masterfully as they can while also\ndoing thoughtful social commentary.\nDance Fever by\nFlorence + the\nMachine\nDance Fever encompasses some of\nFlorence\u2019s most impressive work to\ndate, with her vocals being as huge and\ntheatrical as ever, while the production\nremains rather minimal. The album\nmakes for a cathartic journey, with\nWelch singing passionately about\ndaily emotional struggles and mental\nhealth, the love she feels for her craft,\nas well as issues like gender norms on\nthe anthemic \u2018King\u2019, all told through\na motif of \u201cdancing the pain away\u201d.\nSongs like \u2018Dream Girl Evil\u2019 and \u2018My\nLove\u2019 feature some of her strongest,\ndanceable grooves that will stick with\nme for a long while. Moreover, the\nmore\nmelancholic\ncuts like \u2018Morning\nElvis\u2019 and \u2018Choreomania\u2019\nhave been the soundtrack to\nmany of my daily, over-romanticised\nlife struggles this year, evoking a very\nparticular kind of sadness in me that\nfeels almost hopeful and optimistic.\nAlthough nothing too ground-breaking\nor genre-defining, this album is a fun\ncollection of catchy tunes and touching\nballads.\nNatural Brown\nProm Queen by\nSudan Archives\nMulti-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Brittney Parks delivers some\nof the most exciting sonics this year\nin her sophomore LP, Natural Brown\nProm Queen \u2014 a sexy, string-kissed,\nbeautifully hypnotic collection of R&B\ncuts that bring forward a really unique\nenergy. Incredibly punchy and hectic\ndrumbeatsontrackslike\u2018NBPQ\u2019,aswell\nas skilful and confident vocal passages\nlaced with lovely violin sections on\n\u2018Chiara\u2019 or \u2018Selfish Soul\u2019, make for some\nof the most interesting and forward-thinking tracks I have heard in 2022.\nSudan even detours into trap on \u2018OMG\nBRITT\u2019, showcasing really impressive\nrange on this record, both production-wise and vocally, while consistently\nnailing the more psychedelic, slow-paced vibe on tracks like \u2018Homesick\u2019\nand \u2018ChevyS10\u2019. With an album as\ncaptivating as this, I cannot wait to see\nwhere Brittney\u2019s creative talents will\ntake her in the future.\nFRIDAY 13TH JANUARY 2023\nSudan Archives\nSelf-taught violinist and singer-songwriter Brittney Parks returns with\na more personal-feeling album than her\ndebut,reflectingonhomelifegrowingup,\nand the themes of colourism and racism\narepresentthroughout.Inspirationsfrom\nWest African finger plucking, joined\nwith her more whimsical and flowing\nharmonies make up her unique string\npassages, that captivated so many in her\nearlier music. These continue through\nthe album, from the softer spoken-word\ntracks to the heavier trap beats of \u2018OMG\nBRITT\u2019. The building and cascading\nharmonies with glitchy vocals\nmake \u2018Loyal (EDD)\u2019 my\nfavourite track\noff this\ndanceable, confidence emitting, feelgood album.\nHugo by Loyle\nCarner\n\n"

Charlotte came back\nthis year, ditching her covid quarantine themes from how i\u2019m feeling now and instead making a love letter to classic pop music,\nproducing a retro-futuristic record which just.\ngets.me.going!\u201cI\u2019mhighvoltage,self-destructive, end it all so legendary\u201d from the opener\n\u2018Crash\u2019 gives us a notion that this album would\nbe a true lesson in saying goodbye to one\u2019s label with a bang (or a crash lol). It\u2019s Janet Jackson-esquefeelleavesyouwantingtogetupand\nboogie. \u2018Good Ones\u2019 is filled with throbbing\nsynths which just make you feel something. (It\nwas also released at just the right time in my\nlife, so I had no choice but to stan). The tasty, yet punchy string intro to \u2018Baby\u2019 leads\ninto Charli telling us she will \u201cmake you my baby\u201d, and with this record she did.\n\u2018Lightning\u2019 is also really fucking good. The project\u2019s brilliant production and fun\nwritingarewhatgiveitaspotonmytop5oftheyear.TLDR:Fromashtoash,from\ndust to dust, in Charli XCX, I put all my trust. Listen to \u2018Used to Know Me\u2019.\nHold the Girl byRina Sawayama\nOkay, okay, OKAY. I get it. As a Rina stan I ended up getting a SIGNED\nLP for my S.O. for their bday (I\u2019m such a great partner) and, thus, I am not above\nhaving her in my top 5 for this year, in fact\nI feel epic about this decision. Hold the\nGirl is an incredible project which involves\nmany a bop. It begins with the triple entendre \u2018Minor Feelings\u2019, which describe her\nthoughts as unimportant during her time\nas a minor, all in a minor key, and sets the\ntheme for the album. Just a few days ago\nwe sat down, and group listened to this album via record player. It slapped. Rina was\nback with yet another enticing project. I\ncan wholeheartedly say that we loved all of\nthe tracks off of the album (*cough* apart\nfrom \u2018Holy (Til You Let Me Go)\u2019), and because of that I will never stop loving this\nalbum. \u2018This Hell\u2019 is the yee to your haw, the snake to your boot, the rhythm to\nyour groove - it opens with a catchy, square-dancey, type of intro, coupled with an\neven catchier chorus. \u2018Your Age\u2019 leaves you with a slow but powerful headbang, and\n\u2018Frankenstein\u2019 has yet another thumpin\u2019 chorus. Rina came back and graced us all\nwith this one, lads.\nTLDR: Rina SLAYwayama. Listen to \u2018Send My Love To John\u2019 just cus it\u2019s got my\nname in it.\nNOT TiGHT by DOMi & JD BECK\nHave you seen that \u2018Thundercat\u2019 video? You know, the one with Ariana Grande, and\nthose two other cool kids in the back? Well, let me introduce you to DOMi & JD\nBECK. I shit you not, I was not expecting this whatsoever. Allow me to apologise\nfor my ignorance, and instead of going into my sorrow for unknowingly disrespecting these two by not finding out about them earlier, I\u2019ll just get into it. DOMi &\nJD BECK are a jazz duo, consisting of two child prodigies \u2014 and it shows. NOT\nTiGHT combines the ambidextrously played melodies of piano and bass from\nDomi and the cyborg-like rattling of drums from Beck in a smooth yet wild jazz-fu-sion record. It opens with a graceful string section in \u2018LOUNA\u2019S iNTRO\u2019 before\nseamlessly going into \u2018WHATUP\u2019, where the duo well and truly wigg out and show\nus what they\u2019re really made of. A swing of features from heavy hitters follows from\nthis. \u2018BOWLiNG (feat. Thundercat)\u2019 reunites the pair with the godlike bassist, continuing his signature sound into the following track \u2018NOT TiGHT\u2019. Mac DeMarco\u2019s\nvocals blend seamlessly in \u2018TWO SHRiMPS (feat. Mac DeMarco)\u2019, along with their\nlabel\u2019s head Anderson .Paak in \u2018TAKE A CHANCE (feat. Anderson .Paak)\u2019. The\nremaining features include Herbie Hancock, Snoop Dogg(y dog), Busta Rhymes,\nKurt Rosenwinkel \u2014 the album is nothing to joke around about. TLDR: It\u2019s so\ndamn playful and fun. Listen to \u2018SNiFF\u2019.\nSOS by SZA\nWhere is SZA? How can she get better than CTRL? Will she lay down\na project after half a decade? - These are the questions we as Szlings [sorry] were\nleft with after being graced with tracks such as \u2018Doves In the Wind (feat. Kendrick\nLamar)\u2019 from her last album. If I\u2019m being all honest, I was not hopeful \u2014 unfaithful\nin Solana to give us another album. But then she did it. SOS dropped just in time for\nthe winter holidays, and we would finally have enough resources to go into hiber-nation. She opens with \u2026- - - \u2026 (SOS in morse code for the uninitiated) where she\ntakes back what is rightfully hers \u2013 \u201cDamn\nright, I\u2019m the One\u201d she says just before interpolating \u2018Listen\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, demanding\nwe open our ears to her once again. And listen we did. With post-breakup ruminations\nfrom \u2018Kill Bill\u2019 and an orgasmic key change in\n\u2018Gone Girl\u2019, and rounding off the album with\nheavily anticipated tracks such as \u2018Blind\u2019 and\n\u2018Shirt\u2019, SOS offers listeners an extensive look\ninto SZA\u2019s last 5 years. Despite being released\na week into December, SOS grips me to the\npoint that it had to be in my top 5 \u2014 I may be\nbiased about this, I love SZA, but I think we can all agree that this album is great.\nA gigantic twenty-three track album, which takes the blame she once put on others\nwithin CTRL and releases that. SZA has evolved and it shows.\nTLDR: Really, fucking, good. Listen to \u2018Snooze\u2019.\nRENAISSANCE by Beyonc\u00e9\nDoyouknowthisundergroundartistcalledBeyonc\u00e9?Ifirstgotataste\nfor this album when \u2018BREAK MY SOUL\u2019 was released as a single. In all honesty,\nI was underwhelmed (sue me). It felt like yet another dedication to house music\nthat left my soul wanting more. I then came back again, again, and again. BEYONC\u00c9 had me hooked. I was left unsatisfied with just having this single. I shit you\nnot, when the whole album dropped, I had no\nchoice but to eat it all up. \u2018I\u2019M THAT GIRL\u2019\nenters with a statement to us motherfuckers\n\u2014 we \u201cain\u2019t stopping\u201d her. And she\u2019s deadass\nabout this. The sheer confidence exuded by\nthis opener carries through to the whole album\nfrom front to back. The 3-track run of \u2018CUFF\nIT\u2019,\u2018ENERGY(feat.Beam)\u2019,and\u2018BREAKMY\nSOUL\u2019 leaves me in awe, making me go back\nand enjoy them repeatedly. Lush transitions,\nmasterful production, and absolutely badass\n\u2014 Beyonce\u2019s RENAISSANCE fuels me with\nconfidence. A special mention to the final 5 track run from \u2018THIQUE\u2019 to \u2018ALL UP\nIN YOUR MIND\u2019, to \u2018AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM\u2019, to \u2018PURE/HONEY\u2019, (and\nfinally) to \u2018SUMMER RENAISSANCE\u2019. The pacing of this thing is unparalleled, it\nkeeps my attention all up on it. In your case, if the absolute sheer power of Beyonce\ndoesn\u2019t catch your attention, this album will instead demand it from you.\nTLDR: Smooth, masterful, thanks Beyonc\u00e9. Listen to \u2018VIRGO\u2019S GROOVE\u2019.\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Their long-awaited\nreunion, which has led to this\nnew album, is a testament to their\nsuperb musicianship, incredible\nchemistry, and dynamic playing,\nwhich together makes this album\none of the best of the year.\nListen To: \u2018Long Gone\u2019 & \u2018Disco\nEars\u2019\nShifting Sands\nby Avishai\nCohen, Elchin\nShirinov &\nRoni Kaspi\nIn his newest project, double\nbass virtuoso Avishai Cohen is\njoined by pianist Elchin Shirinov,\nand rising 21-year-old drummer\nRoni Kaspi.

But without a shadow\nof doubt, it has been done - and\nin record time. Inspired by the\nminimalist modern classical\nwork of Steve Reich\u2019s Music\nfor 18 Musicians, the band displays innovative musicianship,\nculminating in a rock record\nthat is epic, complex and, most\nimportantly, fresh. These qualities come together to provide\na deep listening experience,\nwhere it is possible to get lost in\nthe many neatly fitted layers of\nthe album, finding new things\nabout the music, the poetry, or\neven yourself.\nHorseshit on\nRoute 66by\nThe Garden\nTo summarise my full-length\nOctober review of this record\nin one word, the 25-minute\nexperimental punk album is\n\u2018weird\u2019. A lot of this weirdness\nhad already been present in\nprevious projects by the duo,\nbut in here the combination of\nsomewhat random sources of\ninspiration (from 1950s cinema\nto drum and bass to Jacksepticeye)make foracompellinglove\nletter to the band\u2019s background\nand their scene, and, all-in-all,\nwhat punkness is at its essence.\nHellfire by\nblack midi\nHellfire is cinematic.\nStorytellingisatthecentreofthe\nalbum and, as the title suggests,\nit is a chaotically infernal\nnarrative of war, addiction,\nguilt, and ultimately, death.\nThe dark themes, coupled with\nexplosive instrumentals and\ntheatrical vocal performance,\nmake for a captivating\nradionovela recounted by\nthe eccentric Geordie Greep\n(and with contributions from\npartner Cameron Picton,\nof course). Throughout this\n39-minute run, black midi\nexcels at grabbing the listener\u2019s\nhandandshowingthemaround\nthe burning world they have\npainted.\nhypochondriac\nbybrakence\nFor the past couple of years,\nbrakence has developed a\nunique blend of (midwest)\nemo rap and glitch pop \u2013 a\nmix which somehow ended up\nin the hyperpop spectrum. If\nthat sounds confusing, don\u2019t\nfret. hyponchondriac is a highly\nmelodic and easy album to\nlisten to. Although it has some\nexperimental passages, this\nproject is mainly composed of\nvery easy-to-digest pop tunes.\nThe production is the main\nhighlight, giving colour to the\nromantic tales chronicled by\nthe rapper, who in a vulnerable\nwayvariesbetweenemotiveand\nself-centred themes.\nI Didn\u2019t Mean\nto Haunt You\nbyQuadeca\nNo one thought a \u201cYouTube\nrapper\u201d could do it, but here\nwe are. Quadeca has dabbled\nin many subgenres of hip-hop, but in this occasion, he\nstepped completely out of it,\nmanufacturing an album that is\nhardtobox,introducingsounds\nfromemorap,artpop,ambient,\nand even folk.

This term, we\ncanexpectthingstogetexcitingasteams\nprogress towards the final stages of the\nknockout rounds.\nIn addition to BUCS, there are a\nnumber of other competitions coming\nup, including various clashes with LSE.\nParticularlyhighlyanticipatedisTheImperial Varsity: two days of fierce matches and heckling between IC and ICSM\nteams. Internal competition is another longstanding Imperial tradition; in\n1928 the university held its Sports Day\nat Chelsea Football Ground. This year,\ncompetitors and supporters shall be\ntrekking out to glamorous Harlington,\nZone 5 (eat your heart out, Stamford\nBridge!) for teams to battle it out. Even\nthe engines of low-flying planes won\u2019t be\nable to drown out the crowds\u2019 roars. In\nthe running to headline are Waterpolo,\nIndoor Cricket Netball, Men\u2019s Rugby,\nWomen\u2019s Football, Hockey, and Men\u2019s\nFootball. Voting is open now.\nThese represent just a small fraction\nof the 90+ sports clubs across Imperial.\nWhilst many of these clubs have competitive elements, all can be joined rec-reationally. Felix encourages any clubs or\nsocieties who would like to feature to get\nin touch, and is especially keen to hear\nfrom those competing outside of BUCS.\nShow Felix your gleaming trophies\n(or your wooden spoons)\nIsabella Ward Sports Editor\nEdited by: Isabella Ward\nClubs&Sport\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\nEyes on the prize:\nthese teams are currently in top position\nof their leagues.\nGiving it their best\nshot(s) are Men\u2019s &\nWomen\u2019s Basketball.\nMen\u2019s Football II (let\u2019s\nhope this doesn\u2019t go to\npenalties).\nVictories l-across-e the\nboard: Men\u2019s Lacrosse.\nMen\u2019s Squash III have\ntaken the word \u2018squash\u2019\nliterally when it comes\nto how they treat their\nopponents.\nSouthern tier getting\nserved by Women\u2019s Volleyball.\nMaking a splash: Women\u2019s Waterpolo.\nHot on their heels,\nHot on their heels,\nsitting in 2\nsitting in 2nd\nnd\nplace\nplace\nare:\nare:\nWomen\u2019s BadminWomen\u2019s Badminton\nton\nMen\u2019s Dodgeball II\nMen\u2019s Dodgeball II\nMen\u2019s Fencing II\nMen\u2019s Fencing II\nMen\u2019s I & II Futsal\nMen\u2019s I & II Futsal\nMixed Golf\nMixed Golf\nMen\u2019s Hockey II\nMen\u2019s Hockey II\nAlthough perhaps not\nquite in it to win it, these\nteams are hanging on to\npodium position.

    "content": "\u2014 her tenth album returns to the dazzling synth-pop of\nrecords like \u20181989\u2019 and \u2018Reputation,\u2019 with lyrics caught\nbetween a love story and a revenge plot. Midnights is\nfor the girls who worked\nhard to get a life of\ntheir own, but now feel\nempty; it\u2019s the album\nyoulistentowhenyou\u2019re\nalone in the kitchen\nwith no partner to cook\nwith, no friends to go\nout with, no parents to\ncomfort you. It\u2019s for the\nJo March girls, who gave\nup everything and everyone and pretend like it\u2019s alright\nbut cry themselves to sleep every night, it\u2019s for the girls\nwho stare at the ceiling for hours after coming home, it\u2019s\nfor the masterminds, the people pleasers, for the girls\nwho think they\u2019re unlovable, it\u2019s for the autumn/winter\ngirls, it\u2019s for the girls who love rain and gloom, it\u2019s for\nthe girls who read the most gut-wrenching books to feel\nemotions, it\u2019s the ultimate sad girl album.\nBeing Funny in a Foreign\nLanguage by The 1975\nI hate Matty Healy (he has fundamentally\nchanged my brain chemistry since the age of 13) \u2013 but\nwith the new album, the band reasserts themselves at the\nforefrontof2020spop-rock,fusingtogetherthetextures\nand musical ideas of soft-rock hits from three decades\nago with modern sensibilities in a way that sounds\ninstantly familiar, yet distinctively of-the-moment. A\nvery rushed summary of the tracks:\n\u2018The 1975\u2019: Evidence in LCD Soundsystem\u2019s copyright\nsuit against The1975\n\u2018Happiness\u2019: Nominative determinism. The title is how I\nfeel when I listen to the song\n\u2018Looking For Somebody (To Love)\u2019: Move over \u2018Pumped\nUp Kicks\u2019, there\u2019s a new absolute banger about school\nshootings in town\n\u2018Part of the Band\u2019: Please listen to Japanese Breakfast\nshe\u2019s fucking great.\n\u2018Oh, Caroline\u2019: Closest to contemporary pop they\u2019ve\never come. Anyone could have released this, and yet\nthey\u2019ve still nailed it.\n\u2018I\u2019m In Love With You\u2019: \u2018Everywhere\u2019 \u2014 Fleetwood Mac\n(2022 Version)\n\u2018All I Need To Hear\u2019: This isn\u2019t half as cutesy as it initially\nappears. If most of the songs on here are about one\nrelationship, this is the point where it starts to go wrong\n\u2018Wintering\u2019: The best Christmas song released in the last\n15 years\n\u2018Human Too\u2019: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m an idiot, but maybe you are\ntoo\u201d\n\u2018About You\u2019: I am genuinely obsessed with About You by\nthe 1975, it changed the trajectory of my life - healed\nme in a way I cannot articulate, forever altering the\ncourse of my mind, ascends me to a higher realm. I am\nexperiencingexistenceonanelevatedplane.Thespiritual\nsuccessor to robbers. I am young and I feel divine.\n\u2018When We Are Together\u2019: Cows wearing sweaters. Oh,\nand the relationship is over now.\nMUNA by MUNA\nThey did it again, MUNA have once again\nknocked it out of the park with their latest\nalbum, MUNA. My first introduction to the\ntriplet (throuple sounds\nwrong in this context),\nwas with \u2018Saves The\nWorld\u2019, an exceptional album filled with\nmelancholy lyrics that\ntransform into pop\nmelodies. They have\ncontinued this trend\nwith their self-titled\nrelease, with each track\nbringing something special to the table. \u2018Silk Chiffon\u2019,\nthe first track on the album, is a fantastic start to the\nexperience, leading you in with soft vocals and a catchy\nhook. All this tied together with some groovy bass in\nthe background. The stage explodes in width at the\nchorus, with layered vocals and guitars. Each song follows the same basic formula, and yet brings something\nnew and memorable as well, leaving every song distinct\nfrom the others. Half of the songs on MUNA are horny\nand the other half are emotionally devastating. This is\npsychological warfare \u2013 couldn\u2019t recommend it more.\nMOSS by Maya Hawke\nThroughout Moss, Hawke\u2019s earnest, sincere\nlyricism interlocks the public and private,\noverlapping reality and fiction to reflect how she has had\nto negotiate both spaces in life. I couldn\u2019t do the album\njustice but here are my\nfavourite lyrics from\neach song of Moss (non-chorus):\n\u2018Backup plan\u2019: I wanna\nb\u0435 anything you\u2019ve\nlost that you might be\nlookin\u2019 for\n\u2018Bloomed into blue\u2019:\nPlease let me build\nsomething, please let\nme be. I have beliefs in\nmy brain, I\u2019m a bottomless sea\n\u2018Hiatus\u2019 : With a pour heavy, now you\u2019re home on hiatus.\nDoes she hold a candle to me?\n\u2018Sweet tooth\u2019: So my molar collapsed on me, like a glacier\nmelting in the heat. My mouth full up with lightning,\nI\u2019m an outlet shock, a hole, a need.\n\u2018Crazy kid\u2019: I wanted everything mine to be yours too,\nincluding the pain of losing you. I see you when I see\nyour blue\n\u2018Luna moth\u2019: But I didn\u2019t stick around, to watch you\nsmile at an ugly thing, to try to ease my guilt. Watch you\nlooking at a broken wing, like it could be rebuilt\n\u2018South Elroy\u2019: When you flutter by, took all the color\nout of my eyes. Used up all my vibrance on South Elroy\ndrive, when we fought and we fucked and we fought.\n\u2018Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019 - Th\u00e9r\u00e8se does not belong to you, The horses,\ncars, and cowboys do\n\u2018Sticky Little Words\u2019: Sorry\u2019s too slow to stop this crash,\nAnd leave me alone was just too fast\n\u2018Over\u2019: I want my mind fresh, even when my body\u2019s\nrotten. I want to know more than you have forgotten.\nI\u2019m not your flower, I\u2019m the pollen\n\u2018Restless Moon\u2019: A weakness is believing in my\nimagination of yours\n\u2018Driver\u2019: I miss you like the soft spot at the top of my\nbaby skull\u2019s rose, I miss you like my phon\u0435 tonight, I\nmiss you like my openness that clos\u0435d\n\u2018Mermaid Bar\u2019: Come for scallops, come to hear our\nsong, come if you\u2019re in awful, bad trouble, come if you\u2019re\ncertain you don\u2019t belong\nStick Season by Noah Kahan\nKahan said in an interview with Insider that\nstickseasonis\u201cthetimebetweenpeakfoliage\nand Halloween and the first snow \u2014 when\nall the leaves are off the trees. It\u2019s a time of\ntransition. And it\u2019s\nsuper depressing.\u201d\nMimicking this\nbleak time of the\nyear, the album is\nfull of transitions\nsurrounding leaving\nhome, growing up\nand getting help.\nKahan further\nhighlights the\ntransition from quarantine to semi-normal life as\n\u201cStick Season\u201d touches upon the inability to leave home\nduring COVID. Kahan calls this his love letter to New\nEngland. Most of the album is sung to Kahan\u2019s folksy\nguitar playing which adds that really cool rustic feel\nto the album, making it the perfect fall album. While\nI believe every song on the album is a masterpiece and\nlyrically captivating, when Noah Kahan said, \u201cand I\ndivvied up my anger into thirty separate parts, keep the\nbad shit in my liver, and the rest around my heart; I\u2019m\nstill angry at my parents for what their parents did to\nthem, but it\u2019s a start\u201d I felt that. I\u2019m a sucker for a Judas\nreference.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12\n\n"
