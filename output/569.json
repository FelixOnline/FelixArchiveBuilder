A prize of \u00a32 and two tickets to\nthe IC Choir Concert for the first correct\nsolution opened at noon on Tuesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nIt was going to happen sooner or later, and it\nhappened last week. As most solvers pointed out( and some did so more politely than others) I blundered, and last week's problem had three solutions:1 tuba player and5 percussionist s;2harp players and3 percussionists;1 piano soloist and4 percussionists. Sorry about that; I must have been harpist when I composed the puzzle. At least it should convinces c ep tics that Ido make these things up out of my own head, and don't just copy them from books of puzzles. Pondering over how to allocate the p rie, I decided to weight the draw, so that th os<> who found more solutions stood more chance of\nwinning. In the even t,R Grover, Physics1 is\nthis week's winner. IC Choir have followed the splendid\" example set by the Orchestra, and have donated two tickets to their concert next Friday to add to the cash prize. Many thanks. Finally, to solve next week's puzzle, you will\nnot need to be a proficient chessplayer. Ability to solve conventional chess problems won't help much either, and you certainly won't need a comprehensive knowledge of unusual mating positions. Nevertheless, next week's puzzle, while still maintaining the spirit of this column, will demand knowledge of the rules of chess. If\nthis news fills you with dismay, write and complain.

    "content": "Dear Sir\nHaving recently invested in new canoe equipment I thought it may have been a good idea to bring it down to relieve the strain on Club equipment. Now in the light of Miss S nee's recent activities, Iam seriously thinking against doing so as it may have been a set of my paddles that went missing. At present there is approaching \u00a3 1 , 0 0 0 worth of equipment not belonging to the Club, but to individuals within the Club stored in the Canoe Cellar, so the Deputy President could well have walked off with somebody else s personal equipment, without permission, and with the chance of seriously damaging it. This situation not only exists\nwithin the Canoe Club, but exists\nin many other clubs and therefore I feel that the Deputy President far exceeded her office. y ours faithfully\nT James Chem1 Dear Sir\nIt was disconcerting to read last week of our DP's irresponsible action with regard to her distribution of Canoe Club equipment. If she had bothered to consult the Club, the nI'ven o doubt that the C CU concerned would still have been able to borrow paddles for the raft race. However the particular paddles which she chose to lend out would not have been the ones \u2014 firstly, they were brand new and secondly, their unauthorised removal meant the loss of a valuable day's training for the Club's WhiteWater racing team, soon to take part in the British Universities' Championships for London University. As a member of Canoe Club, I obviously have more interest in this incident than the average IC person, however, I feel that it\ndoes raise an important question. Does the possession of Union Building keys give the DP, or indeed, any ICU official the right to distribute equipment in a Club's room as he or she sees fit?\nSurely, this is not the reason they have been given access to Union Building rooms. The control of club equipment of necessity belongs to that club in the person of its own elected officers. It is\ntherefore in the interest of the Union \u2014 particularly those of its\nmembers in clubs with equipment stored in the Union Building \u2014\nto remind Miss S nee of this and hopefully prevent the recurrence of such a misuse of power. Tours faithfully\nMark Benson Dear Sir\nAs a first year member of the IC Canoe Club I was appalled to\nlearn of the irresponsible activities of the Union Deputy President. IC Union cannot afford to have a Deputy President who behaves in this manner, and I hope that Miss S nee will in future conduct herself with restrain,, and endeavour to set a much better example. Tours faithfully\nM Hawes Me chEng1 Dear Sir\nI would like, briefly, to publicly apologise to Canoe Club for the inconvenience which I caused them last week. I borrowed the equipment in good faith, for people who I knew to be responsible for looking after it and while I admit I did not try as hard as I might have to find a Canoe Club member. This was due to my having only been asked on late Saturday afternoon, by RCS Union to borrow the equipment. Under normal circumstances I would, of course, have contacted them first, and certainly will in the unlikely event of a similar situation occurring in the future. Tours sincerely\nRachel S nee( Does RCSU, namely Rich Archer as\nPresident, intend to issue a similar\napology to the Canoe Club? Maybe one\nto Rachel too; for putting her on the\nspot due to their own lack of\norganisation - Ed.)\nDear Marshall\nAs last year's editor of The\nPhoenix, the Magazine of Imperial College Union, you may well believe that the burning questions: \"XViUThe Phoenix live up to its\nreputation?\" My fiery reply is undoubtedly Yes \u2014 but which reputation? Either, The Phoenix will disappear yet again \u2014 not through the inability of the students to express themselves, but rather through their reticence \u2014 or, it will rise, glorious once more, not only as a showcase for their literary and artistic talents, but also for example, as a permanent record of the exploits of our more illustrious societies. With only two weeks left before the official copy deadline, The\nPhoenix finds itself on the brink of the flame filled abyss trying to\nclimb out.'\nSean Gi bl in Editor, The Phoenix\nFounded in 1886 by HG Wells\nand still going strong!\nDear Sir\nAs you may know, I CW A has an unworkable constitution which it is incapable of changing, as it needs to get20% of its members to a meeting to do so.\nAlthough all the women of College are nominally members, most of them care so little for I CW A that they will not either come to a meeting, or leave I CW A officially, thus reducing the number needed for quorum. Because of this, the Society has not had a quo rate meeting for\nyears, and the many changes which they would like to have been made to their constitution have never been done, despite attempts to get Councilor aUG M to change it ( which is not possible). As the constitution is\nnot part of the byelaws, the only other way of changing it, is to delete I CW A from the byelaws. A motion to do this is going to the UG Mon Tuesday. I CW A would then be free to write a new constitution, and form a workable society. If I CW Amet in a common room, they would stand more chance of getting other people interested in their activities. There are very few interested in them now. Last Saturday, when they had a party, in spite of giving free entrance and free alcohol, they only attracted one hundred and fifty people \u2014 the minimum that can be expected for a free night's drinking. I CW A needs to become a lot less isolationist, become a society that people can join, so that they feel\nthat they are members, rather than not even realising that they are. Please come and support this motion, for IC WA's sake, to enable them to become a viable social society, rather than a helpless committee. Fiona Sinclair Maths3 Dear Sir\nI congratulate you on your editing. You made total nonsense of my letter on Teddy Taylor's talk in last week's FELIX. The CE GB does NOT believe nuclear power is more expensive than other options. Taylor believed the CE GB' s recent costings were unc hallen gable. This is untrue as two articles have recently been published in Nature disputing their calculations and highlighting their biased and simplified methodology. I hope this clarifies my previous letter. Tours faithfully\nSimon Pellew PG Environmental Technology Ed's Note\nThanks for your letter. The confusion\narose due to a line of your letter being\nmissed out during typesetting. Please\naccept my apologies and in future\ndouble space your letters and write\nneater.\nSir\nAt the bottom of page one of the1980 I CRag Mag there appears the sentence\" This publication is copyright of DS J ago\". On page three of the same publication there is a Hungarian Policeman joke, this joke also appears on page41 of the1980/1 Birmingham Rag Mag. Does Mr J ago intend to take legal action for breach of copyright? Howard Rudd Chem1 Our legal correspondent replies: No, as copyright has not been breached. The copyright by line quoted by Mr Rudd copyrights the Rag Mag as a collection, and protects( a) the originality of the collection( the particular selection and arrangement oi material) and( b) material which is obviously editorial in character, such as the editorial itself and notes and comments made by the editor. Individual items, including individual jokes, are therefore not copyright( the copyright to many of the cartoons belongs to the original artist; hence the individuals copyright by line by the cartoons).

Our first try was a magnificent solo effort by a mystery RCS\nwinger when he out sprinted the UC defence\nfrom the halfway line. Steve Bishop managed\nto poach a try from a scrum on the line,\nhowever both conversions were missed as\nwere a few penalties, making the half-time\nscore 8-4.\nEarly in the second half our outside half,\nClive, shocked us all by kicking a penalty. We\nwere even more shocked when they scored\na converted try a few minutes later.\nThis proved to be UC's last contribution to\nthe scoring, with Guilds proceeding to score\na further three tries, one of them converted.\nThe best of the tries was scored by Clive\nfollowing a dummy scissors move in the\nbacks, the other tries being scored by Bishop\nand that mystery RCS winger.\nFootball Seconds\nIC 2nds followed up their cup success on\nSaturday with an emphatic 7-0 victory over\nUC 3rds. A re-arranged midfield trio of\nWiggins, Veenman and Armstrong played\nwell, creating plenty of chances up front.\nParticularly encouraging was the performance\nof Wiggins, who linked effectively with\nSaunders on the left side of the field. It was\nSaunders who opened the scoring with a firmly hit drive from just inside the box. Soon\nafter, a goal mouth scramble allowed Wiggins\nto drive home his first goal for the 2nds. By half-time, IC's lead had been extended\nto 4-0 after a close range header from Carr\nand a well taken goal from the edge of the\narea by Veenman.\nSome early second half UC pressure was\neffectively dealt with and soon IC were back\nin control of the match. Carr continued his\nscoring success when his well-timed run left\nhim with only the keeper to beat. Veenman\nthen scored a similar goal to make the score\n6-0.\nSoon after, MacDonald was caught by a late challenge and sadly had to leave the field\nwith a badly swollen ankle. A firm tackle by\nLakin, then resulted in a UC penalty, which\nwas considerately shot wide of the IC goal. A good all-round performance was capped\nwhen Saunders first-time s who t found the net.\nTEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, MacDonald,\nLakin, Armstrong, Wiggins, Veenman,\nWalters, Carr, Saunders.\nJim Beer\nResults and Reports\nSaturday, Nov 22\nRugby\nI C1st XV v HAC622I C2 nd XV v Westfield430 Football\nI C1st XIv Park field15 IC3 rd XIv London Hos p20IC5 th XIv London Ho sp51 Hockey\nI C1st XIv U CH40IC2 nd XIv Staines HC03 IC3 rd XIv Thames Valley II 0-1\nFootball Thirds\nON an overcast Saturday afternoon, IC\nstarted confidently against a LH team who\nhad strengthened their defence at the\nprospect of meeting IC. After twenty minutes\nRimmer collected the ball forty yards out on\nthe right and beat four players before being\nhalf-tackled in the penalty area. He soon,\nregained possession and scored to finish a fine individual effort. The second goal\nfollowed when Wiggins, well out of position\non the right, passed to Esberger who slotted\nthe ball away confidently from just inside the\narea.\nEarly in the second half the Hospital\nrealised they had a shortage of patients and\nhad heard enough Scouse for one day.\nWiggins was duly removed from the pitch\nwith an injured wrist (and knee). The Hospital\nsoon regretted this move when they heard\nHealy approaching from the fifth team pitch.\nAlthough IC played for some time with ten\nmen, the defence played well and the LH\nattack rarely troubled goalkeeper Gilbert,\nwho made a confident third team debut. Late\nin the second half Saunders provided an\nexcellent example of IC Seconds finishing\npower when he headed high over the bar,\nwith only the keeper to beat.\nTEAM: Gilbert, Curran, Redmayne,\nDrabble, Gohil, Sims, Heady, Esberger,\nWiggins (Healy), Saunders, Rimmer.\nSailing\nON SATURDAY, the IC team were again at\nthe 'Harp' to sail a team from Southampton.\nThe wind was strong and this was possibly in\nSouthampton's favour, however their\nfamiliarity with strong coastal breezes did not\nstop them from retiring to the opposite end of\nthe reservoir to practice beating, thereby\ndelaying the start.\nConditions dictated that, just before the\nrace, the start must be altered and this was\nbadly communicated to the teams. Two\nSouthampton boats who had heard about the\nalteration thus created such a lead that IC\nwere virtually left to fight amongst itself for\nthe third, fourth, and fifth positions in which\nthe team eventually finished.\nThe second race was somewhat similar,\nwith Southampton again going off to practice\nbeating, and thereby annoying the home\nteam, and when the race finally started, IC\nsucceeded little better than in the first.\nWhile IC sailed badly and lacked experience\nthis should not detract from the victory of a strong Southampton team.\nTEAM: Murray, Kennedy, Chadwick,\nYounghusband, Redman, Mills.\nTennis\nTHE TWO FILMS, Wimbledon 1980 and How\nTo Win Holes By Influencing People will be\nshown in Mech Eng 542 at 12:45pm on\nDecember 2, 1980.

Recently, there have been one or two\nunfortunate incidents where senior members of\nuniversities at other places have contracted the\ndisease.\nThe latest information on anti-malarial tablets is\nbelow:\nAntimalarial Prophylaxis\nTropics and Sub-Tropics\nOf all the medical hazards that face the traveller,\nmalaria is the greatest. Attempts at eradication\nhave been quite unsuccessful. You are most\nunwise if you do not take anti malarial pills and\ntake them regularly in the state dose. There are\nvariations from area to area in the resistance of\nthe malaria parasites to various prophylactic\ntablets, but the following are as likely as any to be\neffective. Avoid taking other anti malarial tablets.\nAfrica - For Kenya\nTake Maloprim (Pyrimethamine and da psone). Take two tablets at least a week before going, and\nthen one tablet every Sunday and Wednesday,\nand continue for six weeks after you come home.\nFor the rest of Africa\nAt present, normally take Chlorquine. Take two\ntablets twice a week starting a week before you\ndepart, and continue for six weeks after you\ncome home. Some makers' names of Chloroquine\nare Avlochlor, Nivaquine, Arlen phosphate,\nResochin; Darachlor also contains pyr i meth amine and can be used.\nCentral and South America, Asia (including Asia\nMinor)\nTake Malorim (pyr i men th amine and da psone). Take two tablets at least a week before going, and\nthen one tablet every Sunday and Wednesday\nand continue for six weeks after you come home.\nFansidar\n(pyr i meth amine and sul fado x in e) Though initially active against falciparum malaria,\nis now no longer a reliable prophylactic e, particularly in the Far East. It should, therefore,\nnot be used. Paludrine, Daraprim and other\npreparations are not effective in many apr ts of th\nworld and should not be used.\nPreuenriue Measures\nIt is obviously important to avoid as far as\npossible being bitten by the mosquito. Adequate\nclothing should be worn; keeping the arms and\nknees covered is helpful. Insect repellants will keep\nmosquitoes away and are a useful adjunct. In\nadd it on, the old-fashioned mosquito net is coming\nback into its own, and can also play a part in\nprevention. If you are travelling to the tropics or\nsub-tropics, you are advised to consult with the\nCollege Health Service, or with your own doctor.\nIt is important to bear in mind that some of the\nprescribing literature which is being produced is,\nin fact, out of date \u2014 and you are advised to go by\nthe above regime. This has been recommended\nby the University Medical Officer at Oxf j rd who\nis an expert in this field.\nStudents From Overseas\nStudents returning to malarial areas after even a short period in the UK will have lost their\nimmunity. Therefore, they should take anti-malarial s of the specified type and dose. This is\nespecially important if they intend to return to this\ncountry, for example, after a holiday. Otherwise\nthey should take profesional advice in their own\ncountry about how long to continue with the anti-malarial s.

It's dropped a fair bit in the last few years.\nDo you tee any reason why the numbers have\ndropped?\nYes, it's a general downturn in business,\nevery university is suffering the same. Senate\nHouse have gone down by 30% of their\nbusiness and they don't rely so much on\nstudents.\nSo you think that students are eating a lot\nless?\nYes, when I first came here all the students\ncoming to College from various schools had\nbeen having school meals, and we used to\nsupply milk for them. We used to buy\nhundreds and hundreds of half-pint cartons,\nthen suddenly school milk stopped and now\nhardly anybody drinks milk in the mornings. I think a trend began with comprehensive and\ngrammar school students no longer taking\nschool meals, and now this trend has spread\nto us.\nI'd like you to outline your life so far. If as you\na ay In FELIX In May 19S S, your life as a cook\ndidn't atari on Joe'a Stall on the Mile End\nRoad, when did you take up catering?\nIn 1948.\n/ think you've been to sea at a cook?\nNot as a cook, no.\nHave you any cures tor seasickness?\nJust eat as much as you can.\nWhen I feel seasick I find It difficult to eat.\nYes, I know, but you want to eat as much as\nyou can, you'll find it tastes just as good\ncoming up as it does going down.\nHave you any particular memories of the\nSelsden Park Hotel or the St James Court\nHotel?\nWell, they were different worlds, of course.\nDid you enjoy your period at the Grand\nHotel?\nHarrogate? Very much. I enjoyed Harrogate.\nIt was a very nice area.\n/\u2022 It true you started your career at Imperial as\n\"Union Dietician In Chief?\nWell no, I started as Refectory Manager, and\nthat's still my title.\nDo you regret coming to Imperial?\nNot really. I 've enjoyed the years I 've been\nhere. I get ups and downs like anybody else,\nbut I have no regrets.\nSo you think It provides a good outlet for your\nabilities?\nI think so, and I think I 've worked at the job,\nand certainly I 've put as much as is humanly\npossible into it. I'm not always right, of\ncourse.\nHave you ever been confused with members\nof the Unification Church?\nNo.\nSo, If you were not what you are now, Is there\nanything else you'd rather be, maybe fulfilling\na childhood ambition?\nOh, something like Sir Francis Chichester.\nI'd like to move on to your hobble* and other\nactivities. What tort of music, art or film* do\nyou like?\nI very seldom see films, but I must confess to\nwatching the odd late-night cowboy on the\ntelevision.\nVictor Mooney: the most hated man at IC.\nSo that'* one of your favourite sort* ot\ntelevision programme?\nYes the late-night cowboy film, which is a distraction. My musical tastes are fairly low\nbrow I would have thought, just middle of\nthe road stuff.\nAre there any thing* that you really like or\ndislike?\nWell, I very much like sailing, and carpentry, I enjoy that side of my life quite a lot. I dislike\nsmoking, I don't like smoking at all, I find it a terrible habit. That's probably my main\ndislike.\nWhat newspapers do you read?\nThe Sunday Times mainly, Telegraph and the\nEvening Standard.\nDo you find they give a good balance of\nviews?\nYes, I think so. I disregard a lot of the\nTelegraph's views because they are like the\nother side of the coin, too biased to be\npresentable. You read a Communist paper\nand you get one side and you read the\nTelegraph and I suppose midway between\nthe two you get something right.\nA* an aside, how do you feel about abortion\non demand?\nAbortion on demand?\nYes.\nI don't know. I can see it happening, but it\nisn't the sort of thing I'm qualified to talk\nabout, I can see that, as an onlooker, it's going to happen, probably; in fact it does\nhappen in some places.\nWhat about sport, do you like watching\ncricket?\nI don't watch much cricket.\nDo you like watching rugby?\nOccasionally, but not too much of it. I like the\nNew Zealanders. Their game is tremendous.\nHow do you feel about team* playing In\nSouth Africa, do you think that'* right?\nI don't think so. I think it's almost a hypothetical question in as much as there has\nbeen nothing going there in the last few\nyears. I don't think unless you go there you\nare ever going to get them to break down the\nlaws that they have got. I mean they have\nbroken them down now, and I think the more\nthey insist on playing mixed teams, the more\nchance the other people have of coming\nthrough. And one story I used to like, and\nyou've probably heard it, is that the English\ncricket team used to love playing in South\nAfrica because all the blacks used to cheer\nthem on. They got more support there than\nthey did in their own country. It must be like\nthe West Indians at the Oval.\nWhilst we are on South Africa, how do you\nfeel about Aparteld In general, a* I think the\nUnion ha* discussed It In the past?\nOh, I think that it's a dying thing. It will die out\nlike all these things. It's already altered\naltogether now and I think that given time it\nwill go. Obviously, it's not going to be fast\nenough for the blacks and its going to be too\nfast for the whites some how or other, like\nRhodesia is coming round.\nSo you think It will be a good thing?\nI think it will eventually. I think its going to be\nquite a few years before the blacks are\neducated to the necessary standard because\nuntil that time there is bound to be a lot more\nviolence and unpleasantness.\nJust talking about the Union, how do you\nregard It not being part of the NUS?\nW9ll, they have been in and out more times\nthan I can remember. They keep on coming\nand going.\nDoe* It make much difference?\nI don't think it makes a lot of difference.\nDo you play much sport, like golf?\nNo, I used to play golf, but I find I don't get\nthe time.\nYou probably had a very low handicap.\nNo, my handicap was about twenty-four.\n/ shouldn't have thought there were many golf\nclubs around College?\nNo, I used to play on holiday mainly.\nYou said you have done a bit of tailing, how\ndo you feel abut the current t tate of Britain's Inland waterways?\nWell, they are coming up healthy, I think.\nThey're improving all the time.\n/ understand that you are a connoisseur of\nwine* . . . .\nWell, no I just enjoy wines.\nI 've a een a cabinet of wine* for tale In the\nSherfield Building, per hap t you could explain\nto t tude ntt If they can buy wine* from the\nCollege cellar* and how they would go about\nIt?\nYes, they can have any wine they like, six\nbottles and over, and they get a7V2% discount. I think you'll find that represents a great deal of value on some of the wines, on\nothers, it just brings them down to the off-licence price, but in general it does give a good deal.\nAnd they can have them for any reason?\nYes, anytime they want some, just give us a ring, or drop in, and we'll get them up for\nthem.\nOn the subject of food and drink, you must\nhave tatted a great variety of food, do you\nhave, tor Inttance, a favourite Ice cream?\nI like sorbets.\nDo you read FELIX?\nOh yes.\nDo you like It?\nI enjoy it. I have to accept that it is a student\nnewspaper, and when they write about me\nsometimes I feel tempted to reply. The last one\nwasn't too complimentary, but on the other\nhand, it's something that has to be written\namong yourselves and it's for your own\ntherefore I have to not so much ignore it, I Page 4 FEUX November 28, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union BEIT ARCH, 10:30. BE THERE!\nTHE CAMPAIGN In opposition to the student union financing\nproposals reaches Its climax today with a London\ndemonstration.\nThe ULU-organ l sed march starts this morning In Belvedere\nRoad (close to the offices of the Department of Education and\nScience) and takes a circuitous route to Hyde Park via Waterloo\nStation, Vauxhall Bridge, Pimlico, Victoria Station and Park\nLane. It Is expected to take four and a half hours. The IC\ncontingent leaves Belt Arch In Prince Consort Road at 10:30am this morning, although the means of transport Is as yet\nuncertain (Phil Cole hasn't told us).\nPie in the eye for Don!\nTHERE WAS UPROAR in last week's IC Orchestra re hersal when its conductor Donald M Q Monro, Warden of Weeks Hall\nand Senior Warden, was hit in the face by a shaving foam \"pie\".\nHe was not amused by this as his permission had not been\nobtained. As it appeared the event was performed by the\nGuilds \"Hit Squad\", he jokingly threatened to have Dave\nGayor, Guilds President, removed from hall unless he divulged\nthe identity of the culprit. He advised people not to do it again\nas he would be carrying a dagger and would have no hesitation\nin stabbing them.\nDonald\ndidn't duck!\nIt transpired afterwards that the hit had been unofficial, and\nGuilds were not responsible. Following this discovery, a series\nof mass-hits ensued. The entire BE2 group were hit during a lecture and on Thursday evening all of the Big Band musicians\nwere foamed, including Don Munro! A popular theory amongst\nBig Band members is that Dr Munro paid for the hit and'had\nhimself hit so as to lessen suspicion.\nWhether the week's events are connected in any way to a cheque stub made out to City & Guilds Union for \u00a36 in Dr\nMunro's cheque book is uncertain at the time of going to press.\nLast Tuesday evening, three\nFELIX reporters travelled to Male t Street for a press briefing at UL U on SU financing. The President of NUS, David Aaron ov itch, was due to address the London Students' Journalist Group, giving details of the march and background of the campaign. Representatives of many London student newspapers were present at the meeting, which had been arranged two weeks previously. On Monday, Mr Aaron ov itch found time to phone UL U and say that he was unable to attend since he had to leave London urgently(?), However, Ian Cox on( who is\nknown to theN US Student Journalist Conference as \" cocksucker\" and who poses as theN US Press and Publicity Officer) would turn up instead. This he failed to do( no apology has yet been received). Consequently, the London student press were left ignorant of the background to the demonstration and totally reliant on last week's Sennet\n( presently London Student) for the latest news( obviously at least a week old). The representative from the London College of FurnitureS U valiantly defended Aaron ov itch\" he' s a very busy man\". But Keir Hop ley, co editor of Beaver ( the LSE Union newspaper) summed up the feeling sol the meeting:\" with the march coming up, one of his foremost jobs is to in form the press\". Sparse\nCoverage\nIt appears that the student union financing question is The Big NUS Campaign of the Year. In recent years, the Grants Marches have been attended by fewer and fewer students, and attracted correspondingly sparser national press coverage. Th present recession means that any protest on the grants issue would be certain to have an unfavourable reception. It is\ndoubtful, though, whether the question o lSU subscriptions and college budgeting will motivate vast numbers of students to give up time to support a vague and general campaign. Despite such misgivings, the student movement has already won a significant victory. According to Sennet, Dr Rhodes, Boys on( undersecretary of state\nfor higher education) has been pressured to improve the proposed average capita tion lee from. \u00a332 to \u00a344 per student. Student unions, university governing bodies and local authorities had been united against the \u00a332\nproposal. No apathy\nhere!\nAaron ov itch warns:\" Unless clear guidelines on future levels of funding and guarantees of the independence of student unions are forthcoming from the government, the victory we have won on statistics could amount to nothing.\" So be there today; it could be the last big(?) NUS demo for quite a while \u2014 and as usual a huge number olI C students will march under the I CUban r( won't we:').\nNo 569 Friday, November 28,1980\n\n"

RSM Open\nDay\nTHE RS M OPEN DAY was conceived by the student academic societies last year who approached the Dean of RS Masking for all academic work to be cancelled for one day. To organise the event an ad hoc committee was set up comprising students, academics tall and technicians chaired by Peter Ba mlb rd. On the day almost400 students arrived and toured RS Min small groups accompanied by an undergraduate. Most of the students were taken for lunch at\n\" Mooney s\" or to the Union Bar. While this was happening the visiting schoolmasters met representatives of the RS M staff and company representatives. These companies had supplied the \u00a3 1 , 3 5 0 needed to print a booklet and communicate to the schools and had setup an exhibition in RS M that lasted over the weekend begin n ning Friday, November14. After the exhibition had been cleared away one company provided a buffets upper with drinks lor the Open Day Committee, RS M helpers and students. Peter Bamford, when interviewed, wished to thank all the unseen helpers involved and especially the companies whose generosity allowed the Open Day to take place since no Union funds were forthcoming. Of the members of Anti Apartheid Group who were distributing pro pog and a leaflets outside, Mr Bam l'o'rd said:\" these people were disrupting the very difficult problem of registering hundreds of visitors arriving within a lew\nminutes. Their coloured vision will see every event in political terms \u2014 look at the boorish and childish letters against the FELIX Editor this term. They never learn thai they bore the pants of IC students.\" Despite this small protest, the flay was an overwhelming success. Attack by\nBishop\nTHE SECOND of a series ol lectures organised by the Christian groups at IC was given by Colin Winter, Bishop of Namibia in Exile. He took a very forthright view of the situation calling SWAP O\" Their army of Libert ion\". He has said that South Africa is\nfighting a' total war' with Namibia and is prepared to spill the last\ndrop of Af rie a a ner blood in its\ndefence. He accused the West of tacitly supporting S A, especially the Multinational Corporations which resist sanctions at all costs.\nIt was his view that Christians in the West should attempt to bring about the implementation of the UN policy of fair elections since the only alternative is armed struggle. He hoped that all Christians would\" denounce apartheid as\nracism\" and actively support the Namibian s inside and outside Namibia. He then asked the130 or so people gathered in the Pip p ard Lecture Theatre to' empty their pockets' and he raised \u00a3 1 2 2 for the cause. Fascists\noutnumbered\nOn Sunday, November23, about a dozen people from Imperial College joined the counter demonstration to the British Movement's so called\" show of strength\". The Anti Nazi League march, with over2,500 people, went from West way Market to Marylebone station. Any confrontation was prevented at this point by the massive police presence surrounding the500 BM members, who just kept repeating\" zi eg heil\" with Nazi salutes. Jan Czernuszka\nVan to\ngo!\nTHE UNION has been attempting to sell one of its defunct vans, affectionately known as' the SGT'. Or at least it has tried, the van has been un advertised lor the last three weeks while the van has been undergoing repairs in anticipation of the MOT it will soon take. When questioned, Rae S nee was unsure when it would be sold but\" did not know\"how long it\nhad been lor sale and referred the FELIX reporter to Annie, the Union receptionist, who informed us that the van would be advertised when it had passed the MOT and expected that the van would fetch \u00a3 1 , 5 0 0 on the open market. Half price\nbeer!!!!!!!!!!!\nNEXT TUESDAY( December2) from7:()() pm, Stan's Bar will be offering1,000 pints of the new In d Coop e beer, John Bull bitter at 2 5 pap in t. Music, competitions and prizes will be provided by IC Radio. FEUX, November 14, 1980\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "always take notice of what it says, but I never\nhave replied to it, I think it is only fair that you\nare entitled to your point of view, and to voice\nit. I would rather they didn't use that sort of\nlanguage.\nSo you think It's been a bit harsh on you In the\npat t? Sometimes it has, but I think I 've had a fair\ncrack of the whip.\nI'd like to ask you about the cockroaches. Is It\ntrue burnt you said In 1970 that cockroaches\nwere basically clean harmless animals?\nIt was put to us by a biologist that they were\nnot dirty.\nBut do you agree with his view?\nNo. I don't like them. They come in, we can't do much about it, in packing cases, but we\nhave a cleaning contract with Rent-o kii who\nspray the premises weekly and in the bars, as\nwell. But they can't get rid of them in Linstead\nHall. Did you know that? Linstead Hall is infested upstairs where the students keep food,\nand they keep dropping down into our areas.\nDo you still assert then that the Savoy Hotel\nhas cockroaches?\nThey did have at the time, but I don't think\nthey have now.\nDo tiles still present a ma/or health hazard In\nthe kitchen?\nNo, I don't think so. We've got fly killers\nsituated at the main entrances.\nCan you reassure students that the cutlery\nlooks as It It has been badly washed, not\nbecause It has been badly washed, but\nbecause of the hard water In this area?\nBasically it's the hard water in the area.\nOccasionally, it is air dried and we get streaks\nif the water is not hot enough and in fact it is\na deposit of lime, it's not dirt. They are\nwashed as hy geni call y as possible.\nHow Is It then that the cutlery In the Royal\nCollege of Art has no scales on It?\nI don't know, because I haven't seen their\ncutlery. I think one reason that they can get\naway with a better standard than us, is the\nnumbers we do. It is a smaller unit. Possibly\nthey have got nicer staff or better staff and\nthey may have more modern machines for all\nI know. There could be a variety of reasons. I would accept that we should do as well as\nthem, we shouldn't make excuses. At the\nmoment we have a bit of a problem with the\nch lori fier outfit, and when that's back in it\nshouldn't be any worse than anything else.\nAre you satisfied with the way In which food\nIs transferred to Southside and Linstead\nkitchens?\nNo. There is a problem here in as much as\nwe are using frozen food in the transfers.\nThey should certainly be covered and sent\nacross in sealed containers. It shouldn't go on\na trolley because we have got a van now.\nBut It Is still taken from the van to the kitchens\nby the trolley.\nIn that case it should be covered.\nSo you Intend to do something about It?\nYes.\nDo you eat In the Refectories or Senior\nDining Rooms?\nI eat here in the office usually. I eat the same\nfood as yourselves.\nDo you enjoy It?\nYes I usually have something off the counter\nevery day usually a salad, because I will\nconfess, like everybody else in the catering\nbusiness, I have a weight problem.\nMaybe you could give students some advice\nas to where to eat outside college as I gather\nsome aren't particularly keen on the meals\nhere.\nWell, it depends on what sort of thing they\nwant to eat. If you go along to MacDonalds in\nKensington High Street you'll pay half as\nmuch again for the same dish, because we\nuse the same sort of burger, and same sort of\nbun as they use, all we do is don't put the\ndressing in the middle of it, and the chips, you\nprobably get twice as many chips for half the\nmoney. I 've been to the Hot Pot, it is\ncontinuously recommended to me.\nMr Riz Shaklr, Deputy President In 1975, said\nof your meals \"for the poor quality of food\nsuch high prices can only be described as\nunreasonable\". I suggest that many students\nwould have other words with which to\ndescribe your meals and prices. Do you think\nthat this criticism Is still valid today?\nNo, and it wasn't valid then. We were about\nhalf way down the league in University of\nLondon prices, and we still are. The difference is that we provide a longer and\nbigger service than any other college in\nLondon. No others stay open at weekends or\nevenings. The functions and social side of the\ncatering in this College is something that no\nothers even attempt. If we abolish this, and\nthe breakfast service, cut out weekends and\nevening meals we would be able to be\ncheaper, or at least not raise our prices with\ninflation.\n/ understand that the breakfast service may\nbe closed down?\nIt doesn't pay. It serves about thirty\nbreakfasts each morning.\n/ get the Impression that, as a whole the\nUnion Isn't particularly keen on you. You\nwere described In FELIX In 1973 In these\nterms: \"listening to his Union meeting\noffering It seemed hardly credible that he has\nany responsibilities towards Imperial College\ncatering at all\". Do you think the situation has\nchanged since then?\nWell, I don't remember the Union meeting\nconcerned. I 've been to a couple of meetings\nand I don't think that's true at all. I 've had a responsibility to IC ever since I took the job\non, and I 've given the best part of my life to it.\nCertainly, I 've done the job to the best of my\nability, and the staff have worked as hard as I have.\nDo you charge VAT?\nNot on student meals, but on staff meals.\nOn the subject of money: do you think that a reduction In the rate of growth In the money\nsupply Is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor a reduction In the rate of Inflation?\nI'm not convinced. I can't see a lot of sense in\nputting people out of work and paying them\nto do nothing. I can see that people.. just ask\nfor a rise. They think it's their right to have a rise every year. I was brought up in an age\nwhen you got a rise every five or ten years.\nDo you think that the Introduction of the\ncook-freeze system has been a success?\nLimited. Unfortunately it coincided with the\ndrop in business, so it's not been used to its\nfull potential.\nEarlier this term FELIX said: \"frozen food\nfrom the Sherfleld kitchens Is being kept In a normal ref rl d ger at or In Southside for a number of weeks before being served up In\nthe Refectory there. After this period of time,\nIt Is long thawed out and getting rotten\". Is\nthat the case?\nNo, definitely not.\nBut yourself and your assistant went over\nthere . . .\nYes, because they kept the lunchtime meals\nafter heating them up, through to the evening.\nThat is definitely wrong. In general the food\ngoes straight into the deep freeze and is\nstored there.\nIs It true that you said In 1967 In FELIX that If\na meal seems particularly bad It can always\nbe exchanged?\nYou are asked to give it back at the counter,\nand that's the best bet, because it can be\nlooked at, at the time\nBefore It Is payed for?\nNo, even if it has been started and there is\nsomething wrong with it, then bring it back.\nHow much of a portion must be left for an\nexchange to be acceptable?\nWell, we don't expect you to have eaten 90%\nand come back with 10%. If you feel there's some ting wrong with it \u2014 bring it back.\nThe catering has been described In FORWARD as a \"service which everyone agrees Is\ntotally Ineffective and Inefficient and\nproduces completely Indescribable and\nInedible meals\". This Is a fair and accurate\ndescription of the current situation. Do you\nagree?\nIs FORWARD a Conservative new spa pet? No, Liberal. ****\nNo, I don't agree. If you go on to read his\ncomplaints, I think it is mainly concerned with\nthere being no cups of tea or coffee.\nWhat are your main difficulties?\ni We have to provide a capacity service until\nChristmas and for half that number for the\nrest of the year.\nDo you think that the quality of the meals Is as\nhigh as It could be?\nIn general, yes. Certainly, there are odd\ndishes that we fall down on.\nWould you like to tell students which dishes\nyou fall down on, so they can avoid them?\nWell, my impression is that we fall down on\nsome dishes, but other people's tastes may be\ndifferent. For example, the baked minced\nbeef roll is extremely popular. It's a cheap\ndish, it's a tasty dish, and it's a filling dish.\nNow I would find that too much. In general\nthe meals are good value. If one dish one\nday doesn't come out alright, it doesn't mean\nwe've made a mess of everything.\nSo you think that students should look\nforward to eating here?\nI think they could. I'm not an exception; this\ngoes on all over the country. The same\nproblems arise in every other university. We\nget RCA and RCM students eating here. I know you may find that hard to believe and\nsome of the RCM students have said they\ndon't like the food there and would much\nrather eat here. I'm not saying we have a monopoly of good food, but certainly they\nhaven't any more than we have.\nI think our main fault at the moment is that\nmost of our premises are too big and too\ninstitutional looking.\nBut your main task Is to cater for IC students\nrather than RCM students, so do you have\nany future plans to Improve the catering here,\nor are you content to leave It In the disgusting\nstate that many feel It has degenerated Into\nsince you came here?\nI disagree. I don't think it has degenerated\ninto a disgusting state. I'm unhappy about the\nUnion. The manager ess resigned and now we\nhave no manager ess. As far as the Union is\nconcerned the food there is as good as it has\never been, and over the last couple of years it\nhas enjoyed a very good reputation.\nWe are looking all the time for improve-ment s. We've changed Southside twice in the\nlast four years, and we may change it again in\nanother two or three months. We don't rest,\nwe try to change with the times. The problem\nis there is no money to make it look as if we're\nchanged. I think you've got to appreciate\nthere is no money now left in the College to\ndo anything. Southside Refectory is a giant, it\nis far too big for it's purpose. It is impersonal,\nit gives the impression that nobody is around.\nUnless it's busy, it looks almost like an\naircraft hanger. Until we can alter that, I think\npeople will say that the food isn't good.\nAre you suggesting that the size of the\nbuilding affects the quality of the food?\nNo. I'm suggesting that the surroundings you\neat in affect what you think of the food. If not,\nwhy do restaurants and brewers spend so\nmuch on decor? It does enhance it, it's like\nalcohol served with a meal.\nThank you very much tor your frank\nInterview. I 'll have to go, I'm having lunch at\nthe RCA, would you like to come?\nNo thanks, but I think that the chairman of\nthe Refectories Committee eats there\nsometimes.\nFEUX November 28, 1980 Page 7\n\n"
