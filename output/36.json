    "content": "2 FELIX\nPROFILE WAIXY GOSS The light of day first illuminated the saturnine countenance of Walter P. Goss on the eleventh day of June in the year1927 in the historic seaport and market town of Great Yarmouth; from which he has of tl mes strayed to various parts of the world in an effort to overcome his Norfolk accent and its fishy smell. His early education was obtained at the Great Yarmouth Grammar School which he left in1946, when it was felt that nothing more could be achieved, to undertake his National Service obligations in the R.A.F. as a radar instructor. On completing this duty he came to the R.C.S. in order to read Physics. In common with many illustrious forbears who elected to serve their fellow students rather than the fickle whims of examiners, Wally' s academic career has been somewhat chequered and this year has found him engaged in the manufacture of afternoon tea and ah extra million magnifying double power gas microscope somewhere in the inner recesses of the Guilds. Turning now to the extra mural( or outdoor) aspect of hi8 career we find that at a nearly age he was\nforced by illness to refrain from any form of violent exercise for several years, during which time he familiaris ed himself with the rules, aims and ideas of many games and spent his leisure time organising and not participating. It is quite natural therefore, though unique, that Wally should rise in College athletic circles from secretary of the SoccerClub(194950) and official cricket umpire, by way of secretary of the Athletic Clubs Committee(195051), to be this year's chairman of\"\nthe A.C. C.OB JETS D'ART Dear Sir, The successful Annual Exhibition of the Photographic Society has reminded me that a large proportion of the student community is not fully aware of everything that happens in the Union. Admittedly the activities of College Departments, and most of the clubs and societies can be inspected by the inquisitive; but one important student activity is rarely seen by the majority of members of this Union.1 refer, of course, to the collection and display of\" trophies\". Would it not be possible for the clubs and societies who have snaffled bus stops, B elisha beacons, zebra crossings, red lamps, etc., to arrange for the exhibition of these articles? Yours etc. J.N. P.G. The Chairman, Entertainments Committee, states that he is familiar with the whereabouts of some of these trophies \u2014 sufficient to form the nucleus of an exhibition. In response to the request of J.N. P.G. he is willing to arrange a display upon a suitable occasion. He hopes that\" owners\" of interesting specimens will be prepared to loan them for exhibition. His associations are not however confined to college affairs, for in University circles he is well known as a soccer referee of some standing and in the last three years has been successively Publicity. Secretary,, Honorary Secretary and Honorary Fixture Secretary of the University Soccer Team. Next season he is to be Hon. Secretary again. Last Summer Vacation Wally jointly organised and chaperoned the U.L. A.T. C.on their globe trotting tour to Kenya, being officially appointed as wine taster and coconut gatherer. A story has it that whilst refereeing a game\nout there he was overcome by the local atmosphere and fell, injuring his knee, to the derision of his teammates, and returned home the only casual tHis seemingly endless capacity for responsibility( he is also on the HostelS election Committee) seldom seems to impair his enjoyment of life, although he does not suffer fools gladly, for on very few social occasions is he conspicuous by his absence. His likes include beer, blondes, brunettes( redheads he has use for but no time) and big parties; his dislikes fanatics. OUR. ONLY ADMIRER The St erwin Williams Co.,601, Canal Road, N.W.

Dear Sir, Hay Is often your heart by saying that my\nsojourn in this heathen country has been made more\ntolerable by the frequent appearance of Felix, dutifully forwarded by my brother? I was inspired, to the point of writing this letter, by Caveman's contribution to Viewpoint in the13 th Feb. issue.

    "content": "FELIX SQUASH For the Squash C luo this hag been principally a season of consolidation of the remarkable progress made the year before. The Courts were cleaned and the lights raised, and if the tendency of the roof to leak could be cured( as it must be, to preserve the now irreplaceable maple floors), they would be among the best in London; the fixture list was\npruned and added to, and gave usa full season of enjoyable matches in which we broke just over even s; and the number of members was a record, which may be\nl attributed to the increasing popularity of the game, a keen and energetic Hon. Treasurer, and an improvement in general standards of honesty on only one\noccasion was a court booked in the name of Albert Hall, and this seemed such an appropriate name for the person concerned( except that the Hall has no\nlarge' t ash) that it would have been churlish to cavil. One of the most encouraging features of the season was the success and keenness of the second team, for which there proved to te so much talent that there was seldom much difference between the first and fifth players, and the ladder again proved most valuable in selecting the team. In the U.L.3 aside tournament we were beaten in the second round by Westminster Hospital, having beaten Wye College21 in the l st round. There was no very good reason for this defeat, for all3 players were beaten by men whom they could have beaten had they been on form, but that is the way in squash, and in any case we should next have met the very strong St. Mary's Hospital team that won the Cup. The Whiteley Cup was won for the fifth time in succession by J. Kenyon, who returned to the Club in January. Thirty players entered, of whom four were seeded, but unfortunately the Mo.2 see d,A.R. Wane r, had to withdraw( having left the College so that E.M. Hughes, seeded No.4, reached the final. The best match was the semifinal between Kenyon and M.D. Martin, which Kenyon won in three Close games lasting nearly fifty minutes, in which Martin produced a prodigious effort. The final was\npoor by comparison, Hughes starting very badly and losing the first two games cheaply. He then rallied and won the next97, but the effort proved too much, and Kenyon was able to romp home in the next game to win the Cup yet again. The analysis of match and individual results will be put on time noticeboard; the only comment\nwe should like to make here, is that Martin and Hughes are to be congratulated on having played in every match this season, and upon their full colours. GOLF I.C. kept their unbeaten record by beating Barts at Ful well by JJ lj. \u00a5.ax Friedl, playing No.2, shota75 one over par and won his match8 and7, the year's biggest win. A.R.M c Kech nie holed out in one at the fifth hole the first I.C. player to do so In an inter college match. He went on to win by J up and2 to play, thus keeping his record of not losing a match while representing the College. Earlier this year, I.C. beat University College, University College Hospital and Barts,( away) and drew with University College( away) and St. Mary's Hospital. On April21 stR. Heenan won the I.C. President's Cup a tWo rp les don, with K. Glover,( holder) second and M. Friedl third. So far, five members have been chosen to represent the University first team, and five members for the University second team. UL HOCKEY At a general meeting of the University of London Hockey Club on Friday, May 9 th, the following I.C. members were elected to office for the19523 Season. President: As st. Prof. a. Stephenson, O.B.E. VicePresident: E.C. Green. Captain: G.G ll let t.H on. Secretary: H.I. Hayes. ROWING At Putney Regatta, last Saturday, I. C.B.C. were well represented by 3 Tills,2 scull ers and a pair. Though the weather was good, the water was bad until late in the after noon.\nIn the first race of the day, R.G. Seaman won his heat\nof the Junior Sculls by a \u00a3 lengths. In the final he scored\nI.C.'s only win, by beating E.P. Wado easily. In his heat of the Junior Senior Sculls, G.W. Benson\nwas beaten by W. Blue, who was only j \u00bb t beaten in the final of this event. The 2nd VIII rowing in the Junior Senior VII Is started slowly, and kept their rating too low and were beaten by\nVestaR. C. The * lh. VIII rowing in the Beverly Tills( for clinker boats) were beaten by a very fast Thames R.C. crew, who\nlater won the final. After the interval, during which the tide turned, the I.C.p air, JF.P. Gibson and I.M.T iche ner, lost by2 ft. to Lansbury\nafter a very close race. The next race was the first heat of the Junior Tills in which the3 rdT in were beaten by about $ length by an Ibis crew, in very bad water. Though it was not a resoundingly successful day for I. C.rowing, the crews should not be disheartened by these results in their first regatta of the season.\nUL CHAMPIONSHIPS On Saturday, May 1 0 th, at Hotspur Park, I.C. were ba at an, by Kings by119 points to72 points. Middlesex Hospital with45 points, were third. In the steeplechase Pain and Gar rod were let and 2 nd. After a close race in the440. yards, Watts and Williams gained\nl st and 2ndp lao es. Richard won the High Jump at 6 * 0 \" but failed an attempt at the University Record of6'2\". In the3 mile, Garrod was 4th and Pain5 th.3 rd and 5 th places in the Pole Vault were taken by Davies and Goldhawk respectively. The high li rh t of the meeting was G.

WOMENS ATHLETICS \u00bb In the U.L. Athletic Championships last week the I.C.. Women's Team scored a total of 15 points. 'Vhile this was\nnot sufficient to place I.C. among the first3 colleges in the competitions for either the Challenge Cup or the\" Factor Cup\", the performance of the team was most encouraging and\nholds out great hopes for the future as only one member of.\nthe team will not be available next year. As organiser of the team I would like to thank all those members of I.C. W.S.C. who spent so much time practising even though their chances\nof success appeared slender.

    "content": "FELIX\nRIDER HAGGARD Noticing the frenzied efforts to start, and the haggard faces of the owners of the numerous motor cy les in I.C., we felt deeply moved. Accordingly, we asked our Expert to list us Some\nCommon Mechanical Faults, their Courses and Remedies. The following list is the result':1. On depressing kick starter you are propelled smartly over the handlebars. Remedy; retard the ignition. If ignition is fixed, stand behind the machine and get some one else to start for you.2. Engine starts, but on releasing clutch machine moves off backwards. Remedy; takeout a licence to cover a vehicle equipped with means for reversing.3. While proceeding at a steady pace a sudden ripping sound is followed by aloud whirr descending in pitch as machine comes to a grinding halt. Cause: belt of raincoat caught in rear wheel. Remedy: use string.4. After riding hard for some -time with a passenger behind, engine suddenly shows remarkable increase of power. Cause: pillion passenger dropped off. Remedy: get a new one.5. After running for some time along a. lumpy road engine stops firing. Cause: magnets worked. loose and fallen off. Remedy: buy a sidecar. A man I met in France always used a sidecar, with a girl in it. The girl had a large spanner and tightened up all the nuts within reach as they went along. Of course, everything on the offside used. to falloff sooner or later but then, you can't have everything.6. Rear of machine seems unnaturally low, and on stopping, a deep trench is noticed in the joad behind you. Cause: no back wheel. Remedy: remove|\ntop of tank with tin opener and use as wheelbarrow.7. Riding in the rain you notice a succession of sharp shooting pains in the right leg. Cause: high tension cable wet. Remedy: wear rubber boots. Tingling sensation continues. Cause: pins and needles. Remedy: massage.8. You set off on a pitch black night. Machine refuses to lie over o or rect lyon bends; there is no performance, and the brakes don't seem\nto work. Cause: you have got into a car by mistake. the. \u2022 famous musical en berta in ers DOBSON\nAND YOUNG\nin the council room c+g on monday, may26 at5.15. PARTY POLITICS This term has seen an increase in political activity a tI.C. The Conservatives, are holding weekly discussions on Thursdays, in addition to the debate reported in the last Felix. A report on the more important of these will be given in Felix. The entire Liberal Group went to the talk given by Major Grim on dat University College on8 th May to the University of London Liberal Federation. The most important item was the talk given by Dr. Thomas on\" Marxism and Christ\" to the Socialist Group on Friday9 th May . Dr. Thomas, the Vicar of the Ascension Church, Balham, commenced by saying theIr on Curtain was not difficult to cross and that) he had done so several times, on oe in a Russian Ambassador's car. He said that although born a Liberal C once rv at ive he had changed his views to those of a Socialist because Life did not consist of Theory or Doctor in e alone. He pointed out that in Religion one must combine Theory with Practice. The Il arx iste, who are true Socialists, do this. The Marxists were the only true Socialists because they planned and priced according to the need. Answering a question he said that the State in the U.3.S. R. had nothing to do with the Church but that all religions were permitted. Mathematical Fun c tio a x one of those things that happen in maths if you are advanced enough.

GUILDS MOTOR RALLY The Rally was held at the Two Brewers, Northaw\nnear Hatfield, on Saturday,4 th May, The first to arrive was David Allen who was found peering gloomily out of the saloon bar from behind a pork loaf sandwich.\nAll the contestants arrived in good time, except for one person who on enquiring what pub he had stopped at was told by the hooting rabble that it wa3a beer pub.\nA successful retreat was beaten on finding it to be the Sun.\" A working knowledge of map-reading was essential since all the places were identified by grid references. On finding the. position, questions about the district had to be answered,and after finding all the references the two controls had to be reached in a set tine. The\nwinner was he with the lowest score, points being given for late arrival at controls and for every second slower\nthan the fastest time in the special tests. At one\npoint in the first section great assistance was given by two young lovelies who stood by the road waiting to gij-e all the answers. At the first control the two\ntests were: a standing start to roach a balanced pole touch it and stop , the other a Le Mans start. For this, drivers om ly competed, running25 yards to their oars, starting them, and driving them another. 25 jsa rds to finish. The M.G.' s made the fastest times in this. Boanerges came down as an on) starter, having made\ngood speed from South Kensington with one stop to allow a tight big end to cool, arriving just after the last competitor had left. Unfortunately he perished in the pouring rain at the last control with a snapped valve stem.\nDuring the tea,M ike Day, who organised the Rally worked out the results, and at the end presented some\nvery lavish prizes. The awards were as follows: P.M. Ellis Austin8 King'3 College G. Kahan Hillman C&G Miss B.M. Shot terM. G.T. A.P.R. Thicket t Austin7 C&G. Special mention should be made of the amazing\nperformances of some of the Austin7' s,w hi oh suffered a considerable disadvantage, particularly in the special tests. Boanerges was towed in from the last control, and\nthen had to be left at the \"Two Brewers\" pending manufacture of a new valve. Any volunteers would be gratefully taken on for help in an very necessary overhaul. The\nthanks of the Club and the Competitors are extended to Mike Day and all those who marshalled and otherwise contributed to make the day the success it was.\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 Phoenix\" of Spring1951 carried an article on the Biological Field station of the College which gave most of the important facts in its development as a field station. The purpose of the present contribution is to bring to the notice of readers of FELIX something of the setting of Sil wood Park as they may expect to find it, either as residents if their zoological studies take them there, or as migrants if they succumb to the Call of Culture in the shape of the Rector's' Touchstone' weekend discussion groups held there from time to time. \u2022 Sil wood,\" acquired in1947, primarily as a result of the efforts of its present Director, Professor Munro, is ideally suited to its purpose of providing facilities for the study of biological problems both in the field and in the laboratory. Much more thant& is, however, needs to be said if the true north of the station to the collage is to be s^^g g'^ime to tL me students are moved to write to the Editor letters deploring the absence of the residential facilities which seem to them to' make college life'. Part of Sil wood's function has been to offer just those facilities to a necessarily limited number of i. e.scu a enos. il it> per nap o inevitable that most pf the members of the College should scarcely have heard of the Field Station, but atleast it can be said that the opportunity to make\nits acquaintance occurs for everyone to whom the' Touchstone' project offers an additional attraction.S il wood, with its sister mansion, As hurst Lodge,s its in a hundred acres of parkland: grassy slopes for the most part, but with woods and marshes, and a little stream which trickles through to Sil wood Lake. Formal gardens are maintained in flower for the greater part of the year, and the delightful Japanese Garden, with its tiny lake, surrounded by rhododendrons, Japanese maples and bamboos, has suffered only from the loss of the pagoda like shelter that used to provide a shady retreat until its age made it unsafe. Windsor Great Park is within ten minutes' stroll of the Field Station, and the surrounding countryside is as beautiful as any within easy reach of London. Sil wood Park is an ast.et to the college and its beauty deserves appreciation. H ARLINGTON NEWS FLASH I. C.W. A. held another tea on Tuesday,6 th Hay. Miss Penelope Grant told members of some of the differences between Great Britain and South Africa, her home country, and how these might strike an immigrant.

Union on Thursday,8 th May, the motion:\" That the Morphy Day Rag be sent to Salvage* was passed by83 votes to37 with5 abstentions. It was argued that Morphy Day was for boat racing not ragging; that the raghad in recent years declined in s ponta niet y, enjoyment and sportsmanship, and consequently support for it had also declined. The R.C.S. Union felt no longer in cli in ed to engage in this ritual tussle with its friends in Guilds. The opposition appealed to tradition, and while agreeing that the Morphy Rag was not at present satisfactory, held that it should be improved rather than abolished. Without an organised rag, disorganised rags would spring up a Morphy Day would fade altogether as a Saint Day and Feast Day, and college j ha if holiday. JI J \u00ab I JK1! \u00bb J The Morphy Cup was presented at the end of the l st World War by the family of a member of the Boat Club, to rouse interest in the club, which was at that time flogging. The Morphy Rag, which would have been30 years old this year, arose spontaneously among\nB\"at Club supporters, and only since the2 nd World War became stereotyped into the scrum for the drum. The Rag has withered in the winter of public opinion about student privilege. It is no longer possible to dismantle the\" buses hired to carry reinforcements to Putney or to empty bags of soot and tomatoes over policemen on point duty, or achieve a photograph in the\" Mirror\" of a Bobby being ducked in the Thames; not without a lot of\" tut tutti ng\" from the welfare state on te ie touch line..

The standard was considerably above that of last year; the judge, Mr. C.O.Ste in book, A. R.P.S., stated that it was a good deal higher than he had\nexpected for a College Society. He remarked that, in his opinion, some of the p rise winning prints were of the standard of\nthe major London exhibitions. The Pictorial seCtion, the most numerous, contained many\nfine prints. By comparison, the Technical and Record, and\nPortraiture sections were almost poor. Many of the outstanding prints were by Dr.E. Gla is ter, who made a very fine gesture in returning his pri ies to the Society. \u2022\nThe response in both the. colour transparency and lantern slide sections caught the Committee by surprise; the arrangements for exhibiting these sections were inadequate both as\nregards the number of entries which oo ul d be exhibited, and\ntheir presentation. The response to the\" College Activities\" section was disappointing. In all, the Exhibition was a success, and all the exhibitors should be congratulated. It is to be hoped that the standard can be maintained in the coming years. INTER VARSITY DEBATE A successful venture into a new field was made\nby the U.L. U. Debates Committee in holding a debate entirely in French. The principal guests were from Paris university with other platforms pea ice rs from Reading University and Richmond College, U.L. The predominantly female audience( of about80) produced a standard of speaking atleast as high as that normally heard in aU.L. U. debate in English. BEDFORD DEBATE EVERY EXPERIENCE IS OF VALUE As was observed by Tony Peacock, more in jest than in earnest, the fairer sex lack a logical approach to matters of the mind and tend rather to assault one's senses by an appeal to the heart and the innate goodness inherent in every male's breast. However, it was most pleasant to listen to the seductive pleas of redheaded Elizabeth Bruno as she proposed the motion deftly concealed amid quotations and pictures of the brave, whose life had been so enriched by their experiences and anyway of course experience is valuable it makes such nice people. In reply, Mr. Peacock battered us with Marxist, absolute Idealist sophist and what have you values. all far too near the point and cogently made for pleasant debate but his main defence lay in a few examples of experience being of no value. It was all so much happier when Monica Huber, from up north, gave a nonstop, but very he arable, recitation of anecdotes having little to do with the matter. Gallantly rising to the occasion in his best pedantic parliamentary manner, Brian Wyatt launched a pooh pooh campaign upon the ladies present and the subject of debate. This was well received by all present and warmly applauded. The contributions from the floor were of a varied nature, some attempted to deal with the subject, until selby Angus said that this was his third debate on values, and in one of the previous ones he had reached the conclusion that a thing is of value if it enlarges experience. The subject being dead a lively Jack in the box discussion arose as to the best way to treat hangovers. On this motion the ladles were defeated by22 t o21f votes, mainly due to the block voting of the\" solid south\" or. the members of I.C. who had only come for the experience to be gained. With the normal courtesies a buffet refresh ment was provide d.I.C. hogging in one corner and Bedford in the other, with a rapid interplay of empty plates. This soon broke up into a dance where Bedford showed that much valuable experience( non character building) was to be\ngained.

This due in no small measure to lack of readers. It is not suggested that you who have been robbed of three pence for the privilege of owning issue No.36 of FELIX have not shown your interest and supported in the endeavours of your college; but th s chap who is reading this over your shoulder, criticising most violently everything with which he is at variance, and\ndrawing your lecturers attention to your lack of interest in the pearls of knowledge falling from his lips, he can hardly be classed as a saviour of the sinking. Fireproof or not, please help to keep PHOENIX off the rooks. One of the days when everyone in. I.C., professor and\ntutor, fresher and failure, is able to gather together for a few hours, to join in a common re lex ation from the pressing cares of Kensington is Sports Day. No other day is quite so\ninformal nor so pleasant as sitting quietly in the sun, tankard in hand, admiring the prowess of others for more energetic in their re ore ation, Guilds begin favourites with an imposing lead built up\nfrom the tu go' war and 3 mile track rao e held last term and\nshould manage to retain this lead in face of keen opposition expected from the R.C.S.

No\nexperience is necessary but the need of an opportunity to learn to write is a good qualification. Articles, letters, reviews are especially welcome from\ncontributors who have not the time for the routine of the Board.

You may now fill up the space at the foot of Page\n1 in FELIX No.16.... and the best of lu ek too.

Let us supply some air. For sixty years\" Phoenix\" paid his way, till at the end of the war he was forced to move in the ever decreasing circles of an inflationary spiral and finally entered a state of bankruptcy. When his savings were exhausted three years ago he was swiftly\" union is ed*', and in return for his subsidy, requested to produce the annual\" Review\" of the Union. The more obvious functions of\" Phoenix\" are to please the reader, support the writer, reflect the thought and record the doings of I.C. Between the millstones of the\" Review\" and the\" Liberal Outlook Crusade\" the last two functions are ground exceeding small. The first two functions sometimes seem irreconcilable, and in any case noone ever pleases everyone, except Jonathan Staggers. But there is another and most important function of\" t Phoenix\": that of flying the I.C. standard at other sordid Institutions of Higher Learning, Incredible as it may seem,\" Phoenix\" cuts something of a dash in this direction articles from him have in recent terms been commented on and reprinted by other colleges, for example Q.M. C, With a touch of prestige of pedigree and a very fair reputation for both form and content,\" Phoenix\" compares well with the best and is a darned sight better than most other student magazines. What about\" Phoenix' s\" difficulties? Granting that\" Phoenix\" may be an investment outside I.C. and that cheese paring on illustrations and format are not likely to improve him for home consumption, we are left with: dropping the price and raising the subsidy, WRITING more for him and BUYING more of him. And left to last for emphasis, it should be said that giving birth to\" Phoenix\" involves a ghastly labour. The Editor and Advertising Manager in particular are Stakhanovites, and they deserve our CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.\" Phoenix\" and\" Felix\" obviously depend in the end onus; but then of course it's well known that you and I are fireproof.

LEISURE What is this life, if, full of work We have no time to stand and shirk? No time to pause In College life And take a rest from toil and strife? No time to take a holiday, No time to dance the hours away, No time to stop to steal a kiss Or contemplate some future bliss? No time to stroll around the park, Or play a game, or have a lark?
