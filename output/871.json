    "content": "Appealing?\nDear Mr Smedley,\nThank you for the coverage of UCL affairs in recent\nissues of FELIX. It would be better however if you\nused more competent foreign affairs correspondents\nin Bloomsbury and thus avoided a degree of\ninaccuracy and misinformation which resulted in\narticles falling well short of your customary journalistic\nquality.\nThe facts about building developments on the UCL\nsite are as follows:\n1. There is no planned sale of land to anybody.\n2. UCL has been very successful in persuading the\nMedical Research Council and the Eisai Company to\nconsider providing two new buildings for research in\nmolecular and cell biology.\n3. The sites of these buildings are currently occupied\nby an assembly of old buildings and used for various\npurposes, including some UCL Union activities.\n4.1 have initiated a detailed study of how best to re-provide-and hopefully in some cases to improve\non\u2014those facilities which will be lost.\n5. We are also preparing plans for a new Union\nbuilding.\nOn the latter point, we shall need to raise several\nmillion pounds. In the light of the interest of FELIX\u2014\nshared by your readers I trust-in the welfare of UCL\nstudents, I hope I can rely on your help when we start\nthe fund-raising campaign.\nYours sincerely,\nDrDH Roberts, Provost, University College London.\nUCLU talks\nDear Sir,\nThank you for your interest and support during the\nrecent discussion of UCL Union facilities to be lost as\na result of new investment in UCL.\nIn reply to your article in Issue 868 (Friday May 11),\nwe feel an update is in order. Two of the UCL\nsabbatical officers met with Dr Roberts the Provost,\non Wednesday May 16 to discuss proposals to\nremove the Gym, Garage and Theatre Workshop. As\na result of this meeting, during which the Union was\nable to put forward some positive proposals for the\nreplacement of these vital facilities, the student body\nat UCL is much happier.\nThe Provost has expressed commitment to the\nreplacement and amelioration of Union facilities in\ngeneral. However, this is dependent upon the\ncompletion of contracts with the company, Eisai,\nwhich will be encouraged to support student activities\nby providing funding and space for the Union in the\nnew building. Short-term accommodation of societies\nwhich use the threatened space at the moment will\nbe paid for by the college and a new Union building,\nthe object of a thirty-year long campaign, could be\nforthcoming if other negotiations go according to plan.\nThus it appears that some of the fears of the\nstudents have been allayed. However, the Medical\nResearch Council contract, due to be signed in the\nnext week or so is the one which will crush our space\nand no money is forthcoming until the clinching of the\ndeal with Eisai, due to take place in June. Pressure\nmust be kept up to make sure students do not lose\nout even though the present outlook is reasonably\ngood.\nWe will keep you informed of new developments.\nYours faithfully,\nHelen Newens,\nExternal Affairs and Welfare Officer, UCL Union.\nNightline fresh\nfor ULU\nDear Dave,\nI was glad to read in 'President's Report' that Neil\nMcCluskey now agrees with me, that ULU is the right\nsolution for a permanent home for Nightline. The\napproach to ULU is of course a matter for the\nPresident-ULU is run by the student body and not\nby Senate.\nWhen I discussed the matter with Neil, I offered to\nseek support from the other Colleges. I was able to\nraise the matter with the Principals of King's College,\nRHBNC, LSE and the Provost of UCL. They were all\nagreed that ULU, by virtue of its central role, was\nclearly the most appropriate location for Nightline;\nthey will support this solution to the problem.\nNightline serves an important role in the University.\nThis College, in conjunction with the others, will\ncontinue to provide the financial support required to\nenable it to fulfil its function.\nYours sincerely,\nEric Ash.\nSue you too\n(Jimmy)\nDear Dave,\nI write to thank you for your praise of me in last\nweek's editorial. It is entirely undeserved as you would\nfind out if you bothered to use your 'journalistic'\ncapabilities. What is also entirely undeserved, unjust\nand downright ludicrous are your criticisms of Miss\nFiona Nicholas, Union Honorary Secretary (Events).\nEither you have a very short memory or your\nsources have no brains. During the Autumn Term\nFiona was around every single weekend administering\nevents and organising security for nearly all of those\nweekends. The Spring Term was almost the same.\nUnfortunately Fiona with all her work had caused\nherself to be physically ill. Even this though only\nprevented her from being around for a few weekends.\nThe Summer Term is traditionally quieter for the\nHon Sec. Fiona justly deserves shorter hours. Yet even\nnow, if you'd bothered to find out, Fiona is working\nhard on room bookings for the Summer, drafting\namendments to job descriptions, tightening up the\nlegal i ties of operating events and generally preparing\nthe way ahead for next year's Hon Sec. Organisation\nand toward planning are top of the list with Fiona,\ncertainly more so than other sabbaticals (myself\ndefinitely included), so maybe this allows her to\norganise a day, in a day. Fiona was the first person\nto offer me help when I started floundering!\nYour criticisms of Fiona are maybe centred around\nFiona's lack of reports to UGMs, FELIX and Council.\nPerhaps Fiona has decided to save the rain forests\nsince no one seems to take a blind bit of notice of\nwhat she does do. This has certainly been the case\nin the past as no one yet has asked Fiona to give a full and formal report to any meeting. Where does the\nFELIX Editor answer for their follies, do they expect\nopen criticism in FELIX? Hardly conducive to good\nrelations.\nIf I were Fiona I would seek legal advice to see if\nthere were grounds for sue in g.I'd hate to think what\nkind of misjudgements prospective employers could\nmake on reading such tripe. Perhaps it may be better\nto simply make it an internal matter just to see who\nthe FELIX Editor/Print Unit Manager really is\nanswerable to.\n' Yours sincerely,\nNeil McCluskey, ICU President 89/90.\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUCEMENTS\n\u2022 Feel like a revision break?

    "content": "Guards, guards\nA security guard should soon be posted to a new\nsecurity lodge at the Selkirk entrance to the Southside\nHalls, fifteen months after it was first agreed.\nSouthside warden, John Hassard, told FELIX that\nnon- residents 'can and do enter' southside and that\nthere is 'strong evidence' that outsiders were\nresponsible for a spate of thefts and vandalism over\nthe last two weeks. He feels that the security guard\nwould put a stop to much of this and believes that\nthe college authorities have 'fully accepted' the need\nand will now take action as soon as possible.\nFor many years, college chief security officer Geoff\nReeves, has posted two men to Southside even though\nofficially only one was available. According to Dr\nHassard, the position changed a few weeks ago and\nthere will now officially be two security guards. One\nof these guards will work in the new lodge.\nMr Reeves told FELIX that several thousand\npounds still need to be spent on the lodge to make\nit usable. This money would have to come from the\nresidence account and, although Dr Hassard admits\nthat money is scarce, the amount is 'irrelevant' when\ncompared to 'the safety of Southside residents.' and\nworks out at less than 'six day's rent income' from\nthe Hall.\nTheft\n\u00a31300 worth of cash and cheques disappeared from\nthe Union Bar over the weekend. Imperial College\nUnion Deputy President Dave Williams confirmed\nthat the money had vanished but told FELIX that 'the\nmatter had been resolved satisfactorily'. He would\nnot elaborate.\nCollege Security Officer, Terry Briley, told FELIX\nthat the money has not been recovered and that the\npolice have been informed. An internal enquiry is also\nunderway.\nScrooge\na tlC Students in College halls will be required to pay for\none week's residence during the Christmas vacation\nnext year.\nThe ruling, which applies to all students in 31 week\nlets, will enable them to stay in the residence for an\nextra seven days and use the rooms to store\npossessions. Any additional time in hall will still have\nto be paid for.\nScrapped\nA rusting Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Imperial\nCollege Air Cooled Beetle Society will be scrapped\nunless the society starts repairs immediately. The\nbeetle, which has been parked near Linstead Hall for\nthe last two years, has had no work done on it and\nMr Patrello, the Imperial College Traffic Warden,\nfeels that it is wasting valuable parking space.\nMr Patrello also requested people who park their\ncars in the roads behind the Royal College of Science\nUnion Office to stop. These roads belong to the\nScience Museum and the cars are also in imminent\ndanger of a one way trip to the breaker's yard.\nAwards\nThe City and Guilds Union (C& GU) awarded its\nColours and Union General Awards (UGAs), this\nweek. This year's UGAs go to C& GU President Chris\nHome, Vice President Kevin McCann, Hon. Sec.\nRachel Smith, Academic Affairs Officer Chris\nGreenwood, Entertainments Officer and next years\nC& GU President Cathy McClay, and Prof. Pat\nHolmes, the Dean of the City and Guilds College.\nGoing\ndown\nApplications to some college departments for next\nyear are down. Physics and Electrical Engineering\nhave slightly fewer applicants than last year but neither\nexpect problems filling places. Applications to\nMechanical Engineering are down by 5 % despite a national increase of 1%. Admissions tutor, D.A. Robb\nblames the decrease on the 'London' factor: London\nis expensive and tends to intimidate prospective\nstudents. Mineral Resources Engineering are also\ndoing no worse than last year according to Dr. Mike\nSmith, despite a a significant drop in admissions\nnationwide.\nLong term prospects do not look good, as the\nnumber of 18-year-olds is going down. Dr.\nT.C. Bacon of Physics admits to being 'worried'.\nSmash!\nA plate glass window was kicked in during trouble\nat Southside bar last Saturday. Rob Northey, College\nCatering Manager, told FELTX that the college knows\nwho was responsible for the damage and that the\n'gentleman concerned' has been presented with the\n\u00a3322 repair bill.\nCollege Security Officer Terry Briley told FELIX\nthat security will be 'taking a strong line' with\noffenders during the post-exam period.\nFlash!\nFlashers have been reported on the roof of the Beit\nbuilding. They are believed to have been revealing\nall to the inhabitants of the all-female Queen\nAlexandra Hall opposite. Chief Security Officer,\nGeoff Reeves, told FELIX that the offenders have\nnot been caught and it is not known whether they are\nstudents or rather idiosyncratic visitors to the college.\nThe flashers now appear to have stopped.\nHelp?\nIn a last desperate bid to fill up a spare piece of the\nback page and therefore to further spare the acting\nnews editor's hairline, his Smedleyness has kindly\nagreed to print the credits. He would, thus, like to\nthank: Adam Tinworth, Jason Lander, Ian Hodge,\nJeremy Burnell, Richard Murray, The Amazing\nFlying Gerbil Machine, Adrian Pagan, Mark Wilde,\nLiz Warren, Benjamin Turner, Mylan Lester, Rose\nAtkins and Andy Thompson. Good luck to the\nfollowing in their exams: Adam Harrington, Chris\nStapleton, Toby Jones, DEL, Sarah, Simon Haslam,\nBen Turner, Roland Flowerdew, Paul Shanley and\nFruit.\n\n"

    "content": "Welfare Officer\n\u2014Jackie Scott\nMy first job was the editing of the Union Welfare Handbook. As it hadn't been updated for at least four years editing turned into totally rewriting.\nWith a lot of help from FELIX, and Yve (who wrote all the technical bits\nabout Benefits etc.!!) we managed to produce a well-presented, and readable\nbooklet. As a lot of the Benefits are no longer paid to students the handbook\nwill require an insert updating it for next year. The Welfare Officer will be\nemployed over the Summer for this purpose, and also to plan the Campaigns\nfor the coming academic year.\nOf this year's campaigns the Benefits and Rights Campaign was probably\nthe most successful. This was due to the fact that it took place right at\nthe beginning of the academic year, and it was planned during the time\nthat I was employed over the Summer. When term began it became\nimpossible to find sufficient time to plan Campaigns as thoroughly as was\nnecessary, or to be available on the day, as I was stuck in lectures and labs!!\nYve and Neil therefore did most of the planning and organisation for all the\ncampaigns that took place after that. The problems were exemplified by\nthe Stress Campaign planned for the beginning of this term, which never\ntook place, due to a lack of time to allow the necessary planning, by myself,\nYve or Neil. Although I did manage to find the time to write an article in\nFELIX on the subject, between finals and my final year project,\n1 have spent a certain amount of time this year trying to get College to\nsort out the problems in the Union Building concerning Alarms, The only\nAlarms at present are in the Ladies toilets outside the Union Office, but\nfurther alarms are required in the toilets on the central staircase and also\nin the Union Gym changing rooms, (a particularly isolated area) I wrote to\nAngus Fraser and received a reply to the effect that the matter would be\nlooked into, Dave Williams has received quotes for the work but nothing\nmore has been done. I hope it is a matter which next years Deputy President\nand Welfare Officer will be able to see through to completion,\nA major problem this year has been the difficulty I have had in finding\nenough time to complete the job as well as I would have liked. Maybe next\nyears Welfare Officer could look into giving the ordinary members of Welfare\nCommittee more responsibility for the planning of Campaigns. If the two\nordinary members helped out practically, instead of just attending Welfare\nCommittee then hopefully the Campaigns could be run without so much\ndependence on help from the President and Yve.\nJackie Scott.\nPublications Board\n\u2014Doug King\nFortunately it is really easy to write an annual report for Publications Board\nas I don't have to do much and you can all see the results anyway.\nFELIX has built up a really dedicated staff this year under Dave Smedley'si leadership and has created a really sound base for future years. Dave's other\nbig achievement this year has been to get the print unit on a sound financial\nfooting and running as a professional business. A lot of credit must go to\nthe FELIX permanent staff. The place wouldn't run without Rose Atkins,\nand Andy Thompson has become totally invaluable after starting the job\nat the beginning of the year with no idea of what he was letting himself in for,\nIC Radio has seen some major technical improvements this year with the\nupgrading of much of their network and equipment. A new studio has been\nfitted out on the Northside and Prince's Gardens increasing their production\ncapacity as programmes can now be recorded without interrupting\nbroadcasting. Interest in the station has really taken off this year with a large increase in membership over previous years. Thanks to Matt Reeve\nand his band of stalwarts for directing things down there.\nSTOIC has, as usual, been run by a handful of hardened enthusiasts, but\nthrough a high public profile, filming at all major events, they have managed\nto recruit a fair number of new members. Much of the year has been spent\nmaking technical advances, for instance the live simultaneous broadcast\nof the election hustings with IC Radio, A lot of money has been spent on\nnew equipment this year so the future looks rosey. The number of SCAB\nperformances they have been asked to film can only endorse the quality\nof their product this year. Thanks to Ian and Rory and their crew.\nI would like to thank all the publications and the rest of the Pub Board\nexec for being a really easy going bunch and making my job so easy that\nI really can't think of anything I 've had to do worth writing about.\nPub Board AGM and elections are on Tuesday 5th June at 6.30pm in\nthe Union Dining Hall.\nDoug King.\nIndustrial Relations\nCommittee \u2014Nick Lay\nNo-I'm not concerned with negotiating sabbaticals' pay, but with\nencouraging a closer relationship between IC Union, its clubs and societies\nand industry. Or so I thought this time last year. In fact most of the\nCommittee's time has been taken up with running the Careers Fair, which\nthe Union took over from the Industrial Society last year. As a result, the\nCareers Fair made a surplus of around \u00a320,000 which has been used to\nfinance students using the College Nursery, new equipment for the Careers\nOffice, travel expenses for attendance at European student conferences\nand computing equipment for IC Union and the CCUs.\nDue to the amount of time devoted to decisions on what the Careers Fair\nearnings should be spent on and concerns over the accountability of the\nCommittee, IRC next year will solely act as a 'sorting office' for claims and\nmake recommendations to UFC which will make the final decision. The aim\nthis year (and I hope next year} is to fund projects which will either be\nimpossible to fund any other way or benefit a large number of students\nor encourage relations between students and industry, especially in Europe.\nIdeally projects would fall into several of these categories.\nThe transfer of funding decisions to UFC should allow the committee more\ntime to act as a 'think-tank' and to cat aly se closer (and more lucrative) links\nbetween the Union and industry. At the time of writing, there have been\nno nominations for this post, so if you are interested in an interesting and\npractical post in the Union, please see me. Perhaps a new name for the\nCommittee should be your first move!\nNick Lay.\nTransport Officer\n\u2014Mylan Lester\nThe fleet has stayed at seven vehicles which is considered optimum. An\nunprecedented number of bookings, especially at weekends, has resulted\nin a few people not getting a van when they wanted one. A van may be\nleased in to cover these bookings in the first term of the year. The old green\nheap (OLE) has been scrapped and a new van purchased (YRK).\nA number of changes to the administration of the fleet has led to increased\nefficiency and a better understanding of the services offered. A few\ndisciplinary matters have come up and these have mostly been c once red with late returns, late payments and extremely dirty vans being returned.\nThese offences are being tolerated less and less and I would advise all drivers\nto re familiaris e themselves with the regulations.\nIt is now thought that the harmon is ation of EC driving regulations will\nnot effect us as badly as we first thought, although details are still not fully\nknown.\nMylan Lester.\nInternal Services\u2014\n\u2014Chris Stapleton\nThis year, we have seen a dreadful struggle to salvage the Union Snack\nBar, which is not yet over, as well as the dramatic refurbishment of the\nbook shop and the loss of a good manager to a better offer.\nISO is one of the worst jobs you can do. You sit on more committees\nthan any of the other officers and it takes up a lot of your time. Most of\nthis is spent going nowhere. In its present form it is merely a powerless\ndeputy to the deputy president which is pointless. If someone is going to\nlook after the business/service outlets then there is no point duplicating\nthe job.\nI therefore recommend that the post as it stands is abolished and a new\none formed with the same general interests. It should have a different\nemphasis and power to make firm decisions. This matter is not one for a committee but for the deputy president elect, who should decide what form\nthe help he requires should take. This may be in the style of a management\ncommittee with the equivalent ISO taking the chair.\nThat's the main bulk of my report. A few words now to answer some\nof the criticism that I have had.\nI only took up the job after no other takers had chosen to do so. This\nwas after three opportunities. My only real interest lay with the snack bar\nas I knew I had no time to do the whole job. It was better I thought to have\nsomeone doing something than nothing in this area.\nThe majority of the criticisms put before the union general council last\nwere unfounded. The solo efforts described by the deputy president are\nnot true. I have done a lot of work but recently due to exam and course\nwork pressure I have been unable to do anything for the union, or Felix\nfor which I am the editor elect!\nChris Stapleton.\nSocial and Cultural\nAmusements Board\n\u2014Joseph Andrews\nOn the whole, I feel that it has been a successful year for SCAB. As well\nas being very impressed by the activities of the constituent clubs this year\nI have been encouraged by the steadily thawing relations between SCAB\nand the Choir.\nSCAB has run two main functions:\n(i) To oversee the expenditure of the performing arts societies at College\nand to present claims for subsequent years to the Union for appraisal (or\notherwise!).\n(ii) To run Scabnite, a kind of v are it y show, which raises money for Rag.\nThe expenditure side has run very smoothly this year-a lack of selfish\nso cie ites seems to have been the key.\nScabnite was enjoyed by those who watched it, but in all honesty the\naudience could have been very much larger. I take most of the blame for\nthis, as I did not order any tickets for advance sale, but part of it must lie\nwith Guildsheet's Ray Week League Table which placed Scabnite at the\nbottom. My objection to this table is on the grounds that all Ragweek events\ntry to raise money for charity and some of them sell out. The League Table\nmeans that the overflow from a packed Hypnosis Lecture won't go to see\nScabnite instead because it is not rated as highly. Fortunately, Scabnite\ndid make a small profit for Rag this year so all's well that ends well.\nAs far as the individual clubs and societies are concerned, most would\nappear to have enjoyed a productive nine months.\nChamber Music have had a busy year putting on several very enjoyable\nconcerts and a piano masterclass. The emergence of an extremely promising\npiano quintet is also encouraging.\nChoir have had one of their most successful years eve, the high point\nof h wi ch was probably the Alumnus Day concert at the end of 1989 which\nattracted over 700 people.\nDramsoc have done very well this es sion to lift themselves from being\na despairing society, with few members, into one which puts on plays as\nwell as crewing events in the Union Building, As usual Dramsoc is off to\nEdinburgh in August for the Festival.\nFilmsoc's year has been a fraught one as the exec struggled to fight off\nfinal year exams on the one hand while, on the other, discovering that their\nmost trustworthy supplier of parts for their projector had developed chronic\nsenile dementia. They still found time, remarkably, to put on some films,\nincluding the perennial favourite, Betty Blue.\nJazz and Rock club has swung between highs and lows all year. The saga\nof soundproofing the practice room still drags on but the cabaret evening\norganised jointly with Dramsoc and RCSU was hugely successful and will\nprobably be repeated.\nOpsoc started the year shakily and their Christmas Show had to be\ncancelled, but bounced back in February with a rousing production of Gilbert\nand Sullivan 'Utopia Ltd'. For the umpteenth year running they are off on\ntheir summer tour to Devon.\nFinally, Orchestra have had one of their best years for a while. Although\nthe annual weekend at Silwood Park was lost, the music has been of a high\nstandard, pieces such as Bernstein's West Side Story and Schostakovich\n10 being tackled.\nThat's it. Best wishes to my successor.\nJoseph Andrews.\nAthletics Clubs Committee\n\u2014Ben Turner\nSport for competition, or merely for fitness and pleasure, has continued\nto gain strength at Imperial College this year. The number of clubs operating\nactively as part of the ACC has increased with the addition of Cycling,\nShaolin Kung Fu, Yacht and Tai Chi. Several clubs have introduced a women's section, including Ladies Football, Water Polo and Basketball, as\nwell as an attempted revival of Ladies Rugby.\nSuccesses in the Universities Athletic Union (UAU) competitions and\nagainst other University of London (UL) colleges are greater than ever before.\nFencing and Boat Club have both achieved the accolade of national UAU\nChampions. Four Boat Club members are in the Great Britain trials for the\nWorld Championships. Hockey 3rd XI reached the semi-finals of their UAU\ncompetition, as did Badminton 2nd team and Tennis in the winter\ntournament. Ladies Water Polo came runners-up in the National Universities\nTournament in their first year of operation. As usual, nearly all of the Rugby,\nFootball and Hockey teams qualified for the last sixteen knockout rounds\nof the UAU.\nMany teams at IC form the backbone of UL teams. In Judo, UL reached\nthe semi-finals of the British Universities Sports Federation tournament\nsupported by three of our competitors. IC's teams dominate the sports scene\nin London, with Rugby 1st XV winning the Gutteridge Cup, Hockey 1st XI winning the UL Division 1 title, and Football 2nd XI taking the UL First\nDivision title.\nTeams from many clubs will be touring European countries this summer,\nincluding France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Norway. A specialist\nteam from the Yacht Club entered the Spi Dauphine Race, an international\ncompetition in the south of France. Although not finishing high in the leader\nboard, a massive amount of sponsorship was raised by the team members\nand IC received wide exposure amongst European companies and\nuniversities. The IC team was voted the team that was the best\nrepresentative for their sponsor by 'Le Figaro',\nPolicy was passed at a UGM to restructure the travel subsidy for\nrepresentative sport. Although approved by the students, the funds are not\nyet available from College to carry out this scheme.\nA lot of time has been spent dealing with matters concerning other\nuniversities. I must mention Simon Holden, ACC Vice-Chairman, who not\nonly performed the onerous task of coordinating all of the UAU matches,\nbut also dealt with several problems arising from our teams' away trips to\nother campuses! Simon and I have been involved in discussions to\nrestructure the UAU competition, which will have a wider implication on\nthe whole of student sport in Britain.\nSeveral St Mary's students are competing as part of IC clubs, including\nBoat, Fencing and Ladies Water Polo. The general feeling there though is\nthat most clubs do not want to integrate with their IC counterparts.\nSo, with what is arguably the best university sporting record in the south\nof Britain, where are the facilities to attract undergraduates of high\ncompetitive standard; to enable teams and individual competitors to train\nfor greater success; to provide a sporting arena for the more 'casual'\nparticipants, such as Overseas Students Committee clubs' sports nights\nor inter-hail or inter-CCU competitions?\nI'm afraid that the sad discovery during my year as ACC Chairman is that\nAthletics, and extra-curricular activities in general, have a low priority in\nCollege circles. As a result, we must use a Volleyball Court which is a crumbling hall in a condemned building (incidentally the hall is not large\nenough to play matches, so the Volleyball Club is forced to hire facilities\nin Brixton); Badminton have no place with sufficient clearance to train and\nplay matches than the Great Hall; we have a Sports Centre which is required\nby the Governing Body of IC to recoup 80% of its expenditure through\nincome, thus restricting the plans of the management there (compare this\nwith St Mary's swimming pool which does not charge for student\nadmission); we have a sports ground that is a mess in the wake of the\nextraction work there-the contractors have not fulfilled their obligation\nto reinstate the pitches to a good standard within the agreed timetable,\nwith the result that the ground will not recover for years.\nOn a more positive note, Ian Spooner, who will probably take over from\nhis father, Cliff, as Sports Centre Manager, has introduced the possibility\nof building a sports hall on the site of the tennis courts in Princes Gardens.\nNot the multi-million pound multi-storey complex envisaged several years\nago, which never had a chance of receiving planning approval. Just a sports\nhall-four walls, a roof and a floor surface to provide a start to the\nimprovement and provision of the facilities the students badly need.\nHarlington gravel has begun at last to bear fruit, but it has taken five years\nof sustained effort and pressure by ACC representatives, especially members\nof the Hockey Club, to have an astroturf pitch laid down at Harlington. Work\nis under way now and the pitch should be completed by the end of the\nsummer.\nI'm not going to pretend everything is going well when it isn't. IC has the\nworst facilities for sport amongst any of the universities in the UAU, but\nsporting success is an essential aspect of representation and competition\nto an institution that prides itself on its high standards, and is a good selling\npoint to potential undergraduates. So College, get your act together, and\nhelp us to develop the facilities that we deserve.\nBen Turner.\nSocial Clubs Committee\n\u2014Stephen Parkus\nIt has been a fairly uneventful year, in the SCC micro environment. The new\nmethods of submitting claims for club grants certainly looks more efficient,\nbut seemed of little practical use to various people besides myself, other\nthan for advancing bureaucracy in the Union. The SCC was nevertheless\nforced to accept, and clubs made every effort to fit in. Well done to them!\nThe video stolen last year was replaced in the first term this year.\nOther than that, I have tried to reduce the burden of Union politics and\nbureaucracy on club chair people, I have kept SCC meetings relatively few,\nrelatively trouble free and relaxed, and blissfully short. I think it is not\nappreciated that a lot of work is done in/for the Union by students with\na lot of other equally pressing responsibilities. Having been in my final year,\nI have tried to balance my time appropriately, and I take the lack of criticism\nas approval.\nI would like to say thank you to all the SCC chair people for their\ncooperation, and to my exec for their support: Simon Bradshaw, Spenser\nLane, Nikki Fox, Lisa Kestenbaum, and Amanda Baker. Spenser especially\nput in a lot of work as HJT, keeping the books up to date, sorting out financial\nproblems, of which there were many, and thus making things much easier\nfor me.\nI would also like to wish good luck to the new team for next year, chaired\nby Spenser Lane.\nFinally it remains for me to bid farewell.\nStephen Parkus.\n\n"

How about two\nweeks on the Devon coast involved in any or all\naspects of putting on a show?\nEvery year a group of people from Imperial College\nOperatic Society; singers, stage crew, orchestra and\nfront-of-house staff (numbering up to 70 people)\ntravel en masse to Budleigh Salteron, a small friendly\nseaside town on the south Devon coast. Once there\nwe stage ten performances (this year Ruddygore by\nGilbert and Sullivan) to large and enthusiastic\naudiences. What else do we do? Well, we also seem\nto have a very good time, the sun usually shines on\nus, there are lots of good beaches, picturesque walks\n(what is this, a travelogue?), temporary membership\nof the local tennis and croquet clubs and we have lots\nof parties and barbeques, including the infamous\nconcert party where many people display hitherto\nquite unsuspected talents. We also give a charity\nconcert at a local church, which gives people a chance\nto perform more 'serious' music. One evening we\ntravel to Exeter for a formal(ish) dinner and dance\nwhich is always tremendous fun (and much cheaper\nthan London).\nAnd now for the really good news accommodation, which is camping (inside or outside!)\nat a local school plus breakfast for two weeks is \u00a340.\nDepending on how well the show does we give up to\n\u00a320 refund after the show is over, so your holiday will\nprobably cost only \u00a320 (what you spend in the pub\nis your problem).\nIf this has whetted your appetite, then why not find\nout more, come along to our rehearsal on Tuesday\nMay 8 at 7.30pm in the Union Lounge (ground floor\nUnion building) where vile rumour has it there will also\nbe things to eat and drink.

The first six minutes of the match\nshowed how even the teams were, with most of the\nplay concentrated in mid field. Eventually IC put in the\nfirst goal after a quick break from mid field. IC scored\nanother goal before the end of the first half. During\nhalf-time rumours surfaced of the octopus h equivalent\nof a hard ball by IC. Neither team were too worried\nthough as the offence appeared to have turned out\nto Putney's advantage.\nThe second half was as hard fought as the first with\nnumerous goals saved off the line at both ends of the\npool. Putney finally managed to beat our defence with\nthe final score ending up 3:1 to IC.\nPhoenix\nI'd like first of all to thank all those people who\ncontributed this year.

Imperial\nCollege Union's Dramatic Society, under the name\nTheatre West End, is running a Fringe venue on\nPrince's Street for the whole period.

    "content": "Adam Tinworth describes how this week's papers approached Tuesday's emotive press conference\nThe dirt that stays in\nTuesday's Press Conference by the survivors of the\nshooting in Roermond gave the national papers the\nperfect excuse to print reams of articles that their\nbusy hacks had time to research in the time since the\nmurders. Pictures of Lyndal Melrose and Vicky Cross\npartners of Stephan Melrose and Nick Spanos, who\nwere killed by the IRA, were available to fill the front\npages, so the opportunity was there to be taken.\nThe only paper which chose not to cover the Press\nConference, or even follow up the basic story was the\nFinancial Times which focussed upon more fiscal\nmatters as usual.\nEvery other national paper carried some aspect of\nthe story on the front cover, save only the Sport. It\nrelegated the story to page two, preferring to run a story on \"Kim's Naked Secret\" and a huge advert for\nits free Royal Jelly offer, complete with a picture of\na scantily clad female. The story itself was told in a very bland, featureless style, with a retelling of the\ntragedy and elaboration in the form of quotes from the\nconference. Interestingly, Vicky Cross' comment that\n'We were just sitting ducks.' was used twice and also\nas part of the headline. Perhaps the writer was of the\nopinion that the average Sport reader needs to be told\nthings repeatedly before they make any impression.\nThe Sun goes all out for sensationalism. 'Just Like\nA Horror Film' screams the headline, misquoting Mrs\nMelrose who used the term \"Movie\". Mrs. Melrose\nwas 'fighting back the tears' as her husband was\n'riddled with bullets'. The rest of the article consists\nmainly of two long quotes from the conference, one\nfrom each of the women. Of all the papers, The Sun\nplaces most emphasis on ages, giving the age of\nvirtually everybody involved, even telling us how long\nthe Lyndals were married. On pages four and five,\nthey ran some back up articles under the banner\n'Slaughter of the innocents'. The Sun's main rival The\nMirror uses a similar banner complete with masked\nfigure-'Horror in Holland'-and even The Express has\nits 'Murder Of The Innocents'. The main article in the\npaper consists of a tribute to the murder victims from\nfamily, friends and colleagues. They even manage to\nfind a capital punishment angle\u2014'I'd execute killers'\nis the caption under a picture of Mr. Melrose (59). A small piece on Australian premier Bob Hawke's reaction, and a slightly larger piece on warnings to\nBritish holidaymakers abroad, finish off The Sun's coverage.\nThe Mirror's front page confronts you with two full\ncolour pictures of the survivors, both looking on the\nverge of tears. This is a fair warning of the style of\nthe rest of the pieces. While The Sun went for drama,\n77te Mirror played it for horror. The gunmen unleashed\n'a merciless 10 second burst of gunfire' and the\nsurvivors were 'waiting to die'. Its obsession with\nages is nearly as bad as The Sun's. It places much\nless importance on the tributes to the victims,\nconcentrating mainly on their promising careers as\nlawyers. Much more space is given over to Brits\nabroad and warnings and reports that the army are\nstill not changing their policy on number plates. There\nis also a quote from an IRA fund raise r in Melbourne\nwho hoped the tragedy would not affect the cash\nsupplies to the IRA from down-under.\nThe Mirror also manages to pick up on the fact that\na man who works in the same building as the victims,\nwas gunned down in Essex ninety minutes before the\nPage 6\n. -1 i \u00bbff\u00abr,,,<>v shooting. Unsurprisingly, they report that The Police\nhave ruled out a link. The Mirror Comment writer\ndevotes his column to telling foreigners that they\nshould stop looking on the IRA as freedom fighters and\ntreat them as 'the evil and cowardly men' they are.\nThe Daily Star (The Paper That Gives It To You\nStraight) prints a huge picture of the two ladies on the\ncover weeping 'For Their Lost Love' along with three\nsmall bite-sized paragraphs of information in large type\nfor those who can't cope with the articles on pages\nfour and five. The main article is another retelling of\nthe story with quotes. The only noticeable aspect is\nthat it contradicts all the other papers in claiming that\nStephen Melrose was packing away his camera gear,\nnot setting it up. The parents/friends story\nconcentrates on \\ tere the parents are to have their\nsons buried, while a third article compares Australians\nfund raising for the IRA to NORAID in the US. Further\ninto the paper they devote half a page to a 'Top\nBoffin'-Prof. Paul Wilkinson (Director, Research\nInstitute for the Study of Conflict and Terrorism)and his proposals for dealing with terrorists in Europe.\nafter the Roermond shootings.\nhead and not on your hands\nThey are the only paper to reprint a picture of the\nimmediate aftermath of the attack.\nThe Daily Express seems to have decided to play\nup the courageous family in the face of IRA violence\nangle, with a nod to Worldwide Outrage, and\nheadlines like 'Women united in grief bravely tell their\nstory' and 'Mothers moving message to IRA's random\nkillers'. The main spread covers most of pages one,\ntwo and three, the body article covering more ground\nusing excerpts from the Press Conference and cut\ndown versions of what appears in the other articles.\nThese largely consist of one telling of a universal\nnegative reaction to the killings\u2014'Even murderers'\nown backers are feeling sickened'-police plans to set\nup anti-terrorist bases in Europe. On the centre pages\nthere is another two page spread including an\ninterview with the mother of Stephan Melrose.\nIronically you have to remove a supplement called\n'staying alive' to read this.\nThe Mail writer, Tracey Harrison, initially gets a little\nover dramatic, despite the fact that the Mail is the only\ntabloid not to make the story its lead. Phrases like\n'numbed and bewildered', 'ten seconds of horror that\nwrecked their lives' and 'voices breaking' flow thick\nand fast. Eventually the style settles down, and the\narticle manages to combine the press conference,\nparents and tribute stories into one. The only other\narticle is a discussion on potential steps to foil the\nterrorists.\nToday takes a radically different approach,\ndescribing the press conference in a narrative style.\n'I still don't quite believe it has happened. Her voice\nwas barely audible because it is difficult to project\nyour voice when tears are already in your eyes...' This\nspreads over the front page and much of page five\nin a chatty, yet tragic tone of voice that is easy to\nread, moderately informative but not very impartial.\nThe inevitable tribute story and a comment column\nare also here calling for us to 'Salute these brave\nwomen'.\nThe Independent takes a factual angle on the front\npage (as ever) choosing the confirmation that there\nwere two gunmen, not one, as the most important\npiece of news in the story. On page 2 they give further\ndetails of exactly what was said at the press\nconference, resurrect the debate on servicemen's cars\nand give the reaction of people living in the town\nwhere the murder took place and towns to which\narmed forces overseas bases are attached. They also\nlink this with reports of the negotiations between\nBritain and Ireland and the Ulster parties and police\nattacks on Haughey on extradition policy.\n77?e Guardian covers the basic facts of the story and\nthe press conference on the cover, with further\ndiscursive articles inside. The most important of these\nis one that apparently crushes hopes that photographs\ntaken by one of the victims might provide clues to the\nidentity of the victims. Many of the other papers were\nclaiming that this was very possible. The other articles\nare fairly standard-police in Europe and negative-reaction articles. The Austin cartoon makes reference\nto the events with a man finding 'Sorry about the\nmurder' cards in a greeting cards rack.\nFollowing on in a similar form is The Telegraph, with\na factual piece on page one leading onto the rest of\nthe articles on page three. The articles are fairly\nstandard covering army number plates, warnings to\ntourists and international outrage. It devotes several\ncolumn issues to media coverage of the shootings, the\nbiggest section of which was about its own coverage.\nRather tenuously linked in, are warnings that\ntrespassing on military bases could lead to unfortunate\nshootings, after four youths were discovered\nwandering round RAF Barnham.\nCovering things in a similar fashion is The Times,\nwith the familiar format of facts on cover, rest inside.\nThe police in Europe article is there, as is the greater\ndetail on survivors comments and the outrage article,\nalthough this is confined to Australia. The article on\nArmy plates is much more positive than the other,\nsuggesting that army drivers may be able to obtain\nGerman plates, thus increasing safety.\nThe broadsheets show remarkable uniformity when\npresented with a story with little party political\nalignment. The same basic articles are repeated again\nand again throughout all the papers although the\ntabloids do tend to right things in their own inimitable\nstyle, especially the red masthead titles.\nMy opinion of these papers? As the FT would say,\nNo Comment.\nPage 7\n\n"

    "content": "Summers Holiday Last week I went to an Ann Summers party. I was\nhoping to meet Miss Summers, since it was her party,\nbut I was sorely disappointed. I have never been so\nshocked in my life.\nCasually browsing through the catalogue, I was\ndisappointed by the lack of tupperware accessories.\nWhat sort of party had I let myself in for, I thought?\nAs a member of the Salvation Army I was rather\nbemused by the whole affair.\nWhy would anyone want to buy half a pair of\nknickers? Marks and Spencers sell whole pairs for less\nthan the price of these 'crotch less' ones-what a con!\nThe only thought I had was, where are all these three\nlegged women? And the bras! Well, income support's one thing but I hardly think those would support my\noutgoing s. The more interesting part of the magazine was the\nbattery powered section. Pictured below is the party\nsized unit, recently sold to the Wl. The unit is powered\nby six car batteries and comes complete with three\nskilled operators.\nOne of my childhood hobbies. Ann Summers sells\nbattery powered marbles, which are guaranteed to\nwin. My children have already put in a bid for a bag-full. The advantage is, if you lose, they're attached\nto a string, just pull and run! The lady retold an\namusing tale of a recent customer who bought the\n'super magnet' version of the marbles and a pair of\nthe aforementioned cheap-skate knickers.\nEmbarrassment ensued as she met a slight\ncontra temp with the metal escalator at Kings Cross.\nThe funny tea stirrers were even odder. Designed\nfor teacups as deep as 12\", the unusual toys buzzed\naround the table like tops. I have bought one for the\nkids for Christmas, I bet they'll never guess what it\nis, until I stir the first cup of tea with it! The lady had\nanother interesting tale, which warned of the dangers\nof electrical interference from these devices, which\nare capable of picking up Capital Radio on odd\noccasions. The lady added something which said this\nimplied something about the people who listen to this\nstation.\nCasually flicking further through I discovered a page\non party food -jelly and cream and the like. I was quite\ntempted by the strawberry flavourings. The idea of\nedible knickers seemed a good one for those people\nwho like to travel light, with a hasty snack on board.\nThe oddest thing of all was the builders' cream for\npeople who want their buildings to last longer.

I had no idea you could\npurchase a separate Basque all of your own. If the\nterrorist causes any trouble simply hang it with the\nsuspenders that come as. a set. Another unusual\nsection was that on nets capable of holding fish tightly\nin their grasp. The legendary fishnet tights were\navailable in all sizes, from cod to whale.\nFor the musically minded the magazine had a section concerning guitar strings. The edition in\nquestion was particularly uninspiring. 'Air on a Gstring', was the only tune possible from the selection\navailable.\nThe oddest moment of all was at the end of the\nparty when the saleswoman asked us all to have a 'whip round'. I was just searching through my purse\nfor some loose change, when she produced a large\nleather thong. The thong was just a typographical\nerror however, and I escaped unharmed by the thing.\nPage 5\n\n"

Three committees namely,\nResidence's Security Working Party, Wardens Sub-Committee and Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) sit and discuss exactly the same subject matters\nwith no power at any level to do anything that involves spending money!!\nThe policies that SRC does make either get flaunted or the persons\nresponsible for enacting policy are too incompetent to carry them out.\nRecommendations\ni) The committee structure is re-worked to give the committees actual\nresponsibilities and powers, They should be allowed a budget and then be\nable to prior it is e the areas where that budget is spent.\nii l Feed back from students on their reaction to the residences should come\nfrom college Welfare committee and from the use of surveys.\n2.2 Rents\nMyself and others have fought a hard battle to keep the rents as low as\npossible achieving only an average 2.8% increase for 90/91. The Rector\nhas realised that students would not want to come to London if the reality\nis portrayed as accurately as it should be. The halls are inadequately\nmaintained which is resulting in two things; i) lf rents rise to high students\nare not getting value for money and may as well move elsewhere. ii)The\nhalls attract much needed external income from conference bookings. It\nis unfair to expect the students to bail out the college's lack of foresight so...\nRecommendations:\ni) The college takes the money its is building up in its appeal not to buy\na new halls of residence but to refurbish its present stock. Having done\nthat then reorganise the presently inadequately facilities of the\naccommodation office so that it can let the premises profitably during the\nvacations.\nGet rid of Olave House as soon as possible. It loses over \u00a3100ka year,\nthat's equivalent to giving 42 free places in Southside!\n2.3 Private Rented Sector\nAt the beginning of the year I drafted a paper recommending the introduction\nof an office to deal specifically with accommodation in the private-rented\nsector. The idea was to set up a database of the present accommodation\nstudents use and then to maintain contact with the landlords to ensure that\nthe flats/houses are retained by IC students. The office would also provide\na central service to students saving them hours of hassle, leg-work, phone\ncalls and sometimes legal battles. The accommodation office gave the idea\na poor reception, mainly because Miss LO 'Callaghan feared for her own\njob!! I was persuaded by the new Business Manager, Mr Tom Stevens, that\nthe office should be located in the present accommodation office but he\nwould need time to assess the situation. He's still assessing it!!\nRecommendations:\nThe Union goes ahead with plans to survey the students and set-up the\noffice independently. The survey I believe should be carried out in November\nso that the information can be compiled and the office set up in time for\nthe summer term when students need the help.\n3. Welfare\n3.1 The distribution of information with regard to student welfare has taken\nthe form of several campaigns, the most popular of which was the benefits\nand rights week early in the year. The Union Welfare Adviser, Yve Posner,\nhas been kept busy throughout the year with case problems, personal callers\nand telephone enquiries.\nCommemoration Ball\nThe venue of the London Dungeon was a very popular one and consequently\nthe event was a complete sell-out. 400 people ate and a substantial buffet\nand boogied the night away. The seven foot giant who dressed up as Dracula\nwas a little too realistic and bit several people (including me} but apart from\nthat everything went smoothly and the Bail broke even. I would recommend\nthat if the venue chosen is a distance from the Union and in an area not\nfrequented by taxis then a coach be provided to bring guests back to the\nUnion. Also this was the first year that insurance was taken out against\ndamage being done and I would urge that this practice is repeated in future\nyears.\nRoom Bookings\nRoom bookings only became part of the Hon See's job dec rip tion this year\nand had previously been treated in rather a haphazard manner, it is a time\nconsuming business and I would estimate that it has taken up about on\nthird of my time. The rooms are very much in demand and the Union has\nthe potential to make the system a very lucrative one. To facilitate this\ndevelopment, I have compiled a room bookings directory which will make\nMurray's job a lot easier and also writen a new set of terms and conditions\nafter consultation with College security, the Union Bar licensees and Rob\nNorthey.\nElections\nThis section of my job has been hit by the general student apathy that is\ncurrently affecting Imperial, with fewer candidates trying for posts. The\nsabbatical elections prod u ced their usual batch of petty bickering and this\nwas mainly due to an archaic set of election rules which can be interpreted\nin as many ways as there are candidates. Therefore myself and this year's Elections Committee will be doing something about the situation and writing\nan unambiguous version. One thing that is completely certain about this\ncoming year's sabbaticals is that the staff in the Union Office had nothing\nto do with their choice and any accusation to the contrary is frankly libel.\nPublicity\nNumerous poster raids were run this year but only a few fines were dished\nout. This probably had something to do with House Committee upping the\nfine per day for an out of date poster from 5p to 25p! There are no guidelines\nlaid down as to what the Hon Sec should consider 'offensive' so I have\nhad to rely on personal opinion to decide what should grace the walls of\nthe Union Building and the Sherfield Walkway. Ben Turner's infamous 'Great\nRecommendations:\nNext year's President organises all prospective campaigns during the\nSummer vacation to ease the running of them. A benefits and rights week\nshould still be held and Paul Shanley's idea of giving financial advice should\nbe included in this campaign.\n3.2 Next year students from both home and overseas will face financial\nhardship through a combination of low income and lack of state benefits.\nRecommendations:\nThe college has set up by October 1990 a hardship fund into which\nGovernment access fund and a slice of overseas students fees should be\nplaced. A panel should be responsible for disbursing the funds to students\nstrictly on a needs basis. The Imperial Trust should be encouraged to attract\nfunds specifically for the hardship fund.\n4. External Affairs\n4.1 Loans\nAfter fighting hard unfortunately the loans are in. I honestly don't think\nthat college helped the students one iota until it was too late. My thanks\nto Governing Body members who did finally help by writing to MPs.\nRecommendations:\nEvery single student should be encouraged to take out a loan whether they\nneed it or not, Those people who don't need it could possibly be persuaded\nto invest their in say the hardship fund where a slice of the high interest\nearned could be used to supplement the hardship fund.\n4.2 Local Council Elections\nThe attempt to get our own councilors on to the local council has had a very good effect. Talks are about to start with Councilors for the\nKnightsbridge ward with a view to improving relations and to sort out some\nof the difficulties we presently have. With a full election campaign attracting\nmore external voters I believe it is possible to get our own councilors elected.\nRecommendations:\niJ The Union proceeds with talks with the local councilors but not to let certain\ncollege dignitaries muck it up by pushing for change too quickly.\nii)The Union puts up candidates for the next local council election and\nmounts a six month campaign to win.\n4.3 NUS Affiliation Referendum\nUnfortunately this did not happen this year due to certain members of the\nConservative Society using the constitution and bye-laws to scrap the\nreferendum vote. I believe open debate should be held about the pros and\ncons of joining the NUS.\nRecommendations:\ni) Next year's President invites the NUS to come and debate the future of\nthe NUS at IC and straight after hold a referendum.\nii)That the decision to do this should be an Exec decision and should not\nbe interfered with by minority activists.\n5. Overseas Students\nIn this area I have been distinctly quiet, my thanks to the Overseas Students\nCommittee Chairman, Mr W Van Hulten, in covering this area. Overseas\nstudents face one specific problem that of entering into and embracing a foreign culture. The rest of their problems I believe are very similar to home\nstudents though they are exacerbated by the pressure from their fee paying\nbodies (governments, sponsors, etc.! I think the only way to overcome the\nproblem of alienation is to make friends quickly once here. To this extent\nthe student overseas societies are very effective but they are not a much\nwidely publicised as I would like to see.\nRecommendations:\ni) AII overseas incoming students be given a host to guide them through\nthe first few weeks of being in the UK.\nii}Lists of overseas student societies be sent to prospective overseas\nstudents so that correspondence can be struck up with an aim to clarifying\nthe problems of studying and living at IC.\nTits' poster offended a lot of people and for this I am sorry. I think that\nafter doing science 'A' levels and a science degree, I have become immune\nto sexism. The lady I spoke to from NALGO suggested that a meeting be\narranged b tween the Hon Sec and a representative from that Union to\ndiscuss the content of publicity emanating from IC Union and I think this\nwould be a good move for Marray to take.\nEntertainments\nThe Ents Committee have not only worked hard this year but have also\ntaken an extremely professional approach to every event that they have\norganised. There have been times when they have had to put their own\nsafety at risk (see 'Crime') and still they have managed to keep a mature\nattitude, BJ and I have not always seen eye to eye but we developed a very reasonable working relationship nevertheless. I very rarely saw any\nof the bands on offer as I was acting as security but I heard most of them\nand we enjoyed a variety of styles ranging from heavy metal to reggae to\nska to funk.\nCrime\nDrugs reared their ugly head several times during the course of the year\nand were accompanied by violence and vandalism. The police caught onto\nthis and warned us that we would put our bar licence in jeopardy if we\nweren't more careful. A clampdown on room bookings and general event\nsecurity followed and we saw little or no evidence of drugs again.\nUnfortunately I fear that they have just moved elsewhere on the campus.\nAlcohol makes some people prone to violent acts and we saw a nasty\nfight in the Union Bar involving a bar stool as a weapon. There was also\nthe incident involving two blok es who tried unsuccessfully to get into an\nEnts event for free and then proceeded to attempt to beat up two members\nof the Ents Committee and the Duty Officer. The situation got out of hand\nand the police were called. Unfortunately the message lost something in\ntranslation and a patrol car, 3 Astras, a dog van and about 20 policemen\narrived on the scene seconds later. The explanation from me to them was,\nalmost certainly, the most embarrassing time of my year! I developed a very\ngood relationship with PC Law, the local community bobby and he assures\nme that this is a very safe area in which to live, with no sexual attacks\non women reported over the last year. However, knowing that many women\nin College (both students and staff) live out of Westminster, I organised\na self-defence evening. Despite publicity the evening was poorly attended\nbut the graphic demonstration and TV programme were extremely useful\nto those who did.\n6. St Marys\nRelations this year have been much better than last. Basically nothing has\nbeen done apart from extending and accepting invitations to committees,\nparties and functions. Now I think the time is right to start discussions on\nmatters such as:\ni) What does college expect the two student unions to do?\nii)What do the student unions expect or want from each other?\nUntil these questions are answered it is pointless thinking up grand schemes\nto merge the two bodies.\nRecommendations:\ni) Find the answers to the questions\nii)Carry on enjoying each other's company and parties!\n7.Athletics\n7.1 Harlington\nAfter several years, several discussions, loads of meetings, gripes and groans\nan Astroturf is at long last being installed at Harlington. The pitch should\nbe ready by October 1990. Along with the installation of our own, come\npromises of a second astroturf to be financed by the council at Harlington.\nThis bodes well for the future of Harlington being a dual corporate/college\nfacility thus generating some income from a not highly used facility.\nRecommendations:\nil College presses ahead to install a second astroturf and to invite local\nschools and companies to become corporate members.\n7.2 Harlington Trust\nStill the arguments carry on as to who decides to spend what, where and\nwhen. Meanwhile the Trust stands at \u00a32.2 million with only the astroturf\nhaving been considered so far. The Imperial Trust has now set precedents\nthat it wishes applications for sports facilities to go to the Haflington Trust.\nAt last the proper use of the Trust:\nRecommendations:\ni) The Harlington Trust be used for sports and athletics facilities until such\ntime as they are up to standards required by the competing teams.\nii)The Harlington Trust be used to develop\nal Sports Hall at South Ken (see the ACC report)\nb)A health club underneath Southside\nc) The sports centre so that its facilities are up to date and a pleasure to use.\nThat concludes my report to the students of this college. I will be making\nfurther reports and recommendations to other bodies including the incoming\nsabbaticals.\nFor the last part of my report I would like to say a few thanks;\nFirst and foremost to Karen for putting up with me doing a job with shitty,\nanti-social hours; maybe now we can get back to normality and reality!\nTo Yve Posner and Jackie Scott for running the Welfare side of the Union.\nTo Hal Calamvokis for his immense help on the loans issue.\nTo Tom Yates for his much needed advice and assistance in the local\ncouncil elections.\nTo Fiona, Dave Williams, Dave Smedley for being understanding,\nsympathetic and supportive at all the appropriate times.\nTo the Rector for being the Rector. The experience will stand me in good\nstead for my future career (care assistant in a mental hospital!!).\nTo Bob Westaway, Peter Mee, John Smith, Angus Frazer, Ken Weale\nand all the treasurers, Sir Frank Cooper, Pat Holmes, for being open, honest\nand available to talk to and help where possible.\nLastly and most certainly not least thanks to all the staff of the Union;\nJen, Michelle, Pat, Reggie, Louise, David, Yve, Jellie, Ian, Yvonne, Rose,\nAndrew. You've all been marvelous to work with even though I haven't been the most perfect of bosses!\nNeil McCluskey President 89/90\nFiona Nicholas\nOther Bits\nThe CCU Dinners were great fun and, without exception, I enjoyed them\nall. I apologise for the standard of my jokes but I did at least try and suit\nthem to the style of dinner I was attending. The biggest mistake I made\nwas letting Beef 'look after' me at the Geology Dinner. The hangover was\nhorrendous! We enjoyed a lot of American presence at our events and\nparticularly memorable was the Hallowe'en Party when the fancy dress was\nfantastic. Mark Edwards, who is resp on aib le for entertainments at the AIFS\ndeserves special mention as he was a great help with publicity to the\nAmerican students at his establishment. Exec Initiative was an experience.\n'Initiative' consisted of hiding between four of us a total of \u00a370, three credit\ncards, a cash point card a a tool with which we managed to break our chains.\nWe did a pub crawl and collected money and made our way back on the\ntrain. I was sold as a slave for \u00a360 and ended up cooking for a dinner party\nof nine maths students. As I enjoy cooking, this was not too much of a hardship.\nThe Christmas Caper was fun and the Union's contribution was a stand\nmaking stained glass windows. We must have delighted at least twenty\nchildren.\nConclusions\nI have enjoyed my time as Hon Sec and I think it has taught me a lot about\npeople and life in general. Students have found me approachable and have,\non the whole, come and ta Iked to me if they think that I have done something\nwrong or taken, according to them, a strange decision. There has, almost\nalways, been an explanation.\nThanks\nThis is the sickly part of any report but essential, I'm afraid:\nBJ for being BJ. Emma Skitt for being a fantastic Ents Treasurer and a nice\nperson. The Ents Crew for being a laugh to work with. All the Duty Officers,\nespecially Mylan and Doug. Ian Morris for teaching me about photocopier\nsalesmen. Terry Briley for being a constant source of advice. Jelly for being\nJelly and also for having the driest sense of humour in existence. Dramsoc\nfor some good parties. Neil and Dave Williams for putting up with me in\nthe office. All the Union Office staff, especially Jen and Michelle. Tom Yates\nfor being disgusting. Nick for being,\nAll that remains to be said is 'Good luck, Murray!'.\nFiona Nicholas\nHonorary Secretary (Events)\n\n"

    "content": "Harlem Nights\nThis movie begins at a rate of one obscenity per six\nand two-thirds seconds but calms down as it\napproaches middle age to about one per fifteen\nseconds.\nThe film tells the story of Sugar Ray (Richard Pryor)\nand his unruly adopted son, Quick (Eddie Murphy)\nwho have built up the most successful 'after hours'\njoint in 1938 New York. This makes them none too\npopular with gangland boss Bugsy Calhoune (Michael\nLerner). Calhoune sends round his pet bent cop Phil\nCantoune (Danny Aiello) to demand an inordinate\nstake in Club Sugar Ray.\nThe plot is twisting, but runs mainly around the\ncross/double-cross that ensues as Our Heroes try to\noutwit Calhoune and entourage (said entourage\nconsisting of vamp Dominique la Rue and\nmisc ella nous extras).\nDespite featuring two of the world's hottest\ncomedians this film still battles against all-star\nprecedent and manages to be good; both Murphy and\nPryor fend off the temptation to fall into a Jive Turkey\ncartoon character double-act and handle the straight\nparts with surprising skill, particularly Pryor. This may\ndisappoint those who expected Beverly Hills Cop\nmeets Stir Crazy and may account for some of the bad\npublicity the film received in the US. Visually the film\nis stunning with good cinematography and lighting\nbringing out the best in the period scenery. The\nAmazing Machine says 'the clothes were bloody\ngood' and the soundtrack was better. The Flying\nGerbil appreciated the decor and hopes Richie Vento\nand Sunshine live happily ever after (a numbers runner\nand the prostitute sent to distract him).\nLittle Love\nFilm\nm Although the film is not really a comedy Arsenio Hall\n(Murphy's sidekick in Coming to America) deserves\na mention for his painfully funny 'Crying Man' who\nbelieves Quick has murdered his brother. Bonus points\nalso to Eddie Murphy himself for doing absolutely\nbloody everything on the production side-writer/\ndirector/producer/star and generally responsible for\nthe overall look and feel. Redd Foxx and Delia Reese\nput in a creditable double-act as a pair of cantankerous\ngeriatrics; Stan Shaw is good as the stuttering boxer\n(to the credit of those concerned the character is not\nTheatre\nThere is much to enjoy in this tale of two dod gy doctors on the make with new-born babes as the\ncommodity. In his private clinic, the charming Dr\nFrancis Patience supplies wealthy childless couples\nwith infants supposedly unwanted by their natural\nmothers.

They make a deal with Dr Patience\nand Diana fakes a pregnancy complete with false\npadding and a spell in the clinic at the time of the\n'birth' ie. the handover. But quelle surprise the natural\nmother suddenly decides that she wants to keep baby\nfor herself. The ensuing chaos is cleverly written and\nPage 4\nis pretty funny although author Stephen Fagan tends\nto resort to stereotyping his characters in order to milk\nmaximum laughs from his audience: Dr Patience's dithering side-kick, the la-de-daa Diana Hammersley\nand Dr Patience himself are all characters we've seen\nbefore, notably in T.V. sitcoms. And the actors,\nalthough reasonably famous (Lord Brigsley in Not a Penny More, the woman in Drummonds and Douglas\nin Chancer), do nothing to break out of these moulds.\nFagan also deals with the subject of adoption in a flippant manner that hardly broaches upon the severe\nanguish many childless couples experience during the\nadoption process.\nBut pathos aside, this production should appeal to\na wide audience and by the time you read this the\nactors should be familiar with their lines.\nAdrian Pagan.\nwritten to be made fun of) and Richard Pryor takes\nthe film with his surprisingly good performance as an\nelderly club owner with humour and charm.\nThis film does not feature an excessive level of\nviolence; the language is undeniably foul (the main\nminus point) and the plot, while not too surprising has\nthe odd revelation.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine gives the film\nfour woofs and a potato.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine.\nBerenice\nTheatre\nNeil Bartlett's quite a 'wow' in English Theatre ng nt now. He performs on the London Fringe and two years\nago his translation of Moliere's The Misanthrope was\nall the rage at the Edinburgh Festival. But he obviously\nchose to translate seventeenth century French\nplaywright Jean Racine's Berenice on an off day.\nTitus is emperor of Rome and loves Berenice but\ncan't make his mind up whether to marry her or not,\nas for some reason Roman emperors may not marry\nroyalty. There's also their close personal friend,\nAntiochus, who is also in love with Berenice and\nspends the whole two and half hours of the play (no\ninterval) in the throes of moral dilemma, that is he\ndithers about. It's a tedious affair really as there's remarkably little else to distract one's attention while\nthe actors wade through a script which is steeped in\nlong speeches which do nothing to speed up the plot\ndevelopment which goes about as fast as the M1 on\na Friday evening.\nBut Bartlett has done his best with the play. He's installed an interesting set of half-rhymes which,\nalthough not as effective as those he used in TTre\nMisanthope, do save the audience from total\nboredom. Both the acting and costumes are\nunexceptional however and do nothing to save this\nsnail of a play which really shouldn't be on at the\nNational Theatre.\nAdrian Pagan\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Union and St Mary's Student Union to merge at last\nA merger is announced\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School\nStudents Union (SMHMSSU) may finally\nbecome a constituent college union (CCU)\nof Imperial College Union (ICU), almost\ntwo years after the College and the\nMedical School officially merged. The\nprovisional merger document, still under\ndiscussion, formalise s the relationship\nwhich has formed between the Unions\nover the last year.\nRelations between the two Unions had\nbeen strained after Nigel Baker, ICU\nPresident for 88/89 and Phil Drew, his\ncounterpart at St Mary's, clashed over the\nposition of the St Mary's Union. Their\nsuccessors Neil McCluskey and Rhydian\nHapgood have had a better working\nrelationship and have now agreed on a formal merger. The merger document has\nyet to be signed but it is believed that few\nchanges will be made.\nMr McCluskey told FELIX that the\ndocument was 'a wonderful opportunity'\nto initiate discussions and he commended\nMr Hapgood and his fellow contributors\nfor their hard work. Mr Hapgood, who\nhelped draft the proposal, told FELLX that\nhe thought it was 'very fair' and reflected\nhow things were run this year. Although\nhe expects a few 'teething troubles', he\nfeels that medical students have a role to\nplay within IC.\nAs aCC U, the St Mary's Union will\nstill remain largely independent of ICU\nand will have its own separate source of\nfunding. Some of this money will be\ndonated to ICU for administration and the\nuse of its facilities.\nAt present, the St Mary's Union has its\nown facilities at the Medical School, at\nTeddington Sports Ground and at the\nrecreation centre at the rear of its student\nhall of residence, Wilson House. In future,\nSt Mary's students will be given priority\nat these sites although they will not have\nexclusive access. Medical students will\nalso be given first choice for\naccommodation at Wilson House itself.\nAdministratively, the two Unions will\nalso remain largely separate with decisions\naffecting the St Mary's Paddington\nCampus taken at separate St Mary's Ordinary General Meetings (OGMs).\nDecisions affecting the whole of IC will\nstill be taken at ICU Union General\nMeetings (UGMs) at which St Mary's students will be entitled to vote. The St\nMary's Union President will join the ICU\npresident, deputy president and honorary\nsecretary and the presidents of the three\nexisting CCUs on the ICU Executive. St\nMary's Union will also be given a number\nof places on Council, ICUs main decision\nmaking body. The medical schools'\nexisting representatives on the Wardens\nSub Committee and the Board of Studies\nshould remain in their posts.\nRelishing the moment\n\n"

    "content": "Deputy President David Williams\nThis report will not be a catalogue of my successes and failures as I see\nthem, that is for you to judge. It will be a record of the developments in\nthe areas of responsibilities in which I hold court.\nTrading\nThe DP's responsibility for trading comes through his chairmanship of the\nrelevant management committee and thus the associated responsibility to\nCouncil. It is this area of the job that I have found to involve the highest\ndegree of teamwork. It has been the most thankless and the most rewarding.\nBookstore\nThe old mascot and emblem of Imperial College Union was the Phoenix,\nit is that analogy which best describes the changes which have taken place\nthis year within the bookstore. One year ago the College-managed bookshop\nwas on the verge of insolvency; ineffective management control, poor\nproduct selection and non-existent stock control meant that radical change\nwas needed. The Union which had now gained complete control of the\nbookshop management, took the risk-laden step of investing over \u00a336,000\nin the bookstore refit and electronic point of sale control system, Indeed\nduring the course of the year further loans to ease cash flow have been given\nand repaid.\nThe conversion work took place over August 1989 and progressed well,\nbar a few construction al delays thanks to College estates. The new look\n'Bookstore' opened in mid-September with a new manager and a new look\nwhich seemed to meet the overall approval. A number of operational\nproblems arose early on In the term, these were unfortunate for all involved\nand in many respects were to be expected given the mode of the operation\nin place. I am assured that these have been sorted out now and everything\nwill be fine for next October,\nDuring the autumn term vigorous battles took place as College tried to\nfix a rent on the bookstore premises that looked like killing off a return of\nthe Union's investment. Just as a deal was about to be stuck, it was noticed\nin the Union Bye-laws (a document somewhat akin to the Tablets of Stone)\nthat the Bookstore site is for the use of the Union rent free. A wee glass\nof sherry was had by all.\nIn February the 88/89 accounts were ready, they showed that the\nbookshop had made a \u00a369,845 trading deficit, a large proportion of which\nwas a massive stock write-off (we all remember the History of Persian\nEarthquakes!).\nAt the May meeting of the bookstore committee the half year accounts\nup to January 31st were presented. These showed an operating surplus\nof nearly \u00a335,000, although sales were down, an improvement of nearly\n4,000%. It certainly looks as though the Union IT investment is paying off.\nCurrent figures show that trade is now up on last year despite five weeks\nduring which we were not open. However, due to large accumulated losses\nand continued cash flow problems, it will be around two years before the\nUnion will see a significant return on its investment.\nAlthough the manager had to leave us at Easter (due to family reasons)\nthe store (now under the temporary guidance of the Union Manager) has\ncontinued plans for development and expansion, including a mail order\nenterprise and a theatre ticket agency.\nThe start of the year saw the presentation of the 88/89 accounts: these\nshowed a significant improvement over any other year. It was on this note\nthat we pressed forward, sound in the knowledge that the formula was\nright. It soon became clear that the financial pressures of students were\nfinally beginning to hit their beer money: trade in Freshers' Week being 2%\ndown (excluding effects from inflation). This is a trend which has continued\nthroughout the year, there being only a1% growth in cash sales. An increase\nin function trade has meant that credit sales have pushed the total sales\nfigures up by 3%. This sales stagnation has not effected net t profits which\nhave increased by 24%. Please note these figures are based on the year\nto Feb 28th. The bar has had its share of troubles this year, a fight in late October\nled to a prolonged and complicated disciplinary case, which showed the\nCollege to be totally spineless on such matters. On this point, the Union\nhas decided to refer all future violent incidents straight to the police, it is\na move being reciprocated in all College bars.\nThe hunt for an assistant bar manager resulted in a placement being made\nin January. Our relief soon turned to de spare as the appointee disappeared\nat the same time as the weekends takings. We are unlikely to see any of\nthis money again. The appointee has since been charged and is due to appear\nin court soon. After another recruitment drive in February, a replacement\nwas found but didn't show up. On our third attempt we have found someone\nwho seems to be settling in nicely.\nA prolonged debate this year with Britvic Corona resulted in the Pepsi\nmachine finally being replaced, the Union was eventually charged the correct\nprice for soft drinks and given a full back-credit for the seven months of\nover charging.\nSnack Bar\nThis year has been one of change and hopefully development of the Snack\nBar. The start of the year saw the 88/89 accounts showing a E20.5K deficit\nand a realisation that this was the make or break year for the catering\noperation within the Union Building.\nInitially, the year was spent trying to refine the product that we already\nhad. Specialising on product control and making sure that the service was\ngood were prime objectives. The first part of the year was helped by the\nencouragingly healthy function trade. However as the spring term dawned\nit became increasingly clear the formula that we had established was not\nworking, it was at this stage that the relaunch concept was conceived.\nThe idea of converting the snack bar into a sandwich bar came firstly from\nthe catering manager. It was an approach that the committee embraced\nwholeheartedly. The marketing and publicity campaign was a success, a loss of \u00a33,167 in January was reduced to \u00a3846 in February, a significant\nimprovement.\nIt was apparent in February that there were a number of operational\nproblems to be overcome. A task force was set up to tackle these. The\nUnion Manager, dealing with those behind the counter, and a group of\nbudding sabbaticals handling those in front of the counter. As things\nimproved behind, there were two days of action in front.\nAs I write now, there are no trading accounts available up to May, however\nsales seem to be holding steady against the same period last year. A number\nof new initiatives are due to be introduced in the next few weeks, including\na delivery service, ice creams, selling snack bar food in the bar and using\nthe Bookstore as a supplementary outlet for snack bar rolls.\nOver the summer, a working group will be convened to plan a strategy\nfor the marketing of the Snack Bar and other Union facilities. Hopefully their\nplans will not be scuppered through the ineffectiveness and inactivity of\nthe Internal Services Officer and the block headed ness, misguided loyalty\nand personal grudge held against me this year by the FELIX Editor. My last\nstatements are probably going to attract (un savoury) comments from the\nEditor of this Organ. I do not want to detract from my own possible failings\nbut I stand by what I have said.\nAn area of catering operation that can be developed is the function trade.\nThis requires a sizeable investment in both catering hardware in the Union\nDining Hall kitchen, and in the quality of the UDH furniture. Work on this\nis currently underway.\nIn conclusion, I believe the Snack Bar has reached its lowest ebb and\nthe tide is now changing. Next year's sabbaticals have the right formula\nfrom which to work from. Given good, planned marketing and refining of\nthe operation there is no reason that the Snack Bar cannot be turned into\nan outlet with a stable performance figure. Whether this is negative (subject\nto cross sub sid is ation), zero or positive is still to be decided.\nFinance\nThe Union clubs and societies have seen a significant improvement this\nyear, thanks mainly to the new book keeping strategy and the Financial\nProcedure Document drawn up by last year's DP and the Union Finance\nOfficer. A number of irregularities cropped up during the year, mainly\nconcerning external bank accounts, these were satisfactorily resolved.\nUnfortunately, there are a number of clubs which feel they have a God\ngiven right to operate, regardless of any budget ry contra in ts. This was\nbrought to a head this year over the matter of the last issue of the 88/89\nFELIX, Clubs must realise that if they overspend the consequence of this\nmust be bourne by the following year's officers\u2014the Union will not bail\npeople out. It is a lesson that the CCU's have learned to their cost and it\nis one that IC Union clubs must learn also.\nThe Union Finance Committee has been a joy to work with this year,\nReasoned debate and understanding for common problems have been the\norder of the day. If next year, UFC can operate on such a level keel then\nthe Union's money will be in safe hands.\nThe level of funding that the Union will receive next year still hangs in\nthe balance. The College is pressing us to reduce our reserves. Although\nwe accept that these are large, we have our own plan to bring about a reduction (plans such as the UDH refit, writing off the sizable snack bar\ndeficit, and the Union Office computer upgrade). The loans made to the\nsnack bar and the bookstore, to ease cash flow, underpin the need for a Union reserve of several tens of thousands of pounds. It all boils down to\nthe right of the Union to assess its own financial requirements. It is quite\nlaughable that, given the student management of our money, our liquid\nreserve is larger than that of the College!\nMascotry\nThis has been fairly quiet, RCS and Guilds have, as expected been the most\nactive, both giving each other a run for their money. It was good to see\nTheta, the RCS mascot, out more often than last year. The spirit on both\nsides has been as good humour ed as it should. Guilds handed back the King's College mascot, Reggie, to the Dean as the students were not interested.\nThis was a real shame as Reggie is one of London's oldest mascots going\nback to the early 1940s. Sadly there was even less interest from Royal\nHolloway and Bedford. RCS eventually handed back Davy to the RSM, with\nRSM showing a surprisingly un sports manly disinterest in the proceedings.\nNevertheless full marks go to all those who did raise the \u00a3500 to get Davy\nback,\nMike has made it to most UGMs this year, an added complication has\nbeen the evening UGMs which makes returning Mike back home a little\ndifficult. Early in the spring Mike went for a trip around London with Davy\nand Theta, a number of interesting photographs were taken. The offer of\na repeat performance still stands with C&G and RSM mascot ry. The highlight of the year must be the recovery of one of London's oldest\nmascots, Mary, from Queen Mary College, It was discovered in an antique\nshop in Portabello Road by Jim Sarsfield (a member of '22 Club and ex-RCS officer). The handover was negotiated by another old-boy, Simon\nBanton. In exchange RCS recovered a number of minor mascots stolen by\nQMC a few years ago. At least the spirit of mascot ry still exists with some\npeople.\nAcademic Affairs\nThis field of work was one in which I was totally inexperienced, and I saw\nit as one where most people had something to win or lose. In the past,\nAcademic Affairs Officers such as Chas Brereton and Richard Spencer have\npushed forward the bounds of Acc Aff at IC, The College Committees that\n1 have attended with relation to Acc Aff have often proved to be the most\ninteresting. They have shown me that IC does care, the thinking behind\nthe courses is there. Certainly the Undergraduate Studies Committee is the\nmost stimulating committee I have experienced this year. Its only problem\nhas been the 'politic' way it has presented its finding to the Board of Studies,\na committee so large very few members have the nerve to speak out against\nthe Rector.\nThe Undergraduate Studies Committee (USC) is a stark contrast to the\nIC Acc Aff Comm. The apathetic attendance and lack of foresight from its\nmembers proved to be the only dazzling aspect for its existence. The work\nof the CCU AAO's and a couple of dep reps (but notably not the IC AAO)\nare the only elements which raised it from the absolute mists of obscurity.\nThis year saw the presentation of the USC report on the Life Science\nDivision and the Chem Eng departments, which were surveyed last year.\nThe LSD report was quite damning (if one was prepared to read between\nthe lines). I am glad to report that the Biochem department is changing its\nUndergrad course to accommodate the recommendations I am still\nunconvinced by the action to be taken by Biology.\nThe problem of illegal timetabling was a considerable one at the start\nof term. Most departments were most responsive when questioned on the\nmatter. However, when challenging tutors, the unsubstantiated claims in\nFELIX did significant damage to the credibility of our case.\nThe significant steps forward this year taken by the College have been\nthe increased commitment to lecturer training and assessment and also the\nexpansion of the Course X with a year in Continental Europe.\nThe steps backward have been the loss of student intellectual copyright\non inventions made at College, and the progression stop (which prevents\na student moving forward to his next year of study if he owes a payment\non a hall bill).\nOne of the most informative projects that I undertook this year was the\nconference which I attended in Paris. All this year the Union has funded\nvisitors to European student meetings. BEST, or the Board of European\nStudents in Technology, was set up to further the development of the\n'Erasmus and Comet' foreign study and work experience programmes. IC\nis involved in both of these schemes, it is considering dropping this support\ndue to lack of interest from IC students. If you do fancy studying or working\nabroad for a few months do contact your senior tutor. It is fantastic\nopportunity. If IC pulls out then the chance for the other Europeans to visit\nhere will be lost.\nPostgraduates\nEarly on in the session, attempts were made to stimulate interest in a postgraduate group. Nothing was forthcoming until the Spring Term when\nwe saw the emergence of the Women's Posgraduate Group (since made\nan official subcommittee of the PG Group).\nThe work of the College PG Studies Committee has been mostly\nconcerned with the rubber stamping of course name changes. However,\nit has done a great deal of work assessing the role of the research supervisor.\nIt has become evident that the level of supervisory control varies greatly,\nand that the minimum standard is unacceptably low. This is of special\ninterest to overseas students who are generally not used to British levels\nof Postgraduate study. I am happy that the work being done in this field\nhas the correct objectives and I hope the committee will not compromise\nits principles and that the rest of College, particularly the departments, have\nthe convictions to carry them through.\nHouse\nBuilding\nAlthough not directly within my job description. House has accounted for\nover 40% of my time this year and has always been the most frustrating.\nThis year has seen a number of major projects come to fruition-replacement\nof the Gym floor, removal of the dumb waiter, building of the top floor toilets.\nBefore the end of the year I hope that the Concert Hall will be refurbished\nand struct u ally improved and the top floor redecorated. The old kitchen\nabove the FELIX Office is also due to be refurbished and turned into a Rag/ICCAG office, this is to accommodate the American College which is\ntaking office space and classrooms on the top floor.\nRegular maintenance of the building has been a problem all year, this is\nlargely due to the well intention ed, though inefficient, operation of the\nresidence maintenance section, I understand that they are over-stretched\nfor their resources, but if this is the case then why can't the load of the\nUnion Building be shifted onto central estates? For a period of the second\nterm they seemed to manage faults quite effectively, swiftly and without\ntrouble.\nSecurity\nTheft of personal property proved to be a considerable problem in the first\nterm. From talking to College security I have learned that there are specific\ngangs who tour colleges in the fresher s' period because they are such soft\ntargets. Better use of duty officers and improved security of areas such\nas the gym changing rooms all help to combat crime, but the best prevention\nof all is individual vigilance.\nCollege Committees\nGoverning Body and Finance and Executive Committees\nThese have proved to be useful committees for getting to know people,\nthough most of the business has already been 'decided' before the meeting.\nNevertheless, the Union has been able to establish a number of compromises\nwhen it has come to the crunch.\nHouse Committee\nIn a change to its terms and conditions the Union now has to report on\nits bar and catering operations to this committee.\nConference and Catering Service Management Committee\nA few years ago it was decided that the MDH would be refurbished. If\nCollege did this many people would come here for conferences with the\nresult that their hire fees and food bills would pay for the cost of the re dec. Instead, all of the students that eat in QT and drink in Southside have paid\nfor it.\nComments and reflections\nOtherwise known as the depraved ranting s of a cynical old fool.,.\nDave Williams.\nP.S. Thanks for the help and support of everyone I have had the pleasure\n(that certainly narrows it down!) of knowing and working with this year.\nFor the moral guidance of Justine and immoral mis guidance of the '22 Club.\n\n"

    "content": "The Punisher\nThe guy with the red pants and blue tights didn't do\nit. The vegetable man didn't do it. The dark guy with\nthe pointy ears and black cape did. Yes, Batman has\nunleashed a flood of super-hero based movies on us.\nThis Punisher movie is only the vanguard of a whole\nseries of releases. Captain America is next, with\nrumours of Thor, Dr. Strange, Spider-man, Wolverine\nand X Men to come. Comics themselves are just\nbeginning to gain a sort of begrudging respectability\nin this country, but we are still well behind the French\non this, who regard comics (band es des sine e) as one\nof their official art forms. There have been many\nThe Barbican Centre may occasionally have a good\nidea for a theme for a cinema season. This probably\nisn't it.\nThe only reason for staging the films appears to be\n'to complement Barbican Art Gallery's exhibition' by\na Polish painter, Jacek Malczeski. One feels they\nwould also have staged a series of concerts by Polish\ncomposers if only the South Bank hadn't beaten them\nto it with their Szymanowski season.\nHang on a minute, there might be a better reason:\nthe 'films reflect some of the concerns, struggles and\ntriumphs of Polish film-makers since the Second World\nWar'. This presumably explains why one pre-war film\nhas been included. Was this selection of films\ndreamed up after a particularly liquid lunch?\nIf you skip the 'theme', which is misleading and\nprobably a deterrent, there are rich pickings here. The\nLoverboy\nWhenever a pizza firm receives an order for a pizza\nwith extra anchovies the loverboy goes to work. Not\nonly is Randy Bodek a delivery boy he is also a working\nmale prostitute. This is, after all, Beverly Hills.\nThe customers are unhappy rich wives and they\nshow their appreciation by paying for his return to\ncollege. He wants to go back to college to get back\ntogether with his girlfriend. The plot, however,\nthickens and confounds as his father thinks he is gay.\nThis all sounds like a good basis for a comedy but\nit falls wildly short of the mark. The director, Joan\nfactors in this transformation, including seminal works\nsuch as Watchmen, adult comics like the UK's Crisis\nand even the slow, steady work of writers such as\nChris Claremont on books as Excalibur, X Men and\nNew Mutants. Unfortunately films so far have not\nreally reflected this. How does the Punisher fare?\nWell, fundamentally the background is the same.\nMan goes on punishing mission against criminals after\nsome gangs kill his family. The details vary somewhat.\nIn the comics he was a Vietnam vet, not a cop. His\nfamilies death was an accident not a planned attack.\nThese changes actually make the character work\nbetter on screen than the original would have. Another\nastute move was abandon the standard super-heroic\nskin tight costume to more likely combat attire.\nThe emphasis is slightly different too. Between\nnumerous scenes of gratuitous violence (Dakka-Dakka-Aaargh-Splatter-Thunk) we have a portrait of\na man tipped over the edge by the deaths of those\nhe loves. He lives in the sewers and has a rather\ndeviant tendency to meditate in front of candles while\nasking God if his actions are right ('I haven't had an\nanswer yet. Until I do, the guilty will be Punished').\nHis ex-partner is pursuing him in an attempt to repay\nFrank's aid with overcoming a slight propensity\ntowards alcoholic over indulgence. He is compelled\nto actually aid his enemies to help the innocent\nchildren (a a ah). There is also a plot. Something about a gang war\nand the Japanese Yakuza (like the mafia, but older)\ntaking over. Its not actually terribly relevant, being\nmerely an excuse for The Punisher to shoot things in\nprogrammers have tried to contrast the films of\nseveral directors who have produced work both in\nPoland and in 'exile'. Whether the films chosen\naccurately reflect the changing concerns of the\ndirectors because of their 'exile' is debatable.\nHowever the season starts with a strong programme\nfrom Roman Polanski [Knife in the Water and\nRepulsion, June 8th) and Andrzej Wadja [A Generation, Kanal and Ashes and Diamonds, June\n10th). There are also films from Krzysztof Kieslowski,\nwhose films based around the Ten Commandments\nare currently being show on television [A Short Film\nAbout Love, June 9th, Camera Buff, June 16th and\nA Short Film About Killing, June 30th). Whether the films accurately reflect what has been\ngoing on in Poland over the last forty years is\ndebatable. Many claim to draw analogies between\nbetween his agonising.\nRight. What do we have then? A dark and grim\nworld, a bit like Batman's Gotham City but more\nrealistic, with a well motivated hero providing the\nspecial effects people a chance to indulge themselves\nwith the deaths of some reasonably well motivated\nbaddies.\nActually its quite an impressive film for its genre,\nfar superior to the glut of Stallone/Schwarzenegger\nfilms, and a treat for (Over-18) comic fans.\nAdam T.& Present\ntheir subject matter and Poland today (eg Danton, July\n1st) and some of them are attempts to recreate an\natmosphere of poverty and deprivation [A Woman On\nHer Own, 17th June). The choice of many films from\nthe fifties and sixties certainly suggest that they are\ngood enough to stand the test of time as films as well\nas social statements.\nThis season is worth a look if you like to have your\nthoughts provoked, although I strongly suggest you\nignore the artificial links and simply enjoy some\nexcellent cinema. The films are shown on Fridays,\nSaturdays and Sundays from 8th June to 1st July in\nCinema 2 at the Barbican Centre. Tickets cost \u00a33.50\n(\u00a32,50 concessions) per film and there are subtitles\nfor the non-English films.\nLiz W Film\nMicklin Silver, seems to be too busy getting across\nthe message that men are a load of bastards, and all\ntheir wives want is a bit of romance (even if it has\nto be bought). She may have a point but the film isn't funny enough, relying on a more physical comedy and\na flying piano.\nA funny few minutes when the husbands find out\nand the hero nearly sells himself out to his mother but\nit gets confused as well. Loverboy has opened, but\nquite frankly, don't bother.\nMark Wilde.\nPage 3\nPolish Cinema: Past\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\nCongratulations to everyone who submitted an annual\nreport on time. The reports in this issue go to the\nannual general meeting of the union in June. I hope\nthat this meeting will not back down and allow\nofficers who have not handed in a written report to\nreport verbally. Officers were requested to hand in\ntheir reports for this week in the last set of council\nminutes as well as last week's issue of FELIX; I do\nnot believe the meeting should accede to the usual\nwhines of 'not knowing about it,' in these\ncircumstances. The only report which I find\nparticularly notable by its absence is that of the\nAcademic Affairs Officer (AAO). The work of the AAO\nshould influence everybody's courses (whether it does\nor not varies between departments]. The fact that an\nofficer of this importance has not produced an annual\nreport is disgusting.\nInternal Affairs\nNeil McCluskey has written to FELIX this week to\ncomplain at my treatment of Fiona Nicholas in last\nweek's FELIX. I am not going to drag over last week's editorial, this is not what I see as being at stake. Neil\nhas made veiled threats of something far more sinister\nthan just crying libel. He has decided to make this an\ninternal matter. What does he mean by this?\nLast Friday saw hasty talks in the Union Office.\nAmongst the w hinges and whines were threats to\nstop the funding of FELIX for the rest of this year and\nto stop my wages. So much for IC Union encouraging\na free press... The old chestnut of 'Make the FELIX\neditor report to a UGM,' almost certainly cropped up.\nThe view is one which is widely held by most\nPresidents who are incapable of bearing any criticism\nof the Union or its sabbaticals.\nImperial College Union would like to be able to\ngovern its own newspaper. 'We pay for it, so we\nshould have control over it!' they always cry. The\nquestion which always crops up is, who is 'we'? The\nbunch of beau roc rats who term themselves 'The\nUnion,' or the students of Imperial College? It is a sad\nfact that 'Union General Meeting, or UGM' now\nmeans 'A group of about 50 or so hacks who turn up\nto gas off their bigot ted ideas.'\nIf a FELIX editor is required to report to UGMs he\ncan also be forced to do things by one. How long\nwould it be before FELIX was 'mandated' to print\nevery clubs article it received (unedited) and every\nbox-ad it received from the Union, no matter what the\nspace limitations were? FELIX would become 'The\nUnion Advertiser,' with page after page of clubs and\nads. The news would be centred around the headline\n'Well done IC Union, another winning idea,' and the\neditorial would be vetted by the Union President.\nSounds unbelievable? Take a look at a number of other\nstudent newspapers around London. Most of the\ncontents of them concern their unions' policies and\nmeetings-even the clubs become second to the egos\nof the Union Officers.\nI could never accept a move to make the FELIX\nEditor a PR man for the Union. FELIX is not here to\ntell the students what a wonderful thing their union\nis, when it isn't. The fact is, that the union is becoming\never more secretive about its internal affairs. More and\nmore documents are labeled 'confidential' and hidden\naway. Last year's budgets and actual spending are\nheaded 'confidential' in the paper they are in, for\ninstance. Students have a right to know about the\nfinancial affairs of their union if they want to. If FELIX\nis gagged by allowing the editor's hand to be forced\nby a UGM, who will be able to report and comment\nupon these matters?\nA rather sudden Council\nThe Union has called a rather sudden meeting of\nCouncil, its second highest body to a UGM. I do not\nknow what will appear at this meeting, but I have a strong suspicion that the aforementioned old chestnut\nwill come into it somewhere. If you are a member of\ncouncil and you oppose a state control of the press\nat IC, I would ask you to come to the meeting on\nMonday to let Mr McCluskey know what you think\nof the idea. The underhand approach of it all, sums\nup my fears for the future without a free press.\nWine tasting\nLast week's FELIX carried a news story on the national\nwine tasting competition at IC. The comments of the\nOxford team were those of a few drunken bad-losers\nin my opinion. The event was very successful and not\na fix, as the Oxford team complained. Congratulations\nto Kevin McCoen and IC Wine Tasting for winning the\ncontest, which they deserved after several years of\nwinning the Peter Dominic national tasting\ncompetition for universities. Sorry to everyone\nconcerned for last week's article, which I felt, on\nreflection, was somewhat negative.\nFELIX is published by the editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union\nPublications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit,\nPrince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel. 071 -589 5111 ext 3515).\nEditor: Dave Smedley, Business Manager: Jeremy Burnell.
