    "content": "10 INTERVIEW 29\nthe electric c,a$ Jeff Mills has long been described as the most\nimportant name in techno. His DJ sets incorporate the deft use of up to sixty records an hour.\nPeople use the word' god' to describe the musical abilities of this man. Yet deep down he feels\nit is all about depth and a sort of spirituality. ]eff\nis on a mission, yet he claims not to know why he does what he does. I had a rare opportunity\nto talk to the man behind the myth...\nFor people reading who don't know who\nyou are, can you explain who you are and\nwhat you do with music.\nI'm originally from Detroit and I make electronic music for a living...as an art. I create. I 've\nalso been DJing for seventeen, eighteen years.\nCan you describe your DJing style for people who're listening? How you like to express\nyourself...\nIt's like a collage of music within a certain\ntime frame. So what you hear is not the complete full length of the composition but maybe\nparts of it, at times.\nSo you're putting things over each other to\ncreate a sort of layered-effect?\nYes. Like painting which is a collage of\ncolours.\nWhy do you choose to express yourself\nwith electronic instruments?\nIt's the most convenient way for me to be\nable to lay down the idea. I'm not a musician\nwhere I 've studied to play the guitar or the\npiano so 1 use a different type of vehicle to create music.\nA lot of electronic musicians choose to\nbecome DJs. How was that for you?\nI started off as a DJ and over time I began to\nunderstand, after listening to so many records\nfor so long, that maybe I should try to begin to\nmake music myself. So I did and for having such\na long background in playing music 1 found it\nquite easy to make it. Once you learn simply\nhow to make it, then you can figure out how to\nmanipulate it and have it do things that you want it to do or make the machines do exactly\nwhat you want them to do. So that was the\nprocess.\nYou say that you could make the machines\ndo exactly what you wanted them to do. Do\nyou think that you've made tracks where you\ncould step back and say, \"Yes. This is exactly\nwhat 1 wanted to express with this track!\"?\nYes. Many. Many of them. Can you explain some of the things that\nyou have expressed through your music?\nWell I think first you have to have an idea\nbefore you sit down to make music. Then you know eventually where an end is. Because you'll\nhear it and then you'll say, \" OK that's it and I'm finished with it.\" If you have no idea then of\ncourse you'll never understand where the end is.\nWhat usually happens is that I 'll have an idea of\na concept or a place or a person. That is the\nbasis of the release. The individual tracks are the\nelements that make up the release itself. That's when I begin to break down from colour to\nsound; from depth to sound. I relay all these\nthings to sound.\nIs it easy to translate these things from\ndifferent media?\nIt is easy if you construct your own scale.\nLike for me red is hot; high frequency. Blue is\ncool. Black is very low, subsonic frequencies. So\nif you create your own scale then yes it is easy.\nAnd there isn't just one scale. That's the creation of the producer.\nIf you made a record based on a concept\nthat you had imagined and you played it to\nme and I interpreted something different\nfrom it, then would you be disappointed?\nNo. My main purpose is that you heard it\nand you had a reaction. That you were moved in\nsome way, whether it was negative or positive,\nthe fact is that it affected you somehow. Are you ever interested in what other people saw in your records? Or do you just want\nto see them being moved?\nIndirectly. Because I would not want that to\naffect me the next time I sit down to make\nmusic.\nSo would that affect you?\nIt might. And I'm usually afraid of that. For\nexample when someone comes up and says\n\" Wow! You're the best DJ and blah blah blah.\"\nEven if they all came back to you, not one\nsold? Wouldn't that mean something to you?\nWouldn't that affect you in some way?\nIt would make it more difficult for me to put\nout the next record, but it doesn't mean that I would not put out the next record.\nBut would you not feel that if no one was\nbuying it, no one was liking it?\nThat was never really the case. I mean there\nhave been many releases, or I 've made releases\nthat I 've never released because I felt that I didn't need to release it. I actually made white\nlabels of Cycle 30 and gave those to DJs and\nafter I'd given out fifty copies I felt that the job\nwas done and I came very close to not releasing that release.\nWhy did you feel that over something that\nyou have actually released?\nIt was a conceptual release. It was based on the thirty year cycle that we as humans live in.\nThis cycle where things regurgitate over years;\nfashion, trends, political situations and every-thing. I got a very early indication, just from the\nDJs and the producers that really wanted to\nhear this.\nIt was almost as if I'd come up with a theory and just needed the right people to hear it so\nthat they might create something similar to it.\nThat's another way to release music. To release\nan idea. So not to release it directly from the\nperson to people, but from the person to\nanother person and then to the people.\nWhen you're DJing you're creating a col-l age. Are you trying to create this piece of art\nsingle-mindedly or are you just thinking,\n\"Well they want to dance, so I 'll make them\ndance.\"?\nNo. Those elements, the dance elements\ncome second in the Axis material. The idea\ncomes first, then the structure and then 1 feel I should make it dance able. So it actually comes\nsecond or maybe third. In the Purpose Maker\nmaterial it comes number one.\nCan you tell us a bit about the designs you\nuse on the Purpose Maker releases?\nThe logo is a hand in the gesture of either\ngiving or receiving. That's basically why I created\nthe label; to give this music for Djs to use. That's why this music was designed, not to be Top 4 0\nhits, but just as a very good solid track that you could play in between those popular tracks. And as I produced the first release I discovered that\nmany DJs used them for the same reason, that\nthere was a gap at that time, that you couldn't even buy this type of music because people just\nweren't making them. So I decided to make\nvery simple compositions for that reason. That's where the title came from, \"I'm making this title\nfor a purpose, and I'm giving it to you. And it's your hand that is receiving.\"\nDo you also feel that it's a form of com-muni cation? Where 1 come from the hand is a symbol of communication in Indian and oriental dance, and gestures can be used to\ncommunicate whole stories. Do you see it as\na form of communicating without language?\nSure. I only speak English and...OK, a little\nbit of French! 1 find it really difficult, as 1 travel,\nto communicate with people. It's almost impossible to relay my true feelings. In some languages it's almost too difficult to describe\nsomething because in English we may not have\nthe words. In Japanese for example they have\nmany subtle meanings for words that we don't even have. Our language is very simple so I think\nthat as communications become more frequent\n1998 INTERVIEW 11\ntalks to Jeff Mills in other words someone from India can talk to\nsomeone from Spain in a matter of seconds -that language might become too much of a nuisance to communicate in the future, that it\nmight be easier to create a completely different\nlanguage. So I thought that maybe just using\nimages without any information exceeds more\nlanguage barriers.\nThe logo was actually the start of it. And I began to apply that in many other ways.\nLooking at these images there is nothing right or\nwrong about them. It's not like if you look at a Van Gogh painting and an art expert comes up\nand says, 'Yes the landscape means this, and blah, blah, blah!\" That means that what I thought\nwas wrong. So it becomes a little too difficult,\ntrying to determine what is right or wrong, so\nlet's just do away with that. Believe what you believe and that's it!\"\nI think maybe that's the reason why techno\nmusic, without vocals, goes so far so fast and hits so many people so quickly. You listen to it\nand you like it or you don't like it, and that's that.\nYou create your art, your collage, in night-clubs. Would you ever consider taking a different style of records and creating different\ntypes of canvasses in other types of situations? Yeah I have. I 've made music for industrial\ncommercials, small films, backdrop music, music for no reason or main purpose at all but\njust for...well I'm lucky enough to have my studio in my home. I live in a gigantic room, to create music just for the day. I get up early in the\nmorning after eating breakfast and I make\nsomething that just plays throughout the day. I keep it going continuously while I'm working or\nmaking my bed or taking a shower. It's just\nsomething that I hear when I want to hear it.\nWhat happens at the end of the day?\n1 turn it off and I lose it. And it's just the\nmusic for that day. It's just for me. If you're\nlucky enough to make music and have it in the\nsame place where you live you can do this.\n1 read you were once an architect.\nI was studying.\nDoes this kind of use of structure and\nform and light come into what you are doing\ntoday? Could you describe yourself maybe as\na sound architect?\nDifficult for me to determine that.\nDo you think that sound can change the\nappearance of an interior or surrounding, not\nsuperficially but in your mind's eye? As if you\nwere translating colour into sound...\nYeah sure. It's the application of elevator\nmusic. They do that for a reason. It's to make\nyou calm after that terrible meeting. It could be\nlike, say, ambient music which has a really great\napplication if it were applied. 1 think in years it\nprobably will be. It's designed for a specific purpose and that's to make you calm down. If you were on tour and you had the same\nbag of records, and you went to two clubs on\ntwo consecutive nights would you play a different type of set based on the layout and\nsize or appearance of the club?\nNo. Usually it's based on the people. The\ntype of people that they are; how many men, how many women; how many people are sitting\naround the wall; how many people are in the\nback; how many people are actually dancing.\nSo if many people were sitting around the\nwall would you dare them to dance? Would\nyou be more aggressive or would you start off\nslowly?\nSlowly because they're waiting for some-thing. Also how hot it is; what the humidity is\nlike; the distance from the DJ booth to the pe o ple; the type of lighting. This all happens as I'm walking from the door to the booth in a matter\nof minutes.\nI never forget that the people paid to get in\nand they paid to have a good time. That's number one. And then what I would like to play for\nthem comes second. I'm only there because the\npeople asked me to be there. So I need to make\nthem feel comfortable as quickly as possible. So\nI need to let them know that it'sO K to come to\nthe dancefloor. I think over years you just begin\nto know people and how they act and club life.\nDo you think there are people who are\ncapable of liking your music but are afraid of\nthe term techno. Maybe it produces a negative image in their mind. Do you know how to\ntake the music out to those people?\nI think there's a lot of misconception about\nwhat it is in the media. Y 'know techno is this\nhard noise. What it is...it's the process of trying\nto create something that is in the future. Some\ntype of feeling. It's not necessarily music of the\nfuture, but it's the process of trying to create\nsomething. So what you're hearing is young people trying to make something that is of\ntomorrow.\nSo this process is really unclear. It's really\ndifficult to define exactly what techno is\nbecause we're still trying. We're still trying to\ndefine exactly what the structure is. It's not a909 drum machine, it's not a303 sound. We thought it was that. It's not a808. That's actually what techno is. It's the process of trying to\nmake future music.\nFrom the records you've listened to, say\nten years ago, how close do you think they\ncame to what we have now (ie what is the\nfuture for them)?\nYes some people were right on the money.\nComputer world! Y 'know? Pocket calculator.\nSome people were off, some people were on. Look at some movies. I watched 2001 Space\nO dy see last night: Stanley Kubrik was on the\nmoney.\nIn your personal opinion, do you think\nthat one day people who learn about the history of music might learn about jazz artists\nsuch as Miles Davis, and then follow straight\non to techno-jazz artists such as Carl Craig\nwho aren't really accepted jazz musicians at\npresent?\nSure. 1 think the situation is that we need\nmore time for us to get older and then get in a position to be able to preserve the things that\nwe loved when we were younger. It's too soon\nfor us to do that. The music is still too new. Who will be remembered and who won't?I can think\nof some people...\nYou say that you are fuelled by emotion,\nyet music made by computers is often criticised as cold and emotion less. Don't you\nthink it strange that we use computers which\nare logical machines to convey our emotions?\nIt's not the machines that make the music.\nIt's the person. It's just like an ink pen or a type-writer. You can write using a typewriter, but it's the words that you type that create the emotion\nnot the typewriter. In other words it'show you use the equipment. The machine doesn't have a brain. It can't think, at lease not yet. It's just a tool with wires or knobs. If you have a bad idea,\nthe equipment will relay your bad idea; if you have a brilliant idea and you use it correctly then\nit's done!\nHow do you stay focused?\nIt's easy. I know which direction I'm going in.\nI know I'm going to make electronic music for\nmy life; not house, not reggae but techno. So I can run faster because I know the things that I need to be able to goon this road. I know that\n1 need a studio so I can make the music faster,\nI know that I need to travel so 1 can see as many\npeople as possible, I know that, with every new\nrelease, I need to think differently, I know I need\nto keep up with what is new in the world in\nterms of trends and technology and fashion and\nthe way people think. So I know the things that\nare of interest in my career or craft.\nal;ck.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 29 May 1998\nResidents Say No\nto Diana Memorial\nED SEXTON\nOver 250 Kensington and Chelsea\nresidents demanded that plans\nfor a 'Diana memorial garden' are\nscrapped at a public meeting last\nTuesday evening.\nThe garden of remembrance for\nDiana, Princess of Wales, has been\nplanned since last year; the Royal\nParks Agency submitted proposals to\na government committee last\nDecember. Although exact\ndetails have yet to\nbe finalised, the garden is thought to\nconsist of sixteen\nacres of flowerbeds\nand walkways within\nthe grounds of\nKensington Palace.\nA special garden for\nchildren and areas for leaving personal tributes [toilets? -Ed] are likely to feature among the attractions.\nThe plans came under attack at\na special public meeting in\nKensington Town Hall on Tuesday\nevening. Most residents, re mem bering the chaos caused in the area\nlast September when Kensington\nPalace became an impromptu shrine, fear that the garden will\nattract thousands of tourists and\nthus increase traffic and pollution\nin what is already a congested\narea. Art critic Brian Sewell, one of\nmany celebrity residents of\nKensington, commented to the\nBBC that \"the garden will be\ntacky... simply a focus for silly\ntourists\". These 'silly tourists'\ncould reach numbers of five million\npeople a year. Alan Clark, MP for\nKensington and Chelsea, was less\ncondemning in his\ncomments, but did\ncomplain that inform ation was not\nreadily available concerning the garden's design.\nThe nature and\nuse of Diana's me mory in memorials and\ncommercial projects\nare not exactly new\nissues. Only this\nweek a British\nwoman set up five\n'Diana Memorial Tours', designed\nto take visitors by coach around\nthe sites of London that featured\nmost in the Princess' life, including\nher favourite shops and gym nasi um. The company was set up with\nthe approval of the London Tourist\nBoard: If the planned memorial\ngarden goes ahead, Kensington\nHigh Street will have much more to\nworry about than five extra\ncoaches.\nAlan Clark is not amused\nNews in Brief...\nA TEST OF PURE\nEciSMTtww\nA new ecstasy testing kit,\ndesigned to test the purity of the\nillegal drug, has come under\nheavy criticism from the drugs\nczar Keith Hellawell. The test,\nwhich will be available to the general public, detects the presence\nof several chemicals in tablets,\nincluding MDMA, and provides\ninformation concerning the\neffects of the drug.\nKeith Hellawell, speaking on\nBBC Radio 4's Today Programme,\ncalled the test \"a step too far\",\nclaiming that even pure ecstasy\ndamaged all parts of the system.\nHe was also of the opinion that\nusers took other drugs to counteract the effects of ecstasy, and\nthat the kit would encourage drug\nuse.\nTony Puglio, one of the kit's inventors, dismissed these claims,\npointing out that such a kit could\nsave lives. As yet no research has\nshown conclusively that MDMA causes long or short term dam age, and many of the arguments\nboth for and against use of the\ndrug are based on mere\nspeculation.\nFELIX ON THE\nMOVE In order to make way for the\nUnion's dBs development, Felix\nwill be vacating its offices in the\nNorth West corner of Beit Quad. On5 June, the last issue to be\nproduced from the current\npremises will be released, and the\noffice will be moved temporarily\nto the Clubs and Societies\nResource Centre, behind the\nUnion Offices. All enquiries\nshould be made there, and email\nand telephones should work as\nnormal.\nDuring the summer, Felix will\nmove again, this time to the south\nside of Beit Quad, where it will\nremain until next year.\nThe last issue of the year will\nbe on 24 June.\nUNION AGM\nThe Annual General Meeting of Imperial College Union will take\nplace TODAY at 12.30pm in dBs. Everyone is entitled to attend and\nto vote. All union officers will be presenting reports and will all be\nsubject to questioning. BE THERE.\nBrabazon Basement Falls Foul of the Floods\nCLARE ASHWIN\nResidents of Brabazon House,\none of the Charing Cross halls of\nresidence in Pimlico, had their\ndedicated revision schedule interrupted on Tuesday when the\nbasement level of the building\nflooded due to the heavy rains.\nOne of the students returned to\nhis room in the middle of the afternoon to find a large volume of\nwater outside his door. Upon opening the bathroom door, he\nfound water gushing from the overflowing toilets. The water spread\nquickly and residents on upstairs\nfloors were rounded up to help\nbasement residents evacuate their\nrooms.\nIt soon became a race against\ntime to empty the contents of the\nseven rooms affected by the flood.\nComputer equipment, clothing,\ntextbooks, CD players and files of\nnotes began to pile up in the basement library, but it became apparent that the library too was in danger of becoming submerged. The\ntransfer of items to higher floors\nbecame a priority as belongings\nwere hurriedly thrown into bags.\nEmpty rooms on the floor above\nwere opened up and used as\ndeposit points. The water was\nthrown up by the drainage system,\nunable to cope with the heavy rain-fall. Water levels almost reached\nthe height of the windowsills outside and it was feared that the\nwater would start to come in\nthrough the windows if the rain\ncontinued. Sandbags and piles of\nsheets were used as barriers\naround the doors but to no avail.\nNicholas Waters, the first resident to discover the flood, was dismayed to see his carpet floating.\nResidents not in the building when the flooding occurred returned to\nfind their belongings scattered\naround the hall and their bedrooms\nankle deep in drain water. The flow\nof water headed towards the boiler\nroom, fracturing hot water pipes\nunder the pressure and leaving residents throughout the building\nwithout hot water. The electricity\nfailed but was later restored to the\nupper floors of the building. A team arrived to pump the water\nfrom the flooded basement.\nStudents affected were placed in\ntemporary rooms and left to locate\ntheir scattered belongings and\nassess the damage. \"Welcome to\nBrabazon aquarium\" commented one student.\n\n"

I suspect it'son the\ninstruction of their deluded editors that regard it\nas a concession to what I suppose are now called the house spouses of the nation.\nThankfully unburdened by such constraints, you will hear no mention of white suits, kitsch pixies\nor St Christopher's at 7 pm on Thursday 4 June\nwhen Imperial College Radio broadcasts its\nrecent interview with Mr Bell. What you will hear\nare the thoughts of a man who spent over three\ndecades reporting from the world's bloodiest\ntrouble spots; a man who challenged the fourth-safest Tory seat in the last election - and won. On the 31 August this year, the BBC's infamous war correspondent turned MP will be\nsixty. He was educated in Cambridge - first at\nLeys School and then at King's College where he\nread English. But achieving a double first had its\ndownside. For Bell, college wasn't three years of\nlate nights and later mornings at the taxpayers'\nexpense. \" My parents really seldom had two coins to rub together,\" he says, \"I owed them a lot because they really sacrificed for my e duca tion.\" As a result, he worked harder than he\nneeded and missed out on much of college life.\nL Bell joined the BBC after college and went\non to report from over 70 war-torn countries.\nPart of me considers it an unenviable experience, one that must harden you to human suf-fe ring.\" I think rather the reverse\", explains Bell.\n\"It sort of makes you aware of the blessings that\npeople who haven't been in these places sometimes take for granted.\" Apart from a very physical injury from flying shrapnel in Sarajevo, Bell is\nadamant, to the point of persuading himself\nthat war has not scarred him:\" I like to think it\nhasn't done me any harm. In fact, I have to.\" Yet\nwhile Bell has survived, his two divorces suggest\nthe war correspondent lifestyle claimed casualties of its own. Last year Bell quit the BBC to stand in the\ngeneral election at Tatton. Was he used as a pawn to return a tactical vote against Neil\nHamilton? Why did Labour receive his lawyer's bill? How does he see the future of British\nbroadcast journalism? Listen Thursday to find\nout.\nIan\nTHE REAL BLONDE Starring: Mathew Modi ne, Maxwell Caulfield, Catherine Keener, Daryl Hannah, Elizabeth Berkely, Kathleen Turner\nDirector: Tom DiCillo * it\nWeird. Let me say that\nagain. Weird. That's the only way to describe\nThe Real Blonde. Amish mash of\nforties absurd is t comedy and nineties sexual angst topped off\nwith a thoroughly eighties cast and style, it's a film that's going nowhere in a real hurry.\nThe plot is a somewhat convoluted tale of two out of work New York actors struggling to find \"real\"\nacting parts and their ideal woman, a \"real\" blonde. Queue liaisons\nwith various models and actresses,\nas Modi ne and Caulfield navigate\neither end of the greasy pole.\nWhilst Caulfield lands a lucrative\nrole in a daytime soap, Modi ne is\nforced to work as a waiter while he\nwaits for a break.\nWhether director DiCillio is\nreally trying to parody the spiralling\nidiocy of the glamour industry is\nunclear, and certainly The Real\nBlonde lacks the shameless satire\nof his earlier works like Johnny\nSuede and Living in Oblivion. What\nresults is really just an unsurprising\nromantic comedy, advocating the\none woman philosophy of Modi ne as far happier than Caulfield's string of one-night stands.\nWhat makes the film so strange, however, are the bizzar e cameos which clutter two hours\nworth of celluloid. Christopher\nLloyd'scamp head waiter, Kathleen\nTurner's bitchy agent and Steve\nHer a blonde? I don't think so.\nBuscemi'slu wie director provide\nsome light relief, but the remainder\nare straight from the shelf marked\n\"Quirky Hollywood characters\".\nA prime example comes in the\nform of Elizabeth Berkeley's blonde\nactress/model. Berkley, previously\nseen in those great American cult\nicons Showgiris and Saved by the\nBell, improves on her track record\nand slides effortlessly from dismal\nto merely average on the acting\nscale.\nYet the problem isn't her, it's the role. She is the questionably\nblonde actress who repeatedly\ncrosses Modi ne's path and attempts to lure him away from his\ngirlfriend, played by the sparkling\nKeener. The simple question is\nwhy? She's a beautiful young actress. He' s a miserable, thirty-something, out of work actor. Then\nthere's the questionable point at\nwhich fifty guys mistake her for\nMadonna on the set of a video-shoot. As The Real Blonde so clearly demonstrates, you can take suspension of disbelief way too far.\nIn essence, the problem is that\nthe film boils down to a dozen\npoorly drawn caricatures running\naround the screen in search of hap-pines s. Every model or actress a dumb blonde. Every man is thirty-something, sexually frustrated,\nangst-ridden and desperate.\nThe one \"real\" character comes\nin the form of Modi ne's long-suf-fe ring girlfriend, Catherine Keener.\nShe's a make-up artist (and thus\ncomes into daily contact with yet\nmore dumb blondes and camp arty\ntypes) trying to live her life without\ngiving into the constant harassment\nand lechery that she faces every\nday. Her scenes provide light relief\nto the idiocy that seems to befall all\nthose around her. Sadly, however,\nher story is only given a fraction of\nthe running time it deserves.\nIndeed, the whole thing comes\ntogether more as several individual\nstories rather than as an interweaved whole. Having gone their\nseparate ways early on, Modi ne and Caulfield seem destined never\nto see one another again, and none\nof the characters really seem to\ninter-relate on anything more than\na sexual level. But then, perhaps\nthat's the point the DiCillio, who also wrote the screenplay, is trying\nto prove. D Dave\n\n"

    "content": "16\nFICTION\nBOOKS 29 May 1998\nLIKE, LOVE HATE, ADORE Deirdre Purcell\nT his is a haunting and poignant book, dealing as it\ndoes with the somewhat controversial subjects of date rape\nand the general treatment of young men by society in general. The\nchief protagonist, a young man of\nnineteen, is the youngest brother\nof Angela, a woman who has\nwatched her mother die of an\nunnamed illness, presumably AIDS,\nand seen her family split up and\ntaken into care. James, only two months old at the time of his\nmother's death, was brought up by\nhis fiercely protective and loving\nsister, and has now become a scowling ly handsome young man, who is accused of raping a girl who he claims lead him on. When he is\nconvicted of sexual assault, all hell\nbreaks loose, and he is repeatedly\nbeaten up, sent hate mail and\nwished dead or castrated by an\nincreasingly hostile public. With only one side of the story ever\nheard in the media, the girl's, the\nwhole of Ireland are against him,\nand, except in the eyes of his sis-ter, he can do no right. This book\nalso tracks Angela's family history,\nfrom her dysfunctional childhood,\nto her tentative and burgeoning\nromance with Ken. The story is\nheart-breaking ly honest and extremely painful to read. Half-way\nthrough, I was practically crying, as\nthe whole of Ireland, including\nAngela's so-called best friend,\nPatsy, turns on James with a wish\nto utterly destroy him, and even\nAngela, with her capability to love,\nforgive and understand, is unable\nto see a solution to her troubles.\nThe book is groundbreaking in\nits power and honesty, and its subject matter. It does not pretend to\nbe an easy read, it is challenging,\nand will make you think. This book\nflies in the face of received wisdom and public opinion, and poses\nchallenging and demanding ques-t ions. Why do we show such little\ncare and compassion towards the\ngrowing underclass of young, unemployed men? Why, in a case\nof rape, or sexual assault do we\nonly ever hear the victim's side?\nWhy does the media never spare\nthe families of the alleged ag gres sor? With books like this challenging our perspective on life, I hope\nthat the balance may swing the\nother way slightly, and allow for the\nfeelings of the man to be taken into\nconsideration.\nMelinda Messenger\nPublished by Macmillan\nPrice: \u00a3 5 . 9 9\nJACK FRUSCIAIMTE HAS LEFT\nTHE BAND Enrico Brizzi\nTo be a modern writer, it\nappears that you have to lit-tle, if any, idea about gram-mar, a limited vocabulary, a cynical\nattitude towards life and a good grasp of slang. To heralded as a new JD Salinger, you need to write\na rambling, practically incomprehensible account of someone's life,\nhave it hyped up by the media and\nthen sit back and talk about pop culture. The author of this book has\nbeen hailed as the bologna version\nof JD Salinger, with his quirky, offbeat prose, and his fairly accurate\nportrayal of a disillusioned, generation X Italian teenager. Alex, his\nanti-hero, falls in love with Aidi,\nwho breaks his heart, by refusing to\nbecome his steady girlfriend and by\ngoing to America to study English.\nThat is the plot, in a sentence. If we\nadd to that the boy's musings on\nlife in general, his drop-out friends,\nand his opinions on the other children at his school, we have the\nentire novel. And it's not very good. The book has been effusively\npraised by the media across\nEuropean, Enrico Brizzi has been\nlauded to the skies, and yet, when\nit comes down to it, the hero in the\nbook is a pain, the girl is two-dimensional and the other people\nare stock characters: from the\nDrug-Taker and the Spoilt,\nUnhappy, Misunderstood Rich Boy\nto the Smug, Self-Satisfied Virgins\nand the Boring, Bourgeoisie par-ents. To begin with, 1 was interested in the book as a portrayal of\nItalian Youth Culture today, but\nafter a while, I became bored. By\nthe end of the book, I shrugged,\nand just thought, \"who cares?\" The\nslacker style of writing gets dull\nafter a while, and the book wasn't sufficient to keep me interested for\nany appreciable length of time.\nItalia: nul points.\nTamara Palmer-Tompkinson\nPublished by FFI beat wax Not available yet\nLITERARY PRIZES\nThe Orange Prize For\nFiction\nThis year is the third anniversary of\nthis somewhat controversial prize\nOrange Prize for women writers. As\nthe largest prize for fiction in the\ncountry, \u00a3 3 0 , 0 0 0 , it is often\nthought that the gender restrictions\nshould be relaxed, making the prize\nopen to both men and women. This\nyear, as last, it was won by a Canadian author, Carol Shields,\nwith her book, Larry's Party, a story\nof male angst at the end of the\ntwentieth century. With 7-2 odds in\nher favour, Carol Shields' book\nseemed to be an obvious choice,\ndealing as it does with men; in\neffect offering an olive branch to\nthe opposite sex in apology for\ntheir exclusion. It seems stupid to\npractise this type of segregation in\nthe late twentieth century, and\nthere is a strong possibility that the\nprize will be opened to both sexes\nduring the next few years. Certainly\ncritics are becoming hostile on the\nsubject. In my opinion, however,\nthe segregation is a good idea, and\nI would like to see an equivalent\nprize being offered to male novel-is ts. In this way, the books can be\njudged purely on their merit, and\nnot on any gender bias. Men and\nwomen tend to write about different topics, each deal with life in\ntheir own way, and it is interesting\nto compare styles and ideas. With\nseparate prizes, more books will be\nbrought forward into the public\neye, and genuinely talented writers\nwill be given some publicity, with\nlimelight hog gers like Martin Amis\nand Will Self put aside.\nThis year the shortlist consisted\nof Pauline Melville's The\nVentiloquists Tale, Deirdre Purcell's Love Like Hate Adore, Kirsten Bakis'\nLives of the Monster Dogs, Ann Patchett's The Magician's Assistant\nand Anita Shreve's The Weight of\nWater, as well as Carol Shields'\nLarry's Party. Each book is as powerful and evocative as each other,\nand all will be reviewed in Felix in\nthe next few weeks.\nThe International IMPAC\nDublin Literary Award\n\"Voices change slightly when\nthey speak a language not their\nown\" Javier Marias\nThe International IMP AC Dublin\nLiterary Award is the world's richest\nliterary prize for a work in the\nEnglish language, with nominations\nfrom around the world. It was inaugurated in 1996, and at \u00a3 100,00, is\nan extremely prestigious and lucrative prize to win. The winner, Herta\nMuller with The Land of Creen\nPlums, was announced last\nWednesday. Ironically, this is the\nonly book on the shortlist that is\nnot available in the UK, although\njet-setting types can buy it when\nthey next pop over to New York.\nThe shortlist this year consisted of:\nMargaret At wood's Alias Grace,\nAndre Brink's Imagings of Sand,\nDavid Dabydeen's The Counting\nHouse, Jamaica Kincaid's The\nAutobiography of My Mother, Earl\nLovelace's Salt, Lawerance\nNorfolk's The Pope's Rhinoceros,\nGraham Swift's Last Orders and\nGuy Vanderhaeghe's The\nEnglishman's Boy, as well as Herta\nMuller's The Land of Green Plums.\nThese will be reviewed in Felix in\nthe new term.\n\n"

    "content": "29 May1998 MUSIC 9\nCLUBSCENE\nWhat's In The Box ?\nA new Monday night experience is about to hit the city, kicking off on the 1 June @ the Clinic, Gerard Street, Nr Shaftsbury Avenue. This is not\njust another D8JJ night featuring the same old DJs as you hear everywhere. This night dares to be different bringing you the best of the new\nbreed, the next generation of DJs. Nice to see someone giving the up & coming guys 'n' girls a chance.\nSSKSSSP BOX BASS BEOO\nT his isn't just a blatant plug for a new night,\nthe reason I'm mentioning, well, featuring\nthis new night is that the people involved\nare taking the scene one step fur-ther. They will be broadcasting live\nfrom the club to all round the world\nthrough the internet. And after last\nweek's mission deep into the\nunderworld of pirate radio, I though this week I'd stay on the\nright side of the law for a change\nand play things a little, well, a lot\nsafer.\nYes this new night is going to be\nbroadcast live over the internet\nfrom the Interface pirate radio site\n@ http://interface.pirate-radio.co.uk so anyone anywhere in the world with a PC and internet connection can log on and see how we do it\nin London town, the heart of Drum &. Bass some would say.\nInterface doesn't just broadcast D&B but\ncovers the pha test underground beats ranging\nfrom Techno, Garage, Drum &. Bass and everything in-between, but this time it's legal and it\nreaches the four corners of the globe. Interface\nisn't exactly new as it's been going for about a year now, but it's a new method of people getting together, talking and meeting. It not only\nbroadcasts sound live but also includes live\nvideo footage.\nInterface is being hailed by many as the next\nstep forward for the scene, making pirate radio\nlook very limited in comparison. But that said\nthey have no need to worry at the moment as\nonly a small percentage of the people wanting\nto hear this sort of music have the capabilities to\nreceive it where as everyone's got a radio. But\nas time progresses, and the internet becomes\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\ncheaper and more accessible to the general\npopulation it's bound to have a large impact.\nThe man behind The Interface is DJ Mad C VH RY MONDAY MIGHT@ THE CLINIC13 Geraitf SI Chinatown. SOHO, W1.\nLd>VL \u2014 . -Ash, who ran Heart FM and then Face FM. From\nthese pirate stations Ash meet up with club promoter and on-line anarchist Howard Jones. They\nb lagged a load of software and started Interface\n- broadcasting 24hrs a day over the net. Now, a year later, they have state-of-the-art equipment and an average of 8 0 , 0 0 0 listener a week,\nwith some 6,000 at any one time.\nI meet up with Paul Ibiza, who's involved\nwith Interface and is promoting The Box, which\nis going to be broadcast live over the net.\nI asked him: What is it all about?\nIt's a new way of learning what's going on. It's like the pirates, but with pirates you don't know who you're running with, or who's controlling it - gangsters and all that yeah. With\nInterface it's much safer first it's totally legal as\nanyone \u2022 can put information on the net.\nSecondly it's very expensive to set up therefore\nyou need big business backing it. What you get\nis not just the music but also live pictures so it's really a mini television. It a safe way to move\naround, I 've been following this crowd for some\ntime now and there safe, a nice bunch. This is\nthe future ya know, as time goes on\nmore and more people will get connected up and it will naturally take\nover.\nWhat DJs can we expect to hear\nplaying on Interface?\nIt's not about the big boys, it's about giving people like you a chance. They [big names] have\npriced themselves out of it, charging\n\u00a3 3 0 0 - 4 0 0 an hour. I can't afford\nthat, and ultimately it comes back on the punters who have to pay inflated\nprices to go out. So what we're doing is giving\npeople like you a chance, you comedown bring\na few people spread the word and all that and if\nall the DJs bring down a few people we'll have a little party atmosphere going and that's all you\nneed to get things started. It'll build from that.\nWe'll have a camera man running about all\nover the place filming it for the live broadcast,\nso if people can't make it down, they can see\nwhat is going on on your computer screen and\nif they like what they see, they will comedown the next week.\nWe're going to be very strict on the door,\nmaking sure only the right sort of people are\ncoming in, we ain't going to be letting no hoods\nin or any of that. We want to create a pleasant\nparty vibe, no attitude, no hassle.\nIf you fancy checking out this new night just\ndrop me a line on t.j. morgan@ic.ac.uk as I 've\ngot a whole load of guest list places to give\naway. Jo Public\nGA I'i>''', D.O.S.E Crack Man In Bat Den Sex Shock\nStrange title for a strange tune.\nD&B with heavy use of electric guitar - not something I 've ever\nthought would go well together\nand this track reminds me why. The\nunderlying track is actually quite\ngood, if a little hectic, and if most\nof the guitar bits were taken out it\nmight just click as there are a few\nsmall bits where it sounds alright\nbut mainly NO! The other two tracks are in a more hip-hop / downbeat style and\nI like these much more, slowing\nrocking beats that ooze phat ness unpolished rugged breaks and gritty fx. Much more like it.\nFillippa Don't Explain (MCA)\nThe original mix is a totally laid\nback track with a live jazz cafe\nsound deep 'n' moody with the\nexquisite voice and lyrics of Fillippa\ncompleting the experience. Also a livelier mix from Steppa's which is\nat a strange tempo somewhere\nbetween D& JB and downbeat. An intelligent D& VB feel and beat structure but at a slightly slower pace\nprobably to keep the voice of\nFillippa audible which compliments\nthe beats ' n' breaks superbly. One for those easy-going numbers for\nthe summer nights ahead.\nPrime Suspect Case I( Rise 'n' Shine)\nAh ooh ooh eh ooh ooh is full of\nplenty of funky fresh garage groves.\nUsing simply beats but it's the layers of clever key patterns, title\nvocal stabs and key changes that\nget you moving. The Two Step Mix\nalso has the same set up vocals\nand keys, but uses different beats.\nRetro Vibe in a happy happy style\nwith a big piano break that spoils it\nfor me. Finally Dirty Tune is a little\nstorm er Richard Purser has definitely got his key patterns, xylophone sounding bing bongs all\nsorted. I love the way he keeps\nadding little bits of this ' n' that\nsamples etc cutting in and out like\nit's in the mix. Wicked track.\nFull Intention.\nYou Are Somebody?\nDescribed as the undisputed kings\nof disco house, Full Intention bring\nus a uplifting dance track with\ndisco overtones. On the more\ncommercial side of house this track\nhas a pretty lame vocal telling you 'are somebody', but under this\nslightly lame exterior there are in\nfact some rough beats. So if you\ncan handle the lyrics and disco\nsounds this is a well made tune.\nFor the more underground buyer\ntheir are two harder mixes -London mix and the Dark Dub\nwhich has a dark bassline totally\nchanging the feel of the track. Not\nas bad as I though it would be.\nJo Public\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMNS 29 May 1998\nI don't why, but some people in this College\nthink Iam a prophet of\ndoom, incapable of saying anything positive about Imperial,\nsomeone who delights in rubbishing this esteemed institution. As\nyou know, dear reader, this is non-sense. Anyone who has really read\nmy articles will know that any\nattacks on particular parts of IC are\nborne of support and affection for\nthe College as a whole. If money is\nwasted, we limit the College's ability to prosper, so a rant against the\ntransgressor is for the greater\ngood. However, I 'll be honest and\nsay that I never thought I would have a good word for the Ante\nRoom exhibitions. Then, as if by\nmagic, some artwork appeared.\nGood artwork. Not the work of an\neducationally subnormal gorilla,\nbut paintings of obvious form and\nartistic insight. The modern 'art'\nthat we have been subjected to\npreviously was devoid of any of\nthe quality present in truly great\ncontemporary work such as that of\nWarhol, Hockney and Lichtenstein.\nThe exhibition has now finished,\nbut hopefully will herald a dramatic upturn in the quality that we can\nexpect. The sensationalist pap exhibited as part of the Lottery bid\nfor the Music and Arts Centre was\nsimply trying too hard, and was\ndisingenuous to even the most\ncasual observer.\nEven though the\nbid is perceived\nby some in Qj\nSherfield to be V dead in the (\"^\nwater, we stand ry>\na better chance\nnow than at any r \u2014\ntime since the\nAnte Room re fur vJ b ish ment, and all CZ.\ninvolved should \u2122be warmly con- if]\ngra tula ted. Now that I have done my nice\ncop bit, it's time for nasty cop.\nWhen I stroll down the stairs in the\nChemistry department, undertaking our daily evacuation, two things occur with absolutely cer-taint y. Firstly, the fire alarm has\nmalfunctioned, rather than indicating the imminent consumption of\nSW7 by an enormous fireball.\nSecondly, at least three people will\nask me to moan about said false\nalarm in Felix. Such is the frequency of this upheaval that it is no\nlonger taken seriously, which, in a building that is packed to the\nrafters with gas\n' cylinders and III flammable sol-vents, is slightly\nconcerning. Recently, the\nalarm failed to\nwork in part of\n| _ J the building,\nj Obviously, 1 am not alone in\nQ experiencing7 jK Lg such d is rup \u2022II \u2014\"\"^ t ions, and some\nf\"\"+ would say that I have a comparatively easy time of it.

No sooner had everyone reached the\n;f the Long My nd on Thursday\nafternoon, than the snow began to\nfall.

Fortunately, there is\na fantastic warm and cosy club-house. With the heavy snow and\nunlikely imminent change in the\nweather,, some attempted to leave\nearly before getting snowed in. It\nwas too late! By the evening, there\nwere snow drifts of 2-3 feet. All\nroads to the My nd were im pass able. This was a blessing in disguise.\nThe brave (some would say\nmad) people of i cGC who made it\nto the My nd this Easter were Andy\nHolmes, Lynsey Geldeard, J.P. Lodge, Mein hard Ober, Charlie\nWilson, Neil Mothe w, Jane and Afandi. Those who planned to camp in tents outside managed to find\nroom in the bunkhouse.\nThe snowfall continued on Saturday. This did not stop us from\nhaving fun. With the CFls Toyota\nLand Cruiser, a long rope, Andy set\nthe ICGC speed record at 25 mph sledging speed record, that is. As\nsoon as the show stopped for fifteen minutes, the hanger doors\nwere cleared a K21 wheeled out.\nwithout wasting a second, the CFI\nwas conducting a test flight to check\nthe conditions. We all managed a short five minute flight each before\nthe weather closed in again.\n.... Things could only get better,\nand they did!

Andy 'Gliding -God'\nHolmes flew 296, the club's Grob\n102, for well over an hour before he\ngot hungry and came down for\nsome lunch. Jane and Afandi had a bit of a go in the single-seater as\nwell. It was a good day for beginners\nalso. I had my two longest flights yet\nand got lots of exercises covered.\nThe retrieve winch was fantastically\nefficient and there was hardly any\nwait to be launched. The recovery of\nlanded gliders was somewhat more\ndifficult in the snow.

    "content": "Inspiration has not been kind this week so I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here. These\ntwo recipes are of my own design and therefore\nfavourites of mine. They're also exceedingly\neasy to make, nice and green and fresh and\nmight even be knocking on the door of he a thy eating. The name Brixton carbonara came about\nbecause I invented it in Brixton and it's got\ncream in.\nOh and by the way, both of these are sauces\nmeant to go with pasta.\nBrixton Carbonara\nYou will need:\n\u00bb 2 rashers of smoked bacon\n\u00ab\" 1 small aubergine\n\u2022* 'A green pepper\n* 2 cloves of garlic\n^ '/za small tub of thick cream\nThe first thing to do is to slice the aubergine and\nthen cut the slices to make chips about W thick. Put them in a bowl and sprinkle with lots\nof salt as usual to remove as much water as\npossible. This will take about half an hour so\ntake your time with the rest of the prep.\nMter\nCut the bacon and the peppers into strips,\ncrush and chop the garlic. This is probably a good time to get the pasta on as cooking the\nsauce won't take very long.\nRinse the aubergine thoroughly in plenty of\nwater, drain it and for best results dry in a tea\ncloth.\nPour 3-4 t bl of olive oil into a pan and heat\nat max power. When the oil starts to smoke put\nthe aubergine, bacon and garlic in together. Stir\nthe mixture continuously so it doesn't stick and\nburn. Turn the heat down and continue to fry\ngently for 10 minutes to make sure the\naubergine is properly cooked otherwise it tastes\nastringent and not nice.\nThen add the pepper (green) and a good pinch of ground pepper (black). Continue frying\nfor another 2-3 minutes and then add the\ncream. Fold this into the mixture, leave until it\njust starts boiling and immediately stir into the\npasta which you've just cooked and drained.\nCourgette Splat\nYou will need:\n\u00ae- 1 courgette\n\u00bb? 'A onion\n*\" 1 clove of garlic\nStart off by grating the courgette with the\nthin side of a cheese grater. Slice the onion as\nfinely as you can and crush and chop the garlic.\nPut enough oil into a frying pan to cover the\nbase and heat up until it smokes as usual.\nThrow in all the ingredients, turn the heat up as\nfar as it will go and stir like mad. The courgette\nwill start to go soft and turn even brighter green.\nMm mm m!Adda large pinch of salt and some\npepper. For an extra layer of flavour add a small\ntablespoonful of chilli sauce (I don't like giving\nproducts free advertising but nobody's given me\nany money and 1 have to say Encona is way\nahead of the competition). Continue stirring\nuntil the courgette has gone limp but not\nmushy, 5 minutes total at most, and all is ready.\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nTechnology vs Art. Place your bets now.\n\"Turn that bloody TV off! Go out\nand get some fresh air! Honestly,\nwe never watched TV in my time!\nWe used to read books! Have you ever actually read a book?\" On and\non goes the tirade of the angry par-ent. Most of the time, this well-rehearsed piece of melodrama is\nused, not for any philanthropic or\ncaring purposes which might genuinely benefit the harassed offspring in question, but for the realisation of more selfish ends. These\nusually fall into the category of\neither a) Ready Steady Cook is on\nand they're wondering what to\nmake for dinner, or b) Richie\nBenaud is demonstrating four different types of leg-spin delivery on\nBBC2 and it's something that the\nbreadwinner of the household has\nalways wanted to be able to do, but\nnever got round to reading a book\nabout it. Perhaps he was too busy\nwatching television. This, however,\njust demonstrates the allure of\ntoday's forms of entertainment\nwhen introduced to youngsters. In\nmodern society, increasingly less\nand less effort is required for one\nto enjoy oneself as the rate of\ngrowth of technology seems proportional to the rate of growth of\nadolescents' waistlines. Middle class pursuits have deviated away\nfrom such cultured leviathans as\nthe theatre, literature, art and sport\ntowards hobbies which are theoretically more exciting and ex hil arat ing, but in practice are probably just\nless hassle. Let's consider a few\ncases in point:-Theatre, you're dead. Willy\nShakespeare, for all his soulful,\ntelling and really very accurate\nanalysis of the human mind, social\nintercourse, love, hate and the rest\nof it, as well as his going a long way\ntowards shaping a definitive version of the English language, would\nprobably spin a full 900 degrees in\nhis grave to learn that kids these\ndays would rather watch\nNeighbours. Although you could\nforward quite valid arguments\nregarding the differing social places\noccupied by light and \"heavy\"\nentertainment, and point out that\nlots of kids still love going to see\npantomimes, my argument might\nnevertheless constitute an explanation as to why arts graduates have\nextreme difficulty getting jobs\ninvolving anything other than\nsquirting ketchup on to100% flame grilled pry on patties. Even\nactors themselves are being\nreplaced by silicon equivalents: the\ncost of the stadium scene from the\nfilm Forrest Gump was reduced\nconsiderably by hiring a fraction of\nthe extras required to fill the s tadi um, putting them in their seats, and\nthen electronically duplicating them\naround the whole arena. Regular\nreaders will also have learned of my\npassion for Resident Evil 2, the\nintro for which is so scar i ly lifelike\nthat within ten years films will probably be made starring digital actors\nindistinguishable from real ones.\nRADA, you have been warned.\nLiterature, you've popped your\nclogs. Although this is not entirely\ntrue (some might say not true at\nall), as virtually everyone I know\nenjoys a good thought-provoking\nread from time to time, I reckon\nthe early bird that is the microprocessor has gobbled up quite a few potential bookworms. The fact\nremains that thousands of playstation s are sold every day, and people playing these must necessarily\nspend less time doing other stuff.\nThe stereotypical computer nerd is\nbut another example of the decaying effect of the computer. 1 was\nonce speaking to a psychology\ngraduate who told me that a study\nconducted into the social effects of\narcade machines showed that\nsome teenagers were forming relationships with their favourite\narcade cabinets which were directly equivalent to the friendships that\nthey really should be making with\nother boys and girls. I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe that Chun-Li is\nreally that good looking.\nThere you have it. Technology,\nlike fire and water, is a fantastic\nlow-cost servant, but a very soul-less, draining and stagnating mas-ter. You lot reading this will g radu ate, and ultimately be responsible\nfor how the above changes are\nimplemented. 1 implore you, here\nand now, to keep the dream alive..\nAll Campbell\n\n"

    "content": "29 May 1998 FILM\nREVIEWS AND COMPETITIONS\nWILD THINGS\nStarring: Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Bill Murray\nDirector: John McNaught on** Vi\nDamn fine cast. Damn silly\nplot. And, er, that about\nsums it up, because Wild\nThings, whilst sounding like boxoffice gold on paper, is ultimately a very disappointing film\nIt's an attempt to produce an\nold fashioned thriller - strong ensemble cast, absolutely no special effects and a plot tw is tier than\na snake that's had a run-in with a corkscrew. Sadly, however, it turns\nout to be a thriller harking back to a different age - the early eighties in\nfact, with long lingering shots of\nsun soaked beaches and scantily\nclad, dripping wet teenage girls.\nThe pre-publicity describes\nWild Things as a hot, sexy thriller -yet even those who go to see it\nsimply on these grounds will be\ndisappointed as the sex scenes are\nrare, brief and as erotic as Prime\nMinister's question time. Oh, and Neve Campbell has a no-nudity\nclause in her contract, so there.\nFor the rest of us, however, the\nplot and acting may be of more\nimmediate concern. Everything\nbegins promisingly as spoilt rich-kid Richards throws herself at\nteacher Dillon, and then accuses\nhim of rape. Dillon finds himself\nstanding alone against the might of\nRichards' family. Sacked, homeless\nand guilty in the eyes of the town, he turns to the one person who will\ndefend him washed up lawyer\nMurray. So far, so good, so pre-dic table. However, now it all starts to get\ncomplicated, as twist after twist tie\nboth cast and plot in knots.\nCampbell adds to the allegations,\nWild Things - girls in tight tops aplenty.\nclaiming that Dillon has raped her\ntoo, and Bacon arrives on the\nscene to investigate. I won't spoil it\nfor you by saying what happens\nnext, suffice to say that at times it\nseems to happen without rhyme\nnor reason.\nIndeed, the chain of events\nleading to the on-screen antics only\nreally begins to become clear as\nthe closing credits roll, and a series\nof flashbacks attempts to explain\nwhat the hell's been going on for\nthe last two hours. .\nSadly, however, all the plot\ntwists come across as utterly point-less. At points the turns come so\nfast that it all becomes laughable,\nand quite frankly we simply don't care about these people.\nRichards smoulders in an utterly predictable way, and doesn't seem too fussy about taking her\ntop off at every available opportunity. Bacon projects his usual cold,\nhard exterior and Dillon is clearly\nup to something from start to fin-ish. Only Murray, in a hilarious\ncameo of a Grisham style lawyer,\nand Campbell, playing against type\nas drugged up trailer-trash shine,\nWild Things is a sad end item ent of that stock phrase \"they don't make them like they used to\". It\ntries to succeed as an old fash:ioned thriller, but ultimately gives in\nand simply tries to cash in on the'\nsex appeal of its young stars....And\nfails.

Then something\ncame to change all that...Yet unlike\nother A list actors, Bacon's big\nbreak came not through a classic\nrole or a part in a Jim Cameron\nflick. No, when I speak of Bacon's big break, 1 speak of course of the\nKevin Bacon game.\nYou see, Kevin Bacon's rise to\ninternational fame has nothing to\ndo with everything to do with\nsome bored American College students and the internet. For as it is\ntold in legend, these students\nstarted trying to link every film in\nthe Universe together, taking Kevin\nBacon as their centre, and for-sooth, a legend was born.\nFor those of you still ig no rant of the game, then checkout www.c s. virginia. edu/~ bc t7m/ bacon. html. As far as actual acting is con-cern ed, however, Bacon's career\nhas been filled with so-so supporting roles. Whilst his performances\nin Sleepers and particularly Murder\nin the First brought some degree of\ncritical acclaim, he has been\nunable to produce consistently.\nMore importantly, however, his\nchoice of roles has frequently let\nhim down. Witness such appa ling mundane films as The River Wild,\nPicture Perfect and this week's Wild Things. He seems too intent\non cashing in on \"star vehicles\"\nrather than promoting himself to\nthe big money leagues.\nWild Things(1998) Telling Lies in America(1997) Picture Perfect(1997) Destination Anywhere(1997 Sleepers(1996) Apollo13(1995) Murder in the First ( 1 9 9 5 )\nRiver Wild, The(1994) A Few Good Men(1992) JFK ( 1 9 9 1 )\nFlatliners ( 1 9 9 0\nTremors(1990) She'sHaving a Baby(1988) Planes, Trains &.

    "content": "29 May 1998\nARTS AND BOOKS\nSWEET CHARITY\nVictoria Palace Theatre\nBOOKS 15\nLegs. What else do you expect\nfrom a musical about prostitutes. L ast year, I had what was\nundoubtedly my finest hour,\nstanding in a very short pink\ndress and knee length boots, holding a sign, with my friends in the\naudience shouting and whistling at\nme, whilst a spotlight flashed on\nme. The reason for this particular\npiece of exhibitionism was the\n1997 Op Soc production of Sweet\nCharity, a stunning performance by\nall concerned, with some amazing\nacting from yours truly. So it was\nwith great excitement, and some\ntrepidation that I cycled madly up\nthe Chelsea Embankment to see\nthe new production of Sweet\nCharity at the Victoria Palace\nTheatre.\nWritten in the sixties, this musical charts the history of Charity\nHope Valentine as she falls in love,\nfalls flat on her face, gets pushed\ninto the lake in Central Park, falls in\nlove, meets a band of dope-s mok ing evangelists, leaves her job as a dance-hall hostess, and gets\npushed into the lake again. The\nscript was adapted by Neil Simon\nfrom a film by Frederico Fellini,\ncalled \"Le not te di Calabria\", or \"The\nNights of Calabria\", about a prostitute who looks for love on street\ncorners, the music was written by\nCy Coleman, and the lyrics by\nDorothy Fields. The musical has\nfaintly satirical tones, with a lot of\njokes against the film stars of the\ntime, especially the stars of trashy\nromantic comedies. There is a hilarious scene where Charity\nbumps into a rapidly fading Bmovie Romeo, and ends up in his\ncloset, watching him make love to\nhis girlfriend. He sings a ballad\ncalled \"Too Many Tomorrows\", which on the surface appears to be\nan ordinary, slightly sickly song, but\nwhen taken in context, becomes highly ironical.\nThis production, directed by\nCarol Metcalf, stars Bonnie\nLangford as the hapless Charity,\nand as predicted, she is in fine\nvoice, and dances with exuberance\nand great skill. In their microscopic\ndresses and perilously high heels,\nthe other Fandango Ballroom Dancers show off their powerful\nvoices and impossibly long legs\nwith great aplomb, snarling and\nyawning their way through \"Big\nSpender\", and dancing aloof ly to\n\"The Rich Man's Frug\" in very little\nblack dresses.\nIt is important to remember\nthat this show is fun, and is not\nmeant to be taken at all seriously. It\nis entertainment of a superior quality. Go on, blow the last remnants\nof your student loan on a trip to see\nthis; if you like silly shows without\nmuch plot, but with great dancing,\nsinging, peerless choreography and\nan ability to have you leaving the\ntheatre singing and floating, then\nyou will love this.\nWith traffic-stopping songs\nsuch as \"Big Spender\", \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\", \"I Love to Cry At Weddings\" and \"Too\nMany Tomorrows\", this show deserves to be as successful as any\nof Andrew Lloyd-Webber's irony-free, saccharine musicals.\nMarilyn Monroe\nTHE MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT\nLARRY'S PARTY\nCarol Shields\nT his is the book that won the\nOrange Prize this year. It's really, really good. I recommend it to everyone, it is a wonderful, thoughtful and enjoyable\nbook. We watch the hero, Larry J. Weller, grow up from a young man\nin his twenties to a late forty-some-thing, and chart his life, through his\ntwo marriages, the birth of his son\nto his coma and his eventual recovery, via his obsession for mazes. As\na young man, he took Floral Studies\nat college, and ended up working\nfor Flowerworld in Toronto, where\nhe'd lived all his life. On his first\nhoneymoon, he and Dorrie went to\nHampton Court, and it was here\nthat Larry's love of mazes was\nborn. After his divorce, he took a course in Garden Design, moved to\nChicago, started his own company,\nremarried and was happy. Then,\nhis wife moved to England, as\nHead of Women's Studies at\nSussex, and they divorced. He then\nmet Carol, and to celebrate both\nhis ex-wives visiting Chicago at the\nsame time, they throw a party.\nPut like this, it doesn't seem at\nall extraordinary. What sets it apart\nfrom the other entries is the\nhumanity and quality of the writing.\nLarry is a real man,- you can see\nhim, ambling along in his old Harris\ntweed jacket, digging up shrubs\nwith loving care, sitting around the\nfamily table with his mother and\nfather, feeling uncomfortable at\nlarge parties, walking up to you in\nthe street and saying \"Hi\". Knowing\nhim, I now feel that I have a much\nbetter idea of men in general, of\ntheir anxieties and the angst they\ncan suffer at certain ages. I loved\nthis book, it is the perfect antithesis to the inelegant and careless\nprose of writers such as Enrico\nBrizzi and that awful Lana Citron\n(Felix 1114). It deserved to win the\nprize, and I hope the author gains\nmore publicity through this book, I can't wait for her next one.\nCiulia Sometimes\nAnn Patchett\nW hat happens to the assistant after the magician\ndies? When she's loved\nhim for twenty-two years, been\nvanished by him, sawed in half,\nmade to hang in mid-air and had\nhim pull rabbits out of her cle av age, does she just hang up her\nsparkly dress, put her tights in storage and get on with her life some-how? When Parsifal the Great\nmagician dies of a brain aneurysm,\ntwo years after his lover Phan dies\nof AIDS, Sabine is left stranded.\nSuddenly, she gets a letter from\ntheir lawyer, explaining that Parsifal\nwas once Guy Fetters from\nAlliance, Nebraska, and his mother\nand two sisters want to meet her,\nhis widow. Shocked, but weary,\nSabine welcomes Parsifal's family\ninto her home, and gradually realises that only through these people\nshe can get to know the man she\nloved. When they return to\nNebraska, she follows them, and\nlearns the reasons behind Guy's transformation to Parsifal and why\nhe depended on her, with the help\nof his faithful lover, the delicate\nVietnamese Phan.\nAnother book on the Orange\nprize shortlist, this is a sensitive\nand delicately written novel, with\njust the right balance of wit and\ncompassion. The tragic widow Sabine, a wife and yet not a wife, is\ndepicted as a strong woman, from\na loving family, who fell in love with\na man who loved men, and\nbecame his right hand woman, loved and trusted by him. Her\ngrowing awareness of her own ability to perform the magic tricks,\ncard-tricks, pulling eggs from pe o ple's ears and her instant acceptance into the family she never\nknew Parsifal had had, help her to\ncope with life without him, particularly as his sister, Kitty, is almost his\ndouble. This is an extremely\nthoughtful novel, poignant and\nevocative; the beautiful description\nof the flatness of Nebraska, and the\ncontrast with Los Angeles bring up\nfamiliar images of differences\nbetween the places in my life. I really enjoyed this book and I rec-om mend it to all displaced persons\nand everyone who likes to see life\nfrom a wider viewpoint.\nElizabeth Martin\n\n"

Services) for 98/99, is\nexpected to resign his post today.\nMr Wharton, a second year\nmaths student, feels certain that he\nwill be asked to re-sit the year, and\nthus will automatically be deemed unable to take up a sabbatical pos i tion. As a result, he has made the\ndecision to resign now, to allow his\nsuccessor to be elected in time to\ntake over from the present in cum bent, Rob Clark, on 1 July.\nWhilst expressing sorrow for Mr Wharton on a personal level, ICU\nPresident Andy Heeps has praised\nthe decision to stand down, rather\nthan waiting until official results are\nannounced in July. However, he\nemphasised that Mr Wharton' s decision to tender his resignation\nrests with him alone, who has\nmade a \"very bold decision, in the\nbest interests of the Union\".\nA decision to await official confirmation of his results could have\nleft the Union in the state of limbo\nit experienced at the beginning of\nthis year, when DP( Clubs fk\nSocieties) elect Smita Chaturvedi\nonly discovered she had failed her\nexams in mid-Summer. The consequent election was thus unable to\ntake place until November 1 1, and\nthe Union found itself one sabbatical short for in excess of two\nmonths.\nMr Wharton's fellow sabbaticals elect also expressed sorrow\nthat he would not be taking up his\nelected office. However, they\nhoped that his decision to stand\naside now, would allow a suitable\nreplacement to be found, to join\nDave Wharton; exam trouble\nthe other victors from FebruaryDave Hellard, Adam Cherington\nand Ed Sexton - as the elected face\nof ICU.\nThe announcement of Dave\nWharton's resignation, made by\nAndy Heeps at on Thursday after-noon, immediately triggers off a fresh round of sabbatical elections\n- the third set in as many terms this\nyear. In the words of Mr Heeps,\n\"Here we go again\".\nAlthough there is insufficient\ntime to run the usual five week\nelection process (with only four\nweeks remaining this term), Mr Heeps is determined to see a full\ncompliment of sabbaticals elected\nbefore the summer, to allow a smooth hand-over between the\nincoming and outgoing officers.\nSpeaking to Felix he made his feelings very clear, \"the position is a vital one which we must fill\".\nConsequently, he will ask an extraordinary meeting of the ICU\nCouncil, convened at today's AGM, to suspend the election regulations. If Council concurs with Mr Heeps recommendation, this will\nallow the normal fortnight of campaigning to be cut to a single week,\nso that elections can be held in the\nfinal week of term. Papers for the\npost will go up next Wednesday\nand will be posted for two weeks.\nThe election itself 'is provisionally\npencilled in for Wednesday and\nThursday 24 and 25 June, producing a final result for the final day of\nterm.\nAlthough rumours of intended\ncandidature s abound, there are at\npresent no confirmed runners.\nAnyone interested in standing\nshould contact Andy Heeps or the\npresent incumbent, Rob Clark, in\nthe Union Office.\nKing's Union Manager Sacked\nED SEXTON King's college student union's( KCLSU) general manager, James\nChirgwin, has finally been sacked\nfor committing numerous\noffences over the past year,\nincluding fraud and drunken\nbehaviour.\nChirgwin had been suspended\nfor five months on full pay before\nbeing sacked, revealed KCLSU's student newspaper, ROAR. On one occasion Chirgwin was so\ndrunk that he refused to leave a building during a fire alarm, despite\nthe presence of the Fire Brigade at\nthe incident. At the time Chirgwin\nwas head licensee of the KCLSU\nbars and was often found drunk in\nunion buildings, endangering their\nlicense.\nOther offences included cashing cheques at the Union, which\nlater bounced, and running up a \u00a3 2 5 0 bar tab in a period of one\nmonth, which he wrote off as \"pro-motion of the union\". He also\nauthorised himself wage advances\nand attempted to cover up his misdeeds by telling one staff member\nto destroy the bar's safe record\nbook.\nChirgwin rarely turned up to\nunion meetings and committed several other minor offences and\nbreaches of union regulations.

    "content": "14\nTHEATRE\nARTS\nSTEINBERG'S DAY OF ATONEMENT Pentameters Theatre\n29 May 1998\nBe warned, you might have\ntrouble finding The\nPentameters Theatre\nLondon's first ever fringe theatre. It\nis in Hampstead, above a pub, and\nis very small. Be careful where you put your feet - the actors may\ntread on you as there is no stage as\nsuch and the whole place is literally about ten-foot square!\nThis unusual intimacy makes for\na very absorbing experience and\nyou'll feel like you are actually part\nof the action. The story is about the\nunlikely friendship between Steinberg, an elderly Jewish teacher\nand Frances Bourne a mother and\nPTA member who has forced his\ncompulsory retirement. It explores\nthe differences between his religious old-fashioned views and her\nmodern, secular ones. As Steinberg\ndisapprovingly puts it, she goes to\nsynagogue, \"once a year and when she's there she talks about her job,\ncar and family holidays\" while he is\ngod-fearing and devout. She visits\nthe retired Steinberg to apologise\nfor what she's done and following\nJewish doctrine, he must forgive\nher, or this will be viewed as committing a sin just as great. Being a man of integrity and religious devo-tion, he duly does so, and a strong\nfriendship develops between them.\nThe characters' opinion of each\nother (and indeed the audience's opinion) changes dramatically as\nthey become confidants. He started as a stuffy, blinkered and cruel\nold man and she as an ignorant,\nrash 'rich bitch' and both became\ncompassionate, intelligent and\ninsightful people. Steinberg's feelings change, however, in a more\nsignificant way. Tormenting himself\nover his 'sin' he starts having night-mares, which we see integrated\ncleverly and smoothly into his\nmonologues.\nThere are only six characters\nand even fewer props. A few chairs\nand a bookcase were used in a variety of ingenious and often humorous ways to let us know what's going on. A lot of imagination is\nrequired on the part of the audience but in fact this makes it more\nstriking.\nAll of the characters are essentially a little caricatured and include\nthe headmaster, a decent, if cowardly man, and the naive and\nextremely comic school secretary.\nAs well as being thought provoking\nand intelligent the play is very witty\nand thoroughly enjoyable.\nSteinberg's Day of Atonement is a moving and sensitive play and you\ndon't have to be religious to get\nsomething out of it.\nGet your tickets now, at \u00a3 6 . 5 0\ncones - it's only running until June\n14th. Judith and Christian\nNAKED The Playhouse Theatre\nMONSTERS OF GRACE The Barbican Centre\nAfter a great battle, a friend of\nmine finally managed to get\ntickets for this sell out play\nstarring Juliette Bi noche. My expectations were quite high since\nit had been hyped up so much. And I must add that I wasn't disappointed at all.\nThe play is about a young woman Ersilia who is taken care of\nby an older man, a novelist, as she\ncomes out of hospital. We later\nfind out that she was in the newspapers and that the novelist is trying to write a fictional account of\nher life. From there on, we witness\nwhat has happened to her. Various\nmen appear: her fiance, her lover\n(a married man) and the journalist\nthat interviewed her for the newspaper article. They all exploit her\nand she clearly comes across as\nthe victim all through the play. As we get further into the story we find out that Ersilia tried to commit suicide.\nPirandello has created a wonderful confrontation between one\nwoman and the men in her life who are trying to help her, although in\nthe end it feels like they have\ndestroyed her. The paradox is that\neven if Ersilia appears the victim, in\nthe end she triumphs and leaves an\nenormous mess in these men's lives: she successfully commits suicide in the last scene of the play.\nThe four men have to live forever\nwith this tragedy on their minds\nand consciences. Another interesting character is Onoria, the novel-ist's landlady who dismisses Ersilia\nat first as a prostitute, then, as she\nfinds out the young woman was in\nthe papers, becomes very kind to\nher and right at the end turns\nagainst her when the truth finally\ncomes out. It feels like Onoria is\nthe voice of the people, and reacts\njust like most of us do nowadays.\nJonathan Kent's direction is\nspotless, he does a perfect job with\nhis actors. He gives the play a lot of\nenergy and the design adds a lot of\npower to the performances.\nAll of the actors are very good, Juliette Binoche in particular, of\ncourse, giving a splendid performance not too far from her film\nroles (\"Three Colours: Blue\", \"Les\nAmants du Pont-NeuP). She gives\nall she has in her to Ersilia's chara c ter, although she can sometimes\nbe hard to understand. Oliver Ford\nDavies as Not a the novelist is fantastic and very funny. The other\nmembers of the cast are also very\ngood. Overall this is a great night out\nfor theatre lovers and will please\nBinoche's fans.\nIt is definitely worth all the\nqueuing\nD.T he Barbican Centre has just\nkicked off a new festival,\nBITE:98, an international theatre event with collaboration\nbetween two brilliant artists, Robert\nWilson and Philip Glass. To place\nthese people a little: Robert Wilson\nis a major American theatre director who has worked extensively\nover the world; Philip Glass is one\nof the most important and innovative contemporary composers having written the famous \"music in 12\nparts\". His most recent work is the\nmusic for Martin Scorsese's film\nKundun. Wilson and Glass have\nalready collaborated in 1976, producing a groundbreaking work at\nthe time, Einstein on the Beach.\nMonsters of Grace is a fusion of\n13th century Sufi devotional songs\nwith 3D animations, all this to the\nsound of Glass's music. He uses\nquite a few traditional Persian\ninstruments (mostly sampled) but\nhis style is instantly recognisable.\nThere were 13 scenes in total,\nseven of which were 3D animated,\nwhere we all had to wear our little\n3D glasses to watch. It was all pretty impressive: lots of movement,\nalthough things didn't always make\nsense. There was use of geometrical figures, everyday settings,\nhouses and forests, and one particularly amazing piece: a man's hand\nbeing filmed from all angles and\nthen being cut open at the palm.\nThe other scenes were acted out\nby five adults and a very young boy.\nNot much was actually happening\nbut emotionally it was all very\nstrong and visually it was arresting-ly beautiful. The director used things like an aquarium, a gigantic\npiece of turquoise cloth wrapped\naround a woman, which had a most stunning effect.\nThe little boy seemed to play a central part as he walked across\nthe stage into a closed off changing\nroom. The animations then started\nand right at the end he walked out .\nof the enclosed room back to\nwhere he first was.\nThe direction was perfect, giving\nthe actors the maximum of space\nto express themselves, free from\nthe \"dictatorship\" of words. This is\nso exhilarating to watch: the animations are superb and Philip\nGlass's music is simply divine. His\nfans won't be disappointed and\nnewcomers will fall under the\ncharm of that beauty.\nThis collaboration is a masterpiece\nand has shown new directions for\ntheatre/ performance/ music crossovers. This is the stuff of the\nfuture, in a different way to\nCleansed but with the same impact: one feels this is are vela tion.\nThe future looks bright if these guys\ninfluence upcoming artists.\nD. "

We too paid\n\u00a3 6 5 for cleaning which was never\ndone and \u00a3 1 6 a month for some one to carry our rubbish from the landing to the front door, a task for\nwhich I would have gladly accepted\nsuch a princely sum. Our main gripe was the leaky\nlavatory. It took six months of badgering to get it half-hearted ly patched and it smelt awful in the meantime. When our shower leaked into the flat below Mrs Sofaer rang us up to tell us not to shower and that if the flat below\ncomplained again WE would be\ncharged for the repairs to HER plumbing.\nIn the first few weeks we noticed a strange mysterious\naroma about the place. It remained\nmysterious until we discovered that the cooker was leaking gas. To\nher credit, Mrs Sofaer reacted relatively quickly (within a month) by\nbuying a new cooker. This does not\nmake up for the danger in which\nmy flat mates and I were placed.\nThe wiring was over fifty years\nold and failed us on several occasions. Twice the flat was broken\ninto and cash stolen. Police recommended changing the locks; the front door could be opened with a credit card. Predictably, no action\nwas taken.\nMrs Sofaer only accepts rent in\ncash from students. Iam unsure of\nher motives, but Iam told it may be\nsomething to do with tax.\nI feel I should apologise to Felix\nreaders for not revealing this horror\nstory previously. When we left last\nSummer, all we could think of was getting away and enjoying the holi-days. I hope that this serves as a warning to people thinking of renting from Mrs Sofaer next year, if\nshe is not in prison.\nYours 8 x. Iain McNaught Civ Eng 3\nCODE - WITHOUT\n[FRYING\nDear Felix\nBecause of a computer incompatibility problem, I have not been\nable to read the disk which gives\nme the students' names to go with\nthe candidates' numbers for my final year exam. I have, however,\nalready drawn up my mark sheets,\ncomplete with names. Cracking the\nname/number code for a course\nwith only 17 students is easy by\nusing logic, but that has been\nunnecessary as students write so differently from each other. My course was their last one before\nthe exam, so their writing was fresh\nin my mind, particularly from practical books.\nOne student loves to use the\nphrase 'just to name a few\", and frequently puts plural nouns with\nsingular verbs, so his answers\nquickly identified him. Word confusions of the roaster/rooster and flavour/favour type were typical of\none student. Several students have\npoor spelling, but make different\ntypes of error. One, for example,\ngets -cle and cal ending confused,\nso \"pr act i cle\" in one answer identified her. Errors more typical of\noverseas students, with a different\nstyle of writing, identified another\ncandidate.\nEven though many course\nessays were printed, handwriting is\na give-away to someone who has\nmarked essays, exam questions\nfrom old papers and a long practical book from each student. One has large and very irregular letters,\nwhile another has very rounded let-ter s, with distinctive curly tops to some of them. One has neat writing sloping uniformly to the left,\nand another has writing which can\nslope to the left, right, or be\nupright, in different sections of an\nanswer. Spiky writing in black fountain pen ink identifies one student.\nAnother writes the letter \"n\" like an\n\"in\". Others have writing which is\ndistinctive in size, slope, regularity,\ncolour of ink, or fountain pen nib or\nball-point pen. Deadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\nOne student regularly writes\noutstanding answers in a particular\nstyle, in black ink, with lots of outside reading quoted. Another excellent student writes in a different style, in smaller blue hand writ ing. Another lives on a farm and\nshowed a great depth of first-hand\nknowledge on an agricultural\nquestion.\nBy the time 1 had marked one\nanswer each, I had without trying\nand without particularly wanting ita pretty clear idea of which student\nhad written which script. By the\ntime I had finished all the answers,\nI was absolutely certain of which\nnames went with which scripts. I shall of course check that 1 am correct before handing in the mark list.\nIt is only for about the last two\nyears that we have had numbers\ninstead of names on answer books\nfor finals in our department. It is\neasier to mark with candidates'\nnumbers than with names as the\nmarking seems more impersonal,\nthough Ido not think that knowing\nthe names has any influence on the\nmarking. In theory, using only can-di dates' numbers means that one\ncannot take into account when marking that this student was away\nill for two weeks, or that another\nhad done an extended essay related to one of the questions (that is\nalmost possible to avoid). The students told me that those things\nwere matters of luck and did not\nneed taking into account in the\nmarking.\nMy papers are second-marked\nby another member of staff, and\nthe excellent closeness of our two sets of marks has been unaffected\nby the change from names to marks. A visiting examiner from\nanother college, who did not know\nour students, re-marked several\nscripts carefully each year, almost\nalways agreeing with our marks,\nwhether we had names or numbers\non the scripts. The answers may\nalso be looked at by external examiners and chairmen of sub-boards\nof examiners, especially for students borderline between degree\nclasses, so there are plenty of safeguards against bias. Code-cracking\nin this way would be much harder\nin a larger class.\nName and department\nsupplied\n\n"

Their lyrics\ncould be optimistically\ndescribed as incomprehensible, a machine gun succession of supermarket\nanarchist sound bites, bawled over the crazed glam guitars that forms the\nmeat of their music. This\nalbum is the follow up to\ntheir 96 debut album Your\nMajesty... We are Here.\nThe first track, The SAS\nand the Clam that goes\nwith it, blasts out its chorus \"You are your own reaction\"\nover the guitar rock and twisted\nsounds cape of a job lot of Dr Who effects, while The Universal Plan\nexclaims \"It's a beautiful world\" over throbbing stadium rock work\nand a Gary Numanesque keyboard\nrefrain. Both great anthems which\nare perfect for the mosh pit. However, although there are\ndrums. This wouldn't necessarily be\na bad thing, but the songs lack the\nmomentum required to carry the\nlistener through a whole album of\nthe bawling pub rock, and\nthe slower songs God, Let\nme be Kind with its minimalist beats, and the gentle\nDon't Die Jim, aren't enough\nto provide relief from the\nglam pub punk drunken brawling in a carpark stadium some wild and wonderful intros -the church organ solo of Second\nClass War, and the Sixties super spy music in Edelweiss, in almost every\ncase they are quickly buried under\nthe heavy guitars and stomping\nrock.\nAll in all the album lacks\nHH the innovation of their\n\"\" debut, and while individual\ntracks such as 99p and Come Taste my Mind would make excellent live tracks\nand singles, there is not\nquite enough variety in their unique\nbrand of stodgy glam to make this\nalbum an essential purchase.\nPhil Lewis\nReviews are given a mark out of\nfive as follows...\nChoc Fudge\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Space Cake\nFruit Cake\nCarrot Cake\n\u2022 Fairy Cake\nNo Stars Cake of Soap\nTha Bomb!\nTha Bomb will be back next week\nwith the chief himself, Milen.

They are a Glaswegian fOur-piece\nobsessed by Japanese junk culture and\ntigers. Roughly translated as 'noisy stars' or\n'obnoxious aliens', Urusei Yatsura was one of\nthe most popular anime series produced, a frankly bizarre show starring one Lu m an beautiful alien sporting horns and a tiger-skin bikini.\nIt all starts to fit together...\nThe LA2 was surprisingly packed out for a band that has only just made it into London's musical consciousness. Clumps of twenty-something men are swigging away on their\nBudweisers and paying token attention to the\nsupport Apples in Stereo. At least half of these\nmust be music 'journalists'. Between the affect-ed ly cool m usos run the real fans - over excited fourteen year-old teeny bopper s. A pair of\nabsurdly enthusiastic gir lies bounce up to us,\nfeather boas flying. Their voices are just audible\nover a terrible Beach Boys cover - \"Buy our\nFanzine! Buy our Fanzine!\"\nThe support were duly kicked off, and after\nthe usual faff ing and false starts, Yatsura\nstormed on and thrashed out a deafening rendition of Flaming Skull. They seemed to be getting\nthe duller songs out of the way first, and despite\nthe volume, they weren't carrying the crowd with them.\nSuddenly, everyone recognises the opening\nchords of Glo Stars and the moshi ng starts.\nPogoing around like a lunatic while five-foot-five\nbopper s crack repeatedly into the bottom of\nyour chin and the DMs of smelly sixth-former s smack you squarely in the temples as they surf\nthe towards the stage; all in the name of fun.\nAnd what fun it is. The mini-mosh pit is friendly\nbut fast, and the two security guards have their\nwork cut out dealing with the crowd surfers.\nThe band hammer out the favourites, powering through the joyous Hello Tiger with\nimpressive force. Guitarist Graham' s sonic\nsecrets are revealed in Exidor - he takes two\ndrum sticks, weaves one between the strings,\nand clobbers it with the other.\nThe crowd, however, have other ideas.\n\"SIAMESE!\" they demand. Eventually, the band\nagree, and thrash out a rendition of this early\nfavourite with such force that it's barely recognisable. Ears pop, light bulbs smash, and we\njump higher and higher loving the torture.\nGraham is banging away like a madman, apparently unsatisfied until he's broken all the strings.\nSuddenly, they desert the stage, leaving the\ninstruments howling a demonic, ear-shattering\nwail that matching the growing pain in my head.\nIt's madness - we're shouting for more, but noone can hear, not even ourselves.\nSlowly it dawns on us that there will be no\nencore. Although it's just 10.30pm, Urusei\nYatsura have left the building. The massive wailing gradually subsides to a manageable caco ph ony, and the party's over like a burst balloon.\nNoisy Stars they may be, but they're nice\nenough not to keep their diminutive fans up\nafter their bed-time.\nJeremy\n\n"

The length of the songs\nis the largest problem here. Sonic Youth may just feel obliged to fill studio time or dead\nalbum time with amalgams of distortion and feedback. They may feel\nthat it's cool to be radio-unfriendly, as most of the\nmusical breaks come slap\nbang in the middle of a track, as opposed to the\nbeginning or end where\nthey could be cut off.\nWhatever the reason for\nthis sonic meddling, these\ndetours only serve to be\ndetrimental to the overall\nSonic Youth sound. Sadly,\neven this isn't that much to write home about. It'sO K but it's not five star\nmaterial. Perhaps the\nmid song noises are only added to make the\notherwise mediocre material stand out.\nThe album opens with the misleading\nContre Le Sexisme. It's misleading because\nit's probably the poorest piece of material\navailable for aural consumption. It's basically a third-rate Portishead number. It's melancholic\nenough but there's a lack of cohesion present\nthat gives us a feeling of disjointed ness. The\nfollowing track, Angel, manages to hit the\nspot, though. It just about maintains its eeriness without diving into a mass of confused\nnoise. This unsettling nature is kept in balance\nby the melody. It's perhaps of worth to note\nthat this is one of the shorter tracks, at five\nminutes. From there, we are teased with promising\nnumbers like Female\nMechanic on Duty, Hits of\nSunshine (for Allen\nGinsberg) and Heather\nAngel, only for our hopes\nto be dashed by periods\nof unwanted cacophony.\nIf this album was forty\nminutes long instead of\nseventy-five then it would\nbe a lot more accessible\nand, in turn, better. Sonic\nYouth are no mugs,\nthough and they have pur-pose ly recorded this\nalbum in this way. This is a mistake. After all,\nreviews could be written half in English and\nhalf in Fortran but it doesn't do anyone any\nfavours.\nDennis\nSINGLES Pulsars Submission to the Master\nIf Electronic ever split up and reformed, one\nmore step away from New Order, the result\nwould be the Pulsars. Friendly tune and not too electronic to deviate from the mainstream.\nDawn of the Replicants / Smell Voodoo (EP)\nAnother churned out single by the Replicants.\nHow they got signed I don't know, but again, the\ntalent of a terrible singer meets the tuneless\nnoise of an un talented band and this is the\nresult. Please just admit defeat and go and wither away.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Embrace Come Back to What You Know\nFor all of those who thought Good Good people\nwas just a one-off Oasis cribbed fluke (I count\nmyself as one) this single reveals the quality\nEmbrace have been claiming upon themselves\nfor all this time. This is nothing short of an\nanthem of sheer musical perfection. The critics\ncertainly will be laid to rest.\nSilversun Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\nA lot more 'cuddly' than I was expecting, almost\nthe Beegees, but with a tiny bit of token guitar-ing. Might appeal to 14 year old Brian Adams fans, but not many others.\nJohn Martyn Excuse Me Mister\n1 don't like white singers trying black blues; it\ndoesn't work, unless they make it their own( eg\nEric Clapton). Martyn just tries to imitate without the soul of the attitude. What Blues song\nhave you ever known that sings about not calling someone mister because he's bad to the\nenvironment and is giving Mr's a bad name?\nDavid H. Blue Rose The Disconnected EP\nVery well constructed melancholic indie. Sad\nballads, chilling acoustic tunes reminiscent of\nSimon and Carfunkel but the last track,\nEverything we need, is ultimately uplifting.\nBound to do well.\nComfort The Proof of You\nStrong female vocals run over melodious guitar\ndriven tunes, a bit like Catatonia but not as\nannoyingly Welsh! Nothing really inspirational\nor new here but the Proof of You is a good indie-pop tune.\nCornelius Chapter 8\nStrange vocal harmonies and weird effects\ndrive Cornelius in the direction of the Boo Radley's Giant Steps album. Odd, very odd indeed.\nFuture Loop Foundation Karma\nAn excellent tribal ly influenced single with good strong drum 'n' bass lines, definitely spooky.\nThe Click 'n' Cycle mix is mellower but not as\ngood as the top original track.\nMontepulciano Ola Chica\nReally cheesy latin/samba influenced pop/disco\nbastard. The lead singer/crooner really should\nbe fired, along with the rest of the band. The\ninstrumental Hollywood mix isn't bad though.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Transglobal Underground Rejoice Rejoice\n(Album sampler)\nEvery ethnic sound you can imagine, from\nArabic singing and Indian tabla s to gypsy-peas-ant folk tunes are combined with excellent\ndance beats. A must for alternative dance\nfreaks. Brilliant.\nSleater-Kinney One More Hour\nScreaming punk attitude from the much lauded\nAmerican ring-piece. Riot girls cross over into\nthe mainstream? Maybe. The B side, Don't Think You Wanna, is a Nirvana-esque rocker\nthough.\nRamzi\n\n"
