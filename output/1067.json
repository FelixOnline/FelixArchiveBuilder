Also, the College cover would\nnot have included travel costs to hospital and the subsequent physiotherapy departments, or the associated\ncost of being temporarily disabled.\nThe travel costs alone amounted to\n\u00a3200, a substantial sum when compared to the \u00a31.50 for the insurance\ncover that the Union now offers.\nFortunately, I am covered by my\nparent's insurance, and this then covered my travel expenses, operation\nand hospital stay. Had my financial\nsituation been any different, the\nimplications to myself could have\nbeen disastrous.\nBy issuing Activities Cards, students are made aware that the Union\nis committed to its Duty of Care and\noperates an advantageous insurance\npolicy. Speaking as ACC Chair, I now know where to go if an accident\nhappens through any of the ACC\nSporting Clubs. I also know that the\ncover is more comprehensive than\nthat offered by most governing bodies and College.\nMy wish is that should clarification about the policy, or the insurance be needed, that students come to\nthe Union Office or see the Chair of\ntheir Major Sub Committee and not\nbelieve the drivel that was reported\nlast week.\nYours,\nCaroline J Deetjen\nACC Chair.\nDear Alex,\nA few points worth raising about\nActivities Cards:\nCollege has always had and still\nhas an insurance policy covering all\nclub activities in IC, this has worked\nfine for x years and will work fine for another xxx years. So what do we\nneed the BUSA policy for? Nothing,\nthe two policies are virtually identical => waste of money.\nThe cost of each individual policy\nis only 95p. So what about the other\n55p? \u2014> The official answer is 'card\nlaminating costs'. The Union is making a profit out of it too!\nName withheld by request\nI have received a lot of feedback\nover this particular article, and I apologise for any factual inaccuracies that were present. Unfortunately, I am not able verify\nthe research of each and every\narticle that is contributed, how\never much I would like to.\nThe important point to come out\nof this issue is that the new policy\nand the associated cards are not\nproperly understood; there is confusion amongst the clubs and their\nmembers. I understand that Sarah\nhas released a note fully explaining\nthe matter, particularly the costs\nof the scheme, and I hope that this\nwill clarify it for everyone.\nDunblane answer\nDear Felix,\nI totally disagree with the views\nexpressed by the Rifle and Pistol\nClub. No doubt the current law\nshould have stopped Hamilton owning a gun. But it didn't the law\nfailed. Human minds are complex\nand laws that attempt to label them as\neither 'A' or 'B' 'safe' or 'unsafe'\nwith a gun - are bound to fail some-times. Dunblane proves this: it was\none police officer's opinion that\nHamilton was aB but another officer\nthought he was an A. We can never\nsay that someone is 100% safe and\nwe certainly can't tell whether or not\nsomeone will commit a crime in\nfuture.\nI agree that there is no point banning handguns if we forget about\nthose that are already illegally\nowned. However, with a total clampdown on illegal weapons, Dunblane\nwould still have happened. I think\nyou need both: a ban on handguns\nand a clampdown on illegal\nweapons. In the article, the RPC\nseems to think more should be done\nabout illegal weapons. I agree, and if\nthe RPC can offer any practical suggestions, I'm sure they'll be gratefully received.\nRichard Sandiford.\nSandwich crisis\nDear Felix,\nI would like to bring to the attention of IC students the fact that the\nsandwiches sold in QT are of both\npoorer quality and higher price than\nthe sandwiches sold outside the col-le ge.I did some research last week,\nmostly on Gloucester Road:Monday Egg mayonnaise with\ncress 89p Boots (1.10 QT)\nTuesday Tuna and cucumber\n1.00 The Sandwich Shop (1.10 QT)\nWednesday Prawn mayonnaise\n1.19 Boots (1.50 QT)\nThursday Egg and bacon 1.40\nThe Sandwich Shop (1.50 QT)\nFriday Avocado, chicken & bacon\n1.39 Harts the Grocer, Old Brompton\nRoad (with free can of Irn Bru), (not\navailable in QT).\nThis shows that the sandwiches\nsold in QT are on average 15% more\nexpensive than outside the college.\nSurely the college should be sub sidi sing the students rather than making a profit out of them.\nLinda Hart\nIRC for Semiconductor Materials.\nSome valid points here I think.\nWhy are the sandwiches in QT so\nexpensive Mr Foster?\nCareers clarification\nDear Editor,\nYour correspondent Ben Weir (25\nOctober) makes some important\npoints about the Careers Service.\nFirst he says that the Careers\nOffice is not large enough. During\nthe first weeks of the Autumn Term\nthe office is particularly crowded,\nhowever at other times of the year we\nusually have adequate space for the\nneeds of our customers. We try to\nmeet the varying demands during the\nday by having a Duty Careers\nAdviser available from 1.00 to 2.00\npm to assist with queries.\nThe timing of the lunch time\nCareers Talks on Tuesdays and\nThursdays is certainly a problem if\nstudents have other events to attend.\nSuggestions for alternative times\nwould be welcome, bearing in mind\nthat employers are holding presentations on most evenings during the\nautumn term.\nWe have had considerable demand\nfor our Wednesday afternoon\nWorkshops this year. One solution to\nthis problem is for us to put on extra\nworkshops in Departments and we\nwould be delighted to receive more\ninvitations to do so.\nWe shall be asking for comments\nabout the Careers Service from users\nby means of a questionnaire later this\nacademic year, but in the meantime I would welcome any suggestions\nabout improving our service.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Simpson\nDirector, Careers Service.\nClayponds security\nDear Editor\nI would like to correct some of the\nimpressions given in the reporting on\nsecurity at Clayponds:\nFirstly, the College is concerned to\nfind a sensible and practicable solution to the security problems. Yes,\nburglaries were running at about 1\nevery 10 days, but since the introduction of dog patrols there have been\nnone.\nSecondly, at the recent meeting,\nthe College did not rule out any suggestions. Indeed at the meeting there\nwas inevitably a wide range of views\non what might be most appropriate.\nSome students even liked the new\ncarpets!! We did not rule out any\nmeasures, but there are obvious eco-no mic, operational and fire aspects to\nbe considered. For example, grilles\non windows and dead-locks have\nfire-safety implications.\nThirdly, we are listening to the\nClayponds community, and it was\nagreed that this would be done via\nnormal channels through the Warden\nand the Hall Committee. The new\nHall Committee has obviously only\njust been set up and I will naturally\nbe meeting with the Warden after\ntheir first meeting, at which I'm sure\nthese issues will be discussed.\nYours faithfully\n/ Caldwell.\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1066\nis Monday 4th November.

Not only\ndoes this undermine the Union's Duty of Care to its members but it\nalso indicates some dubious practice\nin the methods of research that your\nreporters use. Had the author bothered to speak to myself for more than\ntwo minutes, to my predecessor, to\nany of the major Sub Committee\nChairs, or to the Clubs and Societies\nthemselves, he would have discovered why this policy has been implemented. As for the article, I would like to\ncorrect the blinding errors and\nexplain at this point the reasons\nbehind the Health and Safety Policy.\n1. The members of ICU are not\nbeing conned. Through the various\nMajor Sub Committees, Clubs have\nbeen requesting extra cover for several years. In cases of temporary dis-able ment, dental repairs etc. students\nare now provided with some financial support which, in the past, they\nwould not have been given.\n2. College have not instituted a supplementary insurance policy in\nthe form of activities card. The\nUnion has taken out a blanket policy\nthrough an Endsleigh/BUSA scheme\nwhich we are asking our members to\npay for this year. The activities cards\nprove that individuals pay for their\ninsurance, and they also provide the\nUnion with Contact details for next\nof kin etc. in case there is an accident\nor emergency.\n3. The view the author takes with\nregards to the policy being unnecessary for our mountaineers/ table tennis players/ rugby players seems\nridiculous. If he had thought for one\nminute about the suffering and financial difficulty caused by dislocating a knee, severing a tendon in the hand\n(yes by playing table tennis), or by\nbreaking an ankle climbing, his attitude would probably have been very\ndifferent.\n4. Bridge players do not need\nactivities cards as the Bridge Club\nmembers are well aware. Had the\nauthor glanced at the Health and\nSafety policy, he would have realised\nthis.\n5. You do have to have an activities card to play sport as a member of\nICU, it is detailed in the Clubs and\nSocieties Health and Safety Policy\npassed at the first Council meeting of\nthis year.\n6. Frank Murray, the Sports and\nLeisure Manager of IC was only\nmade aware of the details of our\nHealth and Safety policy at the\nAthletics Committee meeting held on\nthe 24th of October, and the information he had before was incomplete\nand therefore unfortunately in acc u rate.\n7. I presume, when talking about\nthe Finance Office, that the author\nhad talked to someone over in the\nSherfield Administration. The Union\nmanages its own finances, and there-fore, had he talked to any of our\nfinancial staff about the insurance\npolicy, he would have been presented with a large amount of in form a tion.\n8. I was in fact the author of the\nHealth and Safety policy, so if the\nauthor of the terribly researched art i cle, would like to get his facts\nstraight, I suggest he interviews me\nbefore he writes anything else about\nthis policy as he said he would before\nhe wrote his last effort.\nWhilst it is obviously the job of\nFelix to question what goes on in the\nUnion and College as a whole, may I suggest that your researchers attempt\nto follow their job description ie\nresearch.\nWhilst it is easy to get incorrect\ninformation from people who do not\nknow the facts, it is not exactly difficult to get the right information from\nthose who do.\nSo please in the future, just ask,\nSarah Corneille\nDeputy President, Clubs and\nSocieties.\nDear Mr Feakes,\nI am writing in response to the\nappallingly inaccurate account of\n'superfluous insurance' reported in\nlast week's Felix. No doubt the policy correctness will be commented\nupon from other sources, but I would\nlike to highlight the need for provision of adequate insurance through\nthe Union.\nAs a past member of the Imperial\nCollege Ladies Rugby Club, I "

    "content": "6 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 1ST NOVEMBER\nImperial Discovers New\nHuman - BSE Link\nBY JESSICA SHERIIMGHAM\nResearchers at St Mary's, led by our own Professor Collinge,\nhave come up with the strongest evidence yet that eating\ninfected meat products in the 1980s could have caused some\ncases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD), the human equivalent of BSE. The research seems to vindicate the view\nacross Europe, especially in Germany, that the\nBritish beef ban should remain, at least until\nBritain takes stronger action to eradicate\nBSE. Furthermore, it is expected to\ndelay the British Government's request that the EU start lifting the ban from certified\nBSE-free herds in Northern\nIreland.\nThe European Parliament\nhas extended their investigation (into the alleged mishandling of the matter by\nBritain and the Commission) in\nthe light of the new findings. The\nMinistry of Agriculture, however, does not see\nthe evidence of humans appearing to have\ncaught CJD from eating infected beef as confirmation that the Government handling of\nBSE was at fault. Sarah Atwell, a spokesperson for the Ministry, said that,\nalthough these findings are the strongest\nevidence so far supporting this link, the\nCollinge research was not totally con-clu sive. The development of the new test\ncould be a mixed blessing for the\nBritish beef farmers; Philip\nSaunders, spokesperson for the Meat\nand Livestock commission, commented\nthat the test could allow a quick diagnosis of\nBSE and therefore would alleviate the need\nfor unnecessary culling of\ncattle suspected of\nhaving the disease.\nWhile this could be the\nanswer for restoring public\nconfidence in beef, it could also\nreveal more BSE-like diseases in\nother livestock, such\nsheep.\nAlthough scrap ie, the\nsheep form of BSE, has\nnever crossed the species\nbarrier to humans, there is a chance that a cross between BSE\nand scrap ie could be transmissible to humans. In response to a query on\ntesting sheep for a new variant form of scrap ie, Mr Saunders replied that\n\"sheep have had scrap ie for two-and-a half centuries with no problems of\nthe disease appearing in humans\" and saw it as unlikely that the test on\nsheep would reveal any danger to humans.\nThere have been twelve cases over the last two years of a new strain of\nCJD, which has new symptoms and seems to target younger people than\nother, previously characterised, types of the disease. The results of the\nresearch show the molecular characteristics of various forms of CJD and\nBSE-infected brains. Surprisingly, the new variant CJD (nvC JD) was of\na different type to other forms of CJD - yet very similar to the disease\nparticles found in the brains of cats and other animals with BSE\ncaught from eating infected beef products.\nThe link between eating BSE-infected food and developing\nCJD was already considered plausible. This is due to evidence that animals such as cats can contract a BSE-like\ndisease from eating infected products. The new study\nstrengthens that link by highlighting the similarity between CJD and\nBSE, suggesting that\nthese new cases of\nCJD have indeed arisen\nfrom eating infected beef products.\nThe development of a new technique\nby Professor Collinge and co-workers\nallows the character is ation of different CJD and BSE strains in days,\nrather than the years which are\nneeded for conventional stud-ies. At present the technique needs to use brain\ntissue for testing, though\nthe Collinge team are\nhoping to extend the\ntechnique for use on\nother tissues in the\nbody, and eventually\ndevelop it as a blood\ntest.\nThis could not\nonly diagnose CJD,\nbut could offer opportunities\nfor determining the cause of the\ndisease and help to find a cure.\nYv The Collinge study has provided\ndefinitive findings on the pos s ble causes of the nvC JD, a rapid way to\nJL diagnose the disease and in addition has\nH opened up opportunities to discover af cure. However, the underlying message\nfrom the research seems clear. As commented in Suddeutsche Zeitung (a German\nnewspaper) last week: \"there is not the\nslightest reason to ease up the fight\nagainst BSE....Perhaps London will listen at last to serious researchers in its\nown country\".\nProfessor Collinge declined to\ncomment on the political situation.\n>16\n\n"

The junior\nminister insisted that he has one of\nthe largest portfolios of any\nGovernment Minister, and that his\nwork is \"very exciting.\"\nWhile previous political speakers\nhave been vilified for expressing positive views toward Europe, Mr Ian\nTaylor, MBE, MP, forcefully\nexpressed support for the European\nUnion and the European Court of\nJustice. The MP for Esher, in Surrey,\nwent as far as suggesting that some\neurosceptic s should be banished into\nspace for their activities.\nAs the Parliamentary Under\nSecretary of State for Science and\nTechnology, he followed the\nGovernment line on Europe, insisting\nthat a referendum would only be\nneeded in the event of a Cabinet decision in favour of a single European\ncurrency. Mr Taylor went further by\nPHOTO: WEI LEE\nTrust me, I'm a politician. Ian Taylor, Minister for Science and\nTechnology, speaks to a reduced Conservative Society audience.\ndismissing James Goldsmith's Referendum Party, \"Jimmy's off the\nwall\", and calls for a wider referendum on Europe by insisting that\n\"we're already there [the EU], that's not the question.\"\nRubbishing calls from other Tories\nto leave Europe completely, the\nJunior Minister insisted that \"the cost\nof leaving the European Union\nwould be mind-boggling\" and that\nthe single market of 360 million people is essential to the UK.\nEstablishing himself as a complete\nEurophile, Mr Taylor went on to\nexpress his support for a stronger\nCommission, an expansion of the\nCourt of Justice and a European\nParliament with more power to sc rut in is e Brussels.\nConcentrating on his current\nGovernment responsibility, Mr\nTaylor explained how he regularly\ntravels the world promoting British\nscience and innovations. Recent trips\nabroad have persuaded him that this\ncountry's 'science base' is in a healthy state, despite others 'focus-ing only on the negative.' The\nScience Minister insisted that spending has increased by 10% in real\nterms in recent years, and that British\nscientists are amongst the most successful in the world.\nThe low level of R&D spending by\nindustry in this country does worry\nthe Government, with Mr Taylor\nsuggesting that investment in R&D directly affects the future profitability of a company. The telecom giant\nEricsson was praised for spending\n15% of sales on research, but Mr\nTaylor slammed the Chairman of\nGEC, Lord Weinstock, for spending\nonly 1.5% on research saying that he\nis \"one of the worst managers Britain\nhas ever seen.\"\nWith your intelligence,\nshouldn't you be working with ours?\nReuters is a world-class organisation, supplying critical, real-time\ninformation to the financial services industry and to the major\nfinancial centres around the world.\nPerhaps you haven't considered us as a career option.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 1ST NOVEMBER SPORT 15\nFELIX SPORT\nIC Basketball makes a storming start\nIN BOTH THE MEN'S.... Despite the lack of preparation time\nfor IC's basketball team, the first\nmatch of the season against ULU\nwas a complete triumph. With IC\nheading off at half-time 39-19, it\nwas just a question of how high the\nscore was going to get. The final\nwhistle found the difference at 37\npoints, with IC making their easiest\nvictory for four years - and this was\nsupposed to be the most difficult\nmatch of the BUSA qualifying\nround. With Charring Cross and\nWestminster & Royal Free pulling\nout of the competition, first place in\nthe group seems booked - especially\nwith Demetriou, San-Miguel and\nIoannides playing with the quality\nthey displayed against UCL.\n....AND THE WOMENS IC ladies basketball continued their\nfine start to the season, with their\nsecond away victory in a row, this\ntime overcoming a strong team from\nGoldsmith's. Indeed, the eventual\nscore line,3124, could easily have\nbeen far higher.\nQualification in the final thirty-two no longer seems like a distant\ndream, on the showing of the high\nstandard that IC have been able to\nachieve, such a short way into the\nseason. IC has put together a team\nthat knows how to fight to the end,\nand includes some very skillful basketball players.\nThe reward? It remains to be dis-covered....\nIC Ladies FC true to their word\nThe IC ladies football team was out\nin full force last Sunday, with a smashing 8-0 victory over LSE.\nTension ran high between the two\nteams after an initial pre-game run-in\nat Waterloo, where LSE were blatantly told by IC captain Stephanie\n\"You will loose\". Proving that her\nteam never lies, \"Schmichael\"\ninspired her team to victory from her\nspot in goal, where she somehow\nmanaged to find the time to score\none herself, in between dives and\nblocks.\nHowever, the Ladies' first victory\nwas a true team effort, with scores\nfrom all sides of the field. Newcomer Hege started them off, followed by a phenomenal corner kick\nfrom the rookie Catherine that ended\nwith a smooth header into the goal\nby the spirited Juliette, the mysterious hooded striker. Not to be out-done, the invincible defence proved\ntheir versatility with a score from the\nhalf-way line by Tasmin after two\nfrustrating attempts. In the mid-field,\nEleanor and Tracey were a deadly\nduo, controlling the game with\nunstoppable fury.\nRSM kick-off with 5 - 0 win Newly promoted to division two of\nthe London University League, RSM\nstarted the season with a bang and a sparkling performance. Neil Price\nwas man of the match, thanks to his\nrelentless defence, which let not a shot through.\nRSM's international-studded midfield and attack capitalised on opportunities offered by the overwhelmed\nKing's College side. Magnus opened\nthe scoring, closely followed by two\nmore from Si.\nIn the second half, Magnus and\nKarsten slotted away two more -Karsten from the penalty spot - in\ntrue Scandinavian style.\nRSM look forward to another\ngreat season.\nMeanwhile, RSM seconds started the\nseason with a win, thanks to a hattrick from Edson, a goal from angel,\nand the general ineptitude of Bartsthe game not being helped by a referee whose knowledge of the game\ndid not seem to stretch as far as the\noffside rule.\nSport in Brief\nWOMEN'S FOOTBALL\nIC started slowly with a low scoring\nfirst quarter, with Barts keeping up\nthe pressure. However, with a great\ndefence IC managed to maintain a narrow lead.\nThe second half saw dramatic\nchanges. One of IC's leading defenders was injured, leaving IC to play\nthe second half one player down.\nBut, with excellent attacking play\nand hard work, IC put together a run\nof goals, holding on for a well\ndeserved victory.\nSKIING\nThe first match of the year for IC's ski team involved five eager students\npiling into a car and driving aimlessly around London, hoping to find\nBrentwood Park. (Mobile phones\nsuddenly became very useful).\nIt was the first race ever on plastic,\nand some had never raced before.\nDeprived of appropriate equipment,\nthe team (Amelie, Alex, Daniel,\nGilles and Rufina) heroically skied\ninto 15th place - out of 25.\nA solid start to the season!\nMEN'S FENCING\nIC men's fencing squad won their\nannual grudge match for the second\nyear running. The foil team is easily\nthe best in the country this year, and\nstarted us off with an 8-1 victory. We\nclinched the match with a63 victory in the sabre, which gave us an\nunassailable position going into the\ne pee, our weakest weapon, which we\nduly lost 9-0. This gave an overall\nscore line of 14-13 to IC.\nEleven Yobs in Shorts? - The up's and downs of a week in the Fourths\nOCTOBER 19TH SCHOOL OF PHARMACY IC Fourths excellent start to the season continued to demolish all opp osi tion. Proving that their 5-0 thrashing\nof King's in mid-week wasn'ta flash\nin the pan, IC again looked as if they\nhad been playing together for years,\nalthough still only in the first week of\nthe season.\nFrom the kick-off, IC were in control of the game, with their fluid pass ing repeatedly breaking down SOP's defenses. The man of the match had\nto be Darren \"Brawler\" Boland, who\nscored all three goals, showing the\nstrikers arty of being in the right\nplace at the right time. David dazzled\nthe awed seven fans with his ball\ncontrol, but was able to continue\nafter medical treatment.\nThe defence kept their second consecutive clean sheet, helped by captain Cook, whose prowess has finally\ncome to the fore, having in the past\nbeen hidden so well.\nAlthough only early doors (and we\nknow it's a marathon not a sprint),\nthe Fourths are over the moon with\ntheir start, and hopefully if the team\nsticks together, some silver wear can\nbe on show at the end of the season.\nOCTOBER 26TH BIRBECK SECONDS This day will be marked as a disaster\nfor IC football. Although only the\nthird and fourth teams were playing,\nIC fourths were forced to break up\ntheir unbeaten squad, to loan two\nplayers to the Thirds. Result: IC\nThirds continue their loosing run,\nbeaten by a team who the fourths had\ncomfortably beaten in mid-week -and the fourths loose for the first time this season, to a team two divisions\nlower than them.\nBoth sides have now been\nknocked out of the London\nUniversity Cup, a competition in\nwhich the Fourths were among the\nfavourites. With a full team, we\nwould have won comfortably.\nThe IC football hierarchy should\nnot have ordered the break-up of the\nteam, especially on such an important cup weekend. Individually the\nFourth team are not superstars, but\nthey play as a team - \"one for all and\nall for one\" seeing them through\nmany tough games.\nAll the players want to continue to\nplay together. The future will either\nsee two week teams, or at least one\nsuccessful and social Fourth team.\n\n"

It appears that allegations of misuse regarding the software have been made against students at Imperial College. Upon logging in to use IRC software, users\nare informed that due do an investigation into pornographic material\nbeing downloaded from the Internet,\nrestrictions have been put in place.\nThe length of the restriction, or\nwhether it may be permanent, is currently unknown. The topic was discussed at a recent CISSC meeting,\nhowever members of staff were\nunavailable for comment.\nUCL Union - Licence Revoked\nMARIA IOANNOU\nUCL's extended licensing hours\nwere cancelled in early October,\nafter complaints to the police from\nlocal residents about rowdy students\nand street crowds.\nThe extremely popular Thursday\nCocktails Night has already had limits put on it, with a no-guests policy\nbeing imposed. Initially, the late-license ban was put on all UCL sites\nbut this has since been modified and\nthe Gordon Street Union building is\nnow allowed to stay open until mid-night.\nUCL sabbatical Ian Cairns, spoke\non the methods that UCL Union have\nemployed to rectify the situation;\n\"We have had a heavy advertising\ncampaign to make students more\naware of their attitudes and be ha v PHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nBarred! University College London Union have had their late licence\nrevoked after a flurry of protest from nie ghb ours over noise levels.\ni our. Since this step was taken, we residents and the police are very,\nhave had far less complaints from very happy with the situation.\"\nStrikes to paralyse Imperial\nAUT ballot and SWSS EGM soon\nNEWS TEAM With balloting on industrial action\ndue be completed by the 6th November, it appears that a proposed\n'day of action' will go ahead as\nplanned. The 19th November is the\nlikely date for a nation-wide higher\neducation strike which would cripple\nImperial.\nA pay offer of just 1.5% for a cade mic, technical, clerical and academic\nrelated staff has been rejected by all\nthe major trade unions associated\nwith higher education. The postal\nballot of all union members has\nincluded more than 1,000 members\nof Imperial College staff currently\naffiliated to the eight unions\ninvolved. Local Union officials have\nsuggested to Felix that a decision in\nfavour of industrial action is extremely likely with one suggesting that his\nmembers will probably \"go for it.\"\nWhile the National Union of\nStudents has offered full support for\nthe action, Imperial College Students\nUnion has been more reticent. Eric\nAllsop, ICU President, has indicated\nthat it will be up to each individual\nstudent to decide whether they want\nto \"continue their education or stay in\nbed.\" He went on to emphasise that\nICU is an \"apolitical organisation\"\nand that support for a staff strike\nwould be a matter of personal choice.\nImperial College Union looks set\nto enter the debate, despite the\nattempt by sabbaticals to stay out,\nwith Socialist Student Workers\nSociety expressing an intention to\ncall an Extraordinary General\nMeeting of the Union. Although it is\nexpected that the one hundred signatures needed to call and EGM will be\nfound, ICU officials feel that the two\nhundred students needed to make the\nmeeting quo rate are unlikely to mate-ria lise. Despite the current attitude of ICU,\nlocal officials of the Association of\nUniversity Teachers are still hoping\nfor student support. They emphasise\nthat the dispute concerns the national\nunder funding of higher education as\nwell as their own pay deal. It is\nexpected that liaison with ICU will\nfollow today's planned meeting of all\nImperial's trade unions.\nBoth Unison and MSF have over\nthree hundred members currently\nworking at Imperial College, with\none MSF official expecting that\naround two-thirds will vote in the\npostal ballot. The 19th November is\nalmost certain to see the first strike\nheld at Imperial since the 4th December 1991, when industrial\naction over plans to privat is e Security\nreceived widespread support.\nResidence finances under scrutiny\nJACKIE S KEA TE The controversy surrounding the\nsecurity situation at the College's Clayponds residential estate has been\nput in a new light this week with\naccounts showing that College residences produced a net surplus of\nover \u00a31.5 million. This money, mostly profits from conference letting s over the summer, has gone into the\nresidences' short to medium term\nmaintenance and renovations fund.\nAs reported in last week's Felix,\nresidents have been complaining\nabout the amount of money being\nspent on proper security at the estate.\nHowever, though the introduction of\nextra security patrols since then has\ndecreased the number of burglaries at\nClayponds, they have not stopped\ncompletely - a bike was stolen from\ninside a building there only a few\ndays ago.\nAt Clayponds, College Estates still\ninsist that deadlocks and window\nbars, one of the proposed solutions,\nwould constitute a fire risk. Also,\nthey still suffer from ridicule over\ntheir suggestion that students were\nnot able to use the locks on their\ndoors and windows properly. The\ncost of fixing these devices is just\n\u00a333,400 for the entire estate, yet\nother more expensive and less urgent\nimprovements seem to have priority.\nOne of the residents who had his\nroom broken into earlier in the term\ncommented on the attitude the\nEstates Division seemed to have had\ntowards the whole business: \"It\nseems to take ages for anything to be\ndone. They were also very patron is ing... implying that students could-n't understand how to use a door\nlock. It's the cleaners who leave the\ndoors open.\" Another resident commented on the new floor coverings\n\"If they're so keen on replacing car-pets, they should have started at\nSouthside.\"\nMinor renovations are being considered in other halls, though with\nthe aid of external funding. It is\nthought that some time dependent\nfunding is being sought from local\ncouncils for essential \"sanitary and\nkitchen improvements\" in Evelyn\nGardens, though Kensington &\nChelsea officials would not confirm\nthis. If this work goes ahead, it could\ncause substantial disruption to stu-dents.\nElsewhere, criticism about the closure of Montpelier hall does not\nseem to have deterred College from\nrecently spending over a million\npounds on the purchase of the freehold of 47 Princes Gate, a building\nalready occupied by College personnel but earmarked for further expansion of administrative personnel\naccording to one College source.\nThe finances of the College residences have often been questioned\nby students, though it is well known\nthat surpluses from summer letting\nsub sid is e room rents. However, such\na large surplus maybe unjustifiable.\n\n"

The Medics voiced\ntheir concerns about the transition to\nthe new course. Whilst it has been\ndecided that the present BSc and 2nd MB students will continue with the\nold clinical course next year, the current fresher s, on completing their 2nd MB in 1998, will be transferred to the\nnew course; prior to their clinical\ntrain ig, they will have to undertake a short course designed to overcome\ntheir lack of knowledge in certain\nclinical matters.\nOne of the main feature of the new\nsyllabus is its emphasis on early clinical experience. Some students were\nsceptical about the attractiveness of\nthe new course to potential medical\napplicant, who might regard themselves as guinea pigs. Dr Rory Shaw,\nwho was in charge of the new cur-ric ul um, disagreed, voicing that\nmany would see this as a new opportunity, and he would be worried if\nsixth former s were not prepared to\ntake it up.\nThe possible shortage of College\naccommodation for medical students\ndue to the sale of one the hall of res i PHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nA previous reaction by the students of St Mary's to the College's plans for\nthe medical school. New signs, put up by the Estates Division at St Mary's as part of the Campus Renaissance, have also been vandalised.\nden ce of CX WM S was another issue\nthat caused concern among the student body. Sami Ansari, president of\nMary's Student Union, questioned\nwhether final year clinical students\nwould still be guaranteed a place at\nWilson House. Ian Caldwell,\nDirector of Estate, assured him that\n\"any promise made in the prospectus\nwill be fully abided by\"; he did, how-ever, emphasised that at present only\nstudents new to the College were\nguaranteed a place in the halls of res-i den ce. Questions about the sporting activities of medical students after the\nmerger were also raised, particularly\nthe time involved in inter-campus\ntravelling (as dissection will take\nplace at Charing Cross Hospital)\nwould not only increase the expenditure of future medics at ICSM, but\nalso leave little time for participation\nin extra-curricular activities, especially in sports. Heated debate ensued\nafter it had been announced by Eric\nAllsop, the president of IC Student\nUnion, that the medics would no\nlonger have their own team in BUSA\ncompetitions. The possible sale of\nTeddington, currently St Mary's sports ground, caused uproar among\nthe medics from Mary's. The problem was further compacted by the\nlack of solid funding for the new\nsports hall promised by the College.\nThe lack of social space in the new\nBMS building was, as expected,\nheavily criticised. The suggestion by\nsome that the building was constructed primarily for the purpose of holding international conferences was\nforcefully refuted by Mr Caldwell.\nDemands were made to recognise the\nspecial needs of the medics, particularly their close-knit social structure.\nThis has been a common concern\nthroughout the BMS negotiations.\nWorries about whether the number of\nbars currently on the South\nKensington campus could cope with\nthe massive influx of new customers\nwere evident. Mr Caldwell, in reply,\nstated that \"the College is keen to\npromote inter g ration, and there is no\nreason why there should be a separate medical body.\" He also cited that\nthe bars in South Ken were currently\nunder-used.\nThe general feeling among the students after the meeting was that of\nuncertainty. The impression perceived by some was that the College\nhad rushed things through too quick-ly, and that they had not listen\nenough to the students. Sarah\nEdwards, former president of\nSMHMS Union, commented that the\nearly departure of Professor Edwards\n(Principal of ICSM) from the meeting was symptomatic, and did not\ninspire confidence in the College.\nMary's sports, pages 3 and 14\nInside\nNEW SPORTS HALL\nCollege designs for a new sports hall\nare emerging with a planning application due to be in the second half of\nNovember.

If the aircraft is\ncoming in across the land it will fly\nonly a few metres from the tops of\nbuildings, and before touch down an\naccurate right turn has to be made so\nthat several hills and a mountain in the\nnorthern part of Kowloon are narrowly avoided.\nThis spectacular landing will be\nexperienced by many people next\nyear, especially during the last 2\nweeks of June before the 'change\nover' of sovereignty on the 1st July.\nAH the hotels in Hong Kong are fully\nbooked, according to some rumours\neven Baroness Thatcher made her\nbooking a couple of years ago. While\nVancouver has the highest number of\nair ticket bookings for the last two\nweeks of June, with 54 aircraft fully\nbooked, Sydney and London come a close second\nand third respectively.\nMost of these booking have been\nmade by Hong Kongese, who have\nimmigrated to another country. There\nhas been a rumour going around\nrecently that if a Hong Kong born citizen would like to retain his or her\npermanent status after 1997, he or she\nmust be in Hong Kong on 1st July '97\nto witness the change over. Rumours\nlike these are very common in Hong\nKong; many people speculate and try\nto predict what will happen, and quite\noften some of these predictions\nbecome rumours, which become part\nof life in Hong Kong.\nDuring the past fifteen years, many\nnegotiations between the British and\nChinese Governments have taken\nplace. The sino-British Joint declaration in the early 80's and the Chinese\nBasic Law in the mid-late 80's are the\nmajor stepping stones of the future.\nThe Chinese Government has also\nattempted to reassure the general jy jj^ lie in I long Kong. 'Fifty j Q j gars of\nun change', 'horses* caf t conti rif ie to\nrace, people could continue to dance'\nare just two of many quota-t ions. Other political agendas and\nevents are well underway and ready\nfor the change over period. Just simply looking at the one dollar coins in\nHong Kong, the old coins with Her\nMajesty's head are become more difficult to find, and are being slowly\nreplaced with new coins bearing the\nflower of Hong Kong. Another example is The 'Royal' Hong Kong Jockey\nClub' which is no-longer 'Royal' -just simply 'Hong Kong Jockey\nClub'.\nThe number of people expressing\nconcern for their future is easily seen\nby listening to the political talk shows\non the radio. At any one time there is\nat least one radio station broadcasting\na political talk show. Chris Patten, the\ngovernor of Hong Kong, has had his\nfair share of problems; being called\n'Fat Pat' by the public and 'the man\nwith thousand years of sin' by senior\nChinese officials doesn't really make\nhis job any easier. a \u2022 m There is a mixed reaction toward!\nto lead up to the change Qver. Take my\nHpngf Kongese friends from the\nMe^an jc gl Engineering department,\nfor example; we fin- t,i shed our exam in early June.\nMark landed' and immigrated to\nCanada in late June, Esther immigrated to Singapore in early July .\nSome of my friends (like me)\nposes s one or more nationalities,\nsuch as Canadian, Portuguese and\nBritish - (British, not British Hong\nKong). Of course, some of us\nremain at IC to face 4th year in\nMech Eng, and some of us are\nworking in Hong Kong.\nMany Hong Kongese have, like\nme, immigrated to another country\nduring the 'exodus' period of 89-92. The 1989 Tiannamen square\nincident had a vast impact on\nmany Hong Kongese. In 1992,\nwhen the 'exodus' hit the highest\npoint, 66,000 people were leaving Hong Kong in a single\nyear. A very recent survey\nalso suggests that in an office\nenvironment of 100 people, 1\nperson has planned and been\ngranted a visa for im migr at ton.,g How do people fej jj jjb ou fr'97 and how much confidence do they have in <np,\nChinese * * Govern men\nAgain using my friends\naround\nFELIX FRIDAYIST NOVEMBER NEWS FEATURE g me as an example. YY, who is in\nmy year, has found a job with a main contractor firm in Hong\nKong. Her company has great\ninvestment and is running a large\nproject in China. On the other\nhand another friend of mine , (her\ninitials being MM, strangely\nenough), still has two years to go\nin her degree. I asked her what\nshe will do after her degree, and\nshe told me that she is definitely\nnot going back to Hong Kong\nafter her graduation. I suppose the\ngeneral public in Hong Kong are\nquite unsure about where their\nconfidence lies. The corruption\nwithin the Chinese government\nand the law and order of mainland do make people in Hong\nKong doubt about their\nfuture. At this moment in\ntime the confidence of the\nmajority of Hong Kongese\nis placed in the stability of\nthe stock market and real\nestate. Many of us think\nI* that Hong Kong is still static 200 days before\u00abf tie^ change over, and that it\nj \u2022shot rl d* remain so after-s'r# weird s. It may sound naive,\n> but this is what people Want\nto think.\nIn a way the approach of the\nchange-over brings joy and uncertainty for most Hong Kongese, after all,\n'Hong Kongese' is really Chinese, but\na British passport (which\nrequires a visa for entry into ^UKjp\nstudy). We will no longer have aou nc n of non-Chinese speaking pe opT ef rf ok in goyer our shoulder, but on jj the other hand we will miss\nthe democratic and well established\njustice system which the British\nGovernment provides.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 1ST NOVEMBER COLUMNS7 I must apologise if my rapier wit (?!)\nappears somewhat blunted this week.\nThis is because of a very bad\nheadache that has afflicted me these\nlast few days. Not due to alcohol,\nmind, but a result of repeatedly hitting my head against a brick wall\never since reading the excellent front\npage lead from last week's Felix\n(wonder where that idea came from,\nJackie!). I now fully understand the\nfrustration of the Clayponds' residents when I read fatuous comments\nfrom Messrs Leeson (no relation),\nDaniels and , last but not least,\nCaldwell. Paul Leeson saide that\nbreak-ins only occur through ground\nfloor windows. Funny that, I always\nthought that when burglars cased a joint, they sought the most difficult\nroute into a building through the\npoint of highest security. Of course\nthey're not going through the doors\nwhen they can SlttlOIl\njemmy the win-dow s. Comments\nabout deadlocks\nmaking escape in a fire difficult are\nridiculous. When\ndid a Chief Fire\nOfficer say that\nlives would have\nbeen saved in a fire if deadlocks VOICfi Of\nhad not been fit-ted? We could Ian Caldwell\n'resigned attitude' about the persistence of criminals to its logical conclusion and sack the entire staff of\nCollege Security and scrap swipe\ncards on the basis that 'they would\nfind a way [to break in].' Fortunately\nthe Police and, unfortunately for the\nresidents, insurance companies do\nnot agree with this crazy attitude. As\nBoJker f \u00b0rn \u00b0tei r \u00b0\u00b0ms\nwith bars on the\nwindows, the only\nones that I have\nheard of are run for\nthe pleasure of Her\nMajesty, but since\nmy lawyer has just\ntold me not pursue\nthis point, I won't. As for most\nR QCLSOYl Sa\nUin\ng comment,\nit's a toss-up\nbetween Mr Caldwell reassuring us\nthat the money for the carpets come\nout of a different fund from Security,\nand the cork er from Leeson that\nthese cai pets 'will last for a good 10-15 years' even though the previous\none has barely seen out five. On\nreflection, the former just wins. The\nsubject of budgets and the way that\nthey are used here to provide a veneer of credibility to a system that\nis scandalously profligate is one that\none day, dear reader, I shall cover at\nlength, making no apology for sending you to sleep in the process, such\nis the importance of this issue. Ever\nkeen to help, I shall offer this mighty\ntrio a bit of advice. You are on a slippery slope if you persist in treating\nsome of the finest minds of their\nrespective generations like silly little\nchildren whenever they challenge\nyou. All your points have been readily demolished. Theirs haven't.. With all this accommodation\nmalarkey of late, regular readers may\nhave thought that my love affair with\nSouthside Bar was waning. Not on\nyour nelly, miss us. After the refurbishment over the summer of the cel-lar, the range and quality is better\nthan ever. You only have to look at\nmy bank balance to see that.\nWhy are you here? In an ideal world, when\nasked that question the entire student body of\nImperial should clam our in unison \"I am here\nto learn!\", because Imperial is after all an educational establishment and the reason why students come here is to be educated. Thankfully\nthough it is not an ideal world; if it were, it\nwould be very boring. Instead, everyone\nknows that students come here for a vast range\nof different reasons - maybe to learn, probably\nto gain a qualification (Felix 1066), often to\nhave a good time, often to avoid having to do\nany work. So inevitably a significant proportion of the student body have motivations other\nthan those the college would wish: they miss\nlectures, hand in work late (if at all),\ndevote their time to drink, drugs,\nwomen, men, the internet, sports,\nclubbing, whatever pleases them.\nI have nothing against this; after\nall, Imperial would be an extremely\ndead place without such a variety of\ndifferent attitudes. \u00ab \u201e 1 _ . .\nv,, \u201e , , , - in the cou Not only that but\nundergraduates are supposed to be self motivating. It is for them and nobody else to decide\nif they should work or not, and what they\nshould do with their time. As far as I can see,\nit is nobody else's business. If they choose not\nto work it is their prerogative. Similarly if college decides to kick them out for doing no\nwork, that is the college's prerogative. It is\nsimple, straightforward, and it works - the students who should be here stay, those who\nshouldn't leave. At least that is how it should\nbe.\nSadly though, it doesn't seem to work like\nthat. For some reason the academic staff see\nthings differently. As far as they are concerned,\nstudents have to work, whether they want to or\nnot. Distractions may be allowed (if one is\nlucky) but only when they are officially sanctioned. Students not wishing to work are not\nremoved from the system as they should be,\nbut are pampered, cos set ed and n annie d all the\nway through a degree that they themselves do\nnot wish to be doing. And all the while they are\ntreating us like five year olds, the authorities\nchant that 'you are all adults, it is your responsibility now' with a surprising lack of irony to\ntheir words. A case in point: a few years ago,\nthe Department of Computing kept its facilities\nopen 24 hours a day. They stopped this, their\njustification being that it had an 'adverse effect\non some of the students'. Well, as far as I am\nconcerned anyone who does not have the self\ndiscipline required to go to sleep now\nand then should not be at Imperial,\nfull stop. There is no justification for\nthe college to punish the majority\nsimply on the grounds that there are a few people who cannot deal with\ntheir own freedom - people who can-ro pn fr]u tV1,01 l0 \u00b0 ka ft C rUi uw LJ themselves to that\nlevel do not deserve the degree at all.\nSo why is it that so much effort is devoted to\nnanny ing students who should not be here at\nall? There is no logical reason for it in terms of\nthe college and its aims. It simply makes no\nsense at all - those who do not want to be here,\nor are not capable of being here, should not be\nhere; but instead they are forced to stay even if\nit means restricting the 'adult' freedom of the\nrest of the student body.\nIs there an explanation? Of course there is.\nStudents bring in money. More students equals\nmore money. Seeing as losing money is fundamentally bad, IC needs as many students as it\ncan possibly accomodate, and stuff the other\nconsequences.\nTHE WEEKLY POEM supplied by PoetIC\nMY DREAM\nHiding underneath my shadow, behind my reflection,\nI hunger for protection, I thirst for comfort.\nSticking my head out from my shell from time to time,\nI see the slime, the sickness known as humankind.\nOpening my ears, I hear the agonising moans,\nSocieties sickening groans, and pleas for peace\nFrom people dying slowly, wounded with the strife,\nCut open with a sharpened knife, no mercy shown\nBy this villain known as life.\nBut sometimes when I sleep, I'm free to dream\nAnd then it seems that there is more than this.\nOur villi an meets his match, and cannot spread\nHis conquering dread, and we are led\nAway by greatness, to a world where shadows hide,\nThirst subsides, hunger is a memory i All shells are cast away, and laughing drowns\nUnhappy sounds, and I am now at peace\nWith this hope that I have found.\nKeith\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial\nCollege.
