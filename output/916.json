Are you not affected by the\npitiful level of grants, by lack of\ngovernment benefits to students? I think not! So why weren't you at the\nUL U Hallowe'en sleep out demonstration on 31st October? I was and I saw only one other person\nfrom IC there (Hi Ed!). In asking\naround I generally got the response\n' IC, they're all tories aren't they?'\nAre you? Or are you all just a load\nof apathetic scientists willing to let\nsomeone else make the point?\nIn case you're interested (a bit\nlate!) the demo was to protest at the\npresent Government's attitude to\nstudents where money is concerned,\nDear Adam,\nI am writing to complain about\nthe quality of service offered by the\nin-college NatWest bank, which I would describe as fucking shit, but\nI will content myself by defining it\nas less than adequate.\nAnyone unfortunate enough to be\nin a financial situation that requires\nmore than the insertion of a piece\nof plastic into a computer embedded\nin a wall (i.e. the use of a cashpoint)\nmay find themselves in the ghastly\ncircumstance of having to visit the\nNatWest bank in the Sherfield\nBuilding (if you have the bad luck\nof having an account there\u2014a position I find myself in but will\nsoon rectify).\nThose in the know will understand why I describe the\nabove situation as ghastly. For the\nblissfully ignorant I will paint a scenario that will outline the\nproblem: It's12.30pm \u2014lectures\nhave just finished and student Bob\nrushes to the IC branch of the\nNatWest bank. Bob ordered a cashpoint card over six weeks ago\nand despite repeated requests and\nthe creation of several embarrassing\nscenes involving embarrassed bank\nstaff he has still not been issued with\na replacement card. Bob has also\nfilled out a form informing the bank\nof a change in his correspondence\naddress on four separate occasions,\nbut to read and act upon this\ninformation is either too menial a task for the bank's employees or (as\nI suspect) there are not enough of\nthem to cope.\nespecially with respect to housing\nbenefits. There was entertainment\n'till midnight in the form of\nmusicians, dancing and jugglers and\nsome terribly boring political\nspeeches (although it was fun\nbooing at them and shouting\nsarcastic comments). We then\nmoved to Malet Street and lined up\nalong the pavements in sleeping\nbags for the night (some of us did\ntry to settle down in the middle of\nthe road where we felt we would be\nmore not i cable but the organisers\nweren't too amused and the police\ndid persuade us to join the rest\nbefore too long...).\nAt this point it began to rain and\nthe night was spent wrapped up in\nAnyway, Bob is out of money\nand thoroughly pissed off at having\nto cash cheques over the past six\nweeks\u2014he's going to the bank to\nsort out things once and for all.\nAs Bob approaches the bank he\nsees a queue of disgruntled students\nstretching from inside the bank into\nthe corridor. Peering round the\ncorner Bob( who is a very intelligent student) quickly identifies\nthe root of the problem (as he has\ndone on every other visit to the\nbank); there are about ten people\nwaiting for normal over-the-counter\nservices with two or three cashiers\nto serve them. A combination of the\nhigh staff to customer ratio and the\nshort length of time required to\ncarry out these services means that\nthe turnover of the ten or so people\nwaiting for the cashiers is high. The\nremaining people, however, are\nwaiting for the dreaded 'Enquiries\nCounter'. There are about 15-20\npeople in this queue (many would-be queue rs leave after the reality of\nthe situation dawns upon them).\nBehind the enquiries counter is, on\naverage, half a member of staff (the\nother half is busy doing another ten\nthings at the same time) to serve 15\npeople whose enquiries will on\naverage be at least five minutes or\nso in length. It does not take a PhD in mathematics to realise that the\nturnover of people in this queue\nwill, as a consequence, be bloody\nslow. And as a consequence of the\nbloody slow turnover of people, it\nis 1.30pm before Bob gets to the\ncounter to be told that if he wants\ndustbin bags and sodden sleeping\nbags. However, many of us stuck\nit out (maybe something to do with\nthe fact the tube had closed for the\nnight?).\nAnyway fun was had by all and\nwe maybe achieved something too,\nas we did get on various news\nprogrammes.\nSo, why weren't you there?\nCome to the next UL U demo and\nI hope you all had a worthwhile\ntime last Thursday al seep in your\nnice warm beds of apathy.\nOh yes \u2014 if you were one of those\nliving at College Hall on Malet\nStreet watching us from the\nwindow \u2014 FUCK YOU! Lej7a Sherwin,\nBiology 2.\na new cashpoint card he'll have to\nfill out this form. Bob responds by\npounding his head on the counter\nuntil his lifeless body slumps to the\nfloor. 'Another crazy student'\nthinks the person behind the\ncounter.\nBob's life could have been saved\nin three ways:\n1) Increase the number of staff\navailable to deal with 'enquiries'\u2014\nafter all, this is a bank that caters\nmainly to students, and students, as\na sad consequence of many factors,\nare bound to have more financial\nenquiries than your average person.\n2) Keep the enquiries counter\nopen after bank hours so that not all\nthe financial problems of 5000\nstudents have to be dealt with\nduring the lunch break.\n3) Have a separate office away\nfrom the main bank where enquiries\ncan be dealt with more easily eg.\nlike the temporary NatWest stall\nthat was present with all those\nelusive staff at the beginning of term\nto entire us to open accounts.\nYours in anticipation,\nA new Lloyds Bank customer.\nName withheld by request.\nP.S.I hope that this letter has as\nmuch effect on NatWest bank as the\nletter in last week's Felix had upon\nthe pricing of goods in the QT.

The Council\ntax is expected to be law by\nChristmas as it is being forced\nthrough Parliament using a guillotine procedure.\nWhen it is introduced in April of\n1993 it will place residential regions\ninto bands. This attempt to reflect\nvariations in property value will\nclearly give higher values in the\nSouth East of England. The National Union of Students ( NUS), to which IC Student Union does not\nbelong, has 'cautiously' welcomed\nthe new tax, despite the Labour\nparty's claims that some students\nwill pay more, adding that the new\ntax is a shrewd pitch to get first-time\nvoters.\nAll full-time students in halls of\nresidence, hostels, or any building\nin which the occupants are all\nstudents, will be exempt from\npaying the new tax. The term 'full-time' is defined as those who study\nat least 21 hours a week for 24\nweeks of the year or more. If one\noccupant of the residence is a non-LSD\nThe police have reported that 'Blue\nStar' ta too s, otherwise known as\ntabs, containing LSD are being\ncirculated by drug dealers. Some of\nthese have been found to contain\nstrychnine* a chemical used in the\nproduction of LSD which is highly\npoisonous. The symptoms of strychnine poisoning are cramps in\nthe jaw and stomach, which follow\nthe usual effects associated with the\ndrug. The police advice is to stay\nclear and report anything unusual to\nthem.\nstudent then the people in the\nbuilding will pay 7 5 % of the tax,\nwhile if there are two, or more,\nnon-student occupants the charge\nwill be the entire rate designated to\nthe area.\nIn buildings of' multiple occupation' (mixed students and\nnon-students) the building's owner\nwill be charged, and they will share\nthe amount amongst occupants as\nthey see fit. Students living at home\nwill not make any difference to their\nparents' bill.\nFor example, the owner of a building valued at \u00a3250,000,\nsituated in Earl's Court, housing\ntwenty people of which two are non\nstudents, will receive a bill for\n\u00a3520. If the owner chooses to share\nthis equally among the occupants,\nthen each individual will pay \u00a326\nper year.\nMr RobB right well, a spokesperson of the Department of\nthe Environment, described some\nfeatures of the new tax as 'slightly\nconfusing'. Brian Gould, Labour\nMP, has called the new Council Tax\nan attempt to 'splice together an\nunfair property tax with poll-tax\nprinciples'.\nStress\nThe College Health Centre intends\nto set up 'examination stress\nworkshops' next term. Although\nthey say that some stress is\nunavoidable, such as around\nexamination, people who feel they\nare particularly prone should\ncontact the Health Centre. If there\nis sufficient interest workshops will\nagain be held.\nThe Health Centre is located at\n14 Princes Gardens and patients are\nreminded they are entitled to see\ntheir medical records.\nApplications for 16 places to study\nacademic projects in Israel \" are being offered by the London-based\nAcademic Study Group. The Academic Study Group which\ncounts Sir Eric Ash as a member,\nis offering the places with a \u00a3500\nbursar y to the chosen projects. The Director, Mr John Levy, said that\nthey were offering 'academic study\nand a little bit more..' for successful\napplicants.\nThe deadline for projects is May1992 but 'soundings' on ideas can\nbe obtained by writing to the AS G at 25 Lyndale Avenue NW2.

Tim Proctor,\nC& GU President, told Felix that\nonly 60 people signed up for the\nsession in advance, so they were\nexpecting a low turnout. The event\nwas advertised in College media,\nafter which 115 people attended.\nOut of this number 109 were\nallowed to donate.\nThis year the session was\norganised by the North London Blood Transfusion Service( NL BTS) for the first time,\nreplacing the South London Blood\nTransfusion Service only three\nweeks before the event. Mr Proctor\nsaid that the date had to be brought\nforward from Tuesday to Friday,\nmeaning that the Islamic Society's Friday prayers had to be relocated\nin the Union Concert Hall.

The\nIC Red Cross unit was formed 15\nyears ago and is still is the only\nUniversity Red Cross unit in the\ncountry.\nThe awards were presented by Mr J. Lockwood of London's Red\nCross. The ceremony was attended\nby Zoe Hellinger, Union President\nand many other ex- Imperial\nstudents.\nthey intend to stay with the North\nLondon centre permanently but will\nendeavour to maintain the usual\nTuesday booking in future.\nA spokeswoman from the\nNL BTS said that they gain only a small proportion of the blood they\nrequire at local colleges. She\ncontinued, ' We need to get young\nfit people giving blood and show\nthem that it's no big deal, its not\nstressful and it does not hurt. We need to get them into the habit of\ngiving blood, and its a good one.'\nThe session comes at a time when\nfunding into London' s Blood Transfusion Services is just\nbeginning to re-emerge.

But, while\nnearly everyone has heard about\nKirk, Spock and Picard, how many\nknow that Gene's Humanism and\nunshakeable confidence in the\ncapacity and future of Humanity is\nthe bed-rock of Star Trelc?

Dribblers\nThe Dribblers showed the men how\nto really open the season by beating\nthe London Hospital 13-0 last\nSunday. The fact that London Hospital had only 10 women had\nnothing to do with it. Captain Permi\nhad a quiet game and only scored\n8 goals. Other goals came from Jo\n(3), Chris (1) and Rachael (1), who\nhad finally found the net after two\nyears.\nThe player of the match was the\ngoalie, Sandra, who eventually got\ninto the game towards the end of the\nfirst half, after a back pass from a defender. After this 13-0 thrashing\nit was off to the bar for the main\nhighlight of the day - the customary\nboat race. The Dribblers showed\nconsistent form by beating the\nLondon Hospital easily, despite\nEthel's attempts to the contrary.\nAfter this astounding start to the\nLeague, it was back to the usual\nstuff for the Dribblers the following\nweek with a Cup game against\nKing's College Hospital. Having\nfinally scraped together 11 players,\nthe Dribblers lost a player at\nVictoria Station. After eventually\nregrouping at the ground, the\nDribblers finally got down to the\nbusiness of playing football and\nsurprisingly found themselves 2-1\nup at half time, thanks to two goals\nfrom Permi.\nBut obviously, this was not to\nlast, and after 3 successive goals\nfrom King's, the Dribblers trailed\n4-2. So picture the scene, 2 goals\nadrift, 15 mins to go, and an early\nexit from the Cup looming. Any other team would have broken\nunder the pressure, but not the\nalmighty Dribblers. In their true\nvaliant style, the Dribblers fought\nback, against all odds, and levelled\nthe scores at 4-4 to make the game\ngo into extra time (both goals scored\nby Permi). And indeed Captain\nPerfect scored another two goals in\nextra time, to finally put the game\nbeyond the reach of King's, and\nhence taking all the glory.\nOrienteering\nLast Saturday saw the Orienteering\nClub compete in the Cambrdige\nUniversity Sprint-0. The event, held\nin Bedfordshire, saw a number of\nuniversities competing over a series\nof 'knock-out' courses. Against stiff\ncompetition, IC did well. Captain,\nT.

    "content": "8 November1991 Felix 916 Music\nNed's Atomic Dustbin\n\u2014 Kilburn National\nThe Wonder Stuff\n\u2014 Camden Palace\nNed's are ones for originality, and\nthis reflects in the music; if you've\nheard one, well basically, you've\nheard them all. Don't take that as\na criticism, since that one song is\ndead good. The band started off in\nfine style only to come to a grinding\nhalt three times due to a somewhat\ndod gyP A. This enabled the fans to\nsubject the band to the rather typical\nchants of' You' re Shite' and ' Fat Bastard'. But when they did play,\nit was storming, with fave s such as\nKill Your TV, etc. The floor was\na seething mass of hot sweaty\nbodies and Jonn 'the singing man', finished it off in fine style by falling\nunconscious and playing dead...\nThe next night was Camden Palace's5 th Birthday Party, and all\nthe rumours were for an appearance\nof Ned' s. It didn't take long before\nword got round that ' Jon' had been\ntaken ill, and so Ned's were not\nappearing. First the Power of\nDreams played, who I thought were\ngood, but most of the interest was\non who was to follow. Well I was\nwell impressed when The Wonder\nStuff took the stage, and so was\neveryone else if the shouting was\nanything to go by. The Stuffies\nwere completely brilliant and\nplayed just their early, wild, material and were beyond comparison to most other bands.\nI left Camden well satisfied, and\nam now looking forward to\nDecember when the Stuffies play at\nBlack Rock Coalition\n\u2014 History of the Future\nJust to start I would like to say that\nI hate compilation records and rock\nmusic, so perhaps I'm not the best\nperson to review this.\nThe idea of rock music is that the\nperson compiling this collection\nseems rather warped. The tracks\nrange from mellow tunes, more like\nballads, to the more typical\nscreaming guitars and sc re etching vocals. At least they don't sing the\nsame macho lyrics as most other\ngroups of this type do.\nLyrics are based around love,\npersonal problems and racial\nproblems.\nNone of the tracks stick in my\nmind, they all seem to blend into\none song forty minutes long. Sorry\nbut this ain't my thing.\nPebbles.\nManic Street Preachers\n\u2014 Repeat/Love's Sweet Exile\nI was asked, nay, requested, nay,\ntold, that at some point in this\nreview I should make some\ncomment about this band's name.\nSomething like calling them\n' Maniac Strip Prats' or some,\nvariation. Well, what can I say.\nThis sort of dictatorial leadership is\nthe kind of thing revolutions are\nfounded on.\nAs for the record, it's crap.\nWhere shall I start, is it the vain\nattempt to sound like the early\nClash!, is it the complete lack of any song?, is it hell? Yes This lot said that they were going\nto write one song that would be the\ndefinitive rock and roll song, take\nthe world by storm and live off the\nroyalties for the rest of their lives.\nDon't give up your day jobs, lads.\nThey have some talent; they know\nwhich way round to hold their\nguitars.\nBack to the subject that started\nthis review. If you can think of any\nbetter piss-takes of their name, send\nthem to the Felix office before next\nFriday and the best suggestion gets\nit.

    "content": "8 November1991 Felix 916 Feature\nNewcastle, the place where Newcastle Brown comes from. Full\nof loud obnoxious hockey players\n(male and female) singing good old\ntraditional bar songs. Toby has been\nawarded the Great White Shark fin\nfor his performances both here and\nin Scotland. Yes, he has at long last\ncome out of his shell and is now sex\non a stick. All applications for\ndinner with this hunk should be\naddressed to To by 'no I'm not\ngoing to tell you about the shower'\nJones c/o Felix. Security was tight\nbut very sexy. Let's just leave it at\nthat before we put our feet in it.\nThursday, York. News most disgusting thing they had ever\nseen and were bound to sell on the\nblack market for at least 20p each.\nAfter another drunken debauch ero us evening in the Bar we\nheaded off towards one of the halls\nand a comfortable bed each for the\nnight. However, being totally\ninebriated by alcohol and not\nlooking where I was going, I fell off\nthe edge of the world - well, the\nker b and badly twisted my ankle.\nI hobbled back to the hall (good\nsympathy ploy), ate a nine inch\npizza and went off to bed with my\ntrusty companions. At this stage we\ndecided that Nottingham needed\nothers as well, and a rather large\nhost of pubs around the town.\nFeeling the need for a little culture\nafter a couple of pints, we visited\nGlasgow Cathedral - very gothic.\nThe munchies induced a trip to\nSainsbury's, which coincidentally\nhad a rather large wine shop.\nDinner was a blur, as was the rest\nof the evening as the 'local' for\nBeccy's hall was doing \u00a31.00 a pint\n- we drank them dry by midnight\nand were forced back to the hall\nwith some carry-outs. The best\nthing about Scotland is the unusual\nlicensing laws. It seems to me that\nat any point, day or night, you will\nfind at least one pub open.\nPersonally I'm moving up there\nnext week - transfer forms are\navailable from Strathclyde University Admissions Office( address available from IC Careers\nOffice - 3rd floor Sherfield).\nBeware though, the Scots hit\nUniversity one year earlier than us\nat the ripe old age of 17 - this results\nin them drinking all their lager\nthrough straws and getting\ncompletely legless on about two\npints.\nOn Wednesday we kidnapped\nBeccy, forcefully preventing her\nfrom attending a lecture on social\nhistory or something equally arty-far ty, and whisked her off to\nEdinburgh to see the Castle. Jenn\n- being the typical Yankee Tourist\n- attempted to make the guards on\nthe gate smile. Unfortunately she\nFlash an attempt was made\non To by' s life when some looney\nred head (a.k.a Sam Cox) made a valiant effort to push him off the top\nof a rather steep hill.( Un)fortunately he managed to\ncling-on. Life was relieved by a boisterous brass band hopping\naround the centre of the market\nplace, dressed in rather bright\njackets. Thank y 'all for getting rid\nof some tension that had been\ndrew the line at going up and\nundoing his flies - the chicken.\nBeing a little bit suicidal and getting\nrather excited about the Rugby, I thought it would be a good idea to\nshout the England rugby chant at the\ntop of my voice... luckily the getaway car was up and running and\nhad enough petrol in it to get us to\nNewcastle before the Scots got me.\nbrewing for a couple of days. On to Nottingham, another very American University. The Union Bar wasn't called the Mandela Bar\nbut was full of some rather\nemotionally unstable Raggies who\nhad just finished their Rag Runs for\nthe year and who very willingly\nbought the last 50 Rag Mags we had\nwith us, saying that they were the\nlivening up and so began to sing a full repertoire of IC Bar songs. We were then joined by some 'dork'\nwho tried to convince Jenn that he\nhad some 'very interesting curtains'\nin his room, and that she must go\nback with him and look at them.\nThis taught us one lesson - all male\nstudents are obsessed with getting\ntheir end away, and that it's not just\nthose at IC which have the awful\nchat up lines.\nFriday, the last day of our trip\nand where do we decide to go?\nCambridge, that place of happy\nsmiles and mad cyclists. We enter\nthe Electrical Engineering department; Sociables0 Unsociables 1. We go to Trinity\nCollege to track down some friends;\nSociables 0 - Unsociables 2. We go\nto Fitzwilliam College; Sociables 2\n- Unsociables 3. By this stage we\nwere getting fed up with rude and\ninsolent personnel and so, without\nfinding anyone we knew, we sped\nhome to the trusty old ICU Bar.\nStraight down the Ml1, back to the\nsmog of London... breathe that air\n- doesn't that feel better; the\nknowledge that with every breath\nyou are reducing your life span by\nabout 30 seconds. Back to College\nand into the Felix Office with the\nwarmest welcome we had received\nall week - 'you're not leaving that\nblown out tyre in here are you?'\nThanks Adam it feels great to be\nback.\n\u2014 9 \u2014\n\n"

All events will be detailed\nin next week's Felix, but a summary table has been put on this\n'blind' for 24 hours (Monday/\nTuesday), various people participating in the Sponsored City\nPub Crawl( Friday 22nd) and of course a positive plethora of people\nparticipating in the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump Rag Week Introduction\npage for your information. If you're\nnot sure exactly what the events\ncomprise then see last week's Felix.\nMany people already have\nsponsored events planned, so if you\nget the chance please sponsor them.\nAmongst others, these include\nMichelle and Cathy (behind the\ndesk in the Union Office) dressing\nup as Tweed leD um and TweedleDee for the whole day (Tuesday),\nRachel Mountford dying her hair\n(with permanent dye) in the Union Colours, Stef Smith (Felix) going\n(Saturday 23rd). If you're not doing anything yet,\nthen see either your Hall Rag\nRepresentative, Social Rep or just\nturn up to today's or next week's Rag meetings; there's bundles for\neveryone to do, so come and see us.\nIf any of the above sponsored events\nappeal to you, especially the last\ntwo, come and see me ASAP for\ndetails and a sponsor form. Everyone's welcome.\nLastly, the City and Guilds Union\n( C&GC U) still require slaves for\nthe Slave Auction - enquire at the\nGuilds Office. Don't worry, there\nare rules. So go and sign up. Also lastly, the Hall Rag Reps are getting\ntogether at the moment to organise\na 'Giant Conga' around Princes\nGardens on the Sunday afternoon of\nRag Week, so look out for that.\nWith a large enough turn out we\ncould also try and break the\nCaterpillar Dash record - presently\nheld by York Rag. Come and join\nin, it'll be a good laugh, provided\nit doesn't rain.\nVery lastly, keep a look out for\nanything else happening, either in\nCollege or in your hall. In a week\nfrom now things are going to get\nvery silly, so don't miss out.\nCheers Penguin, Rag Chair 91/92.\nPS, If anyone has a blue duff le coat\n(any size) that we could borrow for\nthe week, please contact me\nurgently.\nDear Flanaholics Anonymous,\n...most people think it will never\nhappen to them, but they don't know\nwhat it can be like during Rag\nWeek. Everywhere you turn it's happening - people getting flan ned. There's no protection (except,\nperhaps, if you 're the Rector) and\nanyone could be the next victim...\nFlanning is carried out by the\ninfamous Guilds Hit Squad. A highly organised, finely tuned team,\nwhose sole purpose is to go out and\nflan someone of your choice, for a modest fee. Their excuse for this\nactivity is that all the money raised\ngoes to charity.\nIf you want to take a Hit out on\nVarious Nasties\nsomeone, then pop up and see the\nhappy people in the Guilds Office\n(Mech Eng Level 3) at anytime\nduring Rag Week. If you wear\ncontact lenses then you can obtain\nimmunity from being flan ned in the\nface, again by popping into the\nGuilds Office. If you don't tell\nthem, they can't help you( that\napplies to everything really).\nIf you think that you'll be flan ned once too often during the week,\nthen fret not, a solution is a hand.\nComplete immunity. However it\ndoes cost. You have been told, the\nchoice'is now yours.\nA Flanner.\nin through the door. Now he had\ncover. The day had been long,\nmaybe too long. He was starting to\nloose the edge and he knew it. The\nincident in the Common Room had\nbeen close, maybe too close. It was\nonly his quick reflexes, a little luck,\nand a clean shot with his pistol that\nhad saved him there. It was a stupid\nmove to check his internal post. A mistake he would remember not to\nmake again. At least now he knew\nwho was after him.\nOn reflection the day had been\ngood. Three kills to his credit\nalready and it was only Monday.\nThe first two had been standard\npistol shots, but he had taken pride\nin the third. An aerosol can with the\ntop taped down and 'Gas Grenade'\nwritten on the side. He'd thrown it\nthrough the open window, while his\ntarget inside had been doing\nproblem sheets. He remembered the\npleasure he'd had, knocking on his\ntarget's door and asking him to sign\nhis death warrant.\nIt was late now. He needed a good night's sleep so he could be\nup early in the morning to wait for\nhis next target outside Chem Eng.\nHe stopped outside his room. Even\nthis late in the day he could not be\ntoo careful. He readied his pump\naction shotgun and slowly pushed\nthe door. Crouching down he\npeered round the door. Even in the\ndim light he could tell that the room\nwas clear. It was such a relief. He\nhadn't really realised how on edge\nhe'd been until now. Now he was\nsafe.\nHe made a last check, put the\ndraft exclude r against the door to\nstop any attacks from there, and\nwalked slowly across the room to\nthe window. That's when the\nringing started. It took him a minute\nor two to find the package. It was\njust under his bed. It was a small\nbox with an alarm clock in and\n'Time Bomb' written neatly on the\ntop. How it had got there he could\nonly guess. However the long and\nshort of it was that he was now\ndead. Just as he realised this there\nwas a knock at his door ...\nKiller, there's nothing like it.\nTake part. The idea is simple: on\njoining Killer you are given a target\nwhich you have to 'eliminate'. Once\neliminated, you proceed to\neliminate your target's target and so\non. All the while, however, you are\ntrying to avoid being killed by your\nkiller, who may change if they are\nkilled by their killer. Confused?\nNever mind, take part anyway, it's great fun and there are Cash Prizes\nfor the Winners.\nTo sign up come along to the Rag\nMeeting today, in the Union Lounge at 12.40pm or to the IC Union Office on Mon, Tue, or Wed between 12.30pm and l. OOpm and\nask for Wens. All it costs is \u00a32.50\n+ 2 photos of yourself. So Be Mad, Be Silly & Be Part of It!\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

If you\ndon't know them by now, then you\nobviously have reading difficulties,\nie, you don't know how to. Yes,\nI 've been waiting for this, one of the\nworld's best bands new album\n(mind you, I am biased). Iam also\nallowed, Editor Willing, to convey\nemotion in extreme invective\n( Thanks, Adam) which is,\nincidentally, the only apropos of\nCathal Coughlan and his not-so-merry men.\nThe album opens with 'Behind the\nMoon', a languid acoustic strum\nelegantly trickling through anger,\ninadequacy and all resultant abuses-'She says ' Go', meaning 'Stay',\nmeaning ' You have to pay\". Cathal's passion is imbued in the\nlovely pianissimo arrangements like\nElvis Costello playing Donald\nFagen, or vice versa, and this\ncontinues in the title track; an\nembittered tale of a young Irishman\ndisillusioned and misunderstood in r' freak show Britain'. It could almost\nbe autobiographical, but there's no\ntime here for reflection. If you\nthought 'Blues for Ceausescu' was\nEngland, Monarchy, dynasty/ nepotism viciously castrated by men with guitars for\nshears, the bastard rewrite of\nR.E.M.' s 'Shiny Happy People' is\nthe coup de grace, a vibrator\nwrapped in barbed wire and stuffed\nup ' The well-spanked arse s of the\ncloset queens who make it a crime\nto be gay'. Both quality and quantity\nof venom are unbelievable as lines\nlike ' You look like the type who\nlikes to suck a big pipe' and ' Fuck you, Showbusiness' are spat out.\nAnd this is all over a manic hip-hop\nbeat and a wizened warble of\nR.E.M.' s chorus. You want to see\nthe corpse of some grinning witch-hag from her wholly undeserved\nrest in ' Mario Vargas Yon i'. And so, as the end approaches\nthrough the unrestrained beauty of\n' Long About Now' and ' The Great\nValerio' (both cover versions), the\ngreat pop icon/iconoclast Cathal\nCoughlan emerges as a blazing\nthose famous faces blush like their\nwell spanked arse s?

He walks arm in arm with\nbeauty and hatred while he\nrecharges My sense of both. Let us\nnot forget, anger is an energy.\nDavid. The lead singer of This Picture is\nlike a whirling dervish, like a hyperactive Tim Booth, his arms\nflailing, and his bare feet leaping\nand bounding across the stage. I think it's called presence. Whatever\nit is, he's got it.\nThree weeks back, Pebbles said that\nthe lyrics, and I quote, 'make about\nas much sense as a parrot on speed.'\nThey made sense to me, particularly\nas they didn't play their single, with\nlines such as T think he's a tree',\nbut I don't know whether that says\nmore about the lyrics or about me.\nOf the songs they do play, Death\nSweet Religion stands out as the\nbest, but This Picture's melodic\nstyle, coupled with their lead\nsinger's evident madness, makes\nthem a band to see, if you get the\nchance and you have, if you can\nface seeing Midge Ure, because\nthey're supporting him.

They are\nalso reportedly Miles Stuffie's favourite band. Hell, you won't listen to me, listen to him.\nThe Dylans are a trains potter band. Any band that sells a parka\ncoat with a Dylans badge sewn on,\nand looks like this band does,\nprobably spend their spare time\nlooking for trains, well, I know I do (Alex). If you close your eyes,\nthey're much better, indie stuff.

It is true that\nLondon students have been shat on\nfrom an inordinately great height\nfor an awfully long time, and yet the\nstudents of this esteemed institution\nkeep their heads diligently down,\naiming for that not-so-far off well\npaid accountancy job. The cumulative effect of six thousand\nstudents trying their utmost not to\nmake waves is singularly depressing.\nSecondly, sit-down demonstrations perform no discern able use\nexcept to fill up news pages with big\npictures of indignant students. I don't believe that the Government\ntakes an awful lot of notice - the\nSuffragettes had to chain themselves\nto railings, burn acid holes in golf\ncourses and undergo force feeding,\nbut in the end it was the First WorldWar that persuaded the Government\nthat women performed a useful\nfunction deserving of suffrage.\nIncidentally, I wasn't at the\nsleep out because on Thursday\nnights I wrestle with our demonic\ncollating machine.\nA mere escutcheon\nIt makes you so confident in the\ncountry's press. Since the story on the 'Super Plug' ran, we have had\ntwo phone calls from journalists\nasking to speak with Richard Sea\n(aka Alec Baldwin, star of' The Hunt for Red October'), claiming\nthat they have had no success in\nfinding him at Silwood Park. This\nis not s uprising, of course, as the\nstory was completely fictitious. I admit that putting a misleading\narticle on the front page was\nethically on shaky ground, but it\nwould not be an exaggeration if I said I am very worried that anybody\ncould take it seriously. In addition,\nI am amazed that the national papers\ntake any notice of such small fry as\nourselves. Two years or so ago,\nunder the Smedley hegemony, a feature was run concerning an AC battery. This caused as much\nenquiry and is equally as ridiculous.\nA late letter\nI have received a letter from Laura Barker, of IC Association of University Teacher s(AUT) following my comment in response\nto the letter by S.A.V. Swanson\nconcerning the college day in last\nweek's issue.

    "content": "Tired Buildings\nThe Union Building, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a360,000\nHealth &\nSafety\nImperial College has been forced to\nback down on its proposed changes\nto the College Safety Council\nresponsible for Health and Safety in\nall areas of College.\nThe changes announced last June\nmeant overall voting control of the\nCouncil would stand with the\nManagement nominated representatives. This change,\ntechnically illegal under Government Health and Safety\nregulations, was to have been\nimplemented at the next Council\nmeeting, scheduled for the end of\nOctober but is now delayed until\nnext Tuesday, without any prior\ndiscussion.\nThe Manufacturing Science and\nFinance Union( MSF), one of the\nsix unions in College, held an extraordinary meeting last Tuesday. At the meeting, they voted to withdraw\nfrom College committees and\nprocedures, and form their own\nsafety committee, calling on Management to join the new safety\nstructure. This would effectively\nsuspend all safety procedures in\nCollege until Management conformed.\nMr John Pai gne, Industrial Relations officer at Imperial said\nthat the control of the Committee\nlay with management nominated\nmembers which 'is not necessarily\nthe same as management'. He also\nstated that the Council did not make\ndecisions but 'advised' the Rector\nso any changes had no real effect.\nThis has been hotly denied by the\nUnions in College and lead to the\nunanimous declaration from the\nMSF meeting that 'Safety is not\nnegotiable'.\nAt present, it is unclear why\nCollege management tried to make\nsuch a volatile move. A new safety\ndocument has been produced,\nreducing the management presence\nat the Council. This new statement\nwill be discussed at the next Council\nmeeting on Tuesday. If the\nproposals are rejected then the\nentire safety structure in College\nwould be called into question.\nA report by the lay chairmen of\nuniversity councils released this\nweek revealed that University\nbuildings and residences are in a dangerous condition due to years of\nfinancial neglect. It suggests that the\nsafety of staff and students is in\ndoubt and that an estimated \u00a3752\nmillion is needed over the next ten\nyears just for the maintenance of\nteaching accommodation, laboratories, libraries, offices and\nstudent residences, in this country.\nIn addition, the report stated that\nthe 'ageing and deteriorating\nfacilities pose a threat to the first\nclass learning and advanced research required in the coming\ndecades'. Also it said, that ' if the\nlevel of expenditure cannot be\nincreased, then it is likely that the\nfabric of the buildings will deteriorate substantially, thereby\nincreasing the risk of total\nbreakdown of individual systems\nand dangers to occupants and\npassers-by.'\nMr Gordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, said that he was concerned\nabout the problems raised in the\nreport, adding that it was a 'fairly\naccurate picture of the situation'.\nHe told Felix that many of IC's buildings date back to the 1950s and\n1960s and there was the potential\nfor a massive expenditure which\ncannot be funded internally. He said\nthat it was necessary to replace\nboilers, to rewire many buildings\nand to solve problems associated\nwith flat roofs. He said that\nbuildings are 'getting tired' and\ncurrently 'internal services are\nvulnerable.'\nThe Universities Funding Council ( UFC) have set up a working party, chaired by Sir Idris\nPearce, and Vice-Chancellors are\ndue to meet with the Prime Minister, John Major, in the next\nfew weeks.\nAmendment\nThere is an amendment to the RAG Week Timetable on page 7. It\nshould read Thursday21 st Hypnosis Show, Great Hall and\nFriday 22nd The Smoking Conceit\nCabaret, Union Building.\n99% Apathy\nThe Union General Meeting, held\non 7 November in the Union Building's conceit hall was attended\nby 23 students. It must be assumed\nthat 9 9 . 6 % of IC's students are\nrapturous ly pleased with how the\nStudent Union operates.\n\n"

His legs and arms pumped\nfrantically, powered by implanted\nchips who had decided that sending\nsignals through his brain was a pointless detour.\nHe turned a bend in the tunnel to\nconfront a six and half foot robot\nroller skater wearing bright red and\ngreen shorts and a six foot long\nsound system welded to one\nshoulder. This though was not the\nthing that concerned Stress but the\nfact that the robot had turned the\nsound machine full on and was\nchanting in time to the rhythm,\nwaving a massive gun like a heavy\nduty baton.\n' I'M A PURSUIT COP AND I ORDER YOU TO STOP. DON'T TRY TO MOVE' COSI' MIN THE GROOVE AND I'LL STOP YOU DEAD IF YOU MOVE YOUR HEAD!' Stress reversed and ran back\ndown the tunnel, the beat continuing\nbehind him.\n' I'M UNDERCOVER AND I'M NO THIEF LOVER SO WHILE I'M RAPPING IT'S YOU I'LL BE ZAPPING!' This revelation was accompanied\nby a loud bang as a piece of\nconcrete was taken out of the wall\nnear Stress's head. Glancing behind\nhim he saw the robot gathering pace\non his roller skates. Turning forwards again he saw the tunnel\nslope down just as he lost his\nThe following list of rules\nrepresent the new regulations for\nmascot ry within Imperial. There are\nsubstantial changes mainly as a result of the accident that resulted\nin one member of college breaking\nhis leg. In agreeing on these rules\nthere has been much discussion\nover the general attitude towards\nmascot ry and it is thought that\nthings have got out of hand. The idea of it all is to have fun, raise\nmoney for charity and promote the\nidentity of the CC U's. The new\nrules will hopefully allow a more\nfriendly atmosphere to prevail,\nwhere everyone will remember it is\nonly a game and when it's all over\nfor the day both sides will be happy\nto have been together.\nAs well as the rules below other\nactivities with the mascots have\nbeen suggested\u2014such as a charity\nchallenge. The idea being that one\nC CU challenges another, for a sum\nto Rag, to do something silly with\ntheir mascot. R CSU playing snooker on the Queen's Lawn using\nTheta as a cue was one such\nsuggestion.\nIt is hoped that a joint C CU team\nwill be assembled to look after\nMike, the mascot of Imperial\nCollege, and also to promote\nbalance on the slippery surface.\nSliding down the slope he heard the\nroller skates part company with the\nground for a second before crashing\ndown close behind him. A piece of\nfloor parted company with its\nfriends and flew up into the air with\na loud bang close to Stress's head.\nThe corridor bottomed out and\nStress scrambled up and staggered\nclumsily up the curving slope of the\ntunnel. Thirty feet up he lost his\nbalance again and fell on his back\nto stare at his approaching Nemesis.\nThe robot had reached top speed\non the bottom of the slope and was\nnow hurtling towards him, stereo\nshaking the walls. Stress watched\ncalmly, adrenal in exhausted, as the\nrobot took aim, fire and blew his\nown hand off as the weapon\nexploded.\n' DAMN THAT GUN BUT I'M NOT DONE' COSI WON'T STOP' TIL I CARVE YOU UP!' As the robot rolled towards him, slowing on the steep slope until\nwithin a few feet he swung at Stress\nwith his one hand, passing so close\nto his head that Stress's cerebral\nmodifier chip with the naval\ninsignia was torn free from its place\nmascot ry at other Universities.\nThe most imp or ant point is\nMascotry is not dead and with\nthese new rules has hopefully got\na new lease of life. Please help to\nmake these rules work, if you want\nto get involved in mascot ry see the\nVice President of your C CU. The ' old' rules still apply:\nOverwhelming numbers shall be\n2:1\nNo breaking of the law or college\nrules.\nNo ex-students shall be involved.\nDamage shall be the responsibility\nof the individual(s) or the union if\nthe action was sanctioned by them.\nThere shall be no damage to college\nproperty.\nAll the mascots should be placed on\ndisplay in cabinets within a department of the college\u2014these\ncabinets will be safe, i.e.C CU's will not violate a mascot in its\ncabinet but it remains violate to\nother colleges.\nThe mascots shall be inviolate at\nthe following times:\nFreshers' Reception\nFreshers' Fair\nFreshers' Dinners\non Stress's forehead. The robot\noverbalanced and began helplessly\nrolling back down the slope.\n' LIGHTS AND SIRENS, FIRE AND IRON! MASH WITH STEEL AND CRUSH WITH WHEELS!' Holding his hand over his wound\nStress clambered up the rest of the\nslope and along the further passage\nleaving the robot to stomp up the\nslope behind him, extracting a new\ngun from its innards.\nPowered with new adrenal in Stress dashed down the tunnel\nlooking for somewhere to hide. His\nattempts to open the door were cut\nshort as the door was cut short by\nanother bullet.\n' YOU' RE BEGINNING TO TIRE AND I'M STARTING TO FIRE SO WHICH MOVES FASTER, YOU OR THIS BLASTER?' Stress didn't wait to find out but\nran across to an open doorway and\ndived into the darkness. As he\nscrambled around in the dark for\nsomewhere to hide he was grabbed\nfrom behind and dragged behind\nsome crates while a voice whispered in his ear.\n' Don't struggle, I'm a friend!'\nMascot ry Events off campus\nWhen in the respective department\ncontaining the 'safe' cabinet. (Until\narranged this is to be the C CU office).\nThis includes the journey to and\nfrom the event.\nAll vehicles are banned from\nviolate mascot ry since they are\nharder than even rugby players.\nWhen the mascot leaves the\ndepartment building containing the\nsafe cabinet it becomes violate\nunless agreed otherwise prior to the\nevent. The boundary for the R CSU whilst Theta is kept in the office\nshall be Imperial College Road.\nDuring Rag Weeks the mascots\nwill be out every day and if stolen\nare to be returned by midnight of\nthat day. A score of the respective\nviolations will be kept. At the end\nof the week a mascot exchange will\ntake place so that each C CU has a different mascot and that mascot is\nthe responsibility of the C CU possessing it, (nominally for three\nweeks) and the 'captured' mascot is\nto be used to help raise the money\nChapter 5.\nMotion.\nOur fearless\nexplorer is\ncornered by a rapping\npsychopathic\nandroid\npoliceman.\nRules required for the number of violations that occurred.

It is perfect.\nRichard La Gravense's plotline is\nminimal but highly effective in\nallowing the characters to develop\nin the two hours seventeen minutes\nof screen time. Rumour has it that\nit has been shortened for release\ntoday which would be a pity; it was\nby no means overlong in the first\nplace.\nWatching the film, it was very\neasy to forget that my screen idol\nRobin Williams was playing the\nrole of Parry. Parry was Parry. He was real. He was a man. He could\nhave been me. Similarly, Jeff\nBridges' talent was brought out by\nTerry Gilliam, and the feeling that\nhe was an actor soon evaporated as\nthe mood of the film took over.\nSimilarly, Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer and Michael\nJeter provide great support.\nI 've already stated that there was\nvery little storyline. Very little does\nhappen, but what does is of great\nsignificance. Events recur throughout The Fisher King, and\nmost of the film relates to a critical\nten seconds. It is as if a pebble the\nsize of the world was thrown in a lake at that point, the tidal waves\nspreading out and affecting all. It\nobliterated those close by, and\nnearly killed the thrower.\nI don't really have to tell you to\nsee this film. It's going to be a hit,\nif only because of Robin Williams.\nIt should be a hit, not for him alone,\nbut because the film is a beautiful\npiece of work, from all involved.\nI smell Oscars.\nStef.\nThe Two Jakes Dead Again\nFifteen years ago Chinatown was a massive hit, now Jack Nicholson\ndirects the sequel. Set again in Los Angeles twenty years after the\noriginal, Nicholson is once again\nJack Gitties.\nNicholson sets up a husband to\nconfront his wife in bed with her\nlover. During this, the husband\nshoots the wife with a gun that could\nnot have been in the room. Simple\nenough? You ain't seen nothing yet!\nThe lover was in fact the husband's business partner, and the husband\nstands to gain $6 million on his\ndeath. Obviously our Jack smells a rat and starts to investigate. This is\nwhere it starts to get confusing;\nwhile this is going on, flashbacks\nto the original Chinatown keep\nappearing and a Oil Baron is trying\nto elbow in on the oil underneath the\nland the husband's business is built\non.\nAlthough Nicholson was born to\nplay sleazy low-life detectives, this\ncannot stop the movie slipping into\noverindulgence. It is also difficult\nto fault the acting of the rich and\nfamous (and talented) people who\nappear, and show (again) how\nbeautiful California is.\nUnfortunately the film does not\nstand alone without reference to\nChinatown so it is unlikely to make\nany Box Office impact.\nAll the same Nicholson can never\nbe awful and his cheeky grin keeps\nthe film going through its many\nslow points. If you haven't seen\nChinatown then you don't stand a chance, so go and see Boyz' n' the\nHood instead.\nJonty GR Wizard. As in his debut film, Henry V, Kenneth Brannagh takes up the dual\nrole of actor and director in his\nlatest effort, Dead Again. In it he\nplays Mike Church, a private\ndetective, who is hired to discover\nthe identity of a mysterious mute\nwoman who has amnesia. Church, for convenience, names her Grace,\nand Brann a gh's wife, Emma Thompson, plays her. As you may\nremember, Thompson too appeared\nin the aforementioned Henry V. Coincidence, I'm sure.\nAs Church tries to trace this\nwoman's origins, an antiques dealer\nwho also just happens to be into\nhypnotism turns up, with a view to\nhelping Grace by placing her in a trance. Derek Jacobi plays this\ncharacter, and incidentally, his last\nappearance onscreen was in, surprise, surprise, Henry V. What happens is that Grace has\na past life experience, regressing to\nher life as the wife of a rather short-tempered German composer, in the\n40's. So short-tempered it seems\nthat he killed his wife for letting a reporter, played by Andy Garcia,\nhold her leg. What makes the whole\nthing eerie is the fact that Grace\nbears a startling resemblance to the\nwife, and Church looks incredibly\nlike the mad composer. Will history\nrepeat itself, or is the P.I. as\ninnocent as he seems?\nFor the most part, Dead Again is\na gripping yarn, with plot twists\ngalore, and Brannagh shows that he\ncan handle good old-fashioned\nthrillers as well as Shakespeare. As well as thrills, he also provides a few l aughts, some of which come\nfrom Robin Williams, who makes\na brief appearance as a disgraced\npsychiatrist. The problem is, as well\nas the deliberate comedy, there are\na couple of moments when the\nlaughter is unintentional, like the\nover-the-top climax, for instance.\nStill, don't let that put you off, as\nthis is one of the most original films\nI 've seen in a long time, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.\nScore: 8/10.\nRonnie C.

What\nwe need is your opinion on what\nchanges you' d like to see\nimplemented so that we may\nrepresent everyone the best when it\ngoes to a committee.

Every\npost grad ute who is interested in\ntheir life at Imperial and how to\nimprove it should be there.\nUnion Signs\nOver the summer, the Union purchased some expensive and nice\nsigns for each room in the Union Building. These were designed to\nmake the building more accessible\nso people knew where they were\ngoing and they were also requested\nby the students last year. Unfortunately, some juvenile members of our community have\nconsidered it 'good sport' to remove\nthose signs. I should imagine the\nthought process went something\nlike: 'It will look better in my bedroom'. This is blatant theft and\nis illegal. It is also unfair on other\nIC students because of( a) the\ninconvenience of not knowing\nwhich rooms are which, and (b) the\ncost to the union of replacement\nmust come from somewhere so it\nmeans we must cut other budgets\nfor example bar promotions or\nevents could be affected.\nMany students would appreciate\n. it if the signs were returned. Please\ncontact me on ext 3501 if you have\nany information on the whereabouts\nof the signs. If they are returned by\nnext week then no further action\nwill be taken.\nWelfare Week\nThe events of welfare week seemed\nto go well except for the lack of attendees. I do apologise for the late\npublicity but this is due to a number\nof reasons\u2014mainly lack of helpers.\nDue to the lack of numbers, I don't know whether the service is\nrequired.

If anyone\nenjoyed it that much then you'll be\n2. What facilities do you think the sports centre could provide? glad to know that any student can\ncall something similar. These are\ncalled Extraordinary General Meetings ( EG Ms). To do this,\nprepare a motion and submit it with\none hundred signatures of union\n3. What facilities do you think the sports centre shouldn't provide? members to the President. This\nforces the Union to hold a meeting\nwithin three weeks.\nEvents\nTonight is the Silwood Bonfire\n4.

What comments do you have on the current pricing strategy? Research Pub Crawl/Collection.\nFor those not going to Maidstone\nwith Rag, teams can register from\n10.00am onwards in the Union Building. There is a disco afterwards for the collectors and\nwith 300 students from other\ncolleges it should be fun.\nOn Monday there's a record sale\nin the Junior Common Room and\nin the evening there's 'Gaymers Old English Party Night'. This involves\ncheap cider give-aways and a live\nband.\nBar quiz and disco show up again\non Wednesday for a good tap and\nbrainstorm session.

Rag Week kicks\noff with Guilds Carnival. So, if you\nlike a nice quiet and restful time, I recommend you stay tucked up in\nbed with a mug of Horlicks for a week.

Unless\nthey know different, that is. Do the\nlecturers want a longer day?\nPerhaps the Research groups do,\nalthough most of the populace of the\ncollege, except the undergraduates,\nwork long hours in college anyway.\nThe undergraduates work long\nhours out of college.\nAllowing two hours each night\nfor study, that takes the proposed\nworking week to 50 hours. For a 'job' that pays \u00a33000 a year, anyone\nelse would be out on strike.\nThen there is the rush hour.\nTravelling home in that every night\nmeans that, in my case, I can expect\nto get to sit down at about 8.30pm, by the time I have travelled and\neaten. I would get the chance to\nmeet some new friends on the tube\nas I stare at their armpits.\nIs there a silent (or not so silent)\nmajority at IC that wants a longer\nworking day, or is this an attempt\nby College to do what they want to,\nirrespective of what its members\nwish?\nYours,\nPaul Davison, Physics 2.\n'How's the Psalms' title page\ncoming along?'\nDear Adam,\nSince I haven't heard from the\nChristian Union about the farce we\ncall the C of E,I will leave this\nsubject, if only to resurrect it again\nat a later date. (Pun deliberately\nintended).\nSince my last letter a more\npressing issue has come to light.\nThat of the meddling Eurocrats.\nThese unelected commissioners and\ntwo bit politicians love barking\nBritain at every opportunity. Yet\nwhen it comes to the French\nfarmers burning our sheep because\nthey can't stand a little competition,\nthey keep not surprisingly quiet.\nEvery day in every way our\ns over ie gn ty and nationhood are\nbeing slowly eroded. What's worse\nis we have a PM who, I am afraid,\nseems to be willing to let this\nhappen. I didn't agree with his\npredecessor on everything, but at\nleast she would never have let the\nsituation continue. Mr Major just\ndoesn't have the backbone to stand\nup to the Federalists (not that\nKinnock would be any different).\nMr Major must realise the British\npeople do not wish to be ruled from\nBrussels or Strasbourg (even Jaques\nDelors can't decide on the HQ). Even our adverts are under\nDear Editor,\nHaving completed our degrees at\nImperial College in June, we were\nall looking forward to October 24th, more for the Commemoration Ball\nthan the graduation ceremony itself.\nFor many of us this was a last\nchance to see old friends, so we all\nagreed to try to get tickets for this\nspecial event.\nThe first half of the evening the\nNatural History Museum lived up\nto expectations, as both setting and\natmosphere suited the occasion. We then, however, transferred to the\nUnion Building, (not Sherfield, as\nadvertised), where the majority of\nus met with hostility from those\nstaff manning the door. They\nseemed more interested in taking \u00a32\nfrom students who appeared to be\narriving purely for the bar extension\nthan in allowing those of us who\nhad paid \u00a385 inside the building.\nBall tickets were demanded, but\nwould you go to the trouble of\nthreat, Hamlet ads are gone and\nsoon, we hear, we will see the\ndemise of the Gold Blend couple\nflirting with each other (unless they\ncan prove it really has a 'richer\nsmoother flavour'). I'm not\nkidding! Even Carlsberg and\nHeineken ads face the chop on\nhealth grounds; and after thirty\nyears the children's favourite\n' Milky Bar Kid' could also be\nbanned if it continues to say it\nmakes him 'strong and tough'.\n(This poor little guy has been under\nfire a lot lately. During the Summer\nit was said he was racist because a black child could not play his part.\nBut, imagine the outrage the\nCommission for Racial Equality\nwould express if they used a black\nchild and advertised him as the\n'Chocolate Coloured Kid'.) That aside, John Major should go\nto the Maastricht Conference\nprepared to say no to monetary\nunion, no to a federal state and no\nto a common foreign policy. You only have to look at the pathetic and\nlilly-live red response to the Gulf War to show how much a farce that\nwould be.\nIt is about time the EC Commissioners treated Britain with\nthe same respect as they treat at\nwearing a ball gown/ DJ to avoid\npaying \u00a32 for a disco?\nThe excitement then really began\nwhen trying to fight one's way\nthrough to the bar, only to be met\nby a five-deep wall of people\nwaiting to be served. The inevitable\ncrush meant many people in formal\ndress decided that the need for a drink (quite considerable by this\ntime!) was not worth the risk to\nexpensive clothing from spilt drinks\nand cigarettes. On eventually\nmeeting up with our group of\nfriends in the crush, it was to find\nthat many had already left or were\non the point of doing so.\nThe sense of occasion was finally\ndestroyed on finding the Ents disco,\nwhich was at least the same as it had\nbeen for the last three\nyears \u2014 CRAP! It also occurred to many of us\nwho have been working in the\nlicensing trade that a bar extension\nfor the Commemoration Ball should\nleast the French who are the poodle\nof the dominant Germans.\nUnfortunately, I fear, the PM and\nDouglas Hurd will not argue our\ncase and will lead us on the road to\neconomic and monetary union.\nYours always,\nAlan Bailey.\nPS. After last week's articles from\nthe Third World First and Amnesty,\nmay I suggest the new name for\nFelix as 'The Guardian' or even\n' Marxism Today'? I am not sure that the\nreadership really want to know\nyour opinions on matters which\nare so obviously above your\nintellectual capability. I get the\nimpression that you are trying to\ncause debate, of which I wholeheartedly approve, but it is\ndone in such a ridiculously OTT manner and displays such\nstunning ignorance of any issues\ninvolved that nobody would even\ntry to respond. This is a misuse\nof free speech - please try to do\nit better; it is merely a tedious\nrant at the moment.\n-Adam.\nonly have been used by those\nattending the ball, and not to any IC\nstudent willing to pay \u00a32. Instead\nit would have been more appropriate if the disco invitation\nhad been extended to those\nparticipating in the graduation\nceremony, who were unable to\nobtain, or could not afford tickets\nfor the earlier part of the evening.\nIt would have been nice, if somewhat surprising, of the Union Executive to remember that the\nCommemoration Ball is a special\nnight, being the culmination of3/4 years hard work. This was certainly\nreflected in the \u00a385 ticket price.\nUltimately, the ball was 'a night to\nremember', as promised, but\nunfortunately not for the right\nreasons.\nYours disappointed ly,C Poole, C Masters, N Male,\nJ Phillips, G Andrade,\nK Crawley.\nCommemoration Balls-Up\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

Her evil schemes\nare meticulously recorded in the following tale.\nThe Great British Pub Run 1991.\nI really don't know where to start,\nmainly because I can't remember\nhalf the places we visited. Portsmouth was the first of many\nstops on our Tour de Brit. Well, what can I say; the place was full\nof men - gir lies get your skates on\nand get down there. Most of them\nwere quite sexy and all of them\nbetter than what's on offer here.\nOther than that I don't think there\nis much to comment on - sleazy bar,\nusual prices, boring beer. Then on\nto Southampton. I'm not really sure\nwhat the students do down there,\nbut they haven't really made an\nimpression on the town - nobody\nknows where the university is. By the time we did find it, the bar had\nshut but the c hippie hadn't and, if you should ever what to be insulted\nby a fat Iranian, this is me place to\nbe. I must give many thanks to\nJackie, a good friend of mine who\nput us up for the night or rather put\nup with us for the night without\nmuch choice.\nsays it all:\n'We hate Bristol,\nand we hate Bristol.\nWe hate Bristol\nand we hate Bristol.\nWe hate Bristol\nand we hate Bristol.\nWe are the Bristol haters.'\nSunday - around Bristol and\naround Bristol and around Bristol\nand around Bristol...yes you've\nguessed it they have a marvellous\none way system...and around\nBristol and around Bristol until\neventually we reached escape\nvelocity and ended up at the Clifton\nSuspension Bridge. A lovely view\n- very quaint. So off the intrepid\ntravellers went in search of the\nGreat Free Way to Warwick, a town which has spewed out the\nmost ' American esque' campus\npossibly imaginable. Trees, fields\nand so much open space that I'm sure all the students were lost\nbe cuse none of them were in the\nbar. We were given a warm\nwelcome anyway, and some very\nOn Saturday morning we headed\nback in an attempt to educate the\nrather foolish young American who\ncame with us, Jenn. She was the\none who recently put her hand in the\nFelix collating machine because she\nwas 'intrigued' by it. Charles\nDickens birth place is apparently in\nPortsmouth, she thought. We blew\nout, fixed it and blew off again\ntowards Salisbury for an even more\neducational afternoon. As none of the pubs in Salisbury town centre\nwere showing the Rugby WorldCup, we went to see the Cathedral\ninstead, though after sampling the\nlocal brews of course. Absolutely\nunbelievably gorgeous. If you were\nto consume some rather noxious\nsubstances I'm sure you would not\nbe able to leave the town because\nof the intriguing masonry and\nornamental crystals. Then on to\nBristol. And now for the song that\nsound advice - ' Go to Coventry\nPoly. - it's generally busier.' Thus,\noff we went and got pissed again\nwith some of the most pleasant\npeople we met on the trip. A warm\nwelcome (warmer for one, that\nbeing Jenn), loads of good cheap\nbeer and a few interesting drinking\ngames. Yes you can guess, a drunken debauch ero us evening was\nhad by all and a number of good\nfriendships started.\nMonday, hung over but fed and\nwatered, we set off for Manchester.\nThis was that point in the week\nwhen the 400 Purity test emerged\nand some interesting revelations\noozed their way to the surface. Ask Toby how he managed that with the\nshower hose - everyone I 've spoken\nto says it's impossible.\nManchester has three completely\nlefty universities - they banned us\nfrom selling the ICU Rag Mag because it was sexist, racist,\nhomophobic, anti white heterosexual-males and funny.\nHowever, the Union President of Salford did hold on to a copy\n'purely for reference and to show\neveryone how disgusting Imperial\nCollege was.' The bar was called\nthe Mandela Bar, so we decided not\nto stay too long. If the FoppeSoc,\na.k.a. Right Wing Carnivorous\nHeterosexual Minority Society,\nwould like to pay them a visit one\nday, I'm sure they would be made\nvery welcome. The pilgrims then\nheaded West following the signs for\nLiverpoopole. We arrived at the\nAlbert Docks all keen and ready to\nsee the sights and promptly fell\nasleep. Three hours later we awoke\nand got out of the car just in time\nto see the Beatles Museum and the\nAnimation Centre close for the\nnight. Liverpool University was\nvery refined and quiet - another\nanti-everything college. However,\nthey did have pixies outside begging\nfor money to see the band that were\nplaying in the Main Bar. Sadly, due\nto lack of finances, we had to settle\nfor the Liver bar - not as in Liver and Bacon, but as in the Birds, that\ncrappy 70'sTV program. Jenn\nwasn't really expected to know that,\nHE\nbut at least she was of some use here\n- she knew someone just outside of\nLiverpool who fed us a slap-up\nmeal inclusive of Black Pudding.\nThe poor lass was almost sick when\nwe told her what was in it. We were \u2022\ntempted to stay but we had to get\nto Glasgow and the Land of Fog, Fog and more Fog. When we say\nFog we mean Fog. 20 foot visibility\nat most on the Borders. It started\njust after we passed the River\nRibble - try saying that when you've\nhad a few. Arrival time 3.30am we weren't sticking to the speed\nlimit; the car drove far too fast far\ntoo easily. Many thanks to Beccy\nfor getting up and letting us in at\nsuch an unearthly hour of the\nmorning, and thanks to John the\nsecurity guard who thought that it\nwould be fun to see the reaction at\nher best friend travelling all the way\nfrom London just to see her. Well it was really because the beer is\ncheaper up there but don't tell her.\nTuesday provided the first chance\nto have a decent wash and so, as\nrepayment, we let Beccy take us out\non the Beer or ' Heavy' as they call\nit up there in the wilds.
