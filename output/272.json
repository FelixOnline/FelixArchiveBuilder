Rugby Club was\nfounded between the wars,\ndrawing on the talents of\nthe Constituent College\nteams, which themselves had\nbeen among the best in the\ncountry. At one time, a Mines 1st XV had no less\nthan 6 senior county players.\nProfessor Sparkes, President of the RFC for many\nyears, was himself a first\nclass player as full-back for\nWasps 1st XV.\nSince the war the club\nhas been very successful and\nbefore 1962 won the U.L. Gutteridge Cup seven years\nin succession.\nStars\nMany I.C. players have\ngone on to play for the big\nclubs, the three most recent\nbeing Pete Ray (RAF and\nHeadingley), Clive Swinnerton (Rosslyn Park) and\nJohn Kelly (Ebbw Vale and\nCross Keys).\nI think it is time to say\nthat the Club's standard is\nIf the occupants of the\nSports Centre have seen six\nrepresentatives of the law\nprowling around it was not\nto investigate the loss of\ndrain pressure but to battle\nagainst the I.C. Shooting\nteam. This match is always\nlooked forward to by the\nclub and this year's competition was not lacking in\nhospitality from I.C. nor\nmatch winning ability from\nthe Metropolitan Police.\nThe usual Chiswick full\nbore match gave many sur-p rises, not the least being\nthat the I.C. team narrowly\nlost to a much more experienced team, so all looks\nbright for our future full\nbore commitments.\nSide by Side\nThese highlights are\nbacked by 6 regular weekly\nGeorge Burton, a member of IC Gliding Club, has\nbeen awarded the Frank\nFoster Trophy for completing the fastest 100 Km triangle in Great Britain in\n1968. On 12th April he flew\nfrom Lasham to Fullerton\nJunction to Hungerford and\nback to Lasham at an average speed of 85 k.p.h. in his\nSHK.\nnot as high as it was in the\n'50s, but most College and\nUniversity sides find this\ntoo. Undoubtedly the abolishment of National Service\nhas had a lot to do with this\n(the players taken are much\nyounger).\nFixtures\nNevertheless, the 1st XV has a very strong fixture\nlist, playing (and often beat-ing) such teams as Richmond Vikings, Wasps Vandals, Bedford Wanderers\netc.\u2014 the 2nd XVs of the\nlarge clubs. During the week\nthe 1st XV plays other London Colleges and other\nUniversities, usually with\nrare distinction.\nOur excellent fixture lists\nare due mainly to Gus Turner a now retired Miner of\nmany years standing, who\nsweated blood at many\narduous fixture meetings. In\nhis footsteps Dr. Mike Carabine of Chem. Eng. \u2014 the\nonly permanent member of\ncompetitions ranging from\npostal prone matches to side\nby side encounters with\nLondon colleges as well as\nstanding and kneeling shooting leagues. But this time of\nyear sees a particular frenzy\nas the constituent collegiate\ncompetition, the Courtmann\nshield, is shot for, and in the\nnext few weeks the three\nselected teams of eight will\nfight it out.\nMeanwhile all members\nwill (whether highly skilled\nor not) be involved in the\ninternal competitions run\nby the club which involve\nnearly everything that can\nbe legally done with a gun\nand a bullet, with fantastic\ncash prizes and/or medals\nand cups for the surviving\nwinners.\nP.A. Clarkson.\nLast summer, Mr. Burton\nrepresented Britain in the\nWorld Championships which\nwere held at Leszno in\nPoland. He competed in the\nOpen class, again flying his\nSHK and came seventh, the\nhighest placed British pilot\nin either of the two classes.\nMr. Burton joined the Club\nin 1952, while he was at I.C.D. B. Walker.\nthe RFC \u2014 also works very\nhard at the job, especially\nat strengthening the lists for\nthe lower teams.\nAmong these lower teams\nwe have Ffagin's, who take\nthe A2 fixtures. They were\nformed in the early '60's by\na disenchanted breakaway\ngroup and have their own\ntie. At times their strength\nhas rivalled the 1st XV, as\nmany ex-I.C. players continue to play for them.\nB2's, B3's or\nBl's We also have the B2s\nwho were the B3s and play\nthe Bl's fixtures. They are\na side of tremendous spirit,\nvery clique y, and were led\nby John Smithies of Chemistry 3 until he was spotted\nby a talent scout and\nwhisked away to the 1st XV.\nHe is one of the old men\nof the club, having been\nhere 5 years (on and off).\nAnother of the old men is\nTony Duke, Civil Eng. PG,\nwho has played for the 1st XV and has been awarded\nfull colours for seven consecutive years.\nPresent Captain is John\nBallard, ex-RCS, now of\nMines, who has been here\n4 years. He was a1 st XV regular last year until he\nhad to have a shoulder operation which, however, did\nnot prevent him playing on\ntour!\nOur record in the Gutteridge Cup has not been too\ngood recently, although we\nmade the Final in 65-66 and\n66-67, and the semi-final\nlast year. However, we did\nmanage to win the UL' Sevens' competition last\nyear.\nBlood-bath\nTowards the end of the\nseason we have an annual\nblood-bath \u2014 the Sparkes\nCup, when Guilds (hold-ers), Mines and RCS fight it\nout. The Cup is usually presented by the Prof, himself\nat the Annual Dinner which\nalways boasts many other\nillustrious guests such as\nBrian Stoneman, Bob Taylor, John Young & Co.\nDublin Again\nAfter the Dinner all that\nis left is the Tour. All? In\nprevious years Dublin, Southern France and Brussels have been blessed with\nour presence and it is Dublin's turn again this year.\nThe Tour team will be\ndetermined to retain its\nrecent unbeaten tour record.\nSports\ncomment\nThe I. C.W. A. Hockey team\ndid well on Saturday to come\nback after being 1-0 down to\nwin their U.L. Cup match\nagainst Q.M. C.32. \u2014 Our\ncongratulations and best\nwishes for the next round.\nThe College has been very\nlucky in getting \u00a3600 or so\nfrom the reserve funds to\nequip the new weight training\nroom and effect other alterations in the Sports Centre.\nThe weight training room\nshould be ready by the end\nof term.\nIt is sad to record that the\n1st XV went down fighting in\ntheir cup game against Wye\nCollege, 12-8. An interesting\npoint is that Wye scored no\ntries but kicked four penalty\ngoals, most of them for minor\ninfringements. There must be\na case for reducing the\npenalty goal to 2 pts. especially when one considers the\neffect of a Camberabero on\nan International match. The\nclassic case is of a British\nLions game against the All Blacks. The All Blacks won\n18-17, Don Clarke kicking 6\npenalty goals.\nThis term sees the beginning of a build up of train-ing, both on land and on\nwater, which culminates\nthis term with the head of\nthe river races. These are\nprofessional races rowed\nover three to four miles\nagainst the clock and successful results demand a high standard of fitness.\nDuring the early part of the\nterm the emphasis is on\ndistance rowing but there\nLast Wednesday at their\nhome course in Richmond\nPark the IC first team\nincreased their lead in the\nLondon Colleges Cross\nCountry League by just four\npoints in an exceedingly\nexciting race. The course\nwas very muddy after the\ntorrential rains and the huge\nfield of 170 started at a fast\npace. Immediately two IC\nrunners were up the front\u2014\nNick Barton and Norman\nMorrison\u2014while the rest of\nthe IC team packed in the\nthirties. At this stage, Borough Road P.E. College,\nwho are second in the lea-gue, had their runners\npacked well up. At the finish 5\u00a3 miles later Nick Barton finished in second place\nand Norman Morrison third.\nThere was quite a gap until\nthe next IC runners came in\n\u2014 Barry Dobrowski 26th, Ashley Deans 31st and Dave\nPinkard 32nd completed the\nIC scoring.\nThe second team packed in\nwell and were all in by ninetieth position, thus keeping\nup their good sixth position.\nThe third and fourth teams\nare one or two ' sprint'\nraces over a mile. One of\nthese is the Southern Universities' championship regatta held at Reading on\nFebruary 15th where we\nshall be defending our position as champions and holders of the trophy\u2014a very\nelegant shield.\nThe standards of the five\nregular crews cover the complete range of A.R.A. status,\nalso maintained their places\nin League II.\nTrophy Win\nSo far this term IC have\nbeaten LSE and London\nHospitals and had one\nmatch cancelled. The first\nSaturday of term was the\nQMC 1\\ mile race. IC did\nextremely well here, finishing third overall to Cambridge and Leeds. They carried off the John Banks\nTrophy for the first London\nCollege home. However 1\\\nmiles will seem easy to some\nmembers of the team after\nthey have run in the\nNationals at Parliament Hill\non March 1st which is over\na course of 9 miles.\nRelay\nThe Hyde Park Relay is\ncoming up soon on February 15th and anybody willing to help in organisation\nfor the expected 110 teams\nwill be very welcome. We\nhave almost 700 athletes to\ncope with.\nand it is from those that the\ncrews for the summer regatta and for Henley will\nbe chosen.\nFor those interested, the\nboat club is open to members of the College on Boat\nRace day which is on 5th April this year. An excellent\nview of the crews near the\nstart at Putney can be\nobtained.\nG.W. Harrison.\nLC. versus Cops\nGliding champ Boat Club defend title\n\n"

U.650 students were present and\nthe meeting was also attended\nby several members of the\nnational press.\nThe meeting was decided\nupon at extremely short\nnotice on Thursday, when\nPhil Marshall decided to propose the motion. Despite the\nshort time, at 1.10 p.m. on\nFriday, when the meeting\nstarted, ME. 220 was packed\nwith normal everyday engineers. The opposition to the\nmotion was small and disorganised. The motion was read out\nby Dermott Corr, Guild's President and was as follows:\n1. We deplore and disassociate ourselves from any\ncall to use violent means in\nthe settlement of internal\nproblems.\n2. In particular we deplore the activities of certain\nstudents of the L.S.E. for\ntheir recent actions at U.L. U.3. We do not think the\nrights and wrongs of the internal situation at L.S.E. in\nany way affect our disapproval of the activities of a militant minority.\n4. Staff / Student relationships within this college are\nof a very high standard and\nwe wish to take no action\nwhich will prejudice any\nfuture internal discussions.\n5. We wish to be made\nknown to those people outside the College who may try\nto gain support for student\nviolence from the students of\nCity and Guilds College that\nthey have no general support.\n6. Further we can call\nupon I.C. Union to forbid the\nuse of Union property and\nfacilities to those who wish\nto cause trouble at this col-leg e. Paragraph 3 was slightly\ndifferent originally but was\namended to the above at the\nbeginning of the meeting.\nMarshall, claiming to be an\n\" ordinary fed-up student \"\nproposed the motion to a, for\nonce, reasonably quiet attentive Guilds, in a speech lasting about five minutes. He\nsaid that he had been influenced to propose the motion\n[because a letter had been\nsent to the Rector by some\nstudents asking him, amongst\nother things, not to erect\n\"prison type gates\" at this\ncollege as at L.S.E. \"This\nmeeting,\" he said, \" is to\nshow that we in Guilds did\nnot send this letter.\" He\nasked Guilds to make it\nknown that I.C. is no hotbed\nof revolutionary fer v our and\nthat militant students will\nhave no support here. \"We\nmust make it crystal clear\nthat we are warning off Tariq\nAli and rent-a mob\" he said.\nMarshall received a rousing\napplause for his speech.\nAgainst the motion, Paul\nEkins of E.E. I., said that as\nMr. Marshall did not understand the situation at L.S.E. his comments were invalid.\nHe also wanted para. 6\ndeleted but this amendment\nwas defeated.\nAfter a few short speeches\nfor and against, the motion\nwas carried by 579 votes for,\n50 against, with 21 abs tensions. LETTER SENT TO PENNEY\nOn Thursday 30th, a meeting was held in the college to\ngain support for the march\nfrom UL U to LSE in protest\nagainst the closing of the\nschool. The most important\ndecision of the meeting was,\nhowever, to send an open\nletter to Lord Penney.\nThis letter calls upon Penney to give firm assurances\nthat no \"prison type gates\"\nwill be erected here, that\n\"police will never be invited\nonto the campus for political\npurposes\", that \"academic\nfreedom will not be infringed\nfor commercial or government interest\" and that political freedom here will be\nsafeguarded and no students\nvictimised for their political\nviews. It goes on to ask Penney to use \"every influence\"\nto demand that LSE is reopened for study and all\ncharges and legal actions\nagainst the students for their\npolitical views be dropped.\nIt also asks the Rector to\nexplain to the LSE administration that \"students are\nworthy of being treated as\nadults and consulted before\naction is taken\".\nIt was felt at the meeting\nthat the letter was necessary\nafter what happened at LSE\nand that if Penney rejected\nthe letter it would help\nstudents to become more\npolitically aware.\n\u2022 SI^^^^^ \u2022 Pip'<!' \u2014 : r* \u2022'\nMam\nlil ll ll lli TO SIT OR NOT TO SIT?\nTHE PRESIDENTS DECIDE\nFollowing the occupation\nof U.L. U., on Monday 27th January, by a group of\nstudents from L.S.E. together\nwith various sympathisers,\nU.L. U. Presidents council\nwere still discussing the situation at 7.30 on Tuesday.\nThey eventually informed the\noccupants of the terms\noffered by the U.L. U. Management Committee; that\nthey could use U.L. U. for\nmeetings so long as they\nobeyed the normal hours of\nopening.\nOPINIONS DIFFER\nThe debate that was going\non showed a marked division\nof opinion. There were those\n(mostly L.S.E. students)\nspecifically concerned with\nthe situation at the L.S.E., who felt that any further confrontation with the authorities\nwould hinder the chances of\na quick re-opening of the\nSchool. The other faction felt\nthat the situation was no\nlonger a specific L.S.E. struggle, but that U.L. U. should be used as a base for\nrevolution.\nCONFUSION\nAfter a bitter debate, Paul\nHoch called a vote at 9.10 on\nthe question of whether the\nsit-in should continue. The\nL.S.E. students alone decided\nto call it off, but the meeting\nas a whole felt that it should\ncontinue. The meeting then\nbroke up temporarily in con-fusion, with the defeated\nspokesmen trying to continue\nthe debate.\nMeanwhile, in the U.L. U. office, the Presidents were\ndiscussing three alternative\nplans: that the sit-in should\nbe allowed to continue, that\nthe police should be called in,\nor alternatively that the\nmedical students, who were\nreported to be assembling for\nsome direct action of their\nown, should be called in. It\nsoon became apparent that\nthere would be no alternative\nbut to accept the third plan,\nas the medical students had\nalready arrived, and had begun to clear the concert hall.\nThe Presidents thus decided\nto go to the concert hall to\ntry to ensure the evacuation\nwas as smooth as possible.\nThis they did by holding\" the\ndoors open to allow a free\nflow out of the hall. One\nmember of I.C. council was\nescorted out with the help of\nRex Lowin.\nLOOSE SCRUM\nThe only trouble occurred\nin the entrance, where a number of medics had to form an\nimpromptu loose scrum in\norder to remove a group of\ndissenting anarchists. Two\ngroups decided to continue\ntheir political discussion in\nMalet Street, to the accompaniment of strains of :\"Go\nhome, you bums\".\n\"WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED\nTO START THE REVOLUTION\nProtest last Tuesday week Jewish community held a the previous day. There were\ncentred on the Iraqi embassy s;ien t in Queens' Gate opposite the vigil in pro.es, agains, S \u201e g!T Physics building, when the the hanging of 9 Jews in Iraq crowd.\nAfter two contradictory\nvotes at successive LSE\nUnion meetings on the removal of the symbolic gates,\nthe militants won and the\ngates came down at 8.30 on\nFriday 24th January. The\npolice moved in and made\narrests on conspiracy charges\nafter some Professors had\npointed out known militants.\nOne of those arrested was\nGraham Thomson from I.C. LSE was then closed officially by the Director Dr.\nAdams.\nOCCUPY!\nOn Monday a meeting of\nLSE and other students was\nheld in ULU to discuss the\nuse of rooms there while LSE\nwas closed. As is understand-able, the Management Committee were not helpful and\nat about 9.00 p.m. the decision to occupy was taken.\nThe reasons given were \"to\nobtain a safe base for com-muni cations, publicity and\nmeeting purposes; and to do\nTravel\nAgency\nThe travel agency in the\nUnion is now in operation in\nCommittee room B( by the\nbar). Bookings can be made\ndirectly for journeys handled\nby German Student Travel\nService and Students Travel\nBureau (Italy). Information\nis also available on many\nother aspects of travel. The\nagency is open initially on\nMondays 1-2 p.m. and Thursdays 1-2.30 p.m. something which will hit the\nNational headlines and encourage sympathy action in\nother Universities\". About\nsix IC students were among\nthose who stayed the night\nin UL U where a peculiar\nmixture of anarchy and self-discipline reigned.\nEXODUS\nOn Tuesday a meeting of\nthe occupiers decided to leave\nthe building voluntarily in\nspite of some who said \"We\n55\nshould have stayed to start\nthe revolution\". The exodus\nbegan at 10.30 p.m. and the\nRugby players from the\nRVC, who turned up to\nthrow the occupiers out\nforcibly, only hindered by\nblocking the steps to those\nleaving. They did however\nremove a few Maoists who\nwanted to stay on.\nAfter these dramatic incidents last Thursday, LSE's National Day of Solidarity,\npassed off quietly.\nExtraordinary Meeting\nOn Thursday 13th February, at 1 p.m., there will be\nan extraordinary meeting of\nthe Imperial College Union.\nFor this meeting, in the Concert Hall, G.A.C. Assimakis\nhas proposed a motion that a referendum should be held to\nreflect on some vital points\nof the I.C.U. Constitution.\nIf the motion is passed\nonly two thousand votes on\nthe referendum will be final\nand could result in a complete change in the structure\nof I.C. The referendum\nquestions such things as the\nexistance of the constituent\ncolleges and I. C.W. A. along\nwith the possibility of I.C. joining the N.U.S. The\nmotion is relevant to the\nwork of the Constitutional\nReform Committee, which is\nat present looking for improvements in the I.C. Constitution.\nEngineers D&D and Glasgow, who was at\nthis college from 1948-51\nspoke at the dinner and\nentertainment afterwards\ncame from a discotheque,\nIrish folk singers and a group\nwho brought along their own\nlimbo dancers.

Parker in\nparticular, and it was pointed\nout that with a turnover of\nover a quarter of a million,\nthe refectories could well\nafford the relatively small\ncost of a part time cashier.\nMorade\nThe first motion was proposed by Vinod Garga, and\nwas carried over from the\nprevious meeting before the\nquorum was challenged, vis\nwhether or not to give \u00a325\nto MORADE, the movement\nto reorganise art education. A vote resulted in the motion's defeat by 119 to 79.\nPandemonium\nThe advertised main attraction, the motion to allow\nwomen into the at present all-male bar, was then proposed\nby Adolf Hashteroudian. His\narrival at the microphone\nwas welcomed by pandemonium, paper darts, cries of\n\"off\" and a proposal to move\nthe next business;\u2014defeated,\nThe flat belonging to Brian\nTaylor and John Butterworth\n(Butty \u2014 Chairman of RCS\nEnts.) in Earls Court was\nburgled in the early hours of\nMonday, 27th January.\nAt 2.45 a.m. Brian Taylor\nwoke to find a burglar searching the flat with a candle.\nWhen asked what he was\ndoing, the burglar dropped\nthe valuables and the pile of\nRCS Carnival tickets that he\nwas holding and fled.\nor so Chairman Rex Lowin\njudged. Les Ebdon complained about the row and\nthe din abated long enough\nto allow Adolf to make his\nspeech. The absence of women in the Union bar, he\nmaintained, was causing attendance there to fall, resulting in a loss of \u00a3500 compared with Southside bar's loss of only \u00a3200. Also, the\ncolour television in the Union\nwas falling into disuse as\nmore and more students went\nover to Southside for their\nevenings entertainments.\nThe motion lost a possible\nsecond er,P am Horrocks,\nwhen Adolf accepted an\namendment from Martin Bland that men should be\nallowed into the ICWA\nlounge, and she later made a speech for the abstentions,\naccepting that women be kept\nout of the Union Bar if the\nbehaviour in Southside im-proved. Opposition was provided by John Andrews, who\nsaid the activities in the\nUnion bar were not for women to see or hear, but Dave\nChristopher, taking over as\nthe proposal second er, asked\nthe men in the audience if\nthey never considered the\npossibility that women could\nhave minds as putrid as their\nown. After the opposition\nwas ably supported by Barry\nHood, who derided the\n\" orange squash drinkers\"\nproposing the motion and\nwarning all the ladies present\nof the strange characters to\nbe found in the all-male bar,\nthe motion was defeated\nwithout a count.\nFinally, a motion concerning the plight of soviet Jewry\nwas greeted by a mass exodus\nfrom the hall, and the calling\nof the quorum was left as a formality.\nFortunately the main entrance to the flat was locked\nand Brian was able to prevent the burglar from making\nhis escape while John\n\"Butty\" phoned the police.\nIn spite of the burglar's statement to the police that\nhe was just 'looking for\nfriends', he will appear before\nthe West London Magistrates\nCourt on a charge of breaking and entering.\nWith an agenda consisting\nmainly of Constitutional mat-ter s, the R. C.S.U. meeting on\nTuesday 28th drew a giant\ncrowd of 64(!) to Chem.\nlecture theatre A. The motion putting the\nAcademic Affiairs Officer on\nI.C. Council in place of the\nRCSU Rep was passed nem\ncon. Since, it was claimed,\nP.G.' s are at present left out,\napart from staff and students,\na proposal to give them a rep\non the general committee was\nalso approved.\nNext, a request for opinion\non the future of ICWA,\nwhich is alleged to use too\nmuch money for little pur-pose. Pam Horrocks pointed\nout the use of ICWA's social\nfunctions for girls straight\nfrom school \"who don't know\nwhat MEN are\". Those men\npresent voted ICWA o bse The swimming gala this\nyear was fortunately not\nruined by the permanganate-maniacs who have dominated previous non-events. It\nwas held this year in our\nown pool and despite some\ndoubt amongst the publicists\nas to the starting time it\nstarted at 7.15 p.m. Spectators were limited to\n150, each one being eligible\nfor a free pint in the Union\nLower Lounge afterwards.\nR.C.S. won the Gala by\nlet e, but actual Icwarians\nwere split 50/50.\nThere followed an equally\nvague discussion on I.C. Exec, which is alleged to\nabuse its intended powers to\nact in emergency only, and to\ntake some decisions against\ngeneral student opinion. No\nfirm decision was reached.\nCHALLENGE\nA challenge from ICWA to\nthe general committee for an\nobstacle race down the South\nKen. subway has been acc ep ted. Another challenge, from\nGuilds, to a tug-of-war across\nthe Round Pond was also\naccepted provided Dermott\nCorr acts as middle marker\non the rope. It was also suggested an unwanted and unloved Davy Lamp join him\nthere. Both these events will\nbe during Carnival week.\nwinning the mens' breast\nstroke, free style and back\nstroke races as well as all\nthe womens' races. Mines\ndominated the water polo,\nwinning both their matches.\nThe spectators were adequately entertained after the\nevent by such personalities\nas Sue Lowin, Martin Bland\nand Dave Wield, not to\nmention Mr. Spooner, taking to the water fully\nclothed \u2014 with a little per-sua sion, of course. Everyone\nthen made their way to the\nUnion Lower Lounge to sup\ntheir free liquor.\nMines\nLast week's meeting was\nattended by the same fifty\npeople who always turn up,\nhowever this time the Hon.\nSec, Mr. Barry Hood arrived\nearly.\nReports on the Mines Ball\nand Foreign Students Week\nwere made: a loss of only \u00a320\nwas made on the Mines' Ball\nand it is hoped to make up\nthis deficit by showing films.\nIn connection with Mines'\nForeign Students Week, some\nMines' students have been\ninvited abroad. The method\nof selection had been revised\nby the Council and was put\nbefore the Union for suggestion and approval.\nInevitably the situation at\nLSE was brought up and\ncaused some fairly heated\narguments. Several badly\nworded motions were put forward and after a muddled\ndebate\u2014a second motion was\nput forward before discussion\non the first was finished \u2014\nvoting on the motions was\nabandoned. A suggestion\nwas made that Mines should\nre-occupy UL U, but this\nfaded away as the meeting\nwas ended by half the people\nwalking out.\nFinals\nPhysics III received a stunning blow recently when it\nwas suddenly sprung on them\nthat the finals had been put\nforward two weeks and will\nnow begin on May 19th. Because of this the Summer\nTerm timetable is being compressed to give at least a few\ndays between the end of lectures and the beginning of\nexams.

The social\nsciences are making inroads.\nApplications still outnumber\nplaces by four to one, but the\ndegree of excellence in Alevel is not as high as it was.\n' Nationally things are\nmuch worse. Colleges of\nTechnology are having difficulty in filling their places\nand are filling them up from\noverseas. Government policy\nhas been to create more\nplaces for technology, but the\nfundamental cause is that\nengineers do not have the\nsame status appeal as doc-tors, scientists, sociologists.\n' Every year the caravan\nrolls into town and the engineering firms dangle very\ntempting offers in front of\nour students. We cannot keep\nmany for research and even\nnow we have unfilled places\nfor postgraduates. Elsewhere\nMSc courses are running\nwith three or four students\u2014\na tragic waste of resources.\n' American industry knows\nhow to use graduates so\nmuch better than British in-dust ry, it is almost enshrined\nin the American concept of\nwhat is right that education\nis good. You almost have to\nstudy to be a secretary.\n' Industry itself is not particularly convinced of the\nneed to take in advanced\ngraduates. We do need more\nscientists but firms don't always know it. They do not\nalways know how to use\nthem and there has been little\ndialogue between universities and industry.\n' We should, with our advanced techniques and our\nreal advantage of cheap lab-our, be more than a match\nfor America. But the fact that\nAmerica stays competitive\nwith its much higher costs\nshows how much more effectively they use their labour.\nThis is especially true of the\nway they use scientists.\n' To get industry moving,\none would need a revolutionary improvement in the relations between universities and\nindustry.

Yet together they are categorised |\ni under one catch-phrase\u2014Overseas Students, a phrase which glosses over, and causes 1\n= us to forget, the infinite social and political divisions of these students whose only =\n= common point is that they do not originate from these shores. \u00a7\n^^i is iii iri iv in iiii iii if iiii it ii j iiii iiii iii iii ii|]i In all, the Overseas Students at I.C. come from eighty-five\ndifferent countries. As might be imagined these cover a large\npart of the world including such diverse (both geographically\nand politically) places as Rumania, South Vietnam, Swaziland, Eire and Sierra Leone. There are also a number of\nCzechoslovak refugee students who were found places after\nfleeing from their country following the events of August\n1968.\nTogether the Overseas Students constitute slightly under\na quarter of the total student population of the I.C., with\nstudents from the Commonwealth forming the majority of\nthe group. The number of postgraduate students is in excess\nof the undergraduates by a ratio of almost four : one. Not\nsurprisingly students from the developed countries form the\nmajority of those doing postgraduate courses, since the\nundergraduate degree courses are that much more numerous\nin their own countries. Thus Australia and Canada are\ntogether represented by 79 students, all postgraduates,\nwhereas Malaysia has 14 postgraduates and 18 undergraduates, and Zambia provides only undergraduates.\nMost students have heard of the reputation of I.C. before\nthey have been confronted with the task of applying to a University, as an example, a Kenyan student first heard of\nI.C. whilst still at secondary school. The British Universities\nwhich have a good reputation abroad differ from country\nto country. Thus Newcastle is well known in Greece for its\nMarine engineering course, which would obviously be attractive to a student from ship-building Greece. There seems,\nhowever, to be a group of Oxford, Cambridge and I.C. all of\nwhich are re known ed throughout the world (L.S.E. might\nalso be included in this group); Oxbridge for its social life\nand I.C. because of its excellent academic standard, which\nis not, as at Newcastle, restricted to one particular discipline,\nand which thus appeals to many different countries.\nDespite differences in background, all overseas students\nare faced with one similar situation : they are all outsiders\nin English society. The way they view this obviously depends\nagain on their origin : a student from Canada or Australia,\nspeaking the same language and coming from a not dissimilar\nsociety, finds he is less of an outsider than one from say\nJapan. Because of this difference in outlook, most overseas\nstudents tend to be restrained from forming friendships with\nEnglish students, and not unnaturally restrict themselves to\nmixing with fellow country-men. This reticence is due not\nonly to the strangeness of the society, but is also effected by\nlanguage problems and a general feeling that we do not\ndo all we can to make them welcome.\nWhen discussing the problem of getting to know an English\nstudent all are agreed on one point; it is more difficult\nthan getting to know anyone else. Many students compare\nthis with the position of foreign students in their own\ncountries, where they are immediately accepted as fellow\nstudents rather than as foreigners. A Czech student, only\nrecently over here, was especially critical of our sociability\ncompared to that which he had expected, not only towards\noverseas students, but also towards other English students.\nHe felt, however, that on breaking the ice we tended to be\nmore genuine in our friendship than his own people.\nNarrow-minded, insular\nOne advantage of being outsiders in our society is that\nthey are able to level uninvolved criticism. English society\nis described variously as \" narrow-minded, irrational, socially stratified and insular \". Overseas students compare this\nwith the impression they had of this country when living in\ntheir own countries\u2014one of a well educated people willing\nto apply rational thought to all their problems. Our politicians are described in terms of being hypocritical and bigoted,\nalthough some overseas students reacted with : \" at least\npoliticians in England don't assume they have a right to\nrule as in Africa \".\nA great percentage of overseas students are faced with a problem over and above those of living in an alien society\nand speaking a different language, the problem being that\nof having a different coloured skin in a society that considers\nthis un forgive able. For many such students the first time they\nwere aware of their colour was when they first came to this\ncountry. An African student: \" To read in my first English\nnewspaper comments on racial is m gave me a real shock.\nI had never been conscious of being black before and never\nexpected to find that because of this I would be the object\nof racialist marches on the House of Commons. I completely\nlost a sense of belonging, and didn't know who would want\nto talk to me or who I should talk to.\" Some coloured\nstudents now feel that, with the obvious ill-feeling felt\ntowards immigrants, that Enoch Powell's solutions will have\nto be accepted if the position is not to emulate that in\nAmerica. These people feel that many of those who speak\nagainst Powellism do so merely to impress their friends.\nThis is particularly felt to be true of the public living in\nthe South Kensington area. A specific example was quoted\nby a coloured student, who, having dinner with a family\nliving near college was told in a forthright manner : \" Of\ncourse, you're just as white as the rest of us really \".\nFeeling of confidence .\nLiving in England does help them to gain a new perspective of their own society, and of their personal position as a member of that society as compared to the members of\nother countries that they meet. Many students who come\nfrom ex-colonial countries tend to feel inferior to Europeans,\nand a period of living in this country helps to remove this\nfeeling and replaces it with a feeling of confidence. While\nadopting those Western values which they find worthwhile,\nthey are also made aware of the value of their own society\nby comparing it, not only with our own, but also with the\nmany others represented by Overseas Students here. Students\nfrom certain countries are, however, restrained from taking\nan active part in politics whilst in this country. In the case of\na few societies, the Chairman and committee members even\nhave to be ratified by the appropriate Government. This\nposition is the case where the political situation back in the\nhome country is such that the Government does not have the\nconfidence to allow criticism of any kind, they thus feel\nit necessary to vet students in this way.\nWhat do students from Overseas do when they have completed their degree courses ? They almost invariably return\nhome, apart from those few who are refugees. For a student\nfrom a developed country, the fact that he has had an English\neducation has no particular relevance over and above the\nmarket value of his degree. For those from the developing\ncountries though, the fact that they have had a Western\neducation will mark them as being different from the people\nwho haven't: there will be a reaction of respect mingled\nwith a certain fear that living in western society has caused\nthem to reject the values of their own coutries. Their degree\nwill also not necessarily mean they will automatically get\nthe best jobs, although this depends largely on the country\nthey are returning to; there are still countries where tribes\nand race count for more than education.\nNone of those returning feel any particular need to mimic\nall they have found in our own culture, and this is surely\nwhat we would wish.\nWords: Malcolm Williamson\nI.C.

In Italian hell they lose\nthe nails, break the poker\nand usually can't get the fire\nstarted.\" To George Axelrod,\nwhose notable successes to\ndate include \" The Manchurian Candidate \" and \" Lord\nLove a Duck \", this humorous anecdote held the crux\nof the debate on the relative\nmerits and demerits of the\nHollywood and Italian film\nschools respectively. His new\nfilm \"The Secret Life of an\nAmerican Wife \" (Rialto X) is not only from Hollywood\nand about Hollywood but is\nalso a quite discernible antidote to the highly fashionable\nexpressionism and surrealism\nof the Italian trend. It nevertheless conveys a spirit of\nauthenticity linked with in-sight, to give a humane base\nto what is really a fairy tale.\n73 Sycophants\nThere can be no director,\nwith the possible exception\nof Billy Wilder, who is better\nequipped to portray the\npathetically humorous side\nof American culture than\nAxelrod\u2014and maintain throughout a seriousness\nevoked from he instant identification with the characters\nwith oneself. Wather Matthau, whose expressions do\nfor comedy what Paul Newman's do for brevity, plays\nan inscrutable, inflexible and\nincorrigible in-actor\u2014a film\nstar with 73 sycophants tending his wildest whim and\ntwice as many hangers on\nboring him to death. Anne\nJackson plays the wife of his\nP.R. man whose rise to success stems from a gourmet's palate and the ability to hold\nliquor. Their marriage is at\nthat boring stage where her\nconcern is her apparently\nwaning sex-appeal and his\nbiggest worry is being at the\nright place at the right time,\nthe common denominator being the aspiring neighbourhood where the women go\nabout in sneakers between\nP.T.A. meetings\u2014where they\ntalk about brats\u2014and super-sophisticated cocktail parties\nwhere they also talk about\nbrats !\nA desperate impulse takes\nthe wife on an errand as a call girl where she crosses\npaths with the actor. An un-typical combination of chicken soup and schoolgirl gossip\n(she once slept with her Professor of creative writing)\nwhich all good American\nhousewives should have had\n\u2014has him mystified for only\na while and thereafter the\ntwo complement each other\nin a revealing of \" the true\nme\". They achieve perfect\nharmony and part the respective owners of a rich\nexperience.\nLet there be no misunderstanding that this is a com-ed y. Axelrod wants you to\nlaugh as much as you can.\nNo high-fal ut in analysis of\nthe film is necessary\u2014it is\ndelightfully simple and leaves\nlittle to the imagination.\nThere is, however, the aforementioned strain of pathos\n\u2014not of the \"actor\" who\nultimately reveals that he is\nthe shrewdest man in the\nfilm\u2014but for the housewife\nwhose glorious high-school-and-college education counts\nfor nought when her values\nare construed as those which\nbest fit the sterility of the\nmaterialism in which she\nlives. The film starts with her\ngullible and impressionable\nand it ends with her the\nsame way. It has given us a good laugh and a lot of insight in between.\nConformity is what Lindsay Anderson's \"If . . . \"\n(Paramount X) is all about\n\u2014the worst kind of conforming that is since it is enforced.\nWhen you hear that this film\nexposes the Public School\nsystem you will not fly into\ntantrums of enthusiasm, for\nit's been done so many times\nbefore. Anderson has called\nthe film \" visionary\" and\ntherefore it would be expected to contain the usual\nbumbling house masters, matrons whose maternal instincts\nhave never been quite satis-fie d, headmasters who\nannounce that they PERSONALLY, will be taking\nthe seniors for \" Business\nManagement\" and victimised masters whose biggest\ntrials are the Juniors for\n\" Rugger \" and the chapel for\nboredom. It does contain all\nthese prerequisites but the\nbrutality of the hier arch i al system, the bullying, the\nwarped values and the completely intractable repression\nof the human soul are really\nthe background to a deeper\nstory.\nAggressive drop\nout\nAmongst the initial parody\nof the Public School which\nforms the first part of the\nfilm, there emerges the character of Mick\u2014from his first\nappearance a drop-out whose\naggressive and animal is tic traits are due to a disposition\nmore sinister than immature.\nHis person a it y is one of feral\norigin and we soon see that\nit is the most uncouth and\nviolent aspects which the\noppressive ness of his life\nbrings out. Such a person in\nsuch a place is inevitably persecuted and in \" If . . . \" this\nis relentless and horribly\ncruel . . . at this point the\naction is interspersed with\nfantasy but there is a lingering reluctance to console oneself with the facile and typically British \" it couldn't happen here \" attitude. Now\nwe do not laugh; with the\nexception of the hero and\nfellow conspirators the characters become Dickensian in\ntheir respective barbarism\nand imbecility. The ominous\nconfinement of the \" revolutionary fire\" can only now\nbe released by a cataclysmic\nexplosion\u2014a nightmare of\nshattered ribs, bullet-ridden\nbodies and screaming women\n\u2014a gruesome ending to a film about Public Schools !\nBut is it about public\nschools ? All the current re-views, which are plentiful,\ncriticise the film for not giving enough indications of\nwho are the partisans of such\na revolt which they consider\nis simply a miniature of the\n\" Impending \" deluge which\nwe are to experience in Britain. Thus the Public School\nin \" If . . .\" is relegated to\nthe status of a microcosm of\nSociety\u2014the fate of the two\nbeing in similar proportion.\nTo me, this analogy is not\nentirely valid. The most\nmeaningful scene is the final\none where Mick's machine\ngun\u2014turned on us, the audience\u2014spits a holocaust-sound\neffects par excellence. His\nfacial expression is one of\ntragic heroism\u2014tragic because he too is under a hail\nof fire from his oppressors\nand heroic because his is a just cause. Anderson himself\nlived in India at a time when\nthe Iron Fist of Her Majesty's Government met violence\nwith violence in sufficient\nproportion to obliterate most\nof the Hindu insurgents. I therefore conclude that the\nmessage of \" If . . .\" is this.\nThere is a futility in violent\ninsurrection because the entity\u2014be it hierarchy or\nstatus-quo which you seek to\nobliterate\u2014has the resources\nthe strength and the determination to survive when\nyour own very last drop of\nblood has dried on the pavement\u2014go and see \"If . . .\"\nJOHN SPENCE\nRECORD REVIEWS\nby Phemius\nA Door and a half\nAt the time of writing, the\nDoors are high in the U.S. charts with ' Touch Me'( Elektra EKSN 45050).

Water drips down the wall and collects on\nthe floor.\nEverybody knows.\nFew people care.\nEven fewer help.\nmum Li':-:. ;\ni A common sight in the slums of North Kensington and Notting Hill.\nIn an area of half a square mile in Notting Hill, one child\nis injured on the roads every five days because there is\nnowhere to play, while the local council has firmly made up\nits mind to spend million pounds on a new town hall.\nThis in itself seems exorbitant.\nThe only factor which seems to justify this extravagance\nis that the council also serves Chelsea which can surely\nafford the construction of a luxurious town hall. A few bob\non the rates wouldn't even be noticed.\nOnly a couple of miles away, people are living in slums\nin Notting Hill and North Kensington. I must confess I didn't realise quite how atrocious the conditions are until I went\nup there to see for myself.\nI was appalled to see the squalor of their existence.\nFamilies of six people are living in one room, sharing a kitchen with two other families with a similar arrangement\nfor the loo in the back yard. Bathrooms simply don't exist.\nYou think you are badly off with a few damp patches on the\nwalls; they have wet walls. In the particular room which I saw, the ceiling was literally falling down about their ears\nand the electric lighting was distinctly unsafe. These people\nmove around from room to room trying to find a slightly\nless dilapidated place than the previous one and the poor\nkids are shipped about from one school to the next. It is\nnot really surprising that one generation follows after\nanother without improvement of circumstances.\nThe council seems to be doing precious little about this\nat present. They will agree to a play area if pressed hard\nenough and fork out grants for property improvement.\nImprove a room for six people as much as you like, it's still\nhousing six people !\nReasonable rents\nThe task of rehabilitation in the area has been, to a certain\nextent, undertaken by the Notting Hill Housing Trust, formed\nin 1964, an entirely independent organisation financed by\nprivate donations and Shelter. It was the I.C. Carnival\nCharity for two years. Property is purchased (with money\nborrowed from the council) and converted into flats and\nbed sitting rooms, which provide people with dry, sanitary,\nadequate self-contained accommodation at reasonable rents.\nAccording to the Housing Manager of N.H. H.T., the people\nrehoused in this way lead a much more stable life. Previously\nthe parents \" could not even have a good row in peace \".\nI was shown some of the houses in the process of conversion into flats. The alteration inside and out is remarkable :\na bathroom and kitchen or kitchenette in each flat and no\nlonger any signs of damp. They are now in the process of\nerecting a new building containing similar flats and administrative offices for the N.H. H.T. The majority of the decorating is carried out by voluntary assistance such as students\nfrom the I. C.O.S.S. The trust even has a rent rebate scheme\nfor families in dire hardship.\nNot 'one of them'\nOne of the initial problems of the N.H. H.T. was in communication with the inhabitants of these squalid little rooms.\nAs I walked along the streets I sensed this feeling of\nhostility in the people around me. They knew I was not\n' one of them', which is something I have never experienced\npreviously in London. It would have been virtually impossible for me to communicate with the majority of the res i dents.\nThis is probably the root of the problems in negotiations\nbetween the council and the people. To give the council its\ndue : there is a plan afoot to spend 15 million pounds on a council re housing plan in Notting Hill. In connection with\nthis plan, there was a public meeting the other day which\nended in uproar because the people concerned think \" their\nfuture is being taken out of their hands \" according to the\nwelfare officer employed by the N.H. H.T. Then trouble arises\nbecause the council is discouraged, thinking its work is not\nappreciated and plans of this description are delayed.\nI noticed one block of council flats on my travels, the\nmost distinctive factor being that there was no provision\n'for children in the way of play space. In fact the only\nplace for a decent game of football in the area I visited\nseemed to be in the road. It strikes me that the 3\\ million\npounds for the town hall could be well spent on adventure\nplaygrounds and other recreation grounds.\nHilary Parkinson\n\n"

We should however\nbe concerned that the events at L. SE. will not be repeated at\nthis college. In this context the views expressed in the letter\nto the Rector (reported on page two) are correct in that they\nseek assurances that police will never be invited onto the\ncampus for political purposes, that no students will be victimised for their political views and that academic freedom will\nnot be infringed under any circumstance. What is disquieting\nis that the letter, especially the latter part asking him to\ninterfere with the L.S.E. situation, is putting Penney in a very\ntricky position. If Penney rejects the letter out of hand,\nstudent 'militants' can talk about possible future 'victim is ation'. If Penney accepts the letter and its contents, then his\naction will only precipitate further demands. Either way, the\npossibility of unrest at this college becomes more apparent.\nAnd this is wrong! Any action which introduces tension into\na situation where it does not already exist is unwise. Although\nthe ideals expressed in the letter are a commendable expression of an individual's rights, the sending of the letter is an\nirresponsible thing to have done.\nGUILDS MEETING You will by now have heard about the Guilds union\nmeeting last Friday. A lot of people wanted to express a feeling of dissatisfaction with the use of violence as a tool of\nstudent policy. I am broadly in agreement with this, and\nyet I didn't vote for the motion. My reasons are these: the\nmotion was pushed through the meeting far too fast\u2014\nopposing speakers were jeered and shouted down (read the\nnational papers if you don't believe this); and Phil Marshall's emotive speech was totally unworthy of a complex and\ndifficult motion of this type. As an exercise in reasoned\ndebate, the meeting was about as fruitful as the average\nGuilds union meeting. Not that I blame Marshall or Corr\nfor the way the meeting was run\u2014toss a reasoned argument\nat Guilds and they wouldn't know what to make of it. No\nthinking, rational individual could vote for a motion containing as many varied propositions as this without at least some\ndiscussion and clarification of the issues involved. Two out\nof the six clauses were 'discussed' for a total of time of about\nsix minutes. One is forced to conclude that the majority of\npeople at the meeting behaved in an irrational manner. After\nall, shouting people down is so much less effort than listening\nto what they have to say. Marshall may not like the stigma\nattached to being a student; I am ashamed to be a member\nof Guilds Union.\nAt Imperial College London SW7 (01-589 2963) will be found:\nEditor Paul Heath, Assistant Editor Mary Ford, News Chris Slee,\nFeatures Malcolm Williamson, Sports Bob Pine, Felicity John Probst,\nBusiness Tony Kirkham, Advertising Pete Chapman, Circulation\nDave Chant, Photographies John Rogers John Langley Robin\nGostick, Whats On Andrew Holman, Cover Pat Rotheram, Careers\nJohn Sommer Geoff Craig Ian Carr.

It is this\nwhole fad of separatism at\nthis College that puts the\nUnion in the lamentable state\nit is in at present; it permeates all the way through the\nCollege, making the Union\nbuilding\u2014which should be\nthe centre of College social\nlife\u2014the object of derision\nof students here and else-where, when the only sound\nissuing from it in the evening\nis loud, drunken singing.\nWhat also is the point of\nICWA (the ICWA lounge\ncould be put to far better use\nby some College organisation\nsuch as HENRY); this is just\nan extension of the Union\nBar rule. Surely we have\npassed the stage of regarding\nwomen as tender objects,\neasily offended but to be kept\non hand to show off to and to\nuse as copulating machines.\nAre we all such schizophrenics\nthat we must have such different types of behaviour in different places ? If this type\nof segregation continues further we will soon be having\n' No Coloureds' sign in the\nUnion but I hope people in\nthe Union will use rationality\nand even basic principles of\ndemocracy and not let ridiculous prejudices affect their\nreason.

Union\nmeeting of two weeks ago\nmust give added point to the\nconstitutional reform sub-committee's work, one feature\nof which is to come to a decision about the quorum\nnumber for a Union meeting.\nTroubled by in quo rate attendances at Union Meetings\n(the present quorum is 300\nand has rarely been reached\nin recent years), it seems\nsome members of I.C.U. Exec\ndecided a \"joke motion\"\nwould draw the missing\nmembers. Accordingly Pam\nHorrocks, this year's vibrant\nICWA President, was approached to move a motion\nto admit women to the Union\nbar. Unfortunately, Pam did\nnot feel adequate to the task,\nand she prevailed on Adolf\nHashteroudian, fiery Vice\nPresident of R.C.S. The plan misfired badly;\nthere were never 300 members present, and the first\nchallenge to the quorum was\nTHEY TELL ME successful. Right wingers delayed their challenge until\nafter the Union Bar motion\nhad been defeated. However\nthe real failure lay in the fact\nthat about 150 people had\nbeen attracted with no inter-est, a hard core of whom\nwere determined to reduce\nthe meeting to disorder. I always thought American comedy had the world's worst\nsense of humour in that they\nlaugh at the same joke every\nweek, nevertheless certain\nmembers of the I.C. Bar\ncrowd felt able to laugh at an\nobscene interpretation of a remark by Mr. Olley five\ntimes in as many minutes.\nPaper aeroplanes were\nthrown from the floor at the\nplatform, and by Barry Sullivan at the floor, the Mines\nPresident being fortified, with\nMiss Horrocks, by his usual\nprocession of pints from the\nBar.\nMr. Andrews and Mr.\nHood spoke against the\nmotion to the delight of their\nsupporters. Mr. Hood, who\nrecently threatened this columnist that if he ever misrepresented Council or\nJURGO he would \"person-ally beat your b head in\",\nwill not be surprised if Union\nSecretary Jane Pearson censors parts of his speech before\nshe minutes it.\nThere used to be a tradition that constituent college\nUnions dealt with the serious\nbusiness. It is unlikely this\nUnion meeting will have inspired 300 to come to the\nnext one. To do this one must\nmake Union members feel\nthey are participating in making the real decisions. This\nfeeling can only be built up\nby a series of successful, useful U.G. M.s. This is why the\nproposal before the constitutional reform sum-committee\nthat there be two Union\nBEER AT 2dA PINT\nThe manufacture of beer,\na fermented infusion of malted barley, is very ancient. In\nancient Egypt lightly baked\nbarley was soaked in water\nwith other additives, such as\ndates. After fermentation, the\nbeer was strained through a cloth into pots. We in this\ncountry drank cider and\nmead until the coming of the\nRomans. The Saxons then\nlearnt much about brewing\nfrom us. Hops were not introduced into this country until\nthe sixteenth century\u2014before\nthat the beer was rather sweet\n\u2014and an Act of Henry VIII\nforbade brewers to use hops\nin beer because it was considered a \"wicked weed that\nwould spoil the taste of the\ndrink and endanger the\npeople\". The poor climate of\nthis country has given beer\nlittle competition from wine\nand it has become the national drink. Indeed, before the\nintroduction of tea and coffee,\nbeer was the only beverage\ndrunk by the general public.\nFigures for London in 1836\nrelate that every man, woman\nand child annually consumed\n76 gallons of beer. People\nseemed to mistrust water and\nmuch preferred beer\u2014 \"kept\ndisease at bay\" they said.\nBefore the advent of commercial brewing it was usual\nfor each household to brew\nits own beer and since 1963\nit has been legal for you to\ndo just this. It costs only a few pennies a pint.\nYou will need one plastic\ndustbin with a capacity of\nover 5 gallons, a large saucepan or bucket, plastic tubing\nfor syphoning and some\nstrong screw-top bottles. All the equipment should be\nthoroughly clean and metal\nequipment should not be used\nafter the yeast has been\nadded.\nThe type of yeast you will\nuse depends upon the type of\nbeer you wish to make, e.g. a lager yeast for lager. Follow\nthe maker's instructions im-p licit ly. Light Ale\n3 oz. hops\nIf lb. brown malt\n\\\\ oz. crushed barley\nif lb. brown sugar\n5 gals, water\nStrong Ale\n3 oz. hops\n2 lb. brown malt\n2 oz. crushed barley\n4 lb. brown sugar\n5 galls water\nMix the hops, malt and\nbarley (reserving a handful\nof hops) with ten pints of\nwater. Bring slowly to the\nboil and then simmer gently\nfor 40 minutes. Add the rest\nof the hops and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Strain this\nonto the sugar in the bin and\nadd the rest of the water.\nWhen the temperature is 16\ndeg s.24 de gs.C add the yeast\n( carefully following the\nmaker's instructions). Cover\nwith the lid and leave in a warm place (an airing cupboard or kitchen is ad mir able). After 2 or 3 days fermentation will begin, giving a frothy head, and when all\nactivity ceases (6-9 days) it\nis time to bottle. Syphon the\nbrew into thoroughly clean\nbottles to within two inches\nof the top. Add \\ level teaspoon of sugar to each quart\nbottle. This will cause a slight\nsecondary fermentation to\nput a good head on your\nbeer. Screw down the bottles\nand keep in a warm place for\nthree days, then transfer to\na cool place (13 deg s.) to\nmature. It will be ready in\nten days, but even better if\nleft for 2 to 3 weeks.\nThe finished brew will be\nabout 5 % alcohol by volume.\nPub beer is about 3|%.\nEnough said!\nMORA GH MCGREGOR Small Ads.\nWest End Travel Agency requires students to work as\ntour leaders with American\ntours during Summer 1969.\nTours cover most of Europe.\nLanguage and travel experience essential.

Instead these dates will be published at the start of the year\nand the occasions, one in the\nautumn term and one in the\nspring term, would be free of\ngeneral studies and possibly\nfirst lecture in the afternoon.\nIn any case, strict rules about\nthe time to end die meeting\nand necessary pre-publicity\nshould ensure all the quorum\nrule is supposed to\u2014after all,\nnot turning up is a kind of\nvoting.\nDiscipline\nA recent discipline case at\nCouncil highlights the need\nfor looking again at our college disciplinary procedures.\nA Mr. Worthington was\nfound guilty of in discipline in\nI.C. Union. It was alleged he\npunched a hop doorman,\nsmashed glasses against a wall, and on another occasion\ninterfered with the cloakroom\nby Les Ebdon\nattendants and made himself\na nuisance at hops last term.\nFor the offences of which he\nwas found guilty he was sentenced by Council to be barred from Union facilities, except the refectories, for the\nrest of the term, and this will\nbe extended to the end of the\nsession if he breaks the ban.\nThe whole level of Council\npunishments is ridiculous, if\nwe are to maintain control\nover our Union the yobo s who jeered Council members\nafter this decision must act\nresponsibly. I.C.U. Council\nhas a duty to protect members it asks to do the thankless task of ticket sc rut in is ing and duty office ring. Nobody will give up an evening to do this unpopular task\nif he is not protected from\npersonal, physical violence.\nNor will we ever lower our\nlosses to vandalism in the\nbar unless we take a strong\nline there, too.\nWhat excuse can there be\nfor the minimum sentence for\nwanton destruction of Union\nproperty being less than banning from the union for less\nthan a year, and any pub\nwhich has a barman assaulted will never allow the hooligan back again? Nothing less\nthan a life ban is suitable if\nduty officers have been\nattacked.\nPerhaps Council's sentences would become more\nrealistic if trial procedures\nwere more formal. Council\nshould separate the inquisitorial process (the facts\nshould be ascertained from\nthe witnesses allowing full\npublicity and legal rights to\nthe accused), the judgement\n(this must be made in secret\nand be overwhelming) and the\nsentences (for which guidelines must be set). Or are\nCouncil too scared of the bar\nbullies to act?\nQ jumping\nPeople who rightfully complain at the irritating and\nanti-social rise in queue-jumping at Mooney Southside\nare probably wasting their\ntime, until the Southside Refectory Complaints Officer\nfirst rids himself of the deplorable habit.\nYou have enough\nto worry about. So we don't ask for bank charges.\nThe biggest cloud on the horizon\nfor a student (apart from\nexaminations) is money. A grant\nis difficult to live on.\nSo Lloyds Bank doesn't ask for\nbank charges on student\naccounts, provided\nthe account is\nalways in credit.\nWe can also give free advice\non how to manage your\nfinancial affairs.\nWhy not talk to the Manager\nof your nearest branch of\nLloyds Bank?

There was the lengthy list of firms in\none column and stars in other columns headed by\nthe degree subject. Each final year student got one\nof these lists and I faithfully went through it,\nunderlining all the firms interested in metallurgists.\nMy interest was in extraction metallurgy with a bent to going abroad, but I thought it would be a good idea to go to quite a few interviews for the\nexperience. Several interviews were over subscribed, but I went to about half-a dozen. Eventually three\nfirms offered me second interviews \u2014 I said 'no'\nto one and came to London to see the other two.\nAfter that I was offered a good job on a three year\ncontract in Africa.\nOn consideration, I decided I was not prepared\nto disappear into the blue for three years just then\nand so I thought I would investigate the possibilities of postgraduate courses. \"Royal School of\nMines\" came into my head. A good reputation,\nand I found a course which suited me very well so\nhere I am.\nthe Company's annual report\nand read the Chairman's statement; look at the overseas interest; form your own\nopinion of the growth prospects of the company's prod-uc ts; look at the stock market quotations, especially the\nP/E ratio in the Financial\nTimes.\"\nHe was concerned that\nour attitude to industry was\nright\u2014\" The profit motive is\nwholesome and stimulating\nand is in the national inter-est. New graduates should\nbe prepared to move about\na lot at first and if a company wants you to move, this\nshould be considered an encouraging signal\".\nA good degree in science\nor technology \" is a fine\nstart to a job in industry \",\nbut the qualities required for\nmany of the senior jobs are\n\" personality, clear thinking,\ncommon sense and the ability\nto plan and negotiate.\"\nOnce again it is career-choosing time. Many factors\ngo into the decision, I suppose the main ones are sal-ary, job satisfaction and future prospects not necessarily\nin that order. Unless you\nhave a distinct sense of vocation it's a difficult decision.\nI 've been looking through\nold careers supplements to\nsee what advice people have\ngiven in past years.\n\" What next ? \" wrote two\nstudents in 1965. \"The decision is probably the most\nimportant in life.\"\nThe next year Lord Jackson stressed that \" There is\na finality about the choice of\ncareer on graduation only for\nthe graduate who lacks the\nability to create op port uni ties, or at least to take advantage of the opportunities\nprovided for him by someone\nelse \". He felt that graduates\nshould have a period of\nbroad training in industry\nrather than go straight into\na precisely defined job.\nLook around\nLast year the Rector wrote\non \" Opportunities in Industry \". His first point was that\nprospective graduates should\nfind out about different firms.\n\" Ask your Professors; ask\nyour friends already in in-dust ry; ask for and look at\nLord Penney went on to\nreview the prospects of technologists aiming for the\nboard room. In the past\n\" technologists as a group\nhave been too narrow in\ntheir outlook\", but many\nlarge firms are \" desperately\nanxious to find and help the\nyoung technologist who\npromises to be good enough\nto win a place on their\nboard\". His parting advice\nwas : \" Now is the time to\nget in on the ground floor ! \"\nI have summarised these\narticles because it is worth\ngetting as many people's ideas as possible, and especially ideas from men who\nhave had technological training and experience.\nCareers\npublications\nThere are three Careers\npublications which appear to\nbe widely available through\nout the College. The largest is\nthe \" Cornmarket Directory\nof Opportunities for Graduates \" with a preface by Harold Wilson. This has long\ngeneral articles covering a great variety of careers and\ndegrees and comprehensive\nindexes of organisations seeking graduates. The second is\n\" Professional Careers for\ngraduate Scientists and Engineers \" which includes comments by Chairmen and/or\nManaging Directors of well-known companies on subjects\nrelevant to new graduates.\nAgain it has general articles\nand indexes, and also five\nshort case histories. \" Career\nChoice\". published by Pergamon-Careers, is the third\nbook, and this covers 100\nfirms. It is helpful to spend\ntime going through these\nbooks as there are many\nfirms listed which may suit\nyou better than the commonly known larger organisations. For postgraduate courses\nyou can consult the Cornmarket Directory for courses\nin Britain.*\nVoluntary\nservice\nI would like to end with\na word on voluntary service\nabroad.\nGraduates in any discipline are welcome and the\nperiod of service is usually\nfifteen months to two years.\nI spent a year in voluntary\nwork in East Africa and\nreally appreciated the time\nthere. It put Britain into\nperspective and also gave me\na greater sense of the tremendous needs of the world.\nMore information can be obtained from the British Volunteer Programme, 26 Bedford Square, London, W.C. I. Applications for service\nshould be in as early as possible and preferably not later\nthan March 1969 for this\nyear.\nYou will find some more\ninformation in this supple-ment, but it is no substitute\nfor making the most of the\nadvisory services and publications available in the College. Spending enough time\nnow considering all the possibilities will pay dividends\nlater.\n*In addition the Lyon\nPlayfair Library has a large selection of University\nCalendars and general reference books.\n1 The Advertisers 1\n| in this Careers |\n| Supplement |\n| are: |\n| C.E.
