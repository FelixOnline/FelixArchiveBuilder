    "content": "FELIX\n10\nFEATURE\nFeatures Editor: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 06 MAY 2011\nHow did the media contact you and\nwhat was the process?\nThrough the [Imperial college] press office if I remember rightly. Most of the\nTV stuff has been through the press office here at Imperial, who are very, very\ngood!\nIn the first few hours how hard was\nit to get information about what was\ngoing on?\nI was able to get information about what\nwas going on, so I had a fairly good\nidea. The biggest problem was that the\nevents were changing fairly rapidly and\nthe way that an incident like this occurs\nis there\u2019s such a rapid evolution of the\nengineering process.\nSo if you know what is likely to hap-pen, how do you go about trying to\nput across the risk?\nI think you just tell the truth. You can\u2019t\nsay \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 in a flappy kind of\n\u2018oh well\u2019 sort of way, you have to be\nable to give possibilities. But it\u2019s dif-ficult. Academics are at a tremendous\nadvantage. I don\u2019t receive any money\nfor these appearances at all, so I can just\ntell it like it is. I think that\u2019s what people\nneed to see; they need to see a calm, collected measured response.\nOne of the criticisms that\u2019s been levelled at the coverage is that, people\nwho are funded by nuclear companies have an interest in downplaying\nthe danger. Is that fair?\nI think it\u2019s inevitable. [But] there\u2019s all\nthe difference in the world, in my mind,\nbetween getting money that supports\nresearch, and getting money that goes\ninto your bank balance. I don\u2019t have to\ndo [research] on nuclear power specifi-cally. I take money from companies specifically to fund PhD students, but that\ndoesn\u2019t affect my career actually. And\nthat\u2019s a big difference from someone in\nthe industry who\u2019s paid a wage.\nDo you think any researchers were a\nlittle wary about talking to the me-dia?\nVery much. People are very wary. A researcher spends a long long time really\npolishing up a piece of work. It\u2019s a very\nmeasured, thorough approach. Talking\nto the media is not.\nProfessor Robin Grimes is the Director of the Imperial College Rolls\nRoyce University Technology Centre.\nHe was featured in TV and radio coverage of the disaster.\nHow did you get involved in talking to\nthe media, and what was the process?\n[My head of department] passed [the\nmedia] onto me because he knew that\nthis was my area. From then on, it just\nsnowballed; the phone did not stop ring-ing.\nWow. So you think that it\u2019s something\nthat is important then.\nI think it\u2019s important to get the right messages across. It\u2019s better now than when it\nstarted but [the media] was not getting\nthe right messages across at all, and it\u2019s\nactually misinforming the public.\nDo you think that scientific advice\nhas been handled well in this situa-tion?\nI think the scientific advice has been\nout there, the problem is the media\nreports in headlines, and its headlines\nare what the people remember, not\nwhat the scientists say. I had a lot of\nfeedback from people, expats living in\nJapan, who were watching the international media as well as listening to the\nJapanese media, and a lot of them said\nthank god someone is actually saying\nwhat it is instead of blowing it out of\nproportion.\nDo you think honesty is the best pol-icy?\nAbsolutely. But you need to put it over\nto people in a way [the public will] un-derstand.\nDo you think that researchers\nare reluctant to talk to the media\nfor fear of their remarks being\nmisinterpreted?\nOh yes, there will be a lot of people like\nthat. What you find is what gets report-ed, particularly in the foreign media,\nis the English without the qualifying\nwords that we use in English, so things\nlike \u2018it is highly unlikely that\u2019, will be\ntwisted.\nP r o f e s s o r\nGerry Thomas\nis chair in\nM o l e c u l a r\nPathology in\nthe Department\nof Surgery\nand Cancer at\nImperial College. Her research is on\nthe medical effects of the Chernobyl\ndisaster, and has appeared on\nradio and television broadcasts to\ntalk about the potential dangers of\nradiation.\nWhat does SAGE look like?\nWell first of all SAGE is going to have key government departments and agencies in it. But also I\nbelieve that it\u2019s important that SAGE has independent people from outside government who are able\nto provide some not quite peer review, and are an\nindependent voice beyond government. There\u2019s a\nvariety of networks and for a good approximation,\nfor most issues we have a bit of a yellow pages of\npeople who know about different issues. So in the\ncase of (this) SAGE, one of the key players within\ngovernment would be the Office for Nuclear Regulation nuclear inspectorate, the health and safety ex-ecutive, the health protection agency. But also because there are issues to do with actually predicting\nwhat\u2019s happening, you need the Met Office, because\nif you\u2019re having radioactive release, the weather\u2019s\nimportant.\nSo that was the government side. On the non-government side, we have a national nuclear laboratory which is arm\u2019s length from government. And\nalso I wanted some independent academics so there\nwere three we got for this particular job; one was\nfrom Imperial, Robin Grimes; one from Manchester, Richard Wakeford, who was an expert both in\nnuclear and in health issues; and the other was an\nindependent lady called Sue Ion. That\u2019s SAGE. The\nscene is set for SAGE. That\u2019s the background.\nAn issue that was raised about the advice that\nwas coming from scientists was about scientists\ngetting their funding from nuclear. Was that\nsomething that you had to take into account with\nregards to potential bias?\nWell I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a bias in that sense because you\u2019re actually doing calculations. If there\nwas anything wrong with the calculations then that\ncan be assessed. If we were talking about the wider\nissues of how one should develop a nuclear build\nwithin the UK, or how we should be operating at an\nInternational level in terms of nuclear safety, that\u2019s\na different matter. We were there to say, \u2018what is the\nworst case in terms of radioactive dosage that might\naccumulate in the population?\u2019 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s\nan issue there.\nSo going on to the media reporting of the crisis.\nCOMMUNIC\nAnna Perman and Lizzie Crouch speak to s\nof the disaster in Japan and the challenges the\nSir John Beddington is the Government Chief\nScientific Advisor. He was responsible for convening the \u2018Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u2019 (SAGE), which drew on expert knowledge to provide advice to UK citizens caught\nup in the crisis.\nThe Scientists\nLayton Thompson/Imperial College London\n\u201cMy job is\n[to be as\nfactual] as\nI can. If I\ndon\u2019t know,\nI say I don\u2019t\nknow\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 06 MAY 2011 11\nFEATURE\nDid you find the coverage measured or were\nthere any concerns there?\nI think that there was a mixed reaction. I think that\nsome of the reporting was absolutely factual and ap-propriate. I think that in the early stages there was\na lot of confusion and that there were mixed messages coming out in terms of different reactions to\nthe crisis.\nThe thing that I [did], and I\u2019ve never done this be-fore, was that I start[ed] having a series of telephone\nconversions with the embassy in Tokyo. First of all\nI would give a briefing and say \u201cthis is the analy-sis, this is what we are estimating for ourselves in\neven a series of worst case scenarios\u201d and basically\nwe gave that reassurance. What I then had as part\nof that process was a question and answer session\nfrom embassy staff, people from businesses, people\nfrom schools and from individual families phoning\nin and asking a whole series of questions. Then a\ntranscript of these conversations was put up on the\nembassy website. Remember the focus is on British\nnationals in Japan and having those conversations\nreally worked. So [for example] when the Japanese\ntested the water they found that there was some\ntrace of Iodine-131. I had a question, should I bathe\nmy baby in bottled water? And the answer is no. So\nyou can be reassuring. I think the important thing is\nbe completely open for a Q&A, and when we didn\u2019t\nknow, we said.\nThere is a sense that as a government body, once\nyou address people\u2019s fears, if you anticipate what\nthey might be afraid of, you could be seen to be\nendorsing that viewpoint. Is this a way of addressing that?\nWell I didn\u2019t think of it in that context. I think that\nmy job is to answer questions when they arise\nas factually as I can. And if I don\u2019t know, I say I\ndon\u2019t know. For example, in the early stages, one\nof the things we didn\u2019t have really good information on was on contamination of food, seafood in\nparticular. The sort of advice we were giving is that\nthe Japanese are monitoring it, their standards are\nrather more stringent than what we have in Europe\nand that certain things were at risk. And the sort of\nadvice we were giving was: \u2018if in doubt don\u2019t take\nvegetables from an area you don\u2019t know where it\nis\u2019. Certainly don\u2019t take seafood, in particular seaweed and shellfish, from these areas.\nI know you recently joined Twitter (@uk-sciencechief), and you\u2019ve used this website to\nhave a more personal interaction, is that something [social media/personal interaction] you\u2019re\ngoing to look to continue?\nI don\u2019t know really. This was a one-off in the\nsense that it really seemed sensible to talk to the\npeople in Tokyo. It\u2019s alright issuing some form\nof press release from here, but actually people in\nJapan mainly having access to Japanese media\nwhich, even if you speak Japanese, is.. well I don\u2019t\nknow what the Japanese for millisievert is and I\ndon\u2019t suppose many of the British population in\nJapan does. So I think that was a worthwhile thing\nto do.\nIn terms of how I deal with an emergency in the\nfuture I think I would probably say that I would always try to be outward looking.\nHow do you go\nabout obtaining\nscientific information for your ar-ticles? Can you give any examples of\nthis from Japan?\nThere was a number of sources of information coming out of Japan. For example the Japanese atomic industry forum\nwas regularly posting information.\nCompared with the volcanic ash \u2013 it\nwas easier to get information then as\norganisations were less secretive. However, in that instance, it was harder to\njudge what the risks were from the in-formation!\nBecause it was difficult to know what\nwas happening in Japan, what we could\ndo, and did do, from the information\navailable, was to get good nuclear experts etc to get give a range of possible\noutcomes and opinions. Then, tell the\nreaders the differences between the different possibilities and the likely outcomes based on what was known.\nHow easy is it to get an accurate story\nacross?\nEveryone is learning as they go along\nto a certain point. The responsible thing\nto do is reflect the range of outcomes in\nany case. You do have to take a degree\nof judgement on what expert opinion to\ntake to help this process.\nDo you think that any researchers\nwere reluctant to talk to the media for\nfear of their remarks being misinter-preted?\nIntheJapanstory,therewasnoreluctance;\nthey felt the need to get the information\nout into the public. [Scientists talking to\nthe media] has got much better and the\nScience Media Centre has helped also.\nIt used to be the case that scientists\njust ignored the media and wouldn\u2019t\ndignify them with a response. But realised that it wouldn\u2019t stop the media\nreporting the story, and that they were\nlosing their voice in the debate. So now\nthey are, more often than not, keen to\nspeak with the media.\nDo you think scientists are reluctant\nto talk to the media for fear of their\nremarks being misinterpreted or mis-used?\nScientists will always speak to the\nmedia. The American scientists will answer questions straight away, whereas\nthe UK researchers (in a terribly British\nway) will have a think and come back to\nyou in a few hours. I have been in this\nrole for 29 years and the situation has\nimproved.\nScientists now have to justify grants\netc in ways that never did before, so\nthey will speak to the press to raise their\nprofile.\nDo you think that scientist\u2019s quotes\nare always used in the right context in\nscience reporting?\nThey aren\u2019t always used in the right con-text, and it is very difficult to put them\nin the right context. You are condensing\ncomplex situation into about 800 words,\npeople forget how difficult that is.\nIt has been said that during the first\nfew hours that the details coming out\nof Japan were unclear \u2013 how difficult\nwas it to get information?\nIt was patchy. Sometimes you just have\nto put your hands up and say you don\u2019t\nknow. You have to be honest about what\nyou know. The broadsheets were good\nat this; for example, the Guardian and\nTimes were responsible in their reporting what was or wasn\u2019t known.\nHow important is the amount of scientific detail you include in a piece?\nIf you have more than three salient facts\nthen there is too much for the feature.\n[A science specialist reporter] is battling more than any other specialist with\nreader ignorance. There is a desire to\nknow about science but there is a fear of\nit being complicated.\nThe media has seemed to focus on the\nFukushima situation at the expense of\nthe earthquake damage and tsunami\nvictims; do you think this is fair?\nThe coverage of what was happening\nat Fukushima skewed the story away\nfrom what was an actual disaster. Initially it was made to look like nuclear\ndisaster was imminent when it wasn\u2019t.\nThere was too much emphasis on nuclear and not enough on what else was\nhappening.\nCATING RISK\nscientists and journalists about the reporting\ney face in communicating science and risk\nM ark\nHenderson is\nthe Science\nEditor for The\nTimes\nRobin McKie is the Science Editor\nfor The Observer\nThe Journalists\n\u201cThe responsible\nthing to do is reflect\nthe range of outcomes in any case\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 15\nTECHNOLOGY\nFriday 06 may 2011\nI\nn February, right after using my\nfirst generation iPad for about\nsix months, I knew Apple would\nsoon launch its successor so I\nsold it in order to buy the new\none whenever it came out. Not long\npassed before the end of term came, and\nI started queuing for the iPad 2 about 17\nhours before it was officially launched\nin the UK.\nThe second generation iPad packs\na 1GHz dual-core Apple A5 processor which is fronted fronted by a 9.7\u201d\nLED-backlit screen with a 1024 by 768\nresolution (same as first generation)\nprotected by what Apple claims is a fin-gerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.\nFor all your photographic and teleconferencing requirements, there\u2019s the front\nand rear-facing camera; both with video\nrecording (with the rear capable of 720p\nrecording).\nThis overview of the iPad will be split\ninto 4 sections \u2013 Speed, Screen, Cameras and Battery life.\nSpeed\nHaving a dual-core chip on the device certainly makes application start\na lot faster and work more smoothly.\nAmong the \u2018made-for\u2019 apps I tried were\nthe mother-Apple written iMovie and\nGarageband. Although I hadn\u2019t used\niMovie for iPhone before, I\u2019ve just done\na side-by-side speed comparison and I\ncan say it starts quite a bit more faster\non the iPad, and processes projects faster than on the iPhone 4 as well. Overall,\nthe new chip has improved the speed of\nthe device and I\u2019m looking forward to\ntrying more apps designed to take advantage of the A5.\nScreen\nWhen Steve Jobs presented the iPad on\nMarch 2nd, everyone was disappointed\nby the fact that it didn\u2019t feature a retina\ndisplay. I assume that happened for two\nreasons. One is the cost of such a screen.\nThe other is the fact that its implementation would bring another resolution\nto the crowd of iDevices, requiring all\napps to be modified to look pretty on the\nnew resolution.\nWhile there is no retina display and it\nis not as pretty as that of the iPhone 4,\nthe screen of the second generation tablet is so much better! The trick behind\nthis is the simple removal of the metal\nedges from the iPad 1, thus bringing the\nglass closer to the screen.\nAs for Apple\u2019s claims that it has a\nfingerprint-resistant screen: simply\nput, it does not. After hours of continuous usage (obviously not while eating),\nit certainly needs to be cleaned so as\nnot to look like you used it as a tray\nat McDonald\u2019s. Sure, they made the\nsmart-cover with the \u201cmicro-fibers\u201d\nthat wipe the screen when you open/\nclose the cover. While they do part of\nthe job by cleaning half the smudges\non the screen whenever you open/close\nit, not adding them on the entire cover\nwas a bit of a mistake on Apple\u2019s side,\nsince they tend to leave 3 lines of fingerprints behind.\nThe screen is certainly pretty, but as\nopposed to that of the iPhone 4, it sure\nneeds a lot of cleaning.\nCameras\nPeople nowadays seem to want cameras on everything. Before the iPad\n2 was announced, I had some doubts\nApple would add a rear-facing camera\nto the 10-inch device. But they did.\nUnfortunately.\nWhy am I disappointed? Let\u2019s put it\nthis way \u2013 you have a device (regard-less of its size) with a camera on it,\nright? So, even for the few times you\nwill actually use it as a camera (or does\nanyone actually use their tablet \u2013 not\nnecessarily an iPad \u2013 on a regular ba-sis?), you want it to take good-quality\npictures. Not DSLR-quality pictures,\nobviously, but not poorer than my first\n1.3MP digital camera 11 years ago. I\nwould\u2019ve liked Apple to put at least a,\nsay, 3MP camera on the tablet. Again,\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t use it as my main\ncamera, but it would\u2019ve been cool to\nhave it for those moments when you\u2019re\nusing the iPad, something comes up\n\u201cThey say it can film\n720p. If movies in\n720p looked like\nthat, I\u2019d cry\u201d\nMiles ahead and still racing\nSorin Cioban finds the iPad 2 delivers consistently\nand it would take too long to pull the\nsmartphone out to take a decent pic-ture. And they say it can film 720p. If\nmovies in 720p looked like that, I\u2019d\ncry.\nThe front-facing camera, on the\nother hand, is decent. It does its job\nof a video-call camera. I can\u2019t really\ncomplain about its quality. It\u2019s decent\nenough to allow the person I\u2019m doing a\nSkype/Facetime call with to see my face\nclearly.\nBattery life\nLike the battery of the first iPad, the battery in the iPad 2 allows for quite a lot\nof browsing/music/video/gaming. Simply put, I bought the iPad on the 25th\nof March, used it through the weekend,\ncharged it and went to Spain for 10 days.\nI did some revision (reading PDFs), listened to music on my flights and played\nsome games. I didn\u2019t browse because\nthe hotel didn\u2019t provide free WiFi so I\nbought a Vodafone USB dongle which\nI could only use with my Macbook Pro,\nhence no internet on the tablet. Thus, the\niPad 2\u2019s battery lasted until I came back\nto the UK. Then I charged it again and\nwent home for 2 weeks. This time, the\nbattery died around the 7-day mark because I\u2019d also used it on the internet. So,\noverall, I\u2019d say it lasted for about 13-14\nhours with no WiFi on, and about 10\nwith WiFi. In my opinion, that\u2019s quite a\ndeal-breaker when deciding whether to\ntake the laptop with you on vacation or\nthe iPad.\nConclusion\nOverall, the iPad is an amazing device;\nobviously, it\u2019s not perfect. But with\nthese specs and the base model at just\n\u00a3399, it\u2019s certainly the number one tablet on the market \u2013 at least at this point\nin time. I will most likely be unable to\ngive up my laptop; but for people who\njust need a device for entertainment,\nreading, writing, taking notes, this is, I\nbelieve, what they\u2019ll probably be using\nin a few years\u2019 time.\nThe iPad 2, looking much like the iPad. And the iPod. And the iPhone. Revolutionary design from Apple as always...\nNow sold with matte black triangle\n\n"

Made iconic through\nHemingway\u2019s dry prose and Picasso\u2019s\nchilling canvas, the Spanish Civil war\nwas probably the last real instance in\nwhich thousands of individuals across\nEurope took up arms to defend their ideals in a foreign state regardless of their\nown nation\u2019s views on the matter.\nAlmost every country in the EU hails\nfrom the blood of foreign nationals who\nrisked their lives to free them from their\noppressors. From the Hungarian Legion\nin Italy during its Risorgimento to the\nBritish citizens, most famously Lord Byron, fighting for the freedom of Greece,\nmodern-day Europe was born of a sense\nof brotherhood common to its people.\nNor was this a phenomenon which was\nlimited to the Mediterranean: in South\nAmerica, the British Legion fought for\nthe independence of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru, while Garibaldi\ndefended that of Uruguay. Lafayette and\nother French volunteers sailed to North\nRhys Davies\nAmerica to aid in the American Revolutionary War, and the citizens of the US\nreciprocated in both World Wars.\nSo where are today\u2019s Byrons? As\nthe fiery Arab Revolution blazes on,\none is left to wonder if the citizens of\nour nations will ever heed the call to\narms. A stunningly cynical apathy is\nrife amongst the members of our gen-eration, as if the seventy-five year gap\nwhich separates us from our grandparents\u2019 situation in Spain had bred nothing but a contemptible attachment to the\neasy lifestyle our ancestors shed their\nblood for.\nThis is not the first time the citizens\nof democratic nations have failed their\nneighbours. As part of a wider blaze\nof protests in Eastern Europe and the\nCaucasus which accompanied the death\nof Stalin, the Hungarian Revolution of\n1956 bears many resemblances to the\ncurrent situation in Libya. There too a\nwhole nation spontaneously rose to rid\nitself of a hated government. But a disillusioned and spineless West simply\nstared on, not lifting a finger in the hypocritical attempt to preserve a freedom\nthey let others lose.\nWe all insist on the values of a liberal and democratic government, but\nit would appear that we are also in too\nmuch of a lethargic state to provide any\npractical help to people who are trying\nto form one of their own. Since the fall\nof the Berlin wall, only religious extremism seems to be able to mobilize\nour complacent generation to the ultimate sacrifice. The political organisations formed the only internal political\nstructures which allowed British and\nother foreign nationals to take a stance\nin Spain against the express wish of their\ngovernments, and these no longer exist.\nIn 1848 democrats all over Europe took\nup arms and readily offered their lives\nfor the cause of freedom, while today\u2019s\nliberals can scarcely be bothered to lift\ntheir pens.\nOurs is a generation of cowards, more\ninterested in flicking between channels\nto satisfy our perverse curiosity than\nto actually take any affirmative action\nourselves. Too comfortable in our well\nplanned\u2013out lives, we will always be\ntoo busy with our own petty problems\nto occupy ourselves with defending a\nfreedom we do not deserve.\nT\nhere was a wedding last\nFriday. One of slightly\nmore importance than nor-mal. Did you see it?\nI\u2019m afraid I missed it.\nWhich was a shame because I had a personal invitation to Westminster Abbey\nbut a very important engagement came\nup at the last moment. There was a wall\nthat had been recently painted and they\nneeded someone make absolutely certain that it dried. Like I said, a shame,\nbut I\u2019ll catch the next one.\nSay what you like about the Royal\nWedding (And I believe Angry Geek already has, should you care to look at Felix\u2019s brand-spanking new website...), it\nwas quite popular. Central London was\nfilled with people cheering and waving\nflags as minibuses of royals drove by.\nAnd bunting. What the hell is bunting?\nAfter the ceremony, once everything had\ndevolved into a general good time, a lot\nof people were saying how proud they\nwere to be British.\nThat\u2019s nice for them but what does it\nmean? I\u2019ve never considered myself to\nbe British. I am a Prince of Wales, and\nwill be until I die and my heart will always belong to the land of my fathers,\nthat old land where the minstrels are\nhonoured and free. But what does it\nmean to be British, especially in this\nAlessandro Guazzi\nage, in this cosmopolitan melting-pot\nof a city? The English Defence League\nand the British National Party have\nvery strong ideas of what being British\nmeans. They define themselves as true\nBrits so being British must mean being\nbigoted and xenophobic, short\u2013sighted\nand small\u2013minded, and being painfully,\npainfully white. Somehow, this doesn\u2019t\nseem correct \u2013 and not just because I\ndon\u2019t want to live in a universe where\nthe EDL and BNP can be right.\nThey are both very keen for immigrants to go \u201chome\u201d as well, positing\nthat Britain is for the British. Does that\nmean that you\u2019re only British if you\u2019re\nborn in this green and pleasant land? Is\nnationality something that boils down to\njust a bit of luck and geography? Again,\nI don\u2019t think so. Though an island na-tion, throughout history, Britain has\nplayed host to a thousand colours and\ncreeds. Some have moved on afterwards\nbut many more decided to stay, a testament to our accepting nature. Except the\nFrench. I draw a line with the French.\nExtremists want those who are different\nto them to go home but what is home?\nIsn\u2019t it somewhere where we feel wel-come? For many people, that\u2019s right\nhere, regardless on what\u2019s scribbled on\ntheir birth certificate.\nMaybe being British is a matter of\nstereotypes. If you conform to a certain\nnumber of hallmarks of Britishness,\nmaybe that makes you British? So, being\nBritish includes (but is not limited to)\ndrinking tea, queuing, talking about the\nweather, a stiff upper lip and poor dental\nhygiene, driving on the left, throwing\nvowels in words with reckless abandon\nand\u2026royal weddings. While I know a\nfew people like this, it\u2019s a narrow and\nrather twisted definition of Britishness.\nStereotypes simplify trends into absurd-ity. That\u2019s why the BNP love them so\nmuch. While we do love tea in this coun-try, we also drink coffee. Can drinking\ncoffee be a sign of Britishness too?\nThis might be getting a bit too academic.\nIf you\u2019re British (Proud or otherwise),\nyou don\u2019t need someone to tell you,\nit\u2019s something you feel, something you\nknow intuitively. It doesn\u2019t matter if\nbreathe tea (not an advisable way to imbibe it) or can\u2019t stand the stuff. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter if you were born in Bolton or Beirut. If this strange land, of Buckingham\nPalace and Chicken Cottage, of Pimm\u2019s\no\u2019clock and Tennant\u2019s Special Brew, of\nred, white and blue \u2013 and every other\ncolour under the sun, means something\nto you, maybe that\u2019s what makes you\nBritish.\nAnd if you\u2019re still confused, have a\nlook at your passport.\nHow to be British, apparently\n\u201cIn 1848, democrats\noffered their lives\nfor freedom. Today\u2019s\nliberals can scarcely\nbe bothered to lift\ntheir pens\u201d\nTake up arms to defend freedom\n\u201cCentral London was\nfilled with people\ncheering. And\nbunting. What the\nhell is bunting?\u201d\nIt\u2019s all an\nOlympic waste\nof time\nI have been in two minds about\nbuying my Olympics tickets for\nsome time. This is a chance\nto see some great riding. But\nchamping at the bit, I am not.\nAs one may expect, tickets\nare not cheap and of course\nI want good value for money.\nSeeing good horse-and-rider\ncombinations strut their stuff\nis great, but it may be better\nvalue-for-money to invest in\ntraining with one of those rid-ers. However, regarding tick-ets, as you may well know, one\ncannot simply buy them. It is\na sort of lottery in which one\nhas to register, ask for whatever tickets one wants and\nhand over intimate financial/\npersonal details, all in order to\nwait with bated breath at the\nprospect of being allocated the\n\u2018requested\u2019 tickets.\nI can easily add to this the necessity of having to use a VISA\ncard to pay for such tickets. It\nlooks like a revolting sponsorship deal. This does not reconcile with the otherwise rather\nsensible explanation currently\ndoing the rounds. This is that\ndue to a unique rule governing\nthe use of VISA accounts, the\ntickets bought with them cannot be sold on to ticket touts\nand thus the price not be inflated or used as a vehicle for\ninsalubrious activity. Of course\nit is perfectly possible that\nsuch a sensible rule and such\na nauseating sponsorship deal\nare not mutually exclusive. If it\nwere a combination of the two,\nI think it would reflect well on\nthe organisers.\nCommentators have been\nrather negative about the\nOlympics up to now, moaning\nthat \u201cIt\u2019ll be crap because it is\nin London and not anywhere\nelse\u201d, which is itself a relief.\nPerhaps the sort of furtive\nstubbornness we have seen\nfrom the Olympic organisers\nis the result of such attacks.\nThe side-effects of having people tough enough to organise\nthe largest sporting event in\nthe world are a revolting logo,\na nauseating sponsorship\ndeal and a peculiar ticketing\nsystem. It all leaves me with\na feeling that it is not quite\ncricket.\nSamuel Furse\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 06 MAY 2011 29\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nT\nhe idea of a chess-related\nevent at Imperial isn\u2019t a\nnew one: the last major\nopen tournament held at\nImperial was the 1st Chessmaster British Blitz Championships\nback in 1999, which Hackney famously\ndominated en-route to a well deserved\nvictory. Going back even further, Imperial is quite a famous venue for weekend congresses, as often as three times\na year, spanning from the 70s to the\n90s. The current students and indeed the\norganiser had no idea of this when the\nthought of hosting a chess event crossed\nour minds, and once we had booked\nthe beautiful activity rooms on the first\nfloor of the Union, the pressure was on\nto live up to our reputation.\nSetting up on the Friday night was an\ninteresting affair, particularly with the\nUnion (despite being equipped with an\nawesome dining hall) seemingly only\nhaving ten tables in the entire building.\nThe meeting rooms in the east wing\nbasement were duly plundered, a process taking approximately four hours\nand ending in several hearty drinks on\nFriday evening. The end result, though,\nwas spectacular: the well lit event hall\nwas set up and players would find themselves competing against each other in\nthe shadow of the Royal Albert Hall the\nnext day.\nSaturday morning proved both productive and hectic, with everything\nbeing set up but chaos when it came\nto putting individuals into new teams.\nWhen the dust settled, the event started\nonly twenty minutes late, with nineteen\nteams taking part. The fact that there\nwas an odd number of teams was actually a blessing in disguise: teams with\nplayers departing during the day were\nable to \u2018steal\u2019 players to fill in during\nrounds \u2013 this meant no boards were\ndefaulted, and even players receiving a\nbye could participate in a rated game!\nAmong the event\u2019s guests included the\nesteemed kingscrusher (Tryfon Gavriel), famous for his chess videos and\nthousands of followers on YouTube. At\na \u201cmeasly\u201d ECF rapidplay rating of 208\n(for those unfamiliar with chess ratings,\nthis is comfortably Master strength), he\nwas playing as the lowest rated player in\nthe daunting Team Barford, arriving as\nthe team to beat with an average grade\nof 211!\nExtra tables and analysis boards were\navailable near the entrance of the room,\nwhich players used in the gaps between\nrounds but almost not at all during\nlunchtime, with most of the hall taking\nadvantage of the longer break to get a\nproper meal in, in the many nearby restaurants and cafes.\nThe day was regularly interrupted\nwith muffled screams and shouts of joy\nfrom the downstairs student bar, where\na large number of cricket fans (mainly\nSri Lankan) were congregating to watch\nthe Cricket World Cup Final. After\nlunch (during India\u2019s match winning\ninnings: say that three times fast!) the\nattitude was somewhat more subdued\nand the chess was a tad quieter. For the\nrecord, this event organiser attempted\nto have the World Cup Final moved to\nanother date to accommodate the chess,\nbut they rather rudely never got back to\nmy e-mail\u2026\nRounds one and two started slightly\nlate but with an awesome turnaround\nthanks to our guest arbiter Alex Holowczak, by the start of the third round after\nlunchtime (which was a generous hour,\nnot common for a chess rapidplay event!)\nthe day was looking like it could be back\non schedule by the end of the day.\nBarford were sole leaders after second\nand third seeds Athenaeum A and Kings\nHead I drew their match in Round 3, but\nthe afternoon got especially tense when\nTeam Barford were spectacularly beaten by Athenaeum A in Round 4! Paul\nThorainsson managed a victory against\nVenkat Tiruchirapalli and Charles McAleenan held Andrew Stone to a well deserved draw on bottom board despite\nbeing 46 points his junior, for the match\nto be decided 2.5-1.5 in Athenaeum\u2019s\nfavour. This resulted in Kings Head and\nAthenaeum having a joint-lead for the\nnext round, with Barford a single point\nbehind and ready to pounce.\nThe final round saw Barford in prime\nposition to pounce, playing Kings Head\nI and pulling off a victory. However,\nAthenaeum A won their match as well\nwhich clinched first place outright, so\nBarford had to settle for second place\nafter leapfrogging Kings Head I, who\nput in a great performance to finish 3rd\noverall.\nOther notable mentions that won prizes include Cereal Imperial which won\nthe best-academic-institution prize, as\nwell as a storming tournament from\njuniors from Wilson\u2019s School who deservedly pick up the best-average-U150\nprize as well as keeping all the university teams on their toes! Finally, the best\ngame prize (which was offered on-the-day) as judged by English IM Thomas\nRendle went to the Round 3 encounter\nbetween Chris Tandy of the MushVrooms who played against Tom Slater\nof the Southampton Cheetahs.\nAfter packing up, the day ended with\na lot of the Imperial crew celebrating\nat the event organiser\u2019s residence, with\nspecial guests Postman Patzer (Kishan\nPattni) and DJ Hippo (Justin Hadi)\nkeeping the party going into the early\nhours.\nThe event was an overwhelming success and thanks must be given to all\nparties involved in setting up before\nand after as well as all the team captains and players who made the day a\nfantastic one over-the-board as well.\nSpecial thanks must be given to Adam\nRaoof and Sean Hewitt, who helped tremendously with the organisation of the\nevent beforehand, as well as John and\nChristine Constable who generously offered to lend us top-quality equipment\nfor the day\u2019s proceedings. We look\nforward to seeing you at Imperial College\u2019s events in the future, which will\nhopefully be soon and frequent!\nIMPERIAL H O STS\nCH ESS TO U RN AMEN T\n\u201cI attempted to have\nthe [Cricket] World\nCup Final moved\nto another date to\naccommodate the\nchess, but they\nrather rudely never\ngot back to my\ne-mail...\u201d\nPhotos and words by John Sargent\n\n"

The choreography is ex-cellent, demonstrating just how a single hammer can be used for all sorts of creative fantasy\nfighting skills. Side-kicks worth rooting for\nalso appear, although their developments are\nkept to a bare minimum (we\u2019ll just have to settle for being told that they have been Thor\u2019s\nfriends for years and are utterly loyal to him).\nThe Warriors Three (Ray Stevenson, Joshua\nDallas, Tadanobu Asano) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) form one heck of a team, taking on\nan army of Frost Giants just because Thor asks\nthem to.\nIt\u2019s on Earth where events take a shift in tone.\nThor meets Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) a\nsmart astrophysicist and her companions Erik\n(Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) and Darcy (Kat Dennings)\nwho provide some priceless comic relief that\nwas lacking in the more serious first section of\nthe film. Thor obviously has trouble finding his\nway around the new planet and his overtly confident attitude declaring to everyone that he is\nthe great son of Odin (as if that is supposed to\nmean anything to the citizens of New Mexico)\nworks well to loosen the reins a little and give\nour protagonist a breather from all the heavy\nNow that Joss Whedon\u2019s The Avengers is of-ficial, it\u2019s about time we met some of the new\nMarvel superheroes. First up is Thor, the Norse\nGod of Thunder who wields his trademark\nhammer to fight evil. Unlike the many superheroes we\u2019ve seen who originate from Earth,\nThor (Chris Hemsworth) is from a wholly\ndifferent world, and has a lot of background\ninformation that needs to be explained. Fortunately director, Kenneth Branagh, is not\nafraid to jump straight in here, and show the\nmagnificently designed universe of Asgard.\nWe see Thor\u2019s father Odin (Anthony Hopkins)\nthe ruler of Asgard, his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and some lavish gold-painted set that\ntruly raises the bar on what is now possible\nwith modern day computer graphics.\nThor is an arrogant but talented warrior who\nenjoys nothing more than charging into bat-tle. For years the people of Asgard have been\nin conflict with the Frozen Giants and after a\nlong period of war their leader Laufey (Colm\nFeore) called an uneasy truce with Odin. As\nis common for any film plot that involves two\ngifted siblings, Thor\u2019s problems stem from his\njealous brother. Manipulated into betraying his\nBollywood Bite\nA monthly column dedicated to the\nIndian film industry by Aamir Shamsi\n3 Idiots ****\nStarring: Aamir Khan, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi,\nKareena Kapoor\nDirector: Rajkumar Hirani\nSynopsis: 2 friends go down memory lane as they\nfind a lead to track down their college buddy\nIt\u2019s finally here! If taken individually, Hirani\u2019s third film\nis a heart-warming story packed with laughs, emotion\nand great acting.\nBut not long into the film tat you start to realise how\nsimilar the themes are to the director\u2019s first film (Mun-nabhai MBBS): arduous student life, a cruel college\ndean (played by the same actor), parents\u2019 expecta-tions, rebel student conflicting with the professors,\nbringing joy and compassion to a somewhat militant-run campus, mocking the \u201cgeek\u201d and mistakenly falling for the dean\u2019s daughter. I suppose two films with\nsuch similar themes and settings can work if treated\ndifferently but when they share the same tone and\nlook too, it becomes difficult to differentiate. I also fail\nto see why Rancho (Khan) needs to hide his true identity from his friends and the woman he loves, and disappear as if he never existed once his master\u2019s plan\nis fulfilled. There is no logical sense as to why, when\nthere is no longer any real risk to his \u201cmission\u201d per\nse, he would sacrifice such meaningful relationships.\nAnd so I can\u2019t help but see this as a more refined\nversion in parts of his first with a different core plotline\nand that, along with the strange plot, I feel, takes away\nfrom its brilliance. Nonetheless extremely enjoyable!\nFriday 06 MAY 2011\naction. Hemsworth emerges as a steady lead\nactor, managing to breeze through the action\nwhilst also handling the comedy well.\nProblems arise as we constantly go backwards and forwards between Earth and Asgard.\nIt\u2019s an indisputable fact that Asgard is much\nbetter to look at, and is filled with far more\ninteresting characters and events. Hopkins has\nmany memorable scenes as he speaks his lines\nwith conviction, a standout scene involving a\nheated argument between Odin and Loki, with\nthe son questioning his true origins. It takes\ntime for Hiddleston\u2019s character to build but\nwhen it does, the actor\u2019s portrayal of insecurity,\nvulnerability and instability combine to produce one complex villain. Even Rene Russo,\nplaying the wife of Odin, is given the chance\nto pick up a sword and take a swing at a Frost\nGiant. Things down on Earth seem a lot more\ntepid than that: Thor\u2019s journey for redemption\nis not clearly mapped out, and despite the actors\u2019 chemistry, the romance between Foster\nand Thor is underdeveloped.\nBut as a way of introducing a superhero we\nhave never met before, Branagh has a respectable stab at the material. He involves all the\nright characters, sets the film up in the most\ngorgeous landscapes, and has found the right\nleading man for a challenging part. At the end\nof the credits, a caption reading \u201cThor will return in The Avengers\u201d pops up. And we can\u2019t\nwait to see Hemsworth standing alongside of\nRobert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner in\nMay 2012.\nIt has its faults but Marvel\u2019s Thor descends from the\nheavens to wreak havok amongst us mere mortals\nOut on DVD\nSnippet Reviews\nGame **\nStarring: Abhishek Bachchan, Kangna Ranaut, Jimmy\nShergil\nDirector: Abhinay Deo\nSynopsis: Crime thriller involving 4 strangers invited\nto play a game by a wealthy tycoon\nReview: Interesting concept that eventually becomes\nvery tedious and predictable\nThank You *\nStarring: Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol, Sonam Kapoor\nDirector: Aneez Basmee\nSynopsis: A private detective aims to break up the\nmarriage of his employer after falling for her\nReview: Once again I\u2019m praying this will be the last\nof Akshay\u2019s nonsensical and cringe-worthy comedies.\n\n"

Brotherly competition\nwas always healthy in the house,\ncompeting in strength, in speed,\nin eating watermelons, in aca-demics...\nAnthony was amazingly bright\nand ambitious; he always looked\nto excel, and was passionate\nabout mechanical engineering.\nHis mind was full of creativity\nand he was always experimenting in all aspects of his life from\ntic tacs to magnets, in martial\narts and in engineering. He was\nalways one step ahead of the\ngame when it came to mechanical engineering, before KERS in\nformula 1 had come out, he had\nalready thought of the idea of\nstoring wasted energy in a car\nfrom coasting (when your foot is\noff the accelerator) in the form of\nelectricity to be used (aged 15).\nHe also had a passion for magnets and had experimented with\ndevices to shoot out metallic objects using magnetic energy by\nthe age of 14, which came to be\nknown as a 'rail gun' a few years\nlater. His prediction that electric\ncars/motorbikes would dominate\nfuture travel at the age of 16 is\nalso looking to come true... In\nmy eyes, he was a true genius\nand we had always had a pact to\nstart our business as the three\nof us...\nSocially, Anthony was always\nfull of energy and excitement. He\nwas a friendly character and was\nable to get on with everyone. He\nwas always the life of the party -his energy was contagious. He always tried to live by his favourite\nfilm: 'Yes Man'. Indeed he was\na 'Yes Man', saying yes to life\nand trying all sports and activities from riding on his motorbike,\nballroom dancing, violin, martial\narts, piano, American football,\nfootball, tennis, rock climbing\n(the list goes on!)...\nI have no fear to say that he\nlived his life to the fullest (a quality that I hope to learn and fulfill)\n\u2013 so much so that he was never\none to go in the conventional\nmanner, but always in what he\nloved doing best at that moment\nin time \u2013 and in that moment it so\nhappened to be swimming in The\nSerpentine.\nAlthough I am not religious,\na statement that was taught to\nme has always stuck with me\nand that is that man has always\nwished to live as a God (for as a\nGod you can live for eternity) and\nthe Gods have always wished to\nlive as man because when life\nis limited \u2013 life is sweeter. And I\nam confident to say that Anthony\nlived a life so full - that the Gods\nwould indeed be jealous.\nI like to imagine Anthony, the\ngenius and cheeky character that\nhe was, as having figured out the\nsecret \u2013 cheated life and skipped\nto the ending, forever living in the\nheavens above as the hyperactive 18 year old, full of energy\nand mobility... whilst for the rest\nof us \u2013 we will reach heaven in\nold age, barely walking... so let\nthe sadness go as once again, I\nhe has figured it out and is one\nstep ahead of us :)\nImperial mourns death of Anthony Soh\nFriends hold memorial service in memory of \u2018bright and ambitious\u2019 first year\nJeff Soh remembers his\n\u2018passionate\u2019 brother\nFriends of first year Mechanical Engineering student Yen Soh, also known as\nAnthony, laid flowers at the Serpentine\nlast Thursday in his memory. His passing during the Easter holidays shocked\nImperial\u2019s community.\nThe laying of flowers followed a memorial event in the Mechanical Engineering building, during which friends\nread eulogies to him and recited the\npoem \u201cDeath is nothing at all\u201d by Henry\nScott Holland.\nHe originally went missing on the\n22nd of March after leaving Imperial\nCollege Union at around 11pm, after\na night drinking with his friends. He\nwas last seen turning into Kensington Gore and it was speculated that he\nhad headed through Hyde Park back\nto Wilson House, his hall of residence.\nHis disappearance sparked a massive\nresponse online, with over 3000 people\non Facebook raising awareness about\nhis disappearance and volunteering to\nhelp find him. Search parties were organised and his brother, friends from\nhome and Imperial, and even students\nwho didn\u2019t know him directly, roamed\nSouth Kensington and Bayswater putting up posters asking for information\nabout his whereabouts.\nThe police, who searched the Serpentine without success for four days following his disappearance, launched a\nmissing persons investigation. Sadly,\nhowever, on the 6th of April, he was\nfound in the Serpentine by a boat worker.\nThe coroner found no external or internal injuries, or any water in his lungs and\nsaid that he had died from sudden cold\nwater immersion, in the sense that the\nshock of the cold water stopped his heart.\nHis brother, Jeff Soh, described him\nas \u201cfull of energy and excitement\u201d and\n\u201ca friendly character [who] was able to\nget on with everyone.\u201d\nAnthony will be remembered fondly\nas an intelligent and popular student.\nFacebook was flooded with messages of\ncondolence on the Facebook page: \u2018Rest\nIn Peace Anthony Soh\u2019 and others.\nDr Michael Bluck, Lecturer in the\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering and Hall Warden at Wilson House,\nwhich was Anthony\u2019s student hall, told\nImperial\u2019s Reporter: \u201cAnthony was a\nvery popular resident of Wilson House\nand his many friends will miss him\ndearly.

    "content": "FELIX\n12\nYou won\u2019t believe it..\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Charlie Harvey\nKelly Oakes\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 06 may 2011\nBeauty isn\u2019t in the eye of the\nbeholder, it\u2019s in the eye\nYes, maybe it\u2019s true that there are differing opinions on who we think of as attractive. Indeed,\nsome people think Simon Cowell is good look-ing; still can\u2019t get my head around that one, but\nI digress. Yes, people have their own personal\nprefernces \u2013 blonde or brunette, brainy or brawny,\netc. However, numerous studies have shown that\nthere are a significant number of traits that we\nall find attractive, no matter who we are. These\ninclude big eyes in women, big jaws in men, and\nsymmetrical faces. These features are all signals\nto potential partners of good genetic stock. A symmetrical face, for example, shows that you are able\nto fight off parasites, which can distort the normal\ndevelopment of the body.\nWell, one more trait has been added to the list\nof more-or-less universally attractive features \u2013\nbright, white eyes. The white part of the eye \u2013 the\nsclera \u2013 is made of tough fibres, protecting the eye\nfrom various assaults. This white canvas, however,\nis rather delicate, and can be stained depending\non various ailments one might suffer from. Yellow\neyes, for example, can be caused by fat deposits as\nwe age, or may indicate jaundice (a build up of biliru-bin). Red eyes are caused by dilated blood vessels\nin the eye and can be symptomatic of anything from\ninfection to allergy. The scientists behind the study,\npublished in the journal Ethology, doctored 100 of\npictures of eyes to make them appear bloodshot.\nTogether with 100 healthy white eyes, the scientists asked people to rate the pictures on sadness,\nhealthiness and attractiveness. Unsurprisingly, the\nwhite eyed folk did best on all three counts.\nThe sclera is an interesting part of the body to\ntest beauty on because it is something that humans have which we don\u2019t share with our closest\nrelatives \u2013 chimpanzees. All non-human primates\nhave brown or dark brown sclera. It is thought to be\nthis colour (similar to the iris) so as to mask which\ndirection you are looking. In humans, the eye seems\nto have gained a secondary function (besides preventing you bumping into things) \u2013 communication\nwith others. As well as attractiveness, the white eye\ncan signal gaze direction and emotion. Vital messages in an increasingly social species.\nCharlie Harvey\nAgene associated with increased alcohol drinking behaviour has been identified, and may\nlead to a better understanding of the biological\nmechanisms that control drinking.\nThe research, published in the journal PNAS,\nidentified the gene known as autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) as the likely can-didate. A variant of this gene, present in three\nquarters of people studied is connected with\nhigher levels of alcohol consumption. People\nwith this gene drink, on average, five per cent\nmore alcohol.\nWhile it is not known exactly what the function of AUTS2 is, it is known to be expressed in\nneurons that regulate reward behaviours and in\nneurons that determine alcohol sensitivity. The\nresearchers believe that people with the more\ncommon gene may have to drink more to gain\nthe same amount of reward. Fruit flies have a\nsimilar gene, and in tests researchers found that\nblocking the effect of this gene made the flies\nless sensitive to alcohol. As the name suggests,\nAUTS2 has also been linked to autism and\nADHD \u2013 both of which are known to be connected with higher levels of alcoholism.\nClearly, there can be no single gene responsible for such a complex behaviour such as al-coholism. As lead author Professor Paul Elliott\nnotes \u201cThere are a lot of factors that affect how\nmuch alcohol a person drinks, but we know\nfrom twin studies that genes play an important\nrole. The difference that this particular gene\nmakes is only small, but by finding it we\u2019ve\nopened up a new area of research into the biological mechanisms that control drinking.\u201d\nAlcohol related diseases are a major burden\nin the UK, with 15,000 people dying from conditions such as liver cirrhosis, cancer and heart\ndiseases each year. The researchers hope that\na better understanding of the genetic mechanisms that govern alcohol consumption may\nlead to the development of individually tailored\ntreatments for alcohol abuse and addiction.\nGene linked to alcohol intake found\nCharlie Harvey\nThe infected individual wastes away with fe-ver, sweats and a chronic cough. The disease\nappears to consume them from within. It is\nthe same disease that consumes Satine, played\nby Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge!, and has\nbeen a big killer for centuries. Even today con-sumption, known now as tuberculosis or TB, is\nstill the biggest killer out of all bacterial diseas-es. TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and, unlike other European countries,\ninfection rates are on the rise in the UK, with\n40% of cases here in London. This unexpected\nrise appears to be linked to the increasing number of internationals entering the country with\nundetected TB.\nTB is hard to treat partly due to its complex\ncell wall which prevents many drugs from entering the bacterium. Standard antibiotic treatment lasts between 6-24 months. This poses a\nproblem in many developing countries where\nclinics are few and far between and where patients often do not return for repeat prescrip-tions. Treatment is becoming increasingly difficult with the increase of multi-drug resistant\nstrains. Vaccination, therefore, is seen as the\nbest method to prevent infection and the spread\nof TB. The current vaccine, Bacillus CalmetteGu\u00e9rin (BCG), which has left many of us with\nan ugly scar on our arm, is a live attenuated\nversion of M. bovis, the cow version of Mtb.\nBCG has been in use for around 90 years but\nthe many problems with this vaccine have led\nto a quest for a replacement. BCG only offers\nprotection for around 10 years and protection\nwanes in adults. It also has different efficacy in\ndifferent countries. A trial in India, for exam-ple, showed no protective properties at all. This\nmay be due to a reduced protection in people in\nAsia and Africa who may have been exposed\nto other Mycobacterial species and may have\ngenetic differences which reduces the vaccine\u2019s\neffectiveness.\nIn the past 90 years there have been no other\nsuccessful candidate vaccines. Research into\nnew TB vaccines is currently largely based on\nthe search for highly immunogenic antigens (a\nsubstance that induces an immune response)\non the cell surface of Mtb. A few possible\ncandidates have been thrown up; there are\ncurrently 12 vaccines in clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Mtb72f vaccine contains two\nsurface antigens, one of which is a protein\nnamed PPE18, currently being researched in\nthe Centre of Molecular Microbiology and Infection here at Imperial. Most vaccine candidates have little chance of making it through\nthe vigorous clinical trials with preliminary\ndata showing little more protection than BCG\nalready offers.\nIn March, Imperial announced that the Tuberculosis Research Group in the National Heart\nand Lung Institute had discovered a novel target protein called EspC that may have use as a\npotential TB vaccine. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency pointed out in 2008 that EspC was\nhighly immunogenic. The authors also stated\nthat it was only secreted by Mtb, not M. bovis\nBCG, making it potentially useful for new diagnostic tests. New diagnostics are needed due\nto BCG interfering with the current test used\nand giving false positives. The Tuberculosis\nResearch Unit have further shown EspC to illicit a strong immune response from T-cells isolated from patients infected with TB, therefore\nthis makes it a potential vaccine candidate.\nThere are three main ways of tackling TB:\ndiagnosis, vaccination, and drugs that reduce\nspread and pathology of the disease. TB is\ntransmitted from person to person usually\nthrough the air from the cough of an infected\npatient. Last month, Imperial published findings that MMP-1, an enzyme regulated by\nmonocytes in the presence of Mtb, damages\nthe collagen in lung tissue. This can result in\ncoughing which can spread Mtb through the\nair. As there are drugs to supress MMP-1 we\nmay be able to reduce the spread of TB and reduce immunopathology.\nIt is unlikely that the vaccine candidates in\nclinical trials at the moment will come out of\nthe pipeline to become vaccines. The current\nmethod of taking any protein that elicits a\nstrong immune response and using it as a potential vaccine without knowing its function or\nstructure is slightly worrying. It has clearly not\nbeen the correct method for finding potential\nvaccine targets due to a lack of new vaccines\nin the last century. One of the main problems\nfacing vaccine construction is the incomplete\nknowledge of what constitutes protective im-munity.\nUntil there is a good understanding of Mtb\ninfection it is unlikely there will be a better vaccine than the BCG. The best option at the moment is to make a better BCG vaccine of which\nthere are three potential candidates in clinical\ntrials now. Only time and rigorous clinical trials\nwill tell if one of these three will be the knight\nin shining armour of vaccines.\nAmberley Stevens\nThe rise of consumption\nOh yes, definitely a bad case of Bieber fever\nAre you looking at me?\n\n"

The forbidding policy, in\nwhich even the act of teaching the Japanese language to foreigners is punishable\nby death, preserves the unique cultural\nheritage and independence of Japan, but\nat the same time pickles the island nation\nand dooms it to a gradual decline as it remains stagnant while the world beyond\nits seas progresses.\nOn the bay of Nagasaki, lies Dejima,\nthe sole trading outpost of the powerful\nDutch East India Company and Japan\u2019s\nonly window to the outside world. Jacob\nde Zoet is a young twenty-something\nclerk attached to the Company under a\nfive-year contract at the end of which\nhe hopes to return to Holland wealthy\nenough to take the hands of his sweetheart in marriage.\nHowever, de Zoet\u2019s time in the Land\nof a Thousand Autumns would prove to\nbe more than what he expected as he begins to unravel corruption rife through\nthe Dutch East India Company ranks\nin Dejima. A chance encounter with\nthe mysterious Orito Aibigawa sets Jacob on a besotted pursuit for her love\nand draws him into an adventure which\nwould embroil him with sinister forces\nin the Japanese ruling elite and an adventure of murder and deceit.\nIn The Thousand Autumns David\nMitchell conjures an exquisite stage of\nEdo Japan, and fills it with a colourful\ncast of characters who leap out of the\npage with the energy and grace of a\nnimble ballerina. It is also the work of\na master prose stylist at his finest, for no\nless skilled hands could bring to life the\nstory with such poetic grace.\nSetting a story in which the characters are divided by a mutual language\nbarrier may be an obstacle to effective\ninteraction between the characters, but\nReading the book feels as if I was living\nthe story through the eyes of the char-acters.\nThe first character you are introduced\nto in The Pink Boots is Tayel. He sleeps\nwith girls just because he can. Listening\nto the girl\u2019s shallow blabber and putting up with lame TV shows in return\nfor mediocre sex suits him fine. He is\nmiserable but he just can't stop, because\ndeep down he knows, the girl who really is worth fighting for is a lot more\ncomplicated and he's not sure he's ready.\nJamie has a heart of gold but she just\nhasn't yet met the manager of the \"Good\nLuck\" Department in Life. It seems like\nall she ever does is give and give and\nin return life and other people deal her\none slap in the face after another. She\nescaped from various foster homes in\nher early teens and after a series of disastrous events ends up with Maya, the\ndead gorgeous but psychotic drug ad-dict. What was once a passionate and\nintense relationship turns into what can\nalmost be described as a force of habit:\nan unbalanced structure of dependency.\nJamie is about to lose every last ounce\nof self-respect while Maya freely engages in her weird sexual endeavours.\nAnd that\u2019s when Jamie meets Tayel in\na park.\nTayel made me laugh out loud several times: he's such a typical guy in a\nway, so stubborn and set in his opinions.\nBut as you get to know him better, you\nrealize these strong convictions come\nfrom a genuine place which he still\nfinds overwhelming. It's the place that\nkeeps him far from letting anyone in to\nhis heart. On the other hand, the sweet\nbundle of love that is Jamie wants nothing more than to fill that void between\nthem with all that she's worth but her\nchaotic lifestyle and friends keep getting in the way. When she finally goes\noff the coke, he decides to go on a bend-er. Reading the first part of the story was\nlike watching friends of yours doing the\nmating dance but never quite getting\ndown to the real business, only in The\nPink Boots the wait and the characters\nsurrounding it, will leave you wanting\nmore.\nThe second part of the book blew me\naway. It\u2019s filled with so much raw emo-tion. Jamie's anger and pain, her sense of\nnot belonging to anyone and the kind of\nloneliness no one can really fill. Getting\nto know her story and then seeing her\nlife spiralling downwards, and watching\nTayel through his own struggle, until he\nfinally realises what needs to be done\nbut it is already too late, it made me cry\nlike a little girl. The story reminds me a\nlot of Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Requiem for\na Dream, only that The Pink Boots left\nme with a lot more memories of laugh-ter. Each character in the book is lovable in their own little way, even Virgine\nthe wannabe \"artist\", and Maya the lost\njunkie.\nI recommend this book to anyone\nwho enjoys the insight to both the male\nand female mind and likes it spiced up\nwith a lot of sex, a lot of drugs and quite\nsome rock'n'roll and rave folk.\nFor more information go to:\nwww.thepinkboots.com\nMitchell grabbed the bull by its horns\nand turned the lack of a common language into plenty of humourous word-plays and puns with meanings lost (or\nmuddled up) in translation, the gems\nthat contribute to the novel\u2019s ingenuity.\nThe many years David spent in Japan as an English teacher and the meticulous research (he once spent hours\nresearching whether men of that time\nused shaving cream just to complete a\nsentence about shaving) during the four\nyears spent writing the novel shows in\nthe depth of portrayal of the Edo Japanese culture, down to the quintessential\nqualities of the Japanese language.\nAll in all, The Thousand Autumns is a\nsatisfying, immersive read which transports the reader to an almost fantasy-like world.\nThe book is now out in paperback.\nOnce upon a time in Dejima\nA beautifully realised historical fiction\nSex, drugs, and a pair of pink boots\nA provocative debut novel\nGuo Heng Chin\nCelia Usero Navarro\n\u201cNo less skilled\nhands could bring\nto life the story with\nsuch poetic grace\u201d\nRead an\ninterview\nwith David\nMitchell on\nthe opposite\npage\nInterested\nin reviewing\nbooks?

The epeeists Marcello Colombino, Ed Gilhead and Miles Gandolfi met a stronger team than their foil fencing\nfriends and lost by one hit, 44-45, after a thrilling last period. From here it was down to the\nsabreurs Maiyuran Ratneswaran, Didier Nohlmans and Henry Gann to make sure the men\nfollowed the women in to the final. To ensure\nthis they could lose by a maximum of eight\nhits. Though, keeping in mind that the team\nhas had 45-15 (victory) as their worst result,\nno one was really worried. Edinburgh decided\nto put up a greater fight than any other team so\nfar, and managed to get 29 points. The overall\nscore was 134 \u2013 100 and the foilists found it\nhighly amusing to point out to the sabreurs that\ntheir score had been better, always having been\nthe other way around.\nIn the finals, the men faced St Andrews University and the women Cambridge University.\nFor the women Cambridge were known opponents from the Premier League, with only minor changes to the team, whereas St Andrews\nwere completely unknown to the men. Both\nhad the order foil, sabre, epee and fenced in\nparallel with the Sport Imperial leaders supporting from the stands.\nThe women won their foil match 45-21 and\nthe men repeated their result from the semi-final: 45-26. From here it continued, sabre being up next. The male sabreurs improved their\nscore from the previous match and won by\n45-20, leaving it to their epee team go get one\npoint to get the gold. For the women the challenge got slightly bigger, some of the fencers\nfor Cambridge being unknown. Nevertheless,\nthey stayed strong and won by 45-30, and the\nwomen were now 6 hits from becoming cham-pions. From this position, the competition was\nturned into something different. Both teams\nwould win, anything else would be a massive\nfailure, and the goal was now to win before\nthe other IC team did. The women\u2019s match\nstarted a bit earlier than the men\u2019s, meaning\nthat they\u2019d reached four hits by the time the\nguys started. While Alice was trying to get\nthe final hits Marcello was rushing it a bit too\nmuch in his excitement. Eventually Marcello\nmanaged to score the striking hit and both the\nleaders from Sport Imperial and both teams\nstarted cheering loudly. The girls had another\nchange of fencers before Emily ended the insecurity with another round of cheering. From\nhere, the girls almost gave up in their relief,\ncombined with tiredness and the knowledge\nof Cambridge being the only epee team they\nhad lost to. As their match finished 39-45 the\nfinal was over and the total score 123 \u2013 96 for\nImperial. Meanwhile the men were still at the\nend of their match. This one had been much\nmore even as St Andrews refused to let Imperial win with more than necessary. Challenging\nthem all the way to the end they brought it up\nto 44 \u2013 44 when Marcello put an end to it and\ngot the final point.

The final straw came at the end\nof last term, when a class was delayed\nby half an hour because the lecturer had\nboycotted petrol.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 06 MAY 2011 2\nBOOKS\nFELIX 25\nA maestro of modern literature\nD\navid Mitchell is a major figure in contemporary English literature. Two of his nov-els, number9dream and Cloud Atlas were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. His\nlatest book, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet follows the adventures\nof a young Dutch clerk in 18th Century Edo Japan in a tale of clash of cultures, cor-ruption, love and redemption set amongst a rich backdrop of an empire shut off from\nthe rest of the world. Guo Heng Chin had a chance to speak with David about The\nThousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet and his writing.\nWhat inspired you to write The Thousand\nAutumns of Jacob de Zoet?\nFinding Dejima in 1994 during a trip to Nagasaki. I was 25, and not yet published, nor\neven that disciplined about teaching myself\nhow to write, but when I came across the museum on the site of this partly reconstructed\noutpost of the Dutch East Indies Company, a\nsort of onboard Geiger-counter crackled, and\nI filled several pages of my notebook with\nnotes. About 12 years and 4 novels later, it\nwas time to bring \u2018My Dejima Book\u2019into land.\nDo you put in much of yourself or people\nyou know into the characters you create?\nYour own personality leaks into all your\ncharacters, no matter how you try to insulate them. Characters take DNA from other\nsources too \u2013 people you know, other fictional\ncharacters, but a lot from the creator. Jacob is\nprobably more principled than I am, and his\nfaith in God doesn\u2019t come from me, and his\nrectitude is less flexible than my own: on the\nother hand, sure, he spent a long time living\nin Japan, not always understanding what he\nwas seeing, and that's something I can certainly relate to.\nOne of the gems of the novel is the way you\ntransformed the lack of common language\nbetween the Japanese and Dutch characters and their effort to learn each other\u2019s\nlanguage into a treasure trove of wordplay.\nWhat gave you the idea for all those witty\npuns and humorous \u2018lost-in-translation\u2019\nmoments?\nWith the wordplay in A Thousand Autumns,\nit was a necessity. I realized why nobody had\never done a Dejima-Nagasaki novel before:\nthey (the Dutch and the Japanese) couldn\u2019t\nreally speak each other\u2019s language very well!\nLeiden University had the daily journals that\nall the Dutch East India Company\u2019s chief residents of Dejima kept and they were translated\ninto English. You can actually read what the\nproblems were on Dejima in 1798. One thing\nthey complained a lot is that \u201cNone of these\ntranslators speak Dutch! This is hopeless!\u201d\nEven if they can, they sometimes pretend not\nto speak Dutch. And it was technically illegal\nfor the Dutch to try to learn Japanese, but they\ndid because the Dutch were very ingenious\nlinguists.\nFor the first manuscript I made these tortu-ous, difficult subplots where I thought it would\nbe a good idea to have a couple of the [Japa-nese] translators smuggle themselves out and\ngone to Batavia [modern day Jakarta] to learn\nDutch, and they learned it really well and they\ncame back. So they at least they could speak\nDutch, and I had the same really implausible\nideas to increase the Dutch characters\u2019 level\nof spoken Japanese. Just so I can avoid the\nproblem. But of course readers are intelligent\npeople and they can tell when a book has been\nbent out of shape because the author is trying\nto dig himself out of a hole!\nThen I realized that this isn\u2019t a problem at\nall, it\u2019s actually an addition to the book. There\nis a sort of humour; there is a lot of potential\nin miscomprehension or incomprehension. So\nreally it wasn\u2019t an idea to use the wordplay of\nmutual language barriers, it was an act of sur-render, I gave up trying to avoid the problem.\nWhich authors would you cite as having inspired or influenced you?\nAlways a tricky one, literary genealogy. The\ncloser you look at the verb \u2018inspire\u2019, the foggier it gets, and \u2018influence\u2019 is a cause-effect\nrelationship I'd rather leave to anyone willing\nto spend time thinking about it. To do it myself seems a bit impure. But for whatever it's\nworth, the books I read as a kid which made me\nache to write in a similar vein were Ursula le\nGuin and Isaac Asimov, plus Susan Cooper,\nplus \u2018The Sword in the Stone\u2019, and some of\nPenelope Lively\u2019s children's books. At Uni:\nBorges, Calvino, John Fowles, Angela Carter\nand Kundera all floated my boat. It was the\n80s and unless you had POSTMODERNIST\nwritten on your face with a big marker pen,\nthe doors at my university (Kent) wouldn't\nactually open.\nIn more recent years I try to keep my diet\nmore omnivorous. I enjoy Sylvia Townshend\nWarner, Forster, the 19th century crew, Haruki Murakami, older-school Japanese writers\nlike Juni\u2019ichiro Tanizaki and Shusaku Endo.\nI never tire of re-reading Chekhov. He's\njust great. John Cheever, and an American\npoet James Wright. Primo Levi. Contemporaries whom I enjoy include Sarah Waters,\nMichel Faber, Hari Kunzru, Nadeem Aslam\nand AL Kennedy, but there are lots of others.\nOutside literature, I'm working through the\nbox-set of \u2018The Wire\u2019, too \u2013 it's a mighty\nachievement, and serves as a reminder to\nup my game. Oddly enough (or not) I think\nthat Kate Bush's songs work like short stories\nand mood poems. I don't know if she'd like to\nbe thought of as an honorary writer as well as\na singular musician, but that's how I do think\nof her. Mustn't forget Kazuo Ishiguro, either.\nAnd I\u2019ve just \u2018discovered\u2019 Anthony Trollope\n\u2013 \u2018The Way We Live Now\u2019is a gorgeous great\nhairy thing.\nUrsula le Guin and Asimov! Do you read\nmuch fantasy and sci-fi?\nNot so much, these days, but I've digested\na lot in my life, and as you know, once Science Fiction and Fantasy are absorbed into\nthe body they are there for good. Neil Gaiman\nis a superlative writer, I think. Ballard really\nhad something, too. I know \u20181984\u2019 well and\nthink about it often \u2013 perhaps the best-realized\npolitical novel in the canon. Mostly my SF\nis administered visually, in the form of box\nsets. I know my Borg from my Romulans, and\nunderstand why the joke \u201cHow many Doctor Who fans does it take to change a light-bulb? Only one, but he\u2019s sure that the previous light-bulb is better than the present one\" is\nfunny. The borders between mainstream and\ngenre fiction are getting hazy these days, and\nI think that's a good thing.\nDo you plan all aspects of your the story before you start writing or do you \u2018free write\u2019\nlike Stephen King?\nNot all aspects, no, because that would preclude the happy accidents, and happy accidents are often the best bits. If I \u2018free wrote\u2019\nI'd be afraid that I'd always make the same decision at the same junction, and so my novels\nwould come to resemble each other. I think of\na novel as a road-trip, where I set off at point\nA, will end at Z, and mean to pass through\npoints D, K, O, R and V, but how I get to and\nfrom those points is something I won't know\nuntil I'm en route. Furthermore \u2018Z\u2019 may look\nvery different when I get there to how I anticipated if beforehand. Mmm. This metaphor's\ngotten out of hand.\nLastly, any words for aspiring authors?\nThe crucial stuff you need to know you can\nonly know by writing. Get to it, and when\nyou look back at what you've read and think,\n\u2018Jeez, this is awful', know that that is prog-ress. And avoid sentences that have \u2018that that\u2019\nin them, though it is perfectly okay to begin a\nsentence with \u2018And\u2019 now and again.\nTwo-time Booker finalist David Mitchell talks about his latest book\n\u201cWhen I came across the\nmuseum on the site of this partly\nreconstructed outpost of the\nDutch East Indies Company, a\nsort of onboard Geiger-counter\ncrackled, and I filled several pages\nof my notebook with notes\u201d\n\n"

Suave, suited\nand darn right fit.\nConvenience for the poor?\nDana says: Samuel Furse explores why we dump our dosh in Greggs\nWhy this photo is not a true representation of Greggs: there is only one chav. In reality, they gather in herds...\n\u201cI am not going to wax\nlyrical about their wares\nin a Marks and Spencer\n\u2018food porn\u2019 advert\nsort of way\u201d\nI\nt is just fat pikeys that shop in Greggs.\nSurely? I mean, it must only be they\nwho demand an opening time of 0700\non weekdays, freshly-baked multi-grain\nloaves, Empire biscuits, and roasted\nchicken sandwiches complete with delicate\nslivers of red onion. Must be. There is no other\nanswer, clearly.\nThink for a moment, how often you buy\nlunch. We have all done it \u2013 either a result of\npoor planning the night before, greed, or because colleagues were going out to buy and\nit was just easier to go with the \u2018it\u2019 crowd. In\ncase you thought you were getting off lightly\nby being the last one to decide and appear as\nthe most reasonable-sounding, I am afraid that\nreason can easily be boiled down to simple la-ziness.\nIf you are thinking that you might do this\nmore often that you can remember, you might\nlike to consider the following:\n\u2013 Sandwiches now cost about \u00a32-3 per pack\non average. I want to eat two of these, and I\nam not alone;\n\u2013 A drink. Another \u00a31;\n\u2013 A chocolate bar or cupcake, something\nsweet, \u00a31-2, because, it is not a meal without\nsomething for dessert now is it?;\n\u2013 The coffee you had on the way in, \u00a32. Did\nyou think you had got away with that one?\nNice try: it costs money too.\nThat makes a monetary total in the region of\nno less than \u00a37. That is even if we take one off\nthe list for the sake of a conservative estimate,\nand because not everyone has two sandwiches\nand morning coffee from Moonquids-Caligula-Kingdom-coffee-cottage in the same day. \u00a37\nis not that much though. If it is once a week,\nthat makes \u00a3210 per year. On an Undergrad\nterm-table that is. If you are a postgraduate\nwho eats out like this 3-4 times a week, this is\nan annual bill of \u00a31,400. The average bursary\nof an Imperial College postgraduate is now approaching \u00a312.7k/annum.\nThis does go much further than sandwiches\nI am afraid. Would you spend \u00a35 on a packet\nof coffee that would make only 8 cups worth?\nOf course not. That works out to 63p/cup. Not\nso expensive compared to the \u00a32 one from Asteroidfrancs-Augustus-principality-whatever-coffee, though.\nYou may be wondering exactly why Gregg\u2019s\nis relevant though. Based on the opening para-Joe Black, I pay homage to you\nIt\u2019s not Brad I wanted to talk about really, though,\nit\u2019s the love of peanut butter. The legume delight.\nPeanut butter ice cream, as I discovered this\nweek is a heaven-sent tastebud delight. Spuntino,\nhidden behind panel windows and a wooden sign\nthat screams renovation more than a tapas bar,\nhas been a food blogging sensation for the past\ntwo months. Opening in March, and affiliated with\nits more sophisticated Venetian bars, Polpo and\nPolpetto, it offers simple Italian-American comfort\nfood such as \u2018Mac and Cheese\u2019 and the not-so-tiny \u2018Slider\u2019 burgers.

    "content": "FELIX\n20\nBook Review\nA R T S\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 06 MAY 2011\nThe Echo Chamber By Luke Williams\nLuke Williams\u2019 debut\nnovel, The Echo Chamber, is a beautifully\nwoven reflection on a\nlife of regret and unresolved identity. Across\ncontinents and gener-ations, our misunderstood protagonist Evie\nSteppman crosses\npaths with many remarkable people that\nserve to shape her his-tory, and the history of\nthe world. That wealth\nof cacophonous memories, heavy on our heroine\u2019s\nheart, is recounted through a curious medium:\nsound.\n\u2018Sometimes I have the feeling my memory is a\nmausoleum of broken sounds.\u2019 From page one, Evie\nSteppman laments her \u2018power of listening\u2019 that has\ndefined and haunted her since conception. She explains how, content in the womb, she resisted birth,\nleading to the death of her mother and to a childhood searching for the love of a reproachful father.\nIn the house where her father took his last breath\n\u2013 \u2018Inspired by the din in the attic, the sounds of my\npast begin to rise to a clamour\u2019 \u2013 Evie struggles\nto unleash her skeletons by writing her memoirs,\nalternating between fantasy tales and the histories\nof others as if to avoid committing to her own.\nIn rich detail, heavily reliant on acoustics, Evie\ndescribes her Lagos childhood in the dying days of\nthe British Empire. The characters surrounding her\nexpress their conflicting views about Nigeria with bitterness and racism on all sides. However, Evie grows\nup blissfully unaware of the racial tension. She and\nher father are optimistic that independence will usher in a \u2018new era for Nigeria\u2019. In reality the transition\nis rife with violence and the family flee to Scotland.\nAdulthood follows for Evie as a sequence of ups\nand downs. Her father descends into madness,\nand she meets her equally addled grandfather. She\nmimes and works behind the stage in Oxford, and\nattempts to document the sounds of the United\nStates. But most importantly her adult life revolves\naround a failed relationship with the beautiful actress Damaris. Evie\u2019s obsession with sound and\nDamaris\u2019s selfish character doom the relationship\nand appear to put a seal on Evie\u2019s romantic life.\nIronically, in her later years Evie starts to go deaf.\nThe struggle to document her history culminates in\nher plan to burn the completed memoir as well as\nthe artefacts of her past that fill the attic: diaries,\npostcards, maps of Lagos, \u2018a thousand useless\npossessions\u2019. As if hearing her memories \u2018hissing\nand snapping, cracking like crinoline\u2019 on the funeral\npyre will alleviate her regret.\nLuke Williams\u2019 new voice has the potential to be\ntreasured by many. His evocative first novel of fam-ily, memory, empire, love found and love lost, is in\nmany ways a triumph, but at times felt long-winded.\nHowever, Williams\u2019 narrator possesses a vibrant inner monologue to inspire many an immersive imagi-nation. The Echo Chamber may have sometimes\nlacked focus on the character of Evie, but remains\nan engaging tale of interwoven histories.\nHannah Tullett\nTate\u2019s attempt at redefining our vision of\na medium, watercolour, so commonly associated with amateurship and spinsters\ntrying to show off their artistic talent is\ndefinitely successful. After viewing this\nexhibit your conception of what can be\ndone with watercolours will have drastically changed, and you may leave with\na feeling of greater respect towards what\nmay seem at first an easy medium to mas-ter.\nThe nature of watercolours, fast to dry,\ncheap and portable, make them a very\nappropriate medium to do preliminary\nworks aimed towards preparing a greater\npiece. This is the place to which the academic art had relegated watercolour, as\na mere in-step towards the creation of a\ngreater work. Nonetheless, watercolours\nhave had other uses through human history not so closely related to our modern\nconception of art but to more prosaic.\nDetailed botanical drawings were lit by\nthe use of watercoulours providing XIX\ncentury scientists with a catalogue of the\nmost exotic creations of nature in faraway\nterritories. Topography did also rely on\nwatercolours to transmit and record the\nfruit of its study.\nThe exhibit is well-structured, the\nonlooker is guided firstly through the\nmost ancient uses of watercolours,\nwhich apart from the above mentioned\ninclude meticulously detailed portraits\nmade during the middle ages. Their\nopacity and exactitude will undermine\nthe preconception of watercolours as\nbeing only used in free hand romantic landscapes. Moving on through the\nrooms, a wide variety of landscapes is\ndisplayed. Turner\u2019s The Blue Rigi Sunrise is a coquette piece; one which has to\nbe approached to fully enjoy it. The size\nof the pieces, around the dimensions of\na sheet of paper, will stir the observer\nto move closer, creating a feeling of\nintimacy not usually achieved with the\ngreat oil masterpieces that dominate the\ncollection of most museums. Another\nremarkable piece is The Blue Night\nby Arthur Melville, where an uncommon vision of Venice is displayed: an\nintensely dark blue night surrounding\nthe warm red lights of the Most Serene\nRepublic.\nThe highlights of this exhibition are\nthe fact that it caters for a wide range of\ntastes, since as we move on more modern artwork is on display. A particularly\ndisturbing piece, The Cry Of The Gland\nby Jitish Kallat, greatly contrast with\nthe pre-Raphaelite gouache is it sided\nby; hence, there is no time for boredom\nor repetitiveness on this show. Another\nreason for the success of the exhibit is\nthe insight it provides into how watercolours are actually used. There is a room\nin which the technical advancements of\nthe technique are displayed chronologically as well as explanations of a few\ntechniques with paintings to exemplify\nthem. This room helps bridge the final\nproduct we admire to the obscure workings of the artist. Experiencing the challenge of creating an art piece yourself,\nin spite of all the dishonoured role of the\namateur, can be a fulfilling task which\ndefinitely helps to better understand art.\nIs it time to rethink the\nwatercolour painting?\nTate Britain challenges preconceptions about this medium\nRoc\u00edo Molina Atienza\nThe Blue Rigi Sunrise by J. M. W. Turner\n\u201cYour conception\nof watercolours will\ndrastically change\u201d\n\u2018Watercolour\u2019\nat Tate Britain\nuntil 21\nAugust.\n\u00a310.90 with\nstudent card\nCheck out our new Books\nsection on Page 24!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n14\nThe Best of the Rest\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Feroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 06 may 2011\nDell Streak 7\nDell\u2019s own contribution to the Easter tablet bonanza\nhas unfortunately not gone the way the company\nwould have liked. The Streak 7, 2 inches wider\nthan it\u2019s older brother the Streak, was positioned\nby Dell as a firm step into the tablet market after\nthe neither-here-nor-there Streak. Disappointingly\nhowever, the device sports the same resolution as\nthe 5-inch Streak, with reviewers reporting that you\ncan see individual pixels on the screen from normal viewing angles. With reviewers also panning its\npoor battery life and lack of USB charging options it\nseems as if Dell has merely repackaged the Streak\nwith a bigger screen and little else. So what does\nthe Streak 7 have going for it? Price and price alone\n\u2013 going at \u00a3299 it\u2019s one of the cheapest 7-inch tablets out there.\nThe Motorola Xoom is by all reviewer\u2019s accounts a\nwell designed product that achieves what it promises on the tin, but its Achilles heel lies in the premium that Motorola expects you to pay for it. Sporting Android\u2019s spanking new Honeycomb operating\nsystem, the Xoom can do everything the iPad 2 can,\nwith the added bonus of native Flash support and\npossibly future 4G expansion. Where it fails, as\nmost reviewers seem to be complaining, seems to\nbe in the general lack of apps for tablets in the Android market. While this is a situation that\u2019s bound\nto improve given time, the Xoom\u2019s hefty price tag of\naround \u00a3480 (WiFi only) to \u00a3560 (WiFi+3G) means\nit\u2019s wise to remember there are other tablets out\nthere (and more coming soon) that will probably offer more bang for your buck.\nMotorola Xoom\nHave your cake and eat it too\nThis Easter heralded a slew of new tablet an-nouncements, and the brightest of the latest\ngeneration of iPad contenders finally brought\nsome variety and innovation to the tablet mar-ket. One of the best of these was the Eee Pad\nTransformer, a device that combines ASUS\u2019s\nnetbook prowess and a bit of detachable-screen goodness to offer a tablet experience\nthat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sacrificing on\nproductivity.\nFelix was present at the UK release of the de-vice, and we managed to get a first hand look at\nwhat looks like one of the strongest iPad alternatives to hit our shores yet. At first glance, the\nEee Pad appears to be a simple netbook, but\nits selling point revolves around a clasp that\nallows you to pull away at the screen and use\nit independently as a tablet in it\u2019s own right.\nThe Transformer could prove a much more\nconvenient way to get your music and documents into university without having to drag\nyour laptop the distance, while keeping a neat\nkeyboard and touchpad arrangement at home.\nASUS hasn\u2019t gone to town on the design of\nthe tablet, but the dark brown metal casing it\ncomes in feels solid to the hand and decidedly high quality. The keyboard itself is a neat\nchiclet-layout offering and the combination of\na 1080p screen resolution and the manifold\ninput options (even including multi-touch on\nthe touchpad) makes the Transformer a remarkably versatile device. The response time\nbetween slotting the screen into the dock and\nbeing able to use the keyboard is virtually un-noticeable, which makes the experience of using the tablet as seamless as ASUS promises.\nThe display, boasting the IPS LCD technology that promises power saving over standard\nLCDs, was deliciously sharp.\nOn the inside, the Transformer is very com-petitive, sporting the massively popular Tegra\n2 dual-core chip, 1GB of RAM and 16/32GB\nof storage (with microSD expandability if you\nrequire it). One of the most useful features of\nFeroz Salam\nthe device stems from its battery life. While\nthe tablet alone offers 8 hours of performance,\nASUS has also managed to cram a supplementary battery into the keyboard that activates\nwhen you slot the tablet into it that adds another 8 hours, taking it\u2019s total performance to\na solid 16 hours.\nOn the software side, the Transformer was\nwidely touted as the first tablet to land in the\nUK sporting Google\u2019s Honeycomb version of\nthe Android operating system. The tablet-ori-ented OS was reported to offer a much better\nexperience than prior Android tablet offerings,\nand it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The UI looks a lot\nbetter now that it\u2019s been calibrated for a wider screen, and ASUS has added just the right\nnumber of widgets to improve the device without causing it to look overburdened.\nThat said, one of the more puzzling moments\nduring the hands-on came when I tried to move\nbetween home screens on the device and it\nstopped responding completely for a few sec-onds, both in my hands and those of the dem-onstrator. Delayed responsiveness is an issue\nthat has been reported by others reviewing the\ndevice. While it didn\u2019t kill my experience with\nthe device, I suspect it\u2019s something that could\nbuild into a nuisance if it happens too often.\nIf the Transformer\u2019s solid construction and\nneat keyboard arrangement aren\u2019t enough to\ndrag you away from the iPad, you might just\nbe convinced by the price. Starting at \u00a3379 for\nthe tablet itself and \u00a3429 with the keyboard\ndock, it\u2019s a highly competitive offer from\nASUS for a product that\u2019s pulling a Jekyll and\nHyde act surprisingly well. It\u2019s worth keeping\nin mind, though, that 3G isn\u2019t offered on the\ndevice yet.\nASUS has turned out a solid, competetively\npriced product that carves out its own niche in\nwhat\u2019s quickly becoming a crowded market.\nThe software on the device did seem a bit sluggish at times, but considering the regularity of\nupdates it\u2019s possible that the issues have been\nfixed at the time of writing. If you\u2019re a student\non a tight budget who needs the flexibility of a\nfull keyboard but also wants to pick up a tablet\non the cheap, this is the perfect device for you.\nASUS Eee Slate: tablet workhorse\nCurrently, the tablet market is undeniably\ndominated by Apple, with Google\u2019s Android\nlooking to take some share with Honeycomb.\nThe tablet OS that has seen far less of the limelight so far however is Windows 7. Known of\ncourse as a desktop and laptop OS, it\u2019s also\nperfectly useable on a tablet, and this is what\nthe Asus EEE Slate EP121 brings to the table.\nAs Windows is so associated with that desk-top/laptop usage paradigm, you would expect\na tablet that was to use it to its full effect to\npack some punch, and on paper, the EEE Slate\ncertainly looks to be shaping up. The tablet\nholds an Intel i5 dual core 1.3GHz mobile pro-cessor, sporting Hyper-Threading and Turbo\nBoost, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a 64GB solid\nstate drive, which is an impressive specifica-tion. It\u2019s got the room for all of that though, as\nit has a 12 inch capacitive touchscreen and is\nalmost three quarters of an inch thick. And at\nalmost 1.2kg, this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re going to forget is in your pocket.\nWith that screen though, you also get a digi-tising layer and a stylus to go with it, allowing\nfor easy note-taking and similar tasks as well\nas the ability to draw on the EEE Slate like a\ngraphics tablet, with what you\u2019re drawing right\nunder your pen. This brings the tablet into a\ndifferent niche, especially when matched with\nthe ability to run full Windows applications,\nsuch as Photoshop.\nThe EEE Slate isn\u2019t trying to compete with\nthe iPad on its home turf. To really prove this\npoint, there is no 3G version of the tablet, so\nAsus isn\u2019t trying to market this to the \u201csurf-onthe-go\u201d consumer. I can easily see the majority\nof those who buy this tablet being businesspeople \u2013 taking notes in meetings and working\non software they\u2019re used to on their commute.\nAnd when they get to the office, they can easily transfer their files to their main PC and continue work.\nOn the other hand, the fact that this tablet almost acts like a mini, touchscreen laptop means\nthat you can\u2019t expect a huge battery life. But for\nthose using it for meetings and short journeys,\nthis probably won\u2019t be an issue, and the convenience of using the programs you\u2019re used to\non the go will be a huge advantage. Therefore,\ndespite a fairly hefty price tag, I can see the\nEEE Slate selling, and possibly bringing some\nof that limelight to Microsoft\u2019s offering.\nChris Bowers\n\n"

But for the sake of a game, it seems, the\ngovernment has been bulldozing such areas\nand forcing out their long-standing residents\nin favour of, amongst other things, car parks.\nIt is a move that is anticipated to be replicated in several Brazilian cities, and already\nhas alarm bells ringing for Amnesty International, who are currently meeting with activists in Rio. The effects will be devastating for\nthe hundreds of thousands across the country\nwho will be affected For years families have\nworked hard on building the community in\nsuch favelas, and in the space of days have\nwatched them crumble for the sake of football\nand the Olympic games.\nCurrent campaigning efforts by residents\nprotesting the illegal forced evictions are as\nof yet making little progress: it seems that for\nnow the children and elderly waiting to be rehoused will have to put up with the rats and\nwhatever else the desiccated area is attracting.\nHopefully this will change with added pressure from high pro\ufb01le groups like Amnesty.\nI\u2019m not suggesting we \ufb02y out to Rio and\nform a human chain, but it should be food for\nthought. Most of us care to at least to some extent whether our clothes and food are produced\nin an ethical manner, and in an age of increasing\nmoral consciousness, perhaps some consideration here wouldn\u2019t put us out all too much.\nA weekend in scenic Prague\nWorld Cup woes for the residents of Rio\nChris Richardson\n\u201cNot many people know this, but the Nazis had\nlined the tunnels underneath Prague with dynamite and were prepared to destroy it as they\nretreated in the face of the Red Army. Were it\nnot for a small group of Russian monarchists\nwho opposed them for 5 days and managed to\nfoil the plot, all of Prague\u2019s beauty wouldn\u2019t\nexist.\u201d We sipped our tea as Milo\u0161 continued\nhis story. \u201cAnd are they remembered today?\nThere\u2019s a small memorial to them, about knee-high, somewhere in the city. That\u2019s justice for\nyou.\u201d\nAs we sat in Milo\u0161 Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s tiny antique\nshop hidden in a side street off the old town\nsquare, hearing stories of the city of Prague\nand its past, there was a feeling of unspoiled\nnovelty, as if we have found something truly\nnew and special. However, it was not just the\nsmiling, bespectacled old man who generated\nthis impression \u2013 the whole city in cold grey\nFebruary is like a \ufb02ower waiting to blossom.\nAll its treasures are there, aching to be discov-ered.\nThe treasures are truly endless. The obvious,\nbut deservedly revered, Charles\u2019 Bridge and\nPrague Castle, both jewels of the gothic style,\ncannot be missed. There are also countless museums showing an incredible variety of exhibi-tions: on the old town square an exhibition of\nwatch-making including information about the\nPrague Orloj (the 600 year old astronomical\nclock) faces a building housing photos and letters documenting the life of Salvador Dali. Not\na stone\u2019s throw away is the Sex machine museum featuring, among its many quirky exhib-its, a pornographic \ufb01lm from 1925, allegedly\ncommissioned by King Alfonso XII of Spain.\nAll of these venues and many more accept an\nImperial College card for a student discount,\nusually in the region of 40%.\nPrague boasts many glorious landmarks, but\nequally it hides none of the scars of its history.\nIn Wenceslas square stands the memorial to\nstudent Jan Palach, who burnt himself alive in\nprotest of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia\nby the Soviet Union. Further north in the Spanish synagogue in Josefov, the Jewish Museum\nof Prague presents an informative but chilling\naccount of the lives of Czech Jews during the\nSecond World War.\nAfter a day\u2019s walking on the cobbled streets\nit was time to indulge in an altogether different form of tourism. In Kozi street, the restaurant Kozi\u010dka boasts a wide range of European\nfood including Czech specialties such as beef\ngoulash with potato pancakes in an enviable\nenvironment. The smoky cellar look creates\nan effect of smells, sights and sounds merging into one living hubbub and the food is well\nworth the price, with two eating a two course\nmeal with drinks for about \u00a325. Naturally, the\nselection of beers on tap is large: Svijany is\nrecommended, whilst Kozel and Staropramen\nare ubiquitous. A pint shouldn\u2019t be bought for\nmore than \u00a31.50.\nNot far from the old town square is Potrefen\u00e1 Husa, a branded pub chain run by Staropramen brewery that is also hot on the food\nfront. Set in a more modern, bar-like ambience\nit offers an equally appetizing menu but a more\nrestricted choice of lagers. Staropramen of all\nvarieties are de\ufb01nitely worth a try, especially\nStaropramen Dark (Cern\u00fd).\nDespite only spending 2 days in Prague, the\nexperience has succeeded in embedding in our\nhearts a desire to return there many more times\n\u2013 I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be even prettier in the Spring!\nMaksim Mijovic\n\u201cThe effects will\nbe devastating\nfor hundreds of\nthousands across the\ncountry\u201d\nIf you squint into the distance you can almost see the final resting place of Bin Laden\n\u201cGo compare!

The demonstration was in\nprotest at an Ethiopian government conference being held in the Great Hall on Saturday\n16th April. In the confusion that followed the\nalarm, protesters breached police barriers and\nattempted to storm the Sherfield building.\nAlmost fifty people gathered to stage a demonstration against the Ethiopian government,\nwhich they accuse of human rights abuses.\nProtesters were initially penned near the biochemistry building, with a police guard limited to only a handful of officers. At 2.43pm, a\nbreak glass panel was smashed in the southern\nentrance foyer of the Sherfield building, triggering the fire alarm. The central library, which\nwas packed with students revising for summer-term exams, was evacuated and hundreds of\nstudents spilled out onto the Queen\u2019s lawn. In\nthe commotion, protesters broke past police\nbarriers and tried to enter the Sherfield building where the conference was taking place.\nPolice officers blocked protesters at the entrance to the building and more officers arrived\nat the scene shortly after. Hundreds of evacuated students gathered to watch the demonstration outside Sherfield, with some complaining\nabout the disruption to their revision. The conference was cancelled due to the escalation of\nthe protests and all of the delegates left campus\nfor safety reasons. The protesters followed to\nthe Ethiopian embassy on Exhibition Road to\ncontinue their demonstration. The library was\neventually re-opened for students at 3.10pm,\nafter almost half an hour of disorder, when college security officers reset the broken alarm\npanel. The identity of the perpetrator who triggered the fire alarm is not known.\nA delegation of Ethiopian government offi-cials, headed by Minister for the Civil Service,\nAto Juneidi Sado, attended the conference on\nthe Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) for\nEthiopia. The Network Against Injustice and\nRepression in Ethiopia organised Saturday\u2019s\ndemonstration. Similar demonstrations, organised by affiliated groups, have led to the cancellation of GTP conferences held at two other\nwestern universities in recent months.\nEthiopia received 700,000 tonnes of food\nand \u00a31.8bn in humanitarian aid last year\nalone, more than almost any other country in\nthe world. However, demonstrators claim that\nthe Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government is illegally\nmisusing it, by refusing aid to supporters of\nthe political opposition. Their allegations are\nsupported by Human Rights Watch, which has\nwarned of an \u2018aid-politics trap\u2019 in Ethiopia.\nThe Ethiopian government denies any misuse\nof humanitarian aid.\nMost of the students that gathered to watch\nthe protests had not previously been aware of\nthe situation in Ethiopia, and took an interest\nfor the first time. A second year ISE student\nsaid it seemed like \u201ca worthwhile cause\u201d and\nthat \u201cacademic institutions can\u2019t become puppets to a political agenda.\u201d However, another\nstudent complained, \u201cwe don\u2019t know both\nsides of the story\u201d. Many students were unhappy with the distraction from revision and\ncrowded around the library entrance, starting a\nsmall demonstration of their own.\nProtesters at the demonstration were of all\nages, and included many women and children.\nThey waved Ethiopian flags and raised placards that read, \u201cGreat Britain Stop! Development Aid will be wasted!\u201d One woman held a\npicture of the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles\nZenawi, with a swastika printed on his face.\nA protester, who had fled from the Ogaden\nregion of the country to the UK, called the\ncollege \u201cnaive\u201d for allowing the use of their\nfacilities for the conference. On behalf of the\nprotesters, he told Felix, \u201cwe condemn Imperial College for allowing these killers to meet\nhere.\u201d He wished to remain anonymous for\nfear of retribution on his family, still living in\nEthiopia. Later on, the same man said that to-day, \u201cthe truth prevailed.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Ethiopian embassy\nclaimed, \u201csome of them [the protesters] are allied to terrorist organisations\u201d and cited a flag\nraised at the protest that they attributed to a rebel\ninsurgency group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). However, a key organiser of\nthe demonstration refuted these claims and said\nthat the flag belonged to the Ogaden region and\nits people, rather than just the ONLF.\nThe embassy\u2019s spokesperson also described\nSaturday\u2019s protest as a \u201cvery violent demonstration\u201d, but failed to provide evidence to support this. There were no reports of violence at\nthe demonstration on campus.\nEthiopian satellite television covered the\ndemonstration and broadcast the events on\ncampus live worldwide.\nA spokesperson for the college told Felix,\n\u201cImperial runs conference facilities that are\nbooked by a wide range of organisations for\nprivate events every year. A booking of these\nfacilities carries no endorsement by the College of the aims and opinions of the event organisers.\u201d\nChaos at campus demonstration\nPolice prevent protestors from storming Sherfield\nBen Scally\nThe football team has been fined \u00a3100 by the Amateur Football Association (AFA) after a fight broke\nout at the 19th of March ULU Cup Final with UCL.\nThe club was charged with failing to control its sup-porters, to which they pleaded guilty, and one indi-vidual, whose case has yet to be heard, has been\ncharged with assault on a UCL player.\nThe fight is believed to have broken out towards\nthe end of the match between a small group of\nImperial fans and UCL substitutes. Simon Kilroy,\nImperial club captain, said that he didn\u2019t condone\n\u201cany act of violence or physical intimidation perpetrated by anybody associated\u201d with the football\nclub and that it was \u201cdisappointing that the actions\nof small minority of both universities have marred\nthe game\u201d.\nHe added that he and other members of the\nfootball club committee \u201cworked continuously with\nthose inside and outside of the university to resolve the issue\u201d.\nAccounts of the violence differ, with Mr. Kilroy\nsaying that the UCL substitutes turned a verbal\nconfrontation into a physical altercation, while UCL\nclub captain Mike Tetstall said that the trigger was\nwhen an Imperial fan slapped a UCL substitute\u2019s\nhead. It is believed that one of the Imperial fans\ninvolved in the fight was wearing a red morph suit.\nMr Tetstall laid the blame entirely at the feet of\nImperial saying, \u201cthe blame for the incident has to\nfall on the Imperial fans who went out of their way\nto start trouble\u201d\nIn addition to the sanctions imposed by the\nAmateur Football Association, Sport Imperial has\nbanned two Imperial Football Club members from\nall Sport Imperial facilities for life, meaning that\nthey will not be able to play any sport at Imperial again. One of these club members is facing a\ncharge for assault from the AFA. The sanctions for\nthat member could include a complete ban or a\nfine.\nTwo other club members have been banned from\nSport Imperial facilities until the 1st October 2011.\nSport Imperial have also removed all funding from\nthe football club for next year, although this is\nmainly in the form of equipment like balls, so will\nnot affect the club\u2019s activities adversely. Sport Imperial did not return a request for comment.\nThe AFA have not issued any charges against UCL\nFootball Club or its members.\nThe final was won 3-2 by Imperial.\nKadhim Shubber\nBen Scally\nJames Pope Michiel Blokzijl\nSome students were unimpressed with\nhaving their revision disrupted Police reinforcements arrive\n\u201cTwo football club members\nhave been banned from playing\nsport at Imperial again\u201d\nRead the full match report in the Sports section,\nbeginning on the back page.\n\n"

Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin smokin bin Laden, more\ncommonly known as \u2018Osie\u2019 to his closest\nfriends, was savagely murdered by a bunch of\nseals on the morning of May 2nd, 2011. Osie\nwas just having his morning \u2018Bonne Maman\nWild Blueberry Conserve\u2019 on toast and catching up on the latest developments in \u2018The only\nway is Islamabad\u2019, which he had sky-plussed,\nwhen he was rudely interrupted by a huge\nseal disguised as a travelling salesman. Midway through browsing the seal\u2019s selection of\nmarigold gloves and Scotch-Brite\u2122 scourers,\nit suddenly dawned on Osie that something\nwasn\u2019t quite right. Before he had time to say\n\u201cThese low-grade rubber latex knock-off\ngloves wouldn\u2019t last two plates\u201d, twenty five\nHawaiian warrior-monk seals belly-flopped\nfrom a Chinook into his outdoor pool, which\nwas commissioned during his bid for the\n2016 Olympics. The seals stampeded/rolled\nthrough Osie\u2019s French windows and pulled out\ntheir battle rifles.\nHeroically, Osie utilised his nearest and\nleast-attractive wife as a human shield and survived the first barrage of gunfire. Using this\ningenious wife-shield tactic, Osie managed to\nhold his ground for at least fourteen seconds\nuntil he was down to his last wife. With a heavy\nheart, Osie bravely stood behind his 15th and\nmost attractive lover, whilst he tried to think\nof a plan B. As the seals were all reloading,\nOsie took his chance and double-back-flipped\nbehind his Caliph-sized bed to grab his AK47. \u201cAs long you as you live under my ocean,\nyou\u2019ll live by my rules!\u2019\u2019 shouted Osie. The\nseals were so taken aback by this unexpected\nquote from Disney\u2019s \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 that\nthey momentarily lost concentration and Osie\nunloaded rounds of indiscriminate fire towards\nthose fucking asshole seals.\nIf poor Osie had watched the Blue Planet\nepisode on Hawaiian monk seals, which he\nhad sky-plussed, then he would have known\nthat the species are notorious for their bul-let-proof blubber. As Osie lay cradled in the\narms of the traveling salesman seal with 25\nbullets in his body and head, he managed to\nsay one last thing before his final breath\u2026\n\u201cTell Cleggman it was me all along\u2026 I stole\nhis Petis filous from the fridge... lol\u201d.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 06 may 2011 27\nGAMES\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH\nello Felix readers, Cave\nJohnson here, founder\nand CEO of Aperture\nScience. Now I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019re all wondering,\n\u201cCave, why are you writing about Portal 2? Why are you breaking the fourth\nwall?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you why, it\u2019s because I\u2019m\nCave Johnson and I don\u2019t let silly little\nthings like rules and regulations get in\nMY way. I\u2019ll do whatever I damn well\nplease and damn the consequences.\nHere at Aperture we believe in striving for the best. We took the original\nPortal and thought, \u2018What would make\nthis bigger? Better? BOLDER?\u2019 And\nlet me tell you, THAT was a hefty chal-lenge. Multi-award-winning product,\nseamless design, revolutionary game-play, it had our best eggheads scratching their shining bald domes for hours.\nThey came back and said, \u201cCave, we\ncan\u2019t make this game better. Please\ndon\u2019t fire us.\u201d Did it anyway, no room\nfor failures here. Got some smarter guys\nin, cranked out Portal 2.\nScience has proven that short games\nare bad, no two ways about it, so we\nmade Portal 2 even longer than Portal.\nTwice as long in fact. If you\u2019re dim witted it might even take you three times as\nlong, maybe more, we don\u2019t know. We\nat Aperture only test with the best of the\nbest, no dunces allowed.\n\u201cWhat about story Cave? Have you\nskimped on that?\u201d Who do you think we\nare, Black Mesa? Of course we haven\u2019t\nskimped on story. Portal 2 has at least\n65% more story than Portal 2, and you\ncan go ahead and quote me on that\n(Disclaimer from the suits in PR: quoting me on that WILL result in a court\ninjunction). It\u2019s got thrills, twists and\nturns and so much action it\u2019ll make the\nsappier amongst you soil your diapers.\nNo, seriously, our story writers have\ntold me those of you with weak hearts\nneed to stay away from this game. We\nreally can\u2019t afford another lawsuit.\nWe\u2019ve also gone ahead and thrown in\nsome new gameplay elements. I don\u2019t\npay my lab boys $100,000 a year just to\nsit on their thumbs and suck up coffee.\nNo sir, Cave Johnson makes sure my\nboys work ten hours a day, seven days\na week to churn out fresh new chal-lenges. If they get exhausted, fire them\nand bring in new guys, simple as. We\u2019ve\ngot asbestos funnels, lasers, hard-light\nbridges, plates that fling you about the\nroom and more dynamic surface-coat-ing gels than you have fingers (provided\nyou only have two fingers, that is). All\nof these have been proven to be 100%\nsafe for human use! (A note from the\nboys in the lab says that Aperture Science takes absolutely no responsibility\nfor any damage or injury that probably\nwill occur when you use our products).\nFact \u2013 the key to any successful co-op-erative test is trust. Now we understand\nyou can\u2019t just trust anyone. Hell, I trust\nthe next man just as far as I could throw\nhim. Turn around, next minute he\u2019s stabbing you in the back or pushing you into\na crusher. Boom, dead, end of story. The\nsolution? ROBOTS. Not only do robots\ngive you a guaranteed six extra seconds\nof co-operation versus human subjects,\nyou can\u2019t kill \u2018em. Just try, totally im-possible. Perfect solution to co-operative\ntesting. We\u2019ve gone and designed thirty\nfive new test chambers, and all require\nthe use of two sets of portals and participants to complete successfully. If you\nmanage to do it alone I will personally\ncome to YOUR door and refund you the\ncost of the game, provided we haven\u2019t\nalready spent it.\nNow we\u2019ve been receiving some complaints of late. Normally I\u2019d respond to\nthese in the usual way and throw them\ndown into the incinerator, but our PR\ndepartment has somehow managed to\nconvince me to try and tackle some of\nthese issues head-on. Boost the company profile or some junk like that. One of\nthe biggest complaints we\u2019ve been getting from you big babies is the game\u2019s\nlength. Stop and smell the ROSES peo-ple! I didn\u2019t spend thousands of dollars\nout of my own damn pocket to bring in\nwriters and voice actors and only have\none-tenth of their dialogue listened to!\nSlow down, open your eyes and ears,\nit\u2019s not like you young people have anything better to do besides watching pornography or washing your hair anyway.\nIf you moaning minnies are STILL\ngoing on, guess what? This summer\nwe\u2019ll be giving you all FREE extra\ncontent. You hear that over your blubberin\u2019 and bawlin\u2019? FREE STUFF.\nWould Black Mesa do that? Hell no\nthey wouldn\u2019t! New levels, new chal-lenges, new leader boards, all for noth-ing, NOTHING. I had to fire HALF MY\nSTAFF just to afford this. Are you still\ncrying now? I should damn well hope\nnot! Why the hell am I even answering\nthese God-damn letters, don\u2019t you think\nI have better things to do?!\nSo anyway I had a meeting with PR\nand Carol, and they said that I ought\nto just go right ahead and chuck those\nletters down the incinerator chute. Best\nthing for \u2018em if you ask me. To sum up,\nmore challenges, more story, more fun.\nJust slow down and if we\u2019ve not filed\nfor bankruptcy we\u2019ll be getting out\nsome more test chambers this summer.\nCave Johnson, we\u2019re done here.\nDictated but not read to Laurence\nPope.\nIt\u2019s been a frustrating fortnight for Playstation 3 owners everywhere. PlayStation Network, the service used to play\nonline on the PS3, was closed almost\ntwo weeks ago leaving gamers without\naccess to any online content or multiplayer games. It was revealed that the\nservice was closed not for maintenance\nbut as an emergency security measure.\nSony\u2019s PSN servers were the target\nof a successful malicious attack by unknown hackers, who compromised PSN\nservers and made off with personal de-tails, including passwords and e-mail\naddresses, from over 77 million PSN\naccounts. Included in the data stolen\nis all 9 million accounts registered in\nthe UK. Further information was also\nstolen from the servers of Sony Online\nEntertainment, a PC gaming service\nwhich runs the likes of EverQuest and\nDC Universe Online, where the hackers accessed an \u2018outdated\u2019 database\nfrom 2007, containing 12,700 credit\ncard numbers in addition to a further\n24 million usernames and passwords.\nAlthough Sony has confirmed that only\n900 of these cards are still within the\nexpiry date, it has quite rightly advised\nall users to pay special attention to their\nstatements. The internet has been awash\nwith rumours that credit card data is\nnow up for sale to the highest bidder\nafter Sony rejected a deal to buy it back.\nAlthough specific details on the attack have not yet been released, the\nbasics of the procedure used to gain\naccess to PSN servers have now come\nto light. It was revealed a vulnerability\nwith the PSN application server, sitting between the web server and the\ndatabase, allowed the hackers to inject\nmalicious code. Once they were inside\nthe internal PSN network, they attacked\nthe database server and gained access\nrights to the databases. Some commentators have claimed that the vulnerability was due to the servers using\nan out-dated version of Red Hat Linux\nthat hadn\u2019t been updated with security\nfixes, whilst others claim that the intrusion was an inside job by disgruntled\nemployees recently laid off in massive\njob cuts at the company.\nSony has announced that it aims to\nget fundamental PSN services \u2013 that\u2019s\nonline play, account management, chat\nand PlayStation Home \u2013 up and running\nbefore the end of the weekend, no doubt\nto coincide with peak revision/pro-crastination time for Imperial students.\nPS3 users will have to apply a mandatory update to their console and will be\nforced to change their password as they\nlog into PSN, but this option is only\navailable on the console on which they\noriginally created the account in order\nto prevent anyone with access to the\nhacked data from doing the same. In the\nevent that this console is unavailable,\nusers can use a verified e-mail address\nto change the password instead, underlining the need for any PSN users that\nre-use their passwords on other sites to\nchange them as quickly as possible.\nIn what is surely a move to prevent as\nmany disloyal PlayStationers from turning to Bad Billy Gates and his Xbox as\nthey can, Sony are also going to be offering a \u2018Welcome Back\u2019package of treats.\nEvery user will receive 30 days free access to \u2018PlayStation+\u2019, PSN\u2019s premium\npay-only service, and there will also be\na selection of free content available that\nhas yet to be announced. Rumours have\nalso surfaced that Sony will be slashing\nthe price of PS3 consoles worldwide at\naround the same time.\nPortal 2? Like Portal but better, dummy!\nCEO Cave Johnson on why you should hand over your money\nDespite what it might look like, these robots are programmed for something other than interpretive dance\nService stoppage since Sony server security scandal\nSimon Worthington\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n18\nCOM M ENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 06 may 2011\nT\nhe Summer Ball is once\nmore drawing ever closer.\nThe time when the girls get\nto wear expensive dresses,\nand the guys get to wear\ntuxedos with a real bowtie, (not one of\nthose pre\u2013tied ones, which don\u2019t allow\nyou to wear it with the knot undone for\nthat cool after party look). But wait,\nwhat\u2019s that in the sky? Is it a bird? Is\nit a plane? Yes, it is a plane. It\u2019s actually several planes doing a flyby for\nthe Royal Wedding, but the plane I was\nreferring to is the metaphorical one behind them. It\u2019s here to drop a bomb, a\nmetaphorical bomb; this year the Summer Ball isn\u2019t officially black tie.\nThe decision to not officially make\nthe summer ball a black tie event has\ncaused about as much debate as the AV\nreferendum. If you don\u2019t get that reference then basically that\u2019s a referendum\nthat, no matter what way you vote, will\nliterally end in Nick Griffin being personally called upon to choose who the\nnext Prime Minister is. He will say Donald Trump and all of the UK\u2019s GDP will\nbe put into trying to disprove Obama\u2019s\nbirth certificate (Sorry, a bit off topic\nthere. This just shows the harm revision\ndoes to my mind).\nThis year the dress code for the Summer Ball is \u2018whatever you think is best\u2019,\nand that caused some debate. There are\nobvious solutions to stop the debate. The\nfirst being just change the bit on the logo/\nevent invites that says \u2018whatever you\nthink is best\u2019 to \u2018black tie.\u2019 You could\nalso say \u2018why don\u2019t you just wear black\ntie anyway, you arsehole.\u2019You shouldn\u2019t\nsay that, as it is unnecessarily rude. Your\npoint still stands though. When you read\nthe two back-to-back it\u2019s clear that they\nare just swings and roundabouts. So here\nis my advice to you \u2013 if you want to wear\nblack tie, do it.\nIt is an old saying, probably, that it\nis better to be overdressed than under-dressed. Think about it guys, how many\nwomen have you heard say that George\nClooney needs to tone it down on the\nstylish, suave suits as they make him re-pulsive. What about James Bond? You\nthink he\u2019d be a top secret agent if he\nwalked around in shorts, flip-flops and a\nhat that \u2018makes him look well indie and\nunique\u2019. Now any women reading this,\nhow many guys said that Pippa Middleton was a bit too dressed up at the Royal\nWedding. I\u2019ll tell you how many, none.\nShe even got an appreciation group on\nFacebook, and so could you.\nAnother change you probably didn\u2019t\nnotice or care about is that this year it\nis not just an Imperial event. It\u2019s joint\nwith other universities, although it is\nheld at Imperial. This is actually not a\nbad idea. If you think about it, getting\nsome mixing of universities and more\npeople could only be a good thing.\nThere is a minor flaw though. Now, call\nme sceptical, but I doubt many people\nfrom the other universities will actually\nbother coming. No offense to the Union,\nbut we haven\u2019t exactly got a reputation\nfor throwing amazing parties. Although\nI don\u2019t mind that other universities\nwon\u2019t be there, you can\u2019t force people\nto come. I guess it means we get more\nmoney for the Summer Ball, so why\nnot?\nThe ticket prices are \u00a340 if you buy\nthem this week, with an extra \u00a35 for the\nA load of balls\nafter party in Metric. I haven\u2019t heard\nanyone complain about the price but\nI\u2019m sure someone somewhere will. If\nyou ask me the cost is pretty reasona-ble, considering the length of the event.\nThink about Cambridge, the May Ball\ntickets are usually about \u00a3100. They do\nhave open bar, but still, with the wonders of pre-lash, ours will end up cheap-er. If you are complaining about the extra \u00a35, then good luck going to a club\nand getting in for that. I guess it\u2019s like\nSpotify \u2013 you want the music, but don\u2019t\nwant to pay. Although I have already\nlocked myself out of songs on Spotify,\nso fuck you Spotify.\nI will end this by borrowing a phrase\nfrom Angry Geek. It\u2019s not that I love or\ndon\u2019t love black tie being officially a\ndress code \u2013 it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t give a\nfuck. Once more, if you want to wear it,\nwear it. I will be. If you want to come\nover and thank me for my wisdom,\nplease do. I\u2019ll be the guy with my bow-tie undone surrounded by women telling\nme I look suave.\nWear whatever you want to the Summer Ball \u2013 I will\nTim Arbabzadah\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nFine I\u2019ll wear black tie, but I draw the line at monochrome\n\u201c\ny\ny\ne\ne\ne\n\u201c\nine at monochrome\n\u201d\nThink about it guys, how many\nwomen have you heard say that\nGeorge Clooney needs to tone\nit down on the stylish suits?\nBen Kennedy\n\u201cHere is my advice\nto you: if you want to\nwear black tie, do it.\u201d\nThere has been a great hullaballoo about the\nSummer Ball. The old adage that the more\ntrivial the matter, the more vicious the invective has been proved true once again by the\narguments over the changes to the Summer\nBall. Or Summer Festival, as it should probably now be called. Whilst students at other\nuniversities occupy lecture theatres to protest the effect of government cuts on their\ndegrees, Imperial students suggest calling\nan Extraordinary General Meeting to demand that the dress code of the end-of-year\nparty be obligatory black tie.\nThat is not to demean the desire of what\nseems to be the majority of students to have\nan event where they can dress up with their\nfriends and celebrate the end of the year. In\nfact, Felix would advise students to consider\nthe dress code to be black tie, regardless of\nthe event\u2019s \u2018Whatever you think is best\u2019 label.\nBut unfortunately, amidst the furore over\nwhether having Goldsmith\u2019s students within\na 100-yard radius has the potential to ruin\nan evening, the core reason why the Summer Ball is so cherished has been forgotten.\nWe love the Summer Ball because we\nspend it with our close friends (and it must\nbe said, not a small amount of alcohol). The\nnovelty of wearing a cummerbund may add\nto the fun, but no amount of archaic dress\ncan make you have a good time on your own.\nIn any case, anyone who has attended previous Summer Balls knows that the adherence to the dress-code is far from universal\nto say the least.\nNo convincing argument has been put forward as to how the new format destroys this.\nLast year\u2019s formal dinner was so sparsely attended that it simply did not factor in the vast\nmajority\u2019s experience of the Ball. The dress-code, although bungled, has not banned\nblack tie dress, and in truth the incongruity\nof bow ties and an all-day festival is quite\nappealing. The selection of live acts seems\nbetter than ever and the cost has remained\nstable from last year. We would urge the Union to allow students to remain in the Quad\nthrough to the Sunday as usual, but we understand the pressure the Union faces from\nthe Council with regards to their license.\nThe Union has certainly handled the proposed changes very badly. The new schedule came as a largely unwelcome surprise,\nand most students heard the news through\nnegative responses on facebook rather than\ndirectly from the Union. Students have been\nright to make their voices heard, and all criticisms and suggestions should be publicly\naired and discussed. But when the day in\nquestion comes around, we hope that more\ntime is spent having a good time than playing\nspot-the-fine-arts-student.\nFELIX\nNothing wrong with a\nfew arts students \u2013 for\ndecorative purposes\n\n"

Both of the teams were undefeated\nin their leagues and had confidently gone through\ntheir knock out rounds. In everyone\u2019s mind were\nthe double silvers from last year, where both men\nand women were close to grabbing the gold but in\nthe end were defeated. For the women this year\nwas of extra importance, having ended up second\ntwo years in a row.\nStarting the semi-finals the ladies faced Durham\nUniversity, the team Clare Harding (Imperial sa-breur), used to fence for. It was already known\nthat Durham had a strong sabre team, but were not\nas strong in the other weapons. As they had won\nagainst Oxford University with only a single hit, a\nteam that Imperial had beaten convincingly twice,\nthe girls concluded that they had a fairly good\nchance. Up on piste first were Hannah Bryars,\nOuti Supponen and Alice Mitchell, ready to fence\nfoil. No one from the Durham team was an actual\nfoilist, which meant that even though there was\nnervousness involved our team could win comfortably with 45-12. Epee coming up next with Alice,\nCharlotte Levin and Emily Bottle, with the goal to\nsimply keep Durham on a score as low as possible\nto facilitate it for the sabre team. Facing a bit more\nchallenge in this weapon Charlotte managed to\nhold it fairly alright at the end with the final score\n43-38. This meant that the sabreurs Clare, Hannah\nand Zoe Robinson needed no more than seven hits\nto win, a task they accomplished early but then\nfound the opponents one step stronger and lost 33-45.\nAs the women had advanced to the final with the\noverall score 121-95, the men were going a similar route.

The two teams had\nbeen head and shoulders above the competition\nthroughout the year, with Imperial denied the\nleague title by a single point after suffering their\nonly defeat of the season against UCL\u2019s. This only\nstrengthened Imperial\u2019s resolve, and the squad\nwent into the game in high spirits, and with a legion of fans to help them on their way.\nImperial suffered an early setback when centre-half Farag failed a late fitness test and was ruled\nout. Despite this Imperial began the game well,\ndominating the first 20 minutes with composed\nplay. On the break however, UCL threatened, and\nwith Hill picking up an early booking in the centre\nof the park \u2013 presumably for appearance\u2019 sake, the\nback four could no longer rely on the usual degree\nof protection. After 25 minutes, Imperial paid the\nprice for allowing a UCL forward a moment too\nlong on the ball, as he threaded the ball behind the\nImperial defence to his strike partner, who duly put\nhis team ahead.\nImperial were buoyed by the belief that they\nhad the better of their opposition, and surged for-...

Despite\nnot being able to run with the ball, netball is an extremely skilful, fast paced\nsport. And the Medics happen to be\nrather good at it.\nThis season, the Imperial Medics netball 1st team have played netball three\ntimes a week since the beginning of the\nseason, almost without fail. That adds\nup to in excess of 34 hours of matches.\nIn that time, we\u2019ve scored more than\n1400 goals. That\u2019s more than a goal\nevery 90 seconds. And if that doesn\u2019t\nmake for exciting viewing, I don\u2019t know\nwhat does!\nOf those 34 games, we\u2019ve lost only\nfour. (One of these was started with only\nfive players (traffic on the way there)\nand we only lost by one goal.) If I may\nsay so myself, that\u2019s pretty impressive!\nLast term, the team went to Sheffield for the BUCS South-East Conference cup final. 128 teams enter this\ncompetition, so even to get this far was\nan achievement. Our rivals in the final\nwere Brighton 1s, whom we had both\nlost to and beaten during the season.\nThis was the first time we\u2019d progressed\nso far in this competition; we were the\nunder-dogs...! People are often fooled\nby our team \u2013 we often turn up in dribs\nand drabs, with mismatching kit and occasionally we have to start with 5 play-ers. And I think that Brighton might\nhave fallen for this disguise. We ended\nup the proud owners of shiny gold med-als, having beaten Brighton 41-25.\nThis season has been one of our most\nsuccessful yet. We are the top of the\nULU Premier League; the Manchester\nUnited of netball. (Proud owners of 2\ngold medals!) We are also joint top in\nour BUCS league. And we\u2019re in the\nleague second from the top. The Imperial team are in 3B, which is 3 leagues\nbelow us. Incidentally, we also beat the\nImperial team 46-25 at Varsity. Not really as close a game as they might\u2019ve\nhoped... We also got to the final of the\nULU cup and were unlucky to lose what\nwas a close-match, with the other team\nhaving an 8th player in the form of their\numpire. Though we can\u2019t really complain about another medal, even if it is\nsilver!\nSo I just want to thank all of the\ngirls who\u2019ve been so committed this\nyear, particularly Cat Atkin, our oh-so-nearly-a doctor!

They were rewarded\nhandsomely when Benincasa played a\ndelightful through ball to Eshun, who\nraced onto the pass and delicately lifted\nthe ball over the UCL keeper\u2019s head\nwith remarkable calm.\nTowards the start of the second half\nImperial looked to lose some of their\nearly impetus. This changed somewhat\nwhen Hill, forced off by injury, was\nreplaced by Wilson \u2013 an inspired substitution which restored a good deal of\ncomposure and shape to the Imperial\nside. Both teams pressed on, but the two\nstrongest defences in the league helped\nto keep the scores level until the 75th\nminute. Imperial were slightly overexposed at the back when UCL crafted a\nslick move \u2013 culminating in a headed\ngoal for their striker.\nAware that time was running out,\nImperial switched to an aggressive\n3-4-3 position. The quality of the Imperial midfield began to show, and when\nWeedon played the industrious Robinson through on goal in the 86th minute,\nhe took his chance beautifully \u2013 slotting\nhome to level the scores at 2-2 and spark\nmayhem on the touchline. Imperial\nwere in the ascendancy and, with the\nindescribable support of the fans behind\nthem, dug deep to try and find a win-ner. Hearts were in mouths when Fryatt\nmade a desperate goal line clearance,\nbut Imperial pushed on.\nEntering the 93rd minute of the match,\nwhen weary legs were all but resigned\nto extra time, Benincasa again played\nEshun through on goal. All present held\ntheir breath as Eshun \u2013 1st XI POTY,\nand with more than 50 Imperial goals\nunder his belt, powered toward goal \u2013\nbut he made no mistake.

    "content": "3\nFELIX Friday 06 may 2011\nNEWS\nImperial College NHS Trust faces a\nbudget shortfall of \u00a340m next year, according to CEO of the Trust and ProRector Stephen Smith.\nRecently published board papers have\nrevealed, for the first time, the state of\nongoing service level agreements for\nImperial NHS Trust in 2011-12. Stephen Smith announced the \u00a340m budget\ngap in a speech to the trust\u2019s board of\ndirectors and explained it was \u201cdue to\nvolume and funding withdrawals\u201d from\nthe services commissioned by local Primary Care Trusts.\nA spokeswoman for the trust said\nthat \u00a340m was \u201cnot a definite sum\u201d and\nwould depend on the outcome of the\nongoing negotiations. She also refuted\nreports in the media that the trust is in\n\u2018turnaround\u2019. The spokeswoman said\nthat the current financial environment\nfaced by acute trusts was \u201cextremely\ntough\u201d. She also described the size and\nscale of the cuts that trusts have been\nasked to make as \u201cvery challenging\u201d.\nA spokesman for NHS London said\nthat there were always \u201crobust discussions\u201d about hospital budgets at this\ntime of year, and that it was \u201ccommitted\nto managing constrained levels of funding and using its budget more efficiently\u201d. He said that the NHS in London\nwas \u201cworking hard\u201d at this, and would\nbe \u201cradically slimming down its management structures\u201d.\nThe mounting financial challenge\ncomes at a time when Imperial will\nalso lose three of its senior executives.\nStephen Smith will leave Imperial in\nSeptember to step up his involvement\nin the newly founded Lee Kong Chian\nMedical School in Singapore, a joint\nventure between Imperial and Nanyang\nTechnological University. In his place,\nMark Davies has been appointed as interim CEO of the Trust. Chief financial\nofficer Tony Graff will also leave at the\nend of the month, while chief information officer Alistair Shearin will retire in\nSeptember.\nImperial NHS Trust covers NorthWest London; and includes Charing\nCross, Hammersmith, Queen Charlotte\u2019s & Chelsea, St Mary\u2019s and Western Eye hospitals. It is one of the biggest\nacute trusts in the country, with more\nthan one million patient contacts each\nyear. It is not yet known which services\nwill be affected by the cuts. However,\nthey will add pressure to currently constrained services \u2013 the Trust already has\na backlog of orthopaedic and trauma\ncases. A spokesperson for the college\nwas not available to comment on whether the cuts would have any impact on\nthe quality of medical education offered\nto students across Imperial NHS trust.\nThe announcement adds to the problems troubling NHS London. As a result\nof tough ongoing negotiations, hospitals have become locked in arbitration,\nthough so far Imperial has managed to\navoid this fate. In March, Iain Duncan\nSmith, former Conservative leader, delivered a petition to Downing Street opposing local hospital unit closures. The\nstrategic plan for NHS London has been\nunder review since the coalition government halted the previous Labour administration\u2019s plans, which were largely\nbased on recommendations drawn up by\nImperial\u2019s Lord Darzi.\nThe coalition government has currently put Andrew Lansley\u2019s controversial\nHealth and Social Care Bill on hold for\na two-month \u2018listening exercise\u2019following widespread criticism. This has been\nundermined by a leaked confidential\nmemo from NHS chief executive David\nNicholson, published in the Guardian,\nwhich drew a red line beneath certain\naspects of the bill that the government\nwill not change. Labour opposition has\nslammed the \u2018listening exercise\u2019as a PR\nstunt.\nLast month, the Royal College of Nursing passed an overwhelming vote of no\nconfidence in the reforms after Lansley\ndecided not to speak at its annual conference \u2013 the first health secretary not to\ndo so in eight years. Lansley also failed\nto turn up to make a keynote speech at\nthe launch of Imperial\u2019s newly formed\nSchool of Public Health, in February.\nWith her big bright eyes, a selfless desire to help those in need, and an unrivalled passion for the sounds of obscure\nbands you\u2019d have to Google just to\nmaintain conversation, Demi Atkinson\ncertainly ticked all the boxes. And to\nyour average Imperial fresher, confined\nto our beloved South Ken bubble with\na less-than-ideal male to female ratio,\nperfect she did seem.\nWe\u2019re lucky to live in a time and age\nwhere new students no longer face that\ndaunting prospect of showing up at university and having nobody to talk to:\nthanks to Zuckerberg and his cronies\none can muster up a whole jamboree of\nacquaintances before arriving on that\nrainy day in October. And that\u2019s what\nI and countless other schmucks spent\nhours doing in the months preceding\nmoving-in day last year.\nLike many, I\u2019d had my fair share of\nregular conversations with Demi, mostly about her woeful life. Her mother\nwas dying of cancer, so she\u2019d selflessly\nflunked out of university to be by her\nside. Although her father had walked\nout yesteryear she wasn\u2019t entirely alone,\nand had both her older brother and close\nfriends from Exeter standing by at all\ntimes to lend her a helping hand.\nOctober came and went but Demi\u2019s\nmother was too ill to be left alone, so\nDemi had arranged a deferred place\nwith Imperial. Unfortunately her mother passed away before Christmas, and\nmyself and others gradually became\nmore concerned as Demi\u2019s depression\nand cocaine use heightened, but spoke\nto her less and less as we settled into\nuniversity life.\nWhen her best friend Lara announced\nthe tragic news of her death we were all\ndevastated. Demi had died of sudden\nunexpected death syndrome due to the\nunbearable stresses that life had burdened her with. As is the custom in this\nbizarre and often cringe-invoking age,\ncountless messages bombarded Demi\u2019s\nwall, and amongst the dozens of fresh-ers who knew her, several tears were\nshed.\nBut by pure serendipity it was unveiled that Demi didn\u2019t actually ex-ist. Her mother hadn\u2019t died of cancer.\nThere was no record of a deferred place\nfor her at Imperial. Sudden unexpected\ndeath syndrome is genetic and generally affiliated with young Laotian men.\nDemi\u2019s Facebook photographs had been\ntaken from an innocent bystander from\nSheffield who an Imperial fresher just\nso happened to meet.\nWhen confronted, Demi\u2019s profile as\nwell as those of her elaborate friendship and family circle vanished into\ncyberspace. Somebody clearly had a lot\nof time on their hands, investing hours\neach evening not only talking to people,\nbut also talking to themselves from the\nFacebook fraud\nScaled-down Science Challenge launches\n\u00a340 million shortfall in\nImperial NHS Trust budget\nBen Scally\ndozens of faux accounts they\u2019d created.\nOne has to wonder what kind of motive\nsomeone would have. I mean, Imperial\nfreshers are hardly the most robust or\ninteresting targets in the world. Perhaps\nsomeone has a deranged ex-lover looking to keep tabs on them.\nThe whole situation seems like an\nAesop\u2019s fable for the Facebook genera-tion: we should certainly be more careful\nabout who we\u2019re trusting online. I\u2019m sure\nthose involved will be a lot more scepti-cal: a well-established Facebook profile\ndoesn\u2019t make anybody more \u2018real\u2019. And\nas our social interactions diminish and\nwe irreversibly dive further into dependency on such sites, perhaps we should\nalso be asking what kind of responsibility the site owners should be taking.\nDeceit on the internet is hardly a\nground-breaking phenomenon, but it\u2019s\nthe nature of this incident and the fact\nthat it is so close to home that make it so\ninteresting: how can a bunch of alleged-ly-bookish Imperialites be so blind and\nfoolish to something which in retrospect\nseems entirely absurd? Be careful, kids:\nthere are sick perverts out there, and\nthey want to have a long, hard gaze at\nyour revision-orientated status updates.\nChristopher Richardson\nThe Royal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) Science Challenge finally\nlaunched last week. The essay writing\ncompetition offers cash prizes of up to\n\u00a32,000 and is open to Imperial students\nand students from schools in the UK.\nHowever, the competition this year is\nvastly scaled-down in comparison with\nprevious years and has faced delays due\nto funding problems.\nEntrants have until 6pm on the 3rd\nof June to submit an 800-word answer\nto one of four questions. The Science\nChallenge is not usually held during the\nexam period, in previous years it has\nbeen announced in January and held in\nthe Spring term. Additionally it is traditional for prominent scientists to pose\nthe questions based on their field of interest and then judge the entries, something that is not present this year.\nThe prize money this year is also substantially smaller. In previous years the\ntotally prize pot has been up to \u00a316,000,\nwhile this year it is \u00a35,000. It is also\nunclear what sort of awards ceremony\nthere will be, if any at all, as the winners\nwill be announced at the very end of the\nyear on the 24th of June.\nRCSU President Scott Heath explained that they faced difficulties in\nsecuring funding for the competition\nand that there was some doubt whether it would go ahead at all. Both Shell\nand Winton Capital Management, who\nhave generously funded the competition in previous years, declined to sponsor the Science Challenge this year. He\nsaid that they were left scrambling for\nsponsorship after Shell pulled out in October, but that they were unsuccessful.\nThe only funding for the competition\nthis year is \u00a35,000 from the Faculty of\nNatural Sciences.\nThe uncertainty over funding meant\nthat they were unable to confirm that\nthe competition would go ahead until\nApril, by which point it was too late to\nbook prominent judges. It was decided\nthat running a down-scaled competition\nwould be better than not running the\ncompetition at all.\nFor more information about how to\nenter, go to:\nwww.rcsu.org.uk/sciencechallenge\nImperial NHS Trust CEO Stephen Smith\nMike Finn-Kelcey/Imperial College London\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 06 may 2011 23\nTELEVISION\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nVeronika McQuadeova\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nflashing character labels upon the introduction of each character, I really can\u2019t\nthink of a way to familiarize the characters to a new audience effectively. The\nfilmmakers of Game of Thrones wisely\npicked artistic integrity by opting to\nreveal characters by slowly trickling\ndown the identities as the story unfolds.\nImportantly the TV version stayed\nfaithful to the books. Story and characters are all as they are in the book (at\nleast till now). The more adult themes\nof the story- the incest and the sex -are\nundiluted. HBO has its experience with\nsex and nudity in Rome and its great to\nsee that they did not shy away from it\nin Game of Thrones. Some reviewers\ncomplain about the excessive nudity\nin the show. However I think its great\nthat those scenes were done with no\npunches held, not just because I\u2019m a\nguy, but because it is the way the book\nwas written and they are pivotal to the\ncharacterization and plot. The example\nof The Golden Compass, where the religious theme is watered down to cater\nto US audience, testifies that compromising the central elements of a story\nin the name of political correctness or\nmass appeal results in a film that is but\na lame shadow of its source book. It\nnow remains to see if HBO would stay\ntrue to the goriness of key events in the\nbook. In the two episodes shown so\nfar, the amount of blood spilled seems\npromising.\nA Game of Thrones is a captivating\nread for its spectacular world, character and politics. HBO seems to have\ngot it right, and hopefully, as Game of\nThrones unfold, it would captivate its\naudience as the book does. It\u2019s a\nhigh call for a series of books\nwritten by an author hailed\nas \u2018the American\nTolkien\u2019, but if\nPeter Jackson\ncould do it,\nthose guys\nat HBO (Be-nioff and\nW e i s s )\nb e t t e r\ndo it as\nwell!\nSwords, incest, blood and babes\nbehold. The castles, the medieval stone\nrooms, the busy, muddy courtyard, all\nbrought to life in an opulent and detailed set. The CGI panorama of King\u2019s\nLanding is stunning as well. It all feels\nlike a movie!\nMost of the characters were done to\nsatisfaction. Sean Bean plays a wonderful Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell, while\nMark Addy excels as King Baratheon,\na bashful and merry spirit trapped beneath the responsibilities of governing a kingdom. Lena Headey graces\nthe screen as the cold-hearted, darkly\nambitious Queen Cersei Lannister and\nEmilia Clarke bares all and yet retains a\nhelplessness and innocence as Daenerys\nTargaryen, who would be interesting to\nwatch as she grows to fulfil her destiny.\nHarry Lloyd is absolutely irritating as\nViserys Targaryen, the na\u00efvely ambitious older brother of Daenerys, which\nis how the character is supposed to be\nas par the novel.\nThe TV series do fall short on the\ncharacter development section. But\nwhat could we expect, the TV show is\nalready condensing so much content\ninto ten 1-hour episodes. Some part\nmay be a bit hasty, but generally, the\nshow\u2019s pace is all right. Its already an\nachievement for the show to circumvent with some success what could be\nconsidered the sole flaw of the book,\nmore of a necessity rather than a flaw\nin writing: the first 50 pages are a\nbit of a drag, because there are\nso many characters to introduce,\nnothing much happens! But it\u2019s\nessential in order to populate the\nstage with such a large cast and\nto lay the ground for such an\nelaborate plot.\nWhile fans of the book\nwatch with glee as each of\nGeorge R. R. Martin\u2019s creations are brought to life\nin the TV show, those\nwho have not read the\nbooks might struggle\nto keep up with who\u2019s\nwho in the enormous\ncast of characters.\nShow, not tell, goes\nthe adage for good\nscriptwriting, but\nit is a dilemma\nwhen you have\nsuch a vast\nnumber of\nprotagonists.\nShort of\nlast 3 on its way) into a trilogy would\nrequire cuts so deep it makes austerity\nBritain seem generous! How about one\nmovie per book, ala Harry Potter? With\nthe staggering cast of protagonists and\nultra-complex politics in A Song of Ice\nand Fire, to make a movie out of just\none of the book would abridge the story\ninto such simplicity it loses its essence.\nUnless of course each movie is a 6-hour\nlong epic film, which I wouldn\u2019t not\nmind sitting through, although I am not\nsure if the rest of the people who have\nyet to read the books share my senti-ment. Anyway the TV series would be\nmade by HBO, who churned out TV\ngreats like The Sopranos, Boardwalk\nEmpire and the wire.\nAfter watching the first two episodes\nof Game of Thrones, I am of opinion\nthat the TV series is set for an epic win.\nThe CGI and set is good enough to\ntransport the audience into a believable fantasy world, and is stunning to\nwas disappointing.\nHowever, during the build-up to the\nrelease of the first episode, I realized\nthat being made into a TV series may\nactually do the books better justice than\na film trilogy. To think of it, the first\nbook itself (A Game of Thrones) is as\nthick as all three Lord of the Rings put\ntogether. Hollywood cut out a substantial amount of content to fit LOTR into\na trilogy. To fit the whole of the Song\nof Ice and Fire series (7 books, with the\nA\nfew years ago, picking\nup \u2018A Game of Thrones\u2019\nstarted a love affair that\nkept me up through the\ndeep hours of midnight,\nand ended 5000 pages and 4 books lat-er. I was swept away into the world of\nWesteros George R. R. Martin created\nand was entangled in the intricate plots\nand characters that the story is lived\nthrough.\nA Game of Thrones is the first\nbook in the epic fantasy series that\nis A Song of Ice and Fire, which follows the struggle for the Iron Throne\nof the Seven Kingdoms, set against a\nbackdrop of political conspiracy, warring Houses and incest. The death of\nthe King\u2019s Hand (the Prime Minister)\ntriggers a cascade of events that would\nusher the end of the peaceful era, and\nthreaten House Baratheon\u2019s place on\nthe Iron Throne. Across the Narrow\nSea, the last two remaining bloodline\nfrom the deposed House Targaryen\nare now of age and plot to return to\nthe Seven Kingdoms with vengeance\nto seize the throne they believe to be\nrightfully theirs.\nA Song of Ice and Fire is no doubt\none of the most captivating epic fantasy\nseries of our generation: it weaves a colourful cast of characters, a complex,\nmind-boggling plot that never cease to\nconjure up new surprises, and a highly\nsophisticated world and its equally intricate politics, altogether in a trademark\ndark realism: people die in this story\nand the fact that you are a main character does not spare your head at crucial\nmoments. It was one of those books that\nis good enough to make you feel as if\nreality (a.k.a. moments spent not reading the book) is an aching dream and the\nreal world is whenever you get back to\nreading the book.\nSo it is to some disappointment initially when I heard that A Game of Thrones\nwould be made into a TV series. Where\nis the honour of being translated into\nthe silver screen in an epic 400- million\ndollar trilogy that was bestowed to the\nreigning fantasy book of the last gen-eration? I won\u2019t be able to witness the\nglory of Winterfell and King\u2019s Landing\nand watch the battles unfold in Dolby\nSurround Sound and 3D? Damn that\nI\u2019d love to hold onto that flowing mane and ride her all day... what?

If you\u2019ve been living in\nthe chart bubble let me bring you up to\nspeed: the London-based experimental\nelectronic duo have been tearing up the\nscene with their unique blend of minimalist sounds extracted from miscellaneous children\u2019s toys, and already have\na few of those coveted Pitchfork ratings\nunder their belts.\nThe duo appeared on-stage to greet a\ntable full of electronic gizmos: with the\nretro Game Boys and Fischer Price keyboards it looked like a messy children\u2019s\nroom, but they clearly knew what they\nwere doing. As they faced each other in\na head-on standoff we experienced an\nunusual form of audience interaction:\nrather than bowing to the crowd, they\ninstead invited us in to look at some of\nthe creativity that goes into the tracks\nwe\u2019ve come to love.\nAs my girlfriend so succinctly put it,\n\u201cit was like watching a spaceship land\u201d.\nAn uninterrupted hour or so of those\nanthems that have been the soundtrack\nLittle Scream opened the show for\nJos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez with The G\u00f6teborg\nString Theory. A fairly unknown art-ist; at first shy and inverted, and very\nmuch in front of a judging panel as I\ndoubt many of us in the audience had\ncome for her \u2013 but who, immediately,\ngrabbed our attention with her vocals.\nQuivering and modest, and then living\nup to her stage name, her songs were\nquietly powerful and deeply stirring. As\npart of a solo live show which more than\nfilled the Barbican hall, Little Scream\nperformed with a stamping foot as a\ndrum, a cocktail of pedals as a band and\na high tech microphone as backing sing-ers. With a few awkward jokes thrown\nin, and some humble comments about\n\u2018playing a rough show\u2019 and jetlag, and\nmusic that could cut to the heart of us,\nwe had all fallen in love with her by the\nend of her short set.\nLeft reeling by Little Scream, no one\nwas quite prepared for the spectacle\nto follow. Gonz\u00e1lez opened solo, with\nHints \u2013 just him and his acoustic guitar,\nas we best knew him. Already we were\nbeing reminded of how deeply moving his music is in person. But then he\nwas joined on stage by The G\u00f6teborg\nString Theory orchestra \u2013 who turned\nout to be the perfect catalyst. Led by a\nto my bedroom over the past few years\nwas well overdue. In spite of the sticky\nfloor everyone was moving in sync,\naccompanied by an impressive light\ndisplay that added to the cosmic atmo-sphere.\nThe set ran perfectly as each track\npaved the way for the next in bursting\ncrescendo. Rather than being exposed to\ntheir iTunes library we were watching\nthe melodies being built from scratch,\nwhich included crackled yelping into\ntoy microphones and belting tribal\ndrums. Their delivery was so energetic,\nwhich definitely had a lasting impact on\nthe audience engagement.\nFuck Buttons were definitely worth\nthe wait, and I\u2019ll be bulk-buying tickets\nto their next London show as soon as\nit pops into existence. If your life is in\nneed of a new soundtrack, I suggest you\ngo and download Street Horrrsing and\nTarot Sport, or at least check out some\ntracks on YouTube: their lyricless epics are guaranteed to be the perfect accompaniment to your study session or\nSheen-esque shindig.\nFuck Buttons is the\nmusic scene\u2019s saviour\nFuck Buttons\nHMV Forum, Kentish Town\nThursday 21st April\nChristopher Richardson\nyoung conductor; who was dressed in\nsloppy chinos and torn white plimsoles\nand who boasted dance moves comparable to the most recent version of Thom\nYorke; the orchestra struck up a tune\nwhich no one could resemble to any\nGonz\u00e1lez song. However gradually (as\nthe backdrop slowly lit to reveal an upside down Swedish forest landscape at\ndusk) the violins and cellos quietened to\nallow for Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s track, Far Away.\nThey slowly began their contribution to\nthe piece; starting with soft female backing vocals and a thumping bass drum,\nbuilding to violins; wavering on two\nnotes, off time and reaching a magnificent crescendo as more strings joined\nthe tune at higher pitches and louder\nvolumes. I could write about how The\nG\u00f6teborg String Theory enhanced\nevery single song on the setlist, but the\none that roused the most emotion in me\nwas Crosses. Always a favourite track\nof mine, the staccato violins and faster\ntempo added newer heights to the climaxes and steepened the falls. The effect was overpowering. As they closed\nwith Teardrop, I felt unsatisfied. Every\nsingle audience member gave a standing ovation \u2013 we were hungry for more.\nBut the encore was to surpass all that\nhad been done that evening. Starting\nwith Down the Line \u2013 a number filled\nwith pumping bass drum, sharp string\naccompaniments and feel-good trumpet\nriffs \u2013 the pace and mood of the evening\nwas lifted to a new elevation. The conductor (who was a show in himself, re-ally) conducted the audience into a syn-chronised clapping and stopped us with\na single hand signal, flawlessly, in time\nfor Gonz\u00e1lez to start vocals. Finally, the\nshow was closed with the classic Heartbeats \u2013 a song which brought me close\nto tears with its sincerity and beauty, enhanced by the rising and gentle violin\naccompaniments.\nThe night was as magical as it was\ngenius. After each song I could hear\naudible gasps and mutters as people\nstruggled to come to terms with just how\ngood this was. What The G\u00f6teborg\nString Theory did was add a new dimension to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s one man music\n\u2013 it did what one guitar and one male\nvoice could not. The violins took the\ncrescendos soaring, softening the moments of truest sentiment and raising the\nclimaxes, whilst the double basses took\nus diving to the most intricate depths of\nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s compositions, and rocked us\nwith their steady drones. Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez\nquietly stunned us with his compositions\nand skill in delivering them; and the con-ductor, meanwhile, took us dancing.\n\u201cThe perfect\naccompaniment to a\nSheen-esque shindig\u201d\nJos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez with The\nG\u00f6teborg String Theory\nThe Barbican\nMonday 11th April\nCamilla Nicholson\nJos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez teams up with orchestral collective\nThe G\u00f6teborg String Theory to great success\nKeeping it \u2018disco\u2019 at the Air Hockey World Championships...\nChristopher Richardson\nflickr/halfmadhalfinsane\nAnd I thought Arcade Fire had a lot of band members...\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n\n"

However, when\nthe details of the Ball were announced\nduring the Easter holidays, the response\nwas mixed and for some the radical\nchanges to the format have changed\ntheir end-of-year ball into an end-of-year festival. In a comment echoed by\nmany, one student wrote on Facebook:\n\u2018It\u2019s simply not a Ball anymore\u2019.\nThe changes to the Ball include moving it to earlier in the day (with the\nevent starting at 1pm) the removal of\nthe formal dinner as well as the formal\ndress code. The Ball is also no longer\nan Imperial-only event. It\u2019s being held\nin conjunction with King\u2019s College\nUnion and Goldsmith\u2019s Union, and will\nbe open to all London university stu-dents. Officially, the Summer Ball will\nfinish at midnight where an after party\nfor 1000 people will be held in Metric\nfor an extra \u00a35.\nIn a sense, however, this year\u2019s Summer Ball is the best in recent years. With\nan extremely strong lineup (in spite of\na Chase and Status DJ set) and no increase in price from last year.\nStill there has been a significant\namount of controversy over the chang-es, with students discussing the changes\nextensively on Facebook and differing\nover the significance of the changes.\nSome want there to be a formal dress-code, but are looking forward to the festival format, while others have lamented\nthe loss of the dinner but are looking\nforward to mingling with students from\nother universities. Indeed it seems that\nwith the full lineup now released, headliner Laura Marling has softened opposition to the changes, with the same\nstudent who said \u2018it\u2019s simply not a Ball\nanymore\u2019 declaring that Laura Marling\n\u2018pretty much makes up for everything\u2019.\nHowever, a common complaint has\nbeen that students feel that they weren\u2019t\nconsulted about the changes.\nWere students consulted?\nQuestions have been raised about the\npoor communication between the Union\nand the student body, with a lot of students feeling like they have been blindsided with the changes. There was initially little effort to explain the changes.\nOne of the first questions put to Felix by\na Chemical Engineering student was:\n\u201cwhy have they made such a dramatic\nchange? Was anyone pushing for such\na change? Did they consult with many\nstudents before pushing these plans\nthrough?\u201d The Union have strenuously\ndefended the process behind the changes,\npointing out that the changes were discussed in the Union Council and that the\nEnts Committee, which has three mem-bers, was involved. However, the widespread surprise at the changes shows\nthat there was little communication with\nthe \u2018outside world\u2019, with no mention in\nthe Union\u2019s all-student email, or on the\nUnion website or Facebook page.Ashort\narticle was published in Felix towards the\nend of last term and publicized on the Felix Facebook page and Twitter account,\nbut by this point the changes had been all\nbut decided. Union PresidentAlex Kendall admitted that \u201cpeople are concerned\u201d\nand that they \u201cprobably needed to do\nmore to get the changes across to people\nbefore launching\u201d.\nSharing with other universities\nThe response to sharing the Ball with\nother universities has been mixed.\nOpinion is split between those who\nfeel that it is no longer a special event\nto celebrate the end of their year at\nImperial and some cheeky chaps who\nare looking forward to girls from other\nuniversities balancing the male-female\nratio. The Union has said that having a\njoint ball will mean that there is more\nmoney for live acts. However, all of the\nfunding has come from the Union \u2013 the\nextra money coming from more ticket\nsales. It remains to be seen how many\nstudents from King\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s\nwill attend but there is concern that Imperial students won\u2019t be able to attend\nthe after-party in Metric because of the\nlimited capacity. Deputy President Ravi\nPall admitted that this might be an issue\non his blog, saying \u201cit is expected more\nthan 1000 people would want to attend\nthe afterparty\u201d and that the \u00a35 charge for\nthe after-party was aimed at controlling\nnumbers.\nNo more dinner\nThe loss of the formal dinner has also\ncreated a stir. The Union argue that it\u2019s\nnot a financially viable part of the Summer Ball. They argue that it is \u201cimmoral\u201d to subsidise the dinner tickets, which\nlast year cost an additional \u00a345 on top of\na standard entry ticket and say that the\nnumber of students attending the dinner\nis too low to continue running it. In his\ninitial blog about the changes, Deputy\nPresident Ravi Pall, who also promised\nmoving the event to after exams in his\nmanifesto, claimed that only 300 tickets\nwere sold last year, however that figure\nhas now changed to 158. After the backlash against the changes on Facebook,\nthe Union said that they would consider\nholding a dinner and opened a poll to\nsee if there is enough demand for a \u00a338\nper person dinner in the SCR. The dinner will be quite unlike previous years,\nstudents will dine at different times depending on when they prefer. According to the Union, less than 150 students\nhave said that they would want to go to\nthe dinner, making it financially unvi-able.\nBut you can go to the summer festival. Jovan\nNedic balances the debate on the new look Ball\nWhat will you wear?\nThe bulk of the anger has been reserved\nfor the ambiguity of the dress code.\nWith the previous evening format, the\ndress code was straightforwardly black\ntie. However, with an all-day festival it\u2019s\nnot clear if that\u2019s practical. The Summer\nBall website says that the dress code is\n\u201cDress to Impress!\u201d but leaves the final\ndecision to the discretion of students,\n\u201cFancy dress, black tie or casual \u2013 whatever you think is best\u201d. Students have\nlamented what they see as the loss of\ntheir main opportunity to dress up with\ntheir friends at the end of the year, or\nindeed at the end of their time at Imperial, and the demand for a formal dress\ncode was so high that an online petition\nwas set up demanding that the dress\ncode be changed. It remains to be seen\nwhat will happen on the day, whether\nstudents will all telepathically decide to\ndress similarly, or if the event will see\nripped jeans rubbing up against cummerbunds and bow-ties. Similarly, will\nthe new changes be a breath of fresh air\nor the death of a formal ball that was\nloved by many?\nMercury Prize-winner Laura Marling is headlining\nflickr/rowl images\nThe new format\nFor \u00a340 (rising to \u00a345 midnight Monday 9th) you get a\nrange of live acts including\nLaura Marling, Chase and Status, Nero, and Ian Brown. It\nstarts at 1pm, until midnight,\nwhen a \u00a35 after-party starts\nin Metric, until 4am, when the\nSurvivors\u2019 Photo will be taken.\nThere will be funfair attractions throughout the day.\nGauging student\nopinion\nTo suggest that all Imperial students are against the changes\nto the Summer Ball would be\nridiculous (see Tim Arbabzadah on page 18 for proof), but\nsimilarly to deny that there\nhas been discontent would be\nwrong.\nHundreds of students were\nsufficiently unimpressed to\nsign an online petition demanding a formal dress code and a\nlook at the discussions on\nFacebook shows a broad range\nof students expressing their\ndiscontent. Indeed a Facebook\npoll of around 600 students,\nthough not statistically rigor-ous, indicated a lack of enthusiasm for (or knowledge of) the\nchanges, with only 35 saying\nthey preferred the new format.\nWhether you can plausibly\ndecide between the new format and the old format if you\nhaven\u2019t experienced the new\none yet is debatable, but it\u2019s\ntoo easy to simply write this\noff as \u2018Imperial students complaining again\u2019. The truth is\nthat most people who go the\nSummer Ball have a really\ngood time. There is every reason to believe that students\nwill like the new format when\nthey experience it, but it\u2019s\neasy to see why some students don\u2019t think it needed to\nbe \u2018fixed\u2019; it wasn\u2019t necessarily\n\u2018broken\u2019 last year.\n7\nFriday 06 MAY 2011\n\n"
