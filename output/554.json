    "content": "Practical joke\nfails to amuse\nPolice\nOn Sunday residents from Weeks\nHall drew an outline of a body on the\npavement outside their Hall. The\nadded some tomato ketchup and\nsurrounded the figure with barriers.\nA local resident phoned the Police\nand they questioned some of the\nstudents who live in the hall. The\nWeek's security guard stayed with\nthe students while they were being\nquestioned.\nFINNISTON REPORT\nI have had a bitterly disappointing\nresponse to* my enquiries about the\nviews of the students in City and\nGuilds College on the Finniston\nReport. Our original plan was to\nfor mu 'ite a student response to be\nsent to the Department of Industry\nat the beginning of April, but with a mere 18 replies from our 2,316\nstudents we could hardly be\nrepresentative, but IT IS NOT TOO LATE.\nMr Richard Morris, who is to\norganise the conference on Engineering Education, the offical reply to\nFinniston, to be held in October,\nhas expressed a keen interest to\nhear our students' views and so we\nare once again aiming to produce a student response.\nSo please keep your comments,\ncriticisms, and ideas on the Finniston\nReport rolling into the Guilds\nUnion Office, Mech Eng Dept\nanytime until the end \"of term. It is\nobviously important that we, as\nstudents of the foremost engineering\ninstitution in the country, voice our\nop in on effectively.\nThank You\nJo Armitage\nPresident C& GU Massive scores\non Asteroids\nmachine\nOn Wednesday night, students\nscored a high set of points on the\nAsteroids machine in Southside. The\nabove photograph of the top ten high\nscores table shows that IC students\nare getting pretty good at the game.\nWhen will we challenge other\nLondon colleges?\nEDITORIAL\nThe incident, last Saturday,\nindicates how easy it is for\nunauthorised people to get into\nSouthside. The architectural design\nof the building adds to the problem.\nThere are 3 entrances and it is almost\nimpossible to stop a determined\nperson from entering the building.\nMoving on to other less serious\nevents. The FELIX Motor Rally takes\nplace on Sunday 15th June.\nIf you are interested, please\ncontact your C CU President. The\nRally takes the form of a simple\ntreasure hunt round London. Teams\nof 2 to 5 members. The winning team\nhave their nan.es en scribe d on the\nFELIX Rally pot in the Union Bar. I would like to thank Martin Watson\nfor his help in organising the event.\nLast Tuesday the ICU AGM voted\nthat ICU should buy 200 copies per\nweek of London Student next year.\nThe paper hoped that we would buy\nmore and London Student will need\nto have many large orders from other\ncolleges if it is to survive.\nWhat do think of London\nStudent? Please write to FELIX\nwith your views.\nThank-you to Marie-Therese,\nJeremy Nunns and Tim Hillyer for\npaste ups. Ian for impatiently waiting\nfor eight hours while we rearranged\nthe front page. Once again Mickie\nlias been a great help with printing\nphotographs. Steve Groves has been\nhelping print up pic s for the review of\nthe year.

Last Tuesday's AGM, although heralding that\noccurrence is not however the finale. I'm still press y until the end of June, which\nmeans I still have to work and write FELIX articles (or in articles). Firstly, I must express my sorrow and\nhbr r or over the occurrence last Saturday.\nAny action that now follows will be\nshutting the stable door after the horse\nhas bolted, but it is important that Southside and Beit are now made more\nsecure. College are currently making internal investigations, ICU Council has\ncalled for a Rector's Working Party to be\nset up immediately to make recommendations by the end of June. In the mean\ntime it lies with the residents of Halls and\nHouses, male and female, to be both more vigilant and more careful. There must be no further repeats of incidents of\nthis kind.\nStaff\nOne of my jobs as President, which not\nmany people realise is as an employer.\nIncluding the FELIX staff, the union employs seven people, all of whom are\nexcellent, thereby rendering my job far\neasier than it might be. This is just to\nremind you, that whether you be in the\nUnion Office, the Welfare Centre or the\nFELIX Office to treat those people who\nmaintain the Union, despite people like\nme, with the respect they deserve. Failure\nto do so in the past has led to disciplinary\naction.\nCouncil\nCouncil last Monday, as well as exceeding\nitself in terms of nastiness( my fault),\ndiscussed the Union reply to a letter from\nSir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer who is chairing\na Flowers-type working party on the non-medical bits of the University of London. Council decided that it would like IC to\nstay in U of L and that there should be\nmuch closer academic interaction between\nthe schools.\nIt then went on to spend hours discussing Finniston and UL U, at which\npoint Council became in quo rate and ended.\nBefore the end Council had discussed\nboats and South Africans, the proposal\nby College to build a new hall of residence\nat Silwood which the residents are not\ntoo keen about, and lots of other things.\nWUS Third World Scholarship\nNotes were sent to all academic staff\nasking for donations so far the response\nhas been good so keep the cheques rolling in.\nColours\nMany congratulations to all those who\nwere awarded Colours at the AGM and\nespecial congrats to Malcolm, Wodger,\nTim and Bill for getting U GA's( the top\naward).\nOh well back to the Office.\nBye\nThe Fox\n\n"

    "content": "Boat Club\nDear Colin\nI would like to publicise Steve\nWebb's( the captain of Boat Club)\ncomment to me as his justification\nfor challenging the quorum as the\nmotion censoring the recent action\nof the Boat Club was about to be\nvoted upon.\nHis comment: \" This isn'ta representative meeting \u2014 she goes\nand drags all the overseas students\nin\".\nFirstly, the \"she\" refers to Mary\nAttenborough, as if this issue was\nher personal axe to grind. In fact,\nthe Anti-Apartheid Group at IC\nnumbers about thirty people,\nwhich, I should think is a number\nnot far removed from the number\nof active members of Boat Club,\nand we are joining an international\ncampaign to break links with the\nracist regime of South Africa.\nSecondly, Steve seems to assume\nthat the overseas students were\nforced to attend the meeting, that\nthey cannot make up their minds\nfor themselves and that their vote\ndoes not carry the same weight as\nthat of the home student. For the\nfirst time that I can remember, we\nhad a large contingent of overseas\nstudents at a UGM because they\nwanted to show how strong their\nfeelings were about the issue being\ndiscussed \u2014 why else did they\nbother to attend the meeting? This\nis surely the type of response we\nare aiming at by holding UGMs.\nSteve has so far argued that his\nway is the best way to alleviate the\nsituation in South Africa and up\nuntil the uttering of those two\nphrases, even I thought he really\nbelieved that and I merely felt\nsorry. But now I realise that he just\ndoesn't care \u2014 \"Steve's alright,\nJack.\"\nJo Armitage\nNoise\nDear Sir\nSunday 18 May, 02:10am As I pen this letter three hours\nafter retiring to bed, I am regaled\nby the sounds of boogie-woogie\nand rock'n 'roll music from the\nUnion Building opposite my room.\nWho decided to allow parties till\nthis hour in the morning during\nexams? I know, it's the weekend\nand we poor Beit residents must\nexpect to put up with some disturbance (loud music, empty beer cans\nand kegs being kicked and rolled\nround the Quad, etc), but 2:00am? How many more such events are\nplaned for our delight during the\nexam period I wonder?\nYours sleepless ly James Gray\nConcise\nDear Colin\nMay I suggest that the Editor of\nFELIX issues guidelines on how to\nconstruct a logical argument, in\norder to avoid the nine letters\nwhich rambled on to no purpose\non Iran in last week's issue.\nYours sincerely\nFrank James\nGraffitti\nSir\nCould you please ask your Islamic\nreaders not to write on our College\nBuildings, this may be the done\nthing in Tehran, but certainly not in\nLondon.\nDisgusted of Mayfair\nFrom the Anti-Anti-Apartheid\nGroup/Masses at RSM(IC)\nFollowing the IC Boat Club's successful and prestigious sporting\ntour of non-racist South Africa, we\nwere pleased to learn that RSM\n(IC) has offered RSM(IC) Union\nequipment ot a non-racist white\nSouth African team visiting the UK\nthis summer to row at Henley.\nIn view of the progressive international campaign tg promote\nsporting links with the enlightened\nnon-racist sporting community of\nSouth Africa, we totally endorse\nthe Boat Club's sporting offer.\nWe are considering holding a RSM(IC) non-racist U GM to discuss\nthis further in PO Box 645 Joburg\nRSA during July; come and vote\nfor the anti-anti-apartheid revolutionary government at IC.\nSigned: SAS, Sgd Leader Bamo\nWoghead, Short-arse, Der Fuhrer,\nPaddy, Sgt Doe and Slob.\nPS: Quorum by post not allowed.\nConSoc\nDear Colin\nFollowing the much publicised\nintent of Mary Attenborough to\nstand as Conservative Society\nChairman, the Consoc Committee\ncordially invite her to do so\nprovided Mark Clegg (Consoc\nChairman) is invited to become\nICWA President for the coming\nyear.

Yours faithfully\nArthur Sore Arse\nDear Colin\nIC and South Africa\nAs one who has been at various\ntimes described by Sennet as \"a Conservative\" and by Ms Attenborough as a \"McCarthyite Fascist\",\nI find it rather amusing to be\ndescribed by the Captain of IC\nBoat Club as one of \"Mary Attenborough's cronies\". IC's growing\ninvolvement with the South African\nregime is rather less amusing. It is\na pity that the apartheid system\nshould have as an advocate in your\ncolumns someone so ignorant of\nthe facts (re South African education)\nor at least guilty of terminological\ninexact it it ude( eat your heart out, J Newland).\nTo return to the serious points:\nthere are no mixed-race universities in the Republic. A very small\nIran\nDear Colin\nThe current interest in the\nIranian situation from members of\nthis college seems somewhat\nmisdirected in view of the plight of\nminorities in Iran. The most violent\nrepression is occurring now in\nKurdistan. Kurdish cities have been\nindiscriminately bombed in an\nattempt to 'crush the rebels' as\nKhomeini has ordered. He has no\nqualms about using the military\nmight built up by his predecessor\nfor his own imperialistic adventures.\nA problem closer to the hearts of\nstudents is that of attacks on\nuniversities. Many students were\nmurdered only recently in a number\nof universities during violent\nclashes. Now examinations are\nbeing taken early as the universities\nare to be closed down because of\ndisagreements between university\nauthorities and government. The\nstudents of this college could make\nan effective protest to the Iranian\ngovernment by passing a motion in\nthe UGM condemning the persecution of students and attacks on\nthe higher education system. A telegram should then be sent to\nPresident Bani-Sadr informing him\nof the opinion of the Union.\nYours sincerely\nPhilip Nash\nnumber of non-whites are admitted\nto courses in certain technical\nsubjects at white universities, but\nare not allowed the social benefits\nof full membership of the university.\nThese courses are not offered by\nthe poorly-funded non-white colleges,\nwhich cannot of course afford\nrowing clubs.\nIt is ironic that Imperial College\nis offering collaboration with the\nSouth African nuclear industry,\nwhen a recently graduated Oxford\nPhD is now under house arrest for\nalleged spying on the installations\nof that industry. In the context of\nthe SA-Israeli H bomb project,\nsuch collaboration is against the\npolicy of the UK government. I am\nall for academic freedoms, but I would urge the Dean of City and\nGuilds to consult the Foreign\nOffice on this matter.\nFor reasons which I would be\nglad to explain to any Physics\nundergraduate (perhaps a good\ncomprehensive paper question for\nnext year?) the characteristic X ray\nemission of a4ki lot on atmospheric\nnuclear explosion is un mistake able The detection of this signature by\nthe Vela test-ban monitoring\nsatellite last September, during a South African naval exercise,\nshows how far this project has\nprogress d.

    "content": "CRICKET\nIC SUNDAY XI vs BAYGREEN\nSkipper Price won the toss for the sixth\nconsecutive time, this time using the\ndouble-tailed coin to maintain his\nunbeaten run this season (despite\nwinning the toss every game, though,\nhe's only won one match, drawn one,\nand lost the rest). He elected to bat on\na beautiful summer's afternoon.\nForshaw soon sacrificed his wicket by\nbeing stumped for 1. Then Chadwick\ncame in and dominated an hour long\npartnership of 72 with his contribution\nof 15. Meanwhile at the other end,\nStantiford was showing a bit more\ncalm and composure with his batting.\nHe took 58 minutes to reach his 50,\nbeing dropped only once on the long-on boundary. He was joined by\nMorton after Chadwick was caught,\nand the crowd were treated to two\nvastly different styles of batting.\nStantiford was punishing the bowling\nwith his usual textbook-style shots\nwhilst Morton, showing his forming\nbackground demonstrated most of the\nshots that you wouldn't find in textbooks.\nStantiford reached his 100 in just two\nhours and finally finished up with 127\nNO, including four 6s and twelve 4s whilst Morton scraped a meagre 61 NO in his ninety minutes at the crease.\nConsequently Price was able to\ndeclare at 210 for 2 at ten (reluctantly,\nthough, because he had lost the two\ngames in which he had previously\ndeclared).\nWHAT'SON FRIDAY 23rd MAY IC Christian Union Meeting, 6:30pm in\nthe Music Room,53 Princes Gate.

With talk on' God Now' by Vernon Blackmore.\nSenkiw and Morton opened the\nthrowing after ten. The former, although\nageing, showed plenty of class and\nwas most unlucky not to get a wicket\nin his opening spell. The latter,\nMorton, with a wider variety of short\nballs and long hops down the leg side\nmanaged to pick up the wicket caught\nby his partner Stantiford behind the\nstumps. The next bowler brought into\nthe fray was tennis player, Middelboe.\nHe bowel d with great spirit, if not skill\nand took a wicket in his mammoth\nfour over stint. Next we were treated\nto a truly breathtaking display of the\nart of spin-bowling, by Myers and\nPrice. Myers bowled over 11 overs, 1\nfor 30, the wicket being a diving catch\nby the skipper at mid-off. Price,\nkeeping his spinning ball for every\n10th over, managed with deceptive use\nof flight and pace to take four wickets\nfor 44 runs off 15 overs, all of them\nbeing cu a gh t off half volleys just\noutside the off stump. Despite these\nbreakthroughs and the re-introduction\nof Senkiw into the attack, Baygreen\nheld on to a draw and finished on 137\nfor 7. Forshaw helped Baygreen by\nvery ably dropping 2 catches in the\nslips off Senkiw's bowling. The evening\nwas crudely rounded off by Morton,\nStantiford and Middelboe suggesting\nvarious poetic phrases for the skipper to\nwrite on his 'good luck' card to, as\nMorton, put it, his 'passion flower'!\nTeam (only 10): Price, Morton,\nStantiford, Maguire, Clark, Chadwick,\nSenkiw, Myers, Middelboe and Forshaw.\nAEROS OC WIN\nAERON AUT ICAL CHALLENGE IC may have lost University Challenge, but C&G Aerosoc won\nAeronautical Challenge.\nAeronautical Challenge is an\nannual competition run by the\nGraduate and Students Section of\nthe Royal Aeronautical Society with\nthe same format as University\nChallenge.\nTeams of three, from each of the\nfour London sub-sections (Imperial,\nQueen Mary, City and Kingston\nPoly) competed against each other,\nanswering questions on aeronautical\nsubjects.\nIn the first round Imperial beat\nKingston Poly by 170 to 50 points\nand in the final we beat City by 130\nto 60 points.\nThe team consisted of Mike\nNapier (Aero 2), Paul Butcher\n(Aero 2) and Huw Robert (Aero 2).\nOnce again, this confirms the high\nstanding of Aeronautics students at\nIC.\nMerrie Mannassi\n(Chairman)\nBOAT\nCLUB\nNottingham City Regatta\nOver the weekend, the majority of the\nBoat Club were competing in the Two\nDay Nottingham City Regattas, held\non the Glare international course at\nthe National Watersports Centre.\nThe 1st VIII had a weekend of mixed\nfortunes. Competing in the Senior 'A' event on Saturday, their only opposition\ncame from Durham University. However,\nthe crew had a bad row and were\nbeaten by about two lengths. Sunday,\nhowever, was a different story, and\ndespite being down in the first part of\ntheir final they rowed well, and\neventually rowed through to win by\njust over a length'from Lady Margaret\nBC Cambridge.\nThe 2nd VIII, qualified easily for the\nfinal of the Senior ' C Vllls event, by\nfinishing third in their heat. A good\nstart gave them an early lead in the\nfinal, which they increased throughout\nthe race, to win by about three to four\nlengths. On Sunday, suffering from\nthe night before, and competing in a higher class, they were fifth in the\nSenior 'B' Vllls final.\nThe most unfortunate competition of\nthe weekend was novice Sculler\nAlistair Rowe. On Saturday he finished\nsecond In his final and seemed about\ncertain to win the same event on\nSunday. However, with about a minute\nto go in Sunday's final, as he was\ntaking the lead, equipment failure\nrobbed him of victory.\nThe Ladies Senior 'B' IV, had a very\nhard race with a Hereford RC crew in\ntheir Saturday final, but just managed\nto hold them off to win by about half a length. On Sunday, they had to row in\nthe Unclassified IVs event, where they\ncame up against a potential international crew from Thames RC. The\ngirls rowed well to keep in touch for\nthe first half of the race, eventually\nlosing by about four lengths to\nThames, but beating a Nottingham BC\ncrew.\nA Ladies Seniro ' C IV and a Ladies\nNovice IV were also entered for the\nSunday event, but neither of the crews\nrowed as well as they can, with the\nSenior ' C IV losing to a very good\nWallingford School crew.\nWinning Crews\nSenior 'A' Vllls (Sunday): Bill Bradbury\n(bow), Steve Webb, Matt Pritchard,\nChris Geary, Tony Reynolds, John\nUrry, Richard Fearnheard, Miles Fellows\n(stroke), Steve Crampton (cox).\nSenior ' C Vllls (Saturday): Bob\nMaddocks (bow), Steve Collier, Ed\nHobhouse, Chris Adams, Paul Gerrard,\nPete Allen, Tim Joslin, Pete Maysey\n(stroke), Ian Simpson (cox).\nLadies Senior 'B' IV (Saturday):\nAngela Burgess (bow), Gwen Griffiths,\nNonie Ray, Cathy Wein (stroke), Steve\nCramptan (cox).\n9\n\n"

(As from the 1980\nintake students will need to pass nine units,\nnot eight, for validation of degrees, a move\nstimulated by engineering departments which\nunlike ours use units).\nThe ULU constitution is under review; the\naims of the review body being firstly to make\nthe Sabbaticals more accountable (currently\nthey are responsible to only the annual joint\nassembly of Sports, Societies and SRC).\nSecondly, some reorganisation of the interrelationship of the three councils is needed, to\nease administrative and financial problems.\nThe annual SCR Executive report made\nplain the problems encountered by the six\nfaculty senators in trying to improve contact\nwith AAOs in their respective faculties. This is\nimportant, because these students are our\ncontact with the Senate of the University,\ngiving us all another line of representation,\nwhich at the moment is very under used.\nThe rest of the Exec reported work on\nStudent Grants (based on Bernard Smith's paper), Libraries and Lecturer Training.\nThe elections of next year's executive were\nthen ratified, including:\nJohn Passmore \u2014 Chairperson\nChris Webb \u2014 Senator for Science & Education\nBernard Smith \u2014 Executive Officer\nMotions debated were as follows:\n1. A motion from\u00bb Chelsea College Union\ncondemning the promotion deal done by NUS\nwith Philip Morris Tobacco Co (Marlboro, etc).\nHelen Connors, the National Treasurer, turned\nup to defend both the deal and the secretive\nmanner in which it was arranged, explaining\nthat it was designed simply to help finance\nstudent film societies. The motion was passed\noverwhelmingly nonetheless.\n2. ICU's Human Rights policy was passed after\nsome debate, centred on the clause containing\nthe assertion that \"the family is the natural and\nfundamental unit group of society . . . \" Frank\nJames finally explaining that families were natural\nin the most literal anthropological sense of the\nword.\n3. The final motion passed proposed by QMC\nUnion on the Chix Chewing Gum dispute; this\nconcerns the basic right of workers to join a Trade Union.\nThe meeting closed due to in quo racy( a very\nrare event) before the motion concerning\nsmoking during S RC meetings could be\ndiscussed.\nChris Webb\n6\n\n"

    "content": "A Modest Reply From Justin Newland\nTwo weeks ago, an essay entitled\n\"The American-Iranian Conflict:\nSome Historical Perspectives\"\nappeared in this magazine (FELIX\nIssue No 552, dated 9th May 1980).\nThe following week, a number of\nletters criticising my article were\npublished in FELIX. I should like to\nthank the Editor for allowing me\nthis opportunity to reply to these\ncriticisms.\nFirst of all, I humbly apologise to\nany and all Muslims whom I may\nhave offended by describing their\nreligion as Mohammedism, rather\nthan Islam. This was entirely due to\nmy ignorance.\nNow, the letter from Islamic\nSociety kindly informs us that \"the\nteachings of Islam . . . regard men\nand women ps equal before God\".\nWhile the italics are theirs, I would\nbe more inclined to emphasise the\nword \"regard\". Perhaps Islam\nregards equality in such a way that\nit bears an uncanny resemblance to\ngross inequality? Have you ever\nseen a Muslim man wearing a veil?\nNonetheless, I did admire the\nnimble dexterity with which they\nhave exploited the current situation:\nin the same letter, they tell us that\n\"the aim\" of sending us all their\nreligious propaganda was not to\ndisseminate the Muslim faith, but\non the contrary, \"was to clear\nmany misconceptions about Islam,\ncommon in England\". Indeed, I was\ninterested to read in their 'Brief\nGuild to Islam' that \"from dawn to\nsunset every day for thirty consecutive days . . . a Muslim voluntarily\ngives up eating, drinking and sexual\nhabits\". I wonder if they could\nexplain why, in some Muslim\ncountries, this \"voluntary\" activity\nis supported by legislation.\nYet I fully realise that this is a captious objection to a faith which\nis a magnificent spiritual sanctuary,\nbut whose articles, like those of\nChristianity, are being insistently\nquestioned.\nTwo critics commented on my\nliterary style. May I ask them, was\nmy essay merely a piece of prose,\nand nothing else? If so, then all\ncriticisms should have been aesthetic,\nFOR SALE r Rotel RP 900 Turntable and\nAmstrad IC 2000 amplifier.

But my\narticle was not a poem; it was a serious attempt to examine the\ncurrent American-Iranian struggle\nfrom both sides and to draw some\nhistorical analogies. Therefore, any\naesthetic comments should have\nbeen supplementary to a review of\nthe content of my work, and\nshould have been confined to a single issue: whether the style was\nappropriate to the content.\nIf I am to understand their\naesthetic judgements correctly,\nwriters in FELIX should use no\nmetaphor, simi lie, or any literary\nembellishment save clich es, and\nGod forbid if they should ever\nquote any foreign words and\nannotate these with their meanings.\nAnd eternal damnation to an\nauthor whose vocabulary forces\nhis readers to pore over a dictionary.\nOn a personal note, I cannot\nbelieve that my essay offended Ms\nAnn-Marie Tomsett as much as her\nspiteful, vindictive letter wounded\nme.\nHowever, this same lady suggested\nthat my essay should have been\nentitled \"The American-Iranian\nConflict: Some Personal Historical\nPerspectives\". Allied to her objection\nthat my work was \" . . . opinionated\n. . . verbal ten es mus\"( what the hell\ndoes that mean?), these arguments\nmay seem like those of a fool\nwhose bolt is soon shot.

I should say here that, as a good citizen, I believe everything I read in newspapers, down to the\nlast monosyllable in the Sun. How\ncan the British Press be slandered\nin such a way when, for example,\njust recently they unerringly\nexplained to the curious British\npublic just why the Day of Action\nhad been called? God forbid! It\nwould be like accusing these\nhonourable journalists of distracting\nthe attention of the public from the\ncentral issue (ie, the present\nadministration's iniquitous policies)\nby creating a ballyhoo about Len\nMurray's holiday.\nIndeed, the same critic thought\nthat my conclusion \"we must look\nbeyond . . . the framework of\ninternational law for the eventual\nresolution of this crisis\", did not\naccount for the presence of the\nUN to deal with such situations.\nWell, I suppose they have managed\nit so well that they have already\nresolved the conflict, but are\nkeeping it a secret for the time\nbeing? Like its illustrious predecessor, the League of Nations,\nwhose mere existence did so much\nto halt the onset of the Second\nWorld War, the United Nations has\nfeathered its cap by preventing the\nSuez crisis, the Korean and Vietnam\nwars, and a couple of Middle-East\nwars to boot. Seriously though, I accept that the UN may help\nresolve international quarrels once\nthey have arisen, but are their\nconventions universally recognised,\nor, more to the point, are they\nnever broken?\nHowever, it was this alert gentleman who alone raised any fresh\nquestions on the content of my\nessay. His realistic analysis, as far\nas it went, was excellent, but in\nsome places, dogmatic. At one\npoint, he states that: \"If the\nAmericans agreed to the terms\ndemanded this would then put\nevery foreign embassy in the world\nat risk.\" Here he fails to establish\n.35 Rotring drawing pen and .25\nnib. \u00a33.50 for both.

Incidentally, new evidence seems to\nsuggest that one reason the Americans refused to comply with this\ndemand was that the ex-Shah had\nenormous dollar holdings in the\nUS\nWhile I do not have the space to\ncomment on some other pertinent\ncriticisms raised by Mr Goulder, I will say this: in my opinion, it is\nnow irrelevant whether the Americans accede to the terms of the\nIranian students, in so far as the\ncurrent vogue in terrorism has\nshifted from plane-hijacking to\nattacking embassies.\nFinally, any discerning reader of\nmy original article will have realised\nthat I deliberately adopted a stance\nof non-alignment; hence the criticisms levelled against me by both sides. I repeat my claim that the one\npositive common factor shared by\nthe American and Iranian people is\nthat they are each and all members\nof the human race.

    "content": "Studentae Imperialis\na review of the species\nThe average visitor to South Kensington rarely\nconcerns himself with anything other than one\nor more of the numerous museums, or\nperhaps the Albert Hall. It is easy, amongst the\ngrandiose Victorian architecture, to overlook\nthe shabby, inconspicuous inhabitants of the\narea. More than a casual glance, however, will\nsoon reveal the exciting variety of creatures to\nbe found. One of the most interesting of these\nis Studentae imperial is. It is only recently that\nbiologists have been able to describe this\nspecies, and I present here a review of the\nwork so far.\nStudentae imperial is is confined to the South\nKensington area, where there is a total\npopulation of 4,000 individuals. Because there\nis great variation in appearance, behaviour and\nhabitat, five sub-species, or variants, have been\ndescribed.\nThe 'type' species is normal is. This is the\nmost common variety, comprising 80-90% of\nthe population, and is believed to be the most\nprimitive. Normalis is a placid, dull creature. It\navoids crowds, and prefers warm, safe\nenvironments such as lecture theatres and\nlibraries. Males and females are difficult to\ndistinguish, due to their similar habits of dress.\nHowever, males do vastly outnumber females.\nThe result of this unbalanced distribution of\nthe sexes is that a high proportion of normal is males have poor eyesight and have to wear\nspectacles. Although solitary by nature, normal is occasionally joins a group of five to\nten individuals to form a 'clique'. These cliques\nare uncommunicative and withdrawn when\nconfronted by other individuals, and can often\nbe seen sitting by themselves in a circle in a common room or bar. These groups are\nextremely boring, and the keen naturalist\nshould not waste time observing them.\nThe most common variant after normal is is\nsocial us, which accounts for between ten and\ntwenty percent of the population. This colourful variant is friendly and affectionate.\nThey are more adaptable than normal is, and\nhave a consequently more diverse habitat.\nRarely found in libraries, social us can often be\nfound in bars, pubs, or the noisy crowded\nplaces which normal is avoids. This variant\nwould undoubtedly increase in numbers and\nbring about the extinction of normal is if it were\nnot for the activity of the predator Examiner\nimperial is. This seasonal creature appears for a month in the early summer. Whereas the\nhabitat and behaviour of normal is makes it\nu nap pet ising to the predator, poor social us is\nhighly vulnerable, and the population may\nbe drastically reduced. (Indeed, the fear of the\npredator may be so great that a social us individual may spontaneously revert to a normal is, becoming just as drab and boring,\nand frequenting the same habitats.) Unlike\nnormal is, where copulation is unknown, social us may practice a primitive form of\nsexual reproduction. The production of young\nis rare.\nThree other small but important varieties\nhave been observed. The largest of these is\nvulgaris. This evolved from social us, but is\nundoubtedly degenerate. There are one\nhundred and fifty or so individuals, each having\nits own distinctive behaviour pattern. Vulgaris,\nwhich is often found in the Union Bar, is\nmorphologically dissimilar to the other varieties, usually being thick-set and rather\nugly. One interesting feature is that the right\narm may be better developed than the left.\nThis may be due to the unusual diet, which is\nhigh in liquid content. Other authorities believe\nthat, like the eyesight of normal is males, it is\ndue to the relative scarcity of females. Vulgaris\ncan be one one of the most interesting\ncreatures for the,keen naturalist to study. One\nof Nature's most delightful spectacles is to see\na vulgaris individual bend his head towards the\nground, to hear the distinctive gurgle-splash-gur lge splash sound that indicates that he is\nhaving, or rather, has just had, a good time.\nThere are only four individuals of the fourth\nvariant, Sabbaticalus. They have a short lifecycle of only one year. Nothing useful can be\nsaid about them, other than that they make a lot of noise, out of all proportion to their size.\nThe rarest variant is the much sought after\nEroticus. These females are highly attractive to\nmales of all the other varieties. They are\nextremely rare, and a live individual has not\nbeen recorded for many years. Some authorities\nclaim the variety is extinct, and others claim it\nis a mythical creature that has never existed\noutside the warped minds of social us and\nvulgaris males. It is claimed, however, that\nthere is a stuffed specimen in the Natural\nHistory Museum. This is hard to believe, since\nit is well established that it is virtually impossible to stuff such a female.\nIn summary, it can be seen that Studentae\nimperial is is an extremely interesting creature.\nSo, for an exciting day out with the kids, get\nout the car and drive down Prince Consort\nRoad. Remember, keep the windows closed,\ndon't get out of the car, and definitely do not\nfeed them!\nDave Attenborough\nLife Sci 2\nAft\nCITY AND GUILDS\nDespite having said that last week's article would probably be my last, my arm has been slightly twisted and a typewriter\nput in front of me, so here it is.\nThe Seaside Trip on Saturday was well\nattended with negative empty seats being\navailable on the coach. The weather was\nvery good when we left Beit Arch but a few clouds appeared as we approached our destination. Yes it was Margate. On arrival the first task was to sample the\nsea and a few stalwart (foolish) members of Guilds rushed towards the sea. They rushed away from the sea pretty quickly\nas well due to temperature dependent shortening effects although some people\nmanaged to stay in the sea. As normal, once everybody had left the sea the sun\ndecided to come out and the rest of the\nday was rather good. After a few pints\nand some greasy fish and chips we all\nwent off to the fun fair to try and find a way to get rid of the food. Most of the\nrides were tried. Jo liked one so much she was seen staggering away from it\nafter having-had two rides. Most people's overdrafts were considerably increased and a good time was had by all. I don't remember much of the return trip as I fell asleep until we reached the pub on\nthe way back.\nNow on to an event you will probably\nnot know about. As we have collected\nabout \u00a318,200 this year for Rag, it was\ndecided at Rag Committee that it would be a terrifically spiff ing idea if we could increase this total to over \u00a320,000. To this\nend there will be a final massive Rag collection on14 th June. Don't worry, most people's exams will have finished so\nthere is no reason for not turning up.\nFurther details of this will be available\nfrom the Office and in next week's FELIX.

For those of you who\nenjoyed the original, I can assure you that The Empire won't be in the\nleast disappointing.\nThe original cast return in their\nfamiliar roles along with a few\ninteresting newcomers. Darth Vader, having survived the destruction of the\nDeath Star, is out for revenge. He eventually finds the secret rebel base\non the ice planet Hoth, where Luke, Han, the Princes, et al are hiding.\nThey are attacked in spectacular style\nby hugh mechanical walking 'tanks' \u2014\na real triumph for the effects team of\nGeorge Lucas. In the confusion Luke takes R2-D2 off to the marsh world\nof Dagobah, where he is tutored by\nYoda, an 800 year old Jedi master.\nYoda is no strapping hero though;\nthe character was created by Muppet man Frank Oz and is rather like a cross between Gonzo the Great and\na hobbit.\nMeanwhile the others escape in the\nMillenium Falcon through an asteroid\nstorm, again utilising a series of\nmagnificent special effects. Their paths\neventually converge on the cloud city\nof Be spin, where Darth Vader finally\nconfronts Luke. Luke Skywalker rides a taunt a un on the ice planet Hoth.\nThe newcomers are Lando Calrissian,\nan old friend of Han Solo and\nthe mercenary Bob a Fett. Lando turns\nout to be quite a hero, but little is made\nof Bob a Fett who will obviously figure\nprominently in the next episode of the\nsaga.\nIn true Star Wars style, the plot is\na non-stop action romp which\npretends to be nothing but entertaining.\nA little love interest filters in, but to\nmy mind the outstanding strong point of the film is the special effects. The wooden acting pales into insignificance\nwhen supported by the stunning\nDarth Vader confronts Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett.\nillusions, which are created by George Lucas' company, Industrial Light and\nMagic. The spacecraft weave in and\nout of asteroids and swoop down into craters; -the dinosaur-like taunt a uns run freely across the snow of\nHoth and sparks fly as light sabers\nclash again. All great stuff.\nFinally, the confusing bit. If you\nthought Star Wars was the beginning\nof the saga then you're wrong; Lucas is planning a NINE part saga in\nwhich Star Wars and The Empire are\nparts 4 and 5. These will be followed\nby \"Revenge Of The Jedi\", part 6.\nThen two other trilogies are planned;\n1 to 3 explain Vader's development\nand 7 to 9 will probably be the\ndownfall of the Empire. It's difficult to\nsee how long the appeal will last, but\nat the moment I can't wait to see\nthe next instalment. So until the\nRevenge Of The Jedi . . . .\nMTF B WY( pure corn).\nMark Smith\nForeign Oskar Winners\nTwo other films well worth mentioning are The\nTin Drum (X, Odeon Haymarket) and Get\nOut Your Handkerchiefs (X, Curzon), both\nof which won oscars for the best foreign film.\nThe former concerns the development of Nazi\nGermany as seen through the eyes of Oskar, a three year old boy of uncanny talents. Not only\ndoes he refuse to grow up, but he has a glass\nshattering scream. The film is quite fascinating,\nbut drags in places.\nBetter, however, is the latter. A young man\ndecides to give his wife away to another man in\norder to make her smile, which eventually\nleads to further affairs with a neighbour and\nthen a very nasty child genius,\nstylish and at times very\nenjoyable, indeed.\nThe humour is\nsubtle. Very\nMark Smith\n7\n\n"
