Yes, after more speculation\nand bated breath than someone who is waiting for the return of Elvis, we can tell you that\nthe Fat of the Land will be out on 30the of June\n(yes, this year). Probably.\nIf you enjoyed that little gem, then here is\nanother one. Ian Brown is underway on his\nsolo project. Things are not completely simple,\nthough. 'Who else is playing on the record?',\nOCTOPUS\nThe Borderline\nyou may ask. Well, none other than former\nband-mates Mani and Reni. The working title of\nthe album is Under The Pavement The Beachsomething to do with the French riots in the\n1960's, apparently.

I had been informed by my Northern African Correspondent that Khaled\nwas an African singer currently living in exile.\nAs for Anokha, I was led to believe that he\nwould provide a more ambient sound spiced\nwith tabla s. The Astoria had magically been transformed\ninto a temple filled with a heaving throng of\nrampant worshippers celebrating an alien\nform of music which clearly made their ears go\npop. This is a venue where, mere days ago, I had been witness to the traditional rock n' roll\nvalhalla where Faith No More were playing\none of the gigs of the year. There were circles\nof short blok es dancing around each other\nwith their arms raised above their heads to\nmake them look taller. There were tall blok es with other tall blok es on their shoulders and\neven in the upper circle, people were trying to\nreach higher, dancing on the tables and generally strutting their stuff and all shouting '1,2,\n3 Vive L 'Algerie!' And this was between\nsongs...\nGiven such a friendly crowd, the two acts\ncould hardly fail and they didn't. DJ Anokha\nplayed a solid set of crowd-pleasing anthems\nwhich would clearly have guaranteed a good\nresponse at various Algerian equivalents of the\nHippodrome. Musically, it sounded like a combination Latin and African rhythms with a thumping beat and a collection of chant-be-happy choruses. The mood was that of a summer carnival in a carefree tropical location in\nthe sun.\nThe tempo slowed a little as Khaled took to\nthe stage with his nine-piece band, but the\nsong remained the same. Maybe because\nthese are the only references that I have but I felt that a lot of the songs had the potential to\nburst into a chorus of Yeke Yeke or swing into\nthe the Lambada.\nWorld music, Worlds apart.\nSid\nmusic\n\n"

It ended in glory; promotion to UL U Division m, and the\nDivision TV Championship. Albeit,\nthe top spot was achieved by the narrowest possible margin- level on\npoints with Royal Holloway, but\nhaving a better goal difference by\nre calculated, the truth was realised:\nImperial Shit On The Holloway! (All\ntogether now... If I had the wings of a sparrow...).\nPerhaps not very sporting, but if\nthere's one team I hate (more than\nBolton Wankerers) then it is RH.\nAnd so it was all the sweeter that earlier in the season our biggest win was\nBack: Nak, Paul, Adam, Morgan, Pete, (withheld), Dan, (withheld).\nFront row: Ryan, Darren, Stu', Andy, Geordie.\none, that's one, goal! But so what-we've got the medals!\nGoing into the last game of the\nseason versus Goldsmith Ills we\nthought only a victory would give us\nthe Championship, so after a topsy-tur vy game which saw us go 1-0 up,\n2-1 down, miss a penalty, then 3-2\ndown before finally equal ising in the\nlast minute we were despondent. It\nwas not until numerous 'phone calls\nback and forth to Holloway HQ and\nthen an agonising wait whilst the\ngoal differences were calculated and\nover them and at the same time\nemphasising our superiority over the\nrest of the division. It was the first\ngame after the mid-season break (aka\nChristmas Hols) and IC produced\ntheir most fluent, skilful performance\nwith their full-strength team to win 6-1. It could have been a lot more.\nThe league should have been won\nby a more convincing margin, and\nwould have been if a full-strength\nteam had been available more often,\nbut events conspired against us to\nsuch extents that for many games our\ntop players were out for various rea-sons- and for one game we were\nmissing nine first-choice players,\nneedless to say, we didn't win.\nWe played in some remarkable\ngames this season, for example when\nwe were 2-0 down in the first game\nversus Goldsmiths with only three\nminutes to go (honestly). We won.\nOr 2-0 down halfway through the\nsecond half versus UCL V; we won.\nThirteen goals were scored in two\ngames against UMDS, eight against\nSOP, with none conceded. At home\nwe totally outplayed LSE who finished third, thrashed the fourth\nplaced team, QM WC IV, away.\nWhat a season!\nIn BUSA we had a remarkable\nsequence; in the London group\nmatches, often playing against teams\nin higher divisions, we won our\ngroup. The reward for this was a home tie versus the University of\nEast Anglia. On another day we\nmight have won, mistakes put us 2-0\ndown early on, and although we\npulled it back to 3-2 down, another\nbreak-away goal finally put paid to\nour gallant efforts. The UL U Cup for\nwhich we were the favourites- borne\nout by the fact that the final was\nbetween RH V and QMWC IV- did-n't go well. In fact, we were defeated\nin the first round, at home, against a team who would only win one other\ngame all season and finish bottom of\nthe entire London League- proverbially 92nd in the Football League!\nPerhaps it is wrong to single out\nindividuals since this was a comA third sports editorial\nWith the summer approaching and\nthoughts of sports mainly drifting\nfrom our collective minds it's nice to\nreflect on what has been achieved by\nthe brave and bold sportsmen of IC.\nAbove is an extensive account of the\nseason of the football fourths. If any\nother teams want the opportunity to\nhave your pictures and a retrospective of your season in Felix then all\nyou have to do is write from one to\neight hundred words (or get someone\nto write them for you, rug ger players)\nand hand them in with or without a picture to the Felix offices in Beit\nQuad. Simple, really.\nI must mention the Thursday\nnight skate as it really is jolly good\nfun. It meets at about a quarter to ten\npm outside Mech eng and finishes at\nsome point in the morning in\nTrafalgar Square. Inbetween there\nare fun and frolics suitable for expert\nskaters down to people who can go\nalong and stop but nothing else. This\nreally is a unique and exciting\nevening that allows you to skate the\nstreets of London with some tip-top\nskaters who are willing to help you to\nimprove. So either turn up at nine\nforty five or look on the notice board\non the Sherfield walkway. Bye.\nbin ed effort, but the thirteen players\non the team photo, along with Jamie,\nwere the core and casing of the\nsquad. The young Tippayawong,\nplayer of the year, simply a superstar\nin midfield, Darren, who scored 26 in\n17 games, Sion and his stunning hat-trick; the third of which we'll never\nforget. When we were down to ten\nmen, the left back appeared in the\nright winger's position, swung his\ntrusty boot (the one not held together\nby tape) and then glory was his!\nMorgan, the second highest scorer with 13 goals, produced a great contribution which culminated\nin him scoring the crucial third goal\nin our last game, effectively winning\nus the Championship, which he\nkeeps telling us, though we know it\nwas a combined effort. Andy, David,\nJamie, Paul, Ryan, Adam, Pete,\nChris, Mike as well as the other 18\nwho played at some stage during the\nseason all deserve massive credit.\nWhich just leaves me; the 'keeper for\nwhom the phrase, 'Harlington\nHowler' was written, made far too\nmany mistakes to mention here, but I don't care; we've got the medals;\nwe've got the Championship. Just\nremember, 'I'm Stu...'!\nOnto the future, Morgan, Mike and\nSion will soon be signing on, Pete\nwill be dazzling Europe next year\nand Andy will lead the fourths to\ncarry on the fine traditions of IC foot-ball.\nGood luck everybody and thanks\nto everyone at ICAFC, especially\nthose wonderful second-team ers. Cricketers conquer UCL\nJust ten men, that's all it took! The\nday started badly with two last-minute cry-offs so we went up to\nScotland, or somewhere North of the\nM25, without a full team. We lost the\ntoss and were put into bat on a slow,\ndamp, wet pitch with drizzly weather\nconditions which meant the match\nwas reduced to a35 over slog.\nA solid start was made by the two\nopeners scoring 48 off the first 13\novers. Then a typical middle order\ncollapse saw us staring 54 for 4 in the\nface. The inning was then stabilised\nby a veteran and a majestic 61 from\nour Sri-LankanAVest Indian, Jay.\nThe score was pushed along and after\nthe final five overs were tw at ted by\nJameil Akabar we were in the strong\nposition of 197-6 off the 35 overs.\nAnd all this with only ten men!\nUCL's innings saw us take the\nfield in a confident mood and we set\nto the task of reducing them to what\nthey were - stinking pools of putrid\njelly without a cricket ing bone in\ntheir invertebrate bodies. With 20\novers left we had won the game easily - thanks must go to our two leg\nspinners Barry Richards and Jon\nAinsworth. In the end our first win of\nthe season was a demolition of UCL.\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUMS MUSIC FOR PLEASURE\nMonaco\nPeter Hook, formerly of Joy Division, got his\nnew band off to a flying start with the release\nof their debut and immensely catchy single\nWhat Do You Want From Me?. Admittedly I have only heard a couple of songs by Joy\nDivision and. to be honest, I didn't become an\ninstant fan. However, the sheer exuberance of\nthe aforementioned single meant that I had to\ngive the album a listen. I couldn't imagine\nmissing out on any similar gems possibly contained within.\nSo, lying back, I let the waves of the first single wash over me again, which soon brought\nme to the second track called Shine. This was a dreamy tune that mixed pop and melancholy\nsentimentality perfectly. Half of the album follows this trend with more guitar pop in the\nsemi-bluesy Buzz Cum and the summery\nHappy Jack. The 80s New Order influence is\nUPSLIOE\nSarah CracRnell\nSo you think you know Sarah, do you? Just\nsome random airhead that Pete and Bob\nroped in to give St. Etienne a bit of sparkle, a bit\nof that old star class, hell, even to make the\npress shots look better. You bunch of cynics.\nYou're just the people that Crackers is going to\ngrind under her stacked heels with this album.\nIf you were expecting typically Etienne slices of\nknowing cool, never sure if they're being ironic\nor not, then you're in for a shock. Because\nSarah is obviously a hopeless romantic, and\nwhile the boys were off foot ling around with\nsequencers and stuff, she's been hard at work\nwith a whole bunch of other producers and\nsongwriters crafting an album of gorgeous\ntunes brimming with love, hope and disappointment. Wide-eyed honesty is the outstanding feature\nhere. On Coastal Town she gets Grace to\nbudge over a bit on the park-bench of happy\nhouse anthems, and still manages to sound\nwistful in 'a coastal town, after the rain/You're\nthe brightest star, you're my best friend'. She\nknows that the sweetest things always have a bitter aftertaste, and by coupling the most exuberant electronica with yearning lyrics (Desert\nBaby) you get songs with a mighty emotional\npunch. She doesn't get it right all the time,\nthough, and as the middle third of the album\nproves ifs all too easy to slip from musical simplicity into banality. Taxi is just too damn bland\nto have any impact and on Taking OffFor\nFrance the ideas are all there but lack the arse-kicking from Oakenfold would provide. But by\nthe time the disco funk of If You Leave Me\ncomes around, she's back on track strutting\ncrystal clear throughout and is necessary to\nmake this album sound as good as it does.\nIfs not all straight-up guitar pop. Songs like\nSweet Lips veer away, sending a thumping\ndisco style tumult of energy towards your ears.\nThere aren't just a couple of dance tracks\nthrown in here either. Four quality affairs\nabound, like the ethereal trip hop edge of Billy\nBones or Junk with its typical bassline foundation that features heavily as the backbone of\nthe whole album. Undeniably there is nothing\ndated about the tracks - they are definitely\nplaced in the sphere of 90s music.\nThe album closes with a bleak instrumental\nthat sounds as though its sole purpose is to\nprovide a balance to the cheerful melodies that\nadorn the rest of the recording. At the end of\nthe recording, you're instructed to turn it off, but\nI had to refuse, and reach for play again. (8)\nJason\nattitude and defiance with Aretha, Gloria and\nthe girls in tow. The whole lot is neatly book-ended by Ready or Not and Can't Stop Now,\nboth saturated with sweeping strings and\nhoney vocals that unashamedly push all those\nbuttons guaranteed to have a tear in your eye.\nLipslide is certainly a flawed album, but still\none to be treasured. (7)\nNorm\nRED APPLE FALLS\nSmog\nJust how depressed do you feel at the\nmoment? Girlfriend left you? Exams getting you\ndown? Conservative? Well, here's something to\ncheer you up - you're pro ably happier than\nSmog, members of that quietly flourishing\nbreed of indie miser ab lists who believe that a song isn't worth its salt unless its either (a) slow\nand unhappy or (b) just unhappy. Listening to\nthis sparse, mostly percussion-free album and\nits tales of loss and loneliness makes you feel\nlike an intruder, as though you'd happened\nupon a friend's diary and been unable to resist\nreading it; a guilty pleasure.\nMost of the songs consist of a strummed guitar and piano, maybe a little D russ; meres no\nbravado, no machismo, the music is still and\nquiet. The rough production serves to enhance\nthe rawness of the sound, the imperfections in\nthe singer's voice are more noticeable, the\ncracks more like choked-back tears. This all\nmakes the songs that dare to break into a trot,\nsuch as the Giant Sand-esque / Was A Stranger, sound incongruous - an unnecessary\neffort to lighten the mood. They are better when\nthey are simply being miserable.\nA charge of self-indulgence, of navel-gazing\nto the nth degree could easily be levelled at\nTHE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE\nThe Foo Fighters\nA quick history lesson: Dave Grohl, drummer\nfor the mildly influential grunge band Nirvana.\nIn 1993 Kurt Cobain, frontman of Nirvana, has\nan unfortunate accident with a rifle killing him-self. Now this leaves poor Dave unemployed.\nSo instead of signing on, the young lad\ndecides to collect together all those coppers he\nearned from tips and the few coins thrown on\nstage whilst he was touring the pub circuits\nwith the aforementioned band and form his\nown record label, Roswell, and a band, the\nFoo Fighters. He cobbled together the first\nalbum in a matter of minutes, playing all the\ninstruments himself and even singing! Five\ndays after he recorded the album he got the\nrest of the band together and was away. The\nepo nimo us ly titled album gained great critical\nacclaim.\nAnd now, two years later. The Colour and\nthe Shape, is the first Foo Fighters album\nrecorded by the band as a whole. To call this\nalbum punctuated would be an understate-ment. It starts off with the gentle, floating track\nDoll, all one minute twenty-three seconds of it.\nAnd then, BAM!, straight into the mammoth\nrock song that is Monkey Wrench, their current\nsingle. Indeed this seems to be the\nnew Foo Fighters formula, quiet intros\nfollowed by blinding guitar rock, with\na quiet end (or any mix and match\ncombination of those three.) But there KOl^/i is a more introspective feel to several of the\ntracks especially the acoustic tracks, See You\nand Walking After you. Songs like these show\nthe other side to the Foo's muscle rock norm\nand are a great addition to the album. Only\nthe sluggish five minute ballad February Stars\ntakes the introspection one step too far and\nyou watch in amazement as the life is visibly\nsapped from your body. However you are easily revived by the scorching pop song Up in\nArms and the sublime Everlong.\nThe Colour and the Shape is a very good\nalbum indeed. To describe it as rock does not\ndo it justice. Overall it is a big, hard-sounding\nalbum, something that is not popular with the\nBritish music buying public at the moment. But\nwith popular bands, the likes of Supergrass\nand Radiohead, producing a more hard\neU ye U yui lui ju un j this muy b \u00ab 1\n1 i cwo ys nw1089/ n ahead. (8)\nRamzi\nSmog. But music is a subjective thing, we need\ndifferent things at different times to reflect our\nchanging moods. No-one's happy all the time -it's all about empathy. On the other hand,\nmaybe they are just miserable bastards and\nI'm in the right kind of mood. Who knows? (7)\nK.S. Pulaski\nmusic\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 3 0 TH MAY COLUMNS 17\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nLast Thursday,\n* 111 Mr Blair invited Mrs Thatchi r% er round to 10\nDowning Street for advice on policy\nand strategy. In most other jobs,\nincumbents would expect to get\nsome advice from their predecessors,\nbut the office of Prime Minister is not\n\"most other jobs\". This meeting went\nun publicised until Sunday when\nLabour leaked it for some good pub-li city. It is a shame that it came out\nthis way, because the meeting was a wholly sensible idea for someone\nnew to the job. Mr Blair has already\nsought the advice of Paddy\nAshdown, and although he declined\nJohn Major's offer of advice on how\nto handle the IGC conference, he did\nconsult him on Northern Ireland.\nIndeed, Mr Blair is going one step\nfurther in inviting President Clinton\nto address the Cabinet, the first foreign leader to do so.\nSo what are we to make of this?\nSome people were not slow off the\nmark with their opinions, notably\nDenis Healey, who criticised Mr\nBlair for seeking the advice of\nLabour's greatest enemy for over a decade, calling it \"a bad choice\" to\ntalk with a woman who had been a \"disaster\" and had \"destroyed British\ninfluence in Europe\". On Tuesday\nThe Guardian's quite charming cartoonist compared Thatcher with\nReagan, Hider, Napolean, Genghis\nKhan and what seemed to be\nHannibal Lecter, in an array of personalities Mr Blair was inviting in for\na chat. Quite apart from its usual\nsledgehammer subtlety, The\nGuardian is missing the point. Mr\nBlair is not advocating Mrs\nThatcher's policies, but simply\nrecognising her immense political\nexperience on the world stage. Not\neven her most ardent enemy can\ndoubt that she has amassed a wealth\nof experience and contacts, and association with her will impress many\nforeign leaders, especially those in\nAsia, who particularly admire her.\nDuring the meeting they discussed\na wide variety of issues, with a spokesman saying \"she has strong\nviews. She was opinionated and it\nwas stimulating ... he didn't find her\nshort of opinions.\" Her most conspicuous advice was \"Choose your\nground carefully. Make up your mind\nwhat is important. Don't fight on\nground on which you cannot win.\"\nMr Blair had decided on the meeting\nbecause he liked her on a personal\nlevel, and that she still is \"a figure on\nthe world stage and knows many of\nthe leading players.\" It seems perfectly reasonable for the pair to discuss foreign affairs.\nThere are, of course, a number of\nsubjects on which Mrs Thatcher is\nvehemently opposed to Labour's plans: Europe springs instantly to\nmind. But although it may be difficult for the Labour party to admit,\nMrs Thatcher was right about a number of issues long before anyone else\nsaw them. She had built up a close\nrelationship with Mikhail Gorbachev\nduring the 1980s, culminating in her\n1987 trip to Moscow. She is widely\nrespected in Eastern Europe as one of\nthe first Western leaders to see the\nimportance of the reforms and democratic movement there during the\n1980s. Among the natural differences\nbetween Thatcher and Blair, there are\ncertain similarities which Blair\nwould quite happily see confirmed.\nBoth used their time in opposition to\nplan for Government: witness the\nspeed of reform in the first few\nweeks of this Government if any of\nyou have any doubts. Both moulded\nthe party in their image, and both\nhave engendered a sense of trust in\nthe population, confirmed by their\ncomfortable mandates. I'm sure Mr\nBlair would like to see Mrs\nThatcher's reputed understanding of\nBritish interests abroad, strong lead-er ship, the youth vote and a firm\nhand with her party, added to the list\nof common attributes.\nBlair is looking to be seen by history as a statesman rather than a politician, much as Thatcher is\nalready seen today. He has the\nadvantage that his direct predecessor\nnever had: the chance to implement\nfresh policies and break new ground\nwithout U turning on archaic policy.\nBlair's policies have different roots\nto those of his predecessors: Thatcher\npulled the centre of gravity of Britsh\npolitics so far to the right as to precipitate a wholesale change in the\nLabour party, and ironically shatter\nthe Conservatives. Mr Blair is one of\nThatcher's children as much as any\nof us.\nHaving made one slightly askew\nelection prediction this year, it was\nreassuring to find that my p sep ho logical skills have not completely\ndeserted me.\nThe latest Presidential election\nwent absolutely to form, and I can't say I'm surprised or disappointed.\nCommiserations must, of course, go\nto the defeated candidate, but the\nflippancy of her campaign sealed her\nfate a log time ago. Call me an old\ncynic (everyone else has), but it had\nCV bolstering written all over it. If\nthe list of names bandied around for\nthe third run are correct, I feel confident that we should have a satisfactory outcome before Christmas.\nThe scarcity of talent this year\ndoes raise an important question. If\nwe fail to elect someone in the next\nballot, is it time to move to a non-sabbatical president? I can almost\nhear the sharp intake of breath by the\nhacks. Scrap a Sabb? Thin end of the\nwedge! Next you'll be suggesting\ncutting the Union Council to a sensible number. The problem seems to\nbe that too much has been dumped at\nthe door of the President, necessitating the full-time nature of the post.\nSurely the role of the President is\nakin to that a board chairman - chair\nthe key meetings, represent the\nUnion and help formulate policy.\nThe daily grind of paper work is\nsurely more\npresidency on the grounds that they\ncould not afford to defer a job or\nSimon Baker Ty^'ZI unexpected\nknock on benefit of\nthis could\nwell be to\nopen up the\nposition to a wider body\nof students,\nas hinted at\nin A Swift's letter last\nweek.\nWhile the\ncharges made against\nEric were\nunfair, the\nbroader point about\nthe clique y nature of\nICU was\nwell the task of\nthe permanent Union\nstaff and the\nDeputy presidents etc.\nBefore Piers\nand Sarah\nseek me out\nwith a meat\ncleaver, I would argue\nthat this is\nwhere a sabbatical post\nwould be\nbetter placed.\nThey are, as I well know,\nnot sitting\naround with\ntheir feet up,\nand nor is\nEric (as for \u2022 f the editor of voice of reason\nthis august\njournal...).\nMoving work from the President\nto the DPs and their staff seems a possible solution. In this way, people would not be deterred from the\nobserved. The ability to recite the Union\nConstitution verbatim is not a strong\nquality in a candidate. Indeed such a slavish adulation of rules, regulations and the sound of one's own\nvoice should ensure that such people\nnever make it past the Tiddly Wink\nSoc Social Committee.'However, all\nof the above may be of mere academic interest if some of the excellent\npotential candidates throw their hats\ninto the ring. Cometh the hour,\ncometh the man.\nCouple of quick points before my\nfingers seize up from all this typing.\nSome of you who regularly visit\nLuigi Malone's may have noticed a change in their attitude towards\nlarge groups at lunchtime, namely\nthe refusal to accept bookings for\nmore than ten. A shame indeed,\ngiven their incomparable Santa Fe\nchicken pizza.\nEver keen to bring you, dear read-er, the highest level of service, may I recommend The Rat & Parrot on\nGloucester Road, on the site of the\nold Harrington public house. The\ntransformation is magnificent in\nevery sense, save for the fact that the\nbeer is still rather average. The food,\nhowever, is superb. My suggestion\nfor that Friday long-lunch - Classic\nClub sandwich at said establish-ment, followed by a couple of quick\npints of divine summer ales at\nSouthside before closing time.

    "content": "The Grill The unlikely-named heroine of The Spitfire Grill is Percy\nTalbot, played by Alison Elliot, a young woman just\nreleased from prison. She heads for the town of Gilead\nwhere the local sheriff arranges for her to work at the\nSpitfire Grill, a restaurant which is owned by Hannah\nFerguson (Ellen Burstyn). One is left wondering why\nHannah is so willing to give Percy lodgings and a job considering that Percy is treated with so much mistrust and\nprejudice by the rest of the town. Perhaps the fact that\nHannah's dog takes to Percy is a major influence on her!\nDespite being a hopeless cook events lead to Percy taking over in the running of the restaurant, along with\nHannah's nephew's wife, or something like that. The two\nbecome friends and a bit of female bonding occurs\nbefore secrets are revealed, such as the circumstances\nwhich led to Percy's imprisonment and an explanation for\nHannah's apparently bizarre act of leaving a sack of food\neach night outside the restaurant. Ifs not all happy fam i lies, however, as some money goes missing from a safe,\ntriggering events which culminate in tragedy.\nLight on plot, The Spitfire Grill's main dramatic driving\nforce is Percy's struggle to destroy the townspeople's prejudice and her search for a sense of belonging. The film's strengths lie in the beautiful naturalistic scenery and sympathetic heroine, with Jodie Foster look-alike, Elliot, being\nan actress to look out for in future. Our sympathy for her is\nmade stronger by the fact that very few people are on her\nside throughout the film.\nUltimately, however, the film is a little predictable and\noverlong. It would perhaps work better on television than\non the big screen and probably will do little to satisfy\nmodern cinema audience's desire for mainstream\nHollywood fare. Jenny Ho\nBeavis and Butthead\nDo America\nThe idiotic duo hit the big\nscreen as they leave MTV\nfor the first time. After the\ncatastrophic theft of their TV\nthey find themselves travelling across America with\nthe FBI hot on their trail,\nlaughing at funny-shaped\nbuildings and regretting\ntheir unsurprising inability to\npull. You probably know if\nyou'll like this film before\nyou see it. If you're a fan of\nMTV's most intelligent\nmusic presenters you'll love\nit, otherwise ifs not for you.\nAnna Karenina\nAn awful film. Harsh, but\ntrue. Leo Tolstoy's classic\nromantic novel was filmed\nentirely on location in St\nPetersburg, but even the\npicturesque backdrop can't compensate for the\nextreme tediousness of this\none. Sean Bean would be\nwise to stick with Sharpe.\nThe first blockbuster of the Summer arrives next Friday,\nCon Air, starring Nicolas Cage and produced by Jerry\nBruckheimer, the man responsible for The Rock and\nCrimson Tide. Cage is the unlucky man stuck on a flight\ncontaining the most dangerous and notorious prisoners in\nthe US, when one of them, Cyrus The Virus\" Grissom,\nsuccessfully hijacks the plane. What follows is one of\nthose \"roaring roller coaster rides from start to finish\" that\nlooks like being one of the most successful of the\nSummer's films. The sun is shining, the birds are singing\nand we're all feeling happy because exams are nearly\nover, so we're giving away some Con Air goodies.\nThis time those student-friendly chaps at the Odeon\nKensington have really surpassed themselves.

    "content": "THIS summer the Natural History Museum launches its new exhibition 'Dinosaurs of the Gobi Desert'\njust as Jurassic Park II fever is about to hit Britain. These pre-historic 'monsters' may still inspire fear\nand excitement in children's hearts, but the new exhibition reveals some of their more tender\nmoments. Heather Holve reports on the first UK showing of these spectacular fossils discovered in the\n1920s and explains how the exhibition quite literally unearths the domestic life of dinosaurs.\nDesert opens 18 May\nuntil 31 August and\noffers a wide range of\nkids activites: Dinosaur\nDig, the drama 'Legends\nof the Flaming Cliffs'\nand 'Travel the\nTimeline' and 'Build a Dinosuar' workshop.\nsI walked in the exhibition I was immediately struck\nby a towering wall of orange. Having over-enthusiastically fallen for last year's colour myself I felt in no place\nto comment at the choice. But one should never judge too\nquickly: I discovered I was standing at the foot of the\nFlaming Cliffs' of the Gobi desert where Roy ChapmanAndrews and his team made the dramatic chance discovery of the first ever recorded dinosaur eggs. What they\ndiscovered in this extreme and inhospitable landscape,\nwhile, incidentally, looking for proof that Central Asia was\nfie cradle of evolution, was one of the richest dinosaur\ngraveyards in the world. This landscape continues to lay\nbare new fossils which fire the imagination of palaeontologists around the world today.\nWhat these first explorers uncovered changed the\ndirection of future research. They found nests filled with\neggs, dinosaur babies and youngsters at different stages\nof development, which provided important information\nabout how they nurtured their young and a direct link\nbetween dinosaurs and their descendants, birds. The link\nthese explorers uncovered also extended further back\ninto pre-history. Many of the dinosaurs found in the Gobi\ndessert are more primitive forms of North American\ndinosaurs, suggesting that major groups evolved in Asia\nand later spread to North America across a land bridge\nthat once joined the two continents.\nAs someone who's knowledge of dinosaurs is limited\nlo impromptu lessons from my elder brother, I was\ninstantly lost in the face of all those bones. These skeletal\nmonsters may have held a fleeting resemblance to spec i. mens in my ABC book of dinosaurs, but the impression\nthey left was very different. These beasts were of much\nsmaller than many of their North American relatives; the\nlar bos a urus( 'alarming lizard') stood about two-thirds the\nheight of its more recent relative the Tyrannosaurs Rex\n[tyrant lizard king'). And with so many examples of eggs,\nnests and young I found myself comparing these creatures to Sesame Streefs Big Bird rather than monsters like\nGodzilla.\nFor the first time I gazed in wonder at the ostrich-like\nstructure of Gallimus Bullatus ('chicken-mimic'). I had\nnever seen fossils where a series of ages could be com-pared, and the Gallimus was just the beginning of the\nexperience. A range of Protoceratops skulls from adults to\nmere hatchlings showed how this turtle-beaked vegetarian developed. This small dinosaur, common to the Gobi,\nbrowsed on plants, cropping and chopping vegetation\nwith self-sharpening teeth. What I found amazing was\nthat the skulls at different stages showed how the 'frill' on\nthe back of the head developed with age. I was looking\nat how a cute and cuddly baby changes into an overly\nlarge emu-like lizard!\nSo what did the audience make of this display of\ndinosaur family values? I did a swift straw pole. Two very\nunsuspecting kids, Kristen age 10 and Ezesme age 8\ngave their expert opinion 'Really great...I loved it all. I especially liked all those BIG teeth'. The new age 'family\nvalues' approach to palaeontology obviously passed\nthese two by. Kristen and Ezesme revelled in the thrill of\nknowing that, through a trick of geological timing, they'd escaped the risk of being eaten by a monster that even\ntheir imagination would find difficult to conjure-up.\nGiles Clarke and Catherine Barr, who have been\nresponsible for the development of the exhibition, are\nmore than happy with this reaction. They arranged for the\nexhibits and information to be at kid height to bring the\nfossils, if not to life, then so close to the child as to make\nthem seem part of a pre-historic zoo. Visitors can latch\nonto whichever theme touches their imagination;\ndinosaurs as monsters, dinosaurs the much maligned\nparent; intrepid desert adventurers past and present.\nI am still not ready to throw away my ABC book of\ndinosaurs, but I can now honestly say that these creatures have been rescued from the 'mythical' department\n\"Two very unsuspecting kids. Kristen age\n10 and Ezesme age 8\ngave their expert opinion 'Really great...I loved it all. I especially\nliked all those BIG\nteeth'. The new age\n'family values'\napproach to palaeontology obviously\npassed these two by.\"\n1 0 SS/I These eggs were discovered in the\n1920s by the adventurer Roy\nChapman Andrews (the model for\nIndiana Jones) in the Gobi desert.\nInitially believed to have been stolen\nby the dinosaur Oviraptor ('egg-thief),\nthey have recently been discovered to\nhave been laid in Mongolia by the\nmis-named Oviraptor osier 80 million\nyears ago.\nof my memory's storage system and dinosaurs are now\nvery real to me. These beasts of the Gobi were turned to\nstone while in the process of nurturing and protecting\ntheir young from a cruel sandstorm 70-80 million years\nago. And every year the Gobi offers up a few more treasures as the abrasive powers of sandstorms cut into a new layer of the landscape.\nWe still have not reached 'the end' of dinosaur history.\nOnly in 1993, 70 years after its discovery, did the Oviraptor\n(egg-thief) finally have its conviction for thieving quashed\nwhen an adult was found not 'raiding', but protecting a nest of 22 eggs. Dr Rinchen Barsbold, Director of the\nGeological Institute ot the Mongolian Academy of\nSciences, quotes from Newton to explain recent successes \"We stood on the shoulders of giants\". He thus honours past palaeontologists and hints at the calibre of\ntoday's international scientists busy unravelling present\nday dinosaur secrets.\nthe go lem and other stories\n\n"

    "content": "6 SIR RON V VOR FELIX FRIDAY 3 0 TH MAY After months of meticulous planning,\nthe time had come. I entered Sherfield,\nscurried up the back stairs and\nreached the top floor. Suite Five lay in\nthe distance. Through the landmines,\nunder the razor wire, passing the\n'KILL BAKER' and 'SILENCE THE\nVOICE' posters, I was almost there.\nMy lucky break came when Lynda\nDavis' machine gun jammed. Our\nHead of PR and Chief of IC Secret\nPolice hurriedly reached for her\nrevolver, but it was too late. I was in\nthe Rector's Office.\nSimon Baker, Voice of Reason, talks\nto Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the Rector,\nabout some of his favourite subjects.\nSir Ron Oxburgh\nThe idea for this interview, or rather chat, actually\ncame from a very unexpected sources within the\nupper echelons of that esteemed building. After listening to me bang on about the whys and wherefores of Imperial for the last two years, it seemed a good idea to hear from the leader of the\nOpposition, namely Sir Ron Oxburgh. No discussion about the College at the moment could avoid\nthe exam relocation farr ago; it has been a good\nencapsulation of the general notion that students\nfeel aggrieved by the attitude of College towards\nthem. While I 'll agree with the notion that students\nwill always find something to moan about, this is\nnot a trivial matter. Let Sir Ron now answer.\n\"A choice between two evils\", the tent and the\nGreat Hall, is a view that most would support. \"I am satisfied the people that were concerned have\nactually done everything possible\" may raise at\nleast a few eyebrows among our more cynical\nmembers. As the Rector pointed out, \"the problem\ndeveloped eight days before the exams,\" which is\ntrue, if one refers to the specific incident causing\nthe noise. The broader point is surely that College\nshould have erred on the side of caution by either\nplanning the construction work around the exams\nor relocating the exams much, much earlier.\nThe suggestion that the last couple of weeks of\nexams may indeed be moved to a variety of locations around College means that the latter option\ncould have been taken with a little more foresight\nby Estates and the Registry. The new garden\nbehind Weeks Hall was \"obviously considered\",\nbut rejected because of \"access problems\". Hang\non a minute. Did we not have an almighty row last\nyear about access to this garden, deemed so important that a path was constructed to it during last\nyear's exams? All in all, this is, despite the protestations of the Rector, a disaster that could so easily\nhave been avoided.\nOur conversation then turned to Campus\nRenaissance. To my surprise and delight, the\nRector stated that the next big priority was Beit\nQuad, a combination of increased Union facilities\nand significantly upgraded accommodation offering 270 rooms. I say surprised, since it does not\nappear in a recent Estates Major Projects Report\neven in the planning section. Beit Quad has enormous potential, and Sir Ron alluded to a Cambridge model, which is certainly applicable in\nthis case (to a certain extent). A figure of about\n\u00a37million was mentioned, and we look forward to\nthe results.\nOn the broader issue of student rents, the Rector\nwas reasonably encouraging. Acknowledging that\nwe do not \"have a very good arrangement at the\nmoment\", he went on to say, \"I would like us to\nhave rents as low as possible, but I would like those\nto be economic rents...any subsidies should be\ndecided on grounds other than being a first year.\"\nAnd so say all of us, but the figures do not seem to\nbear that out. Of the \u00a34.5 million student rent collected last year plus the \u00a32.3 million from other let-tings, College was left with a final surplus after all\ncosts of \u00a32.2 million. Rents as low as possible Sir\nRon? He quickly pointed out that this was a \"spoof\nfigure\" no depreciation charges for ultimate\nreplacement of the Halls were included in that fig-ure. Quite so, nor included anywhere else at all, it\nwould seem. It is the case that hotels do not depreciate long-standing properties, but simply keep\nthem in good repair. Given the large under-spend\nin the maintenance budget here, we appear to do\nneither. True, no loan repayments were included in\nthis figure. This would only apply to Clayponds, as\nfar as is obvious, bringing the surplus down to\nabout \u00a31.2 million, or free rent for everyone in\nPrinces Gardens. No scope for lower rents? I remain unconvinced that students are getting the\nbest deal.\nConferencing remains the big hope for College\naccommodation. Again, the Rector cited a Cambridge College, who by a \"careful and clever\nmarketing strategy\" have produced very good\nreturns. Sadly Imperial, whose sixties buildings he\ndescribed as \"orange boxes, badly designed, badly\nbuilt\", is no Cambridge college. The 'virtuous c ir cle' of investment in accommodation stock to\nattract conferencing business that would in turn\nhelp fund more redevelopment looks very appeal-ing, but with it comes the risk that student rents\nwill have to meet the shortfalls from pricing ourselves out of the market.\nThe more observant of you will have noticed that I have the odd gripe about Sherfield, both the building and the contents. \"The role of administration is\nto provide the College with an interface with the\noutside world to leave the academics free from outside interference and to provide an environment in\nwhich they can pursue their activities.\" Most academics that I have spoken to would contend that the\nbulk of interference is not from external bodies but\nfrom Sherfield itself.\nI have before now stated that at least half the IC\nteaching grant gets taken centrally. 'A totally misleading figure', but one supported by several senior\nacademics. It is partly a case of how you do your\nsums, but the near universal feeling is that our central admin is over-bloated. Sir Ron countered this\ncharge by suggesting that we had one of the lowest\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 30TH MAY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 19\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nDear Alex,\nHaving read the letters page in last\nweek's Felix I feel I must respond to\nthe two letters of criticism, namely\nthe letters from the Beit Hall residents and Mr A Swift.\nI would like to assure the residents\nof Beit Hall that the Union is indeed\ntaking steps to ensure that the Albert\nHall authorities are aware of the\nimpact of the work upon the res i dents, whilst it is indeed true that the\nUnion was not represented at the\nmeeting on 15th May we have been\nrepresented at the similar meetings\nover the previous year and found\nthem deeply unsatisfactory forums to\ndiscuss the obvious issues of con-cern.\nCurrently the College and the\nUnion are having discussions with\nthe Royal Albert Hall to ensure that\nthe work starting in September this\nyear has a minimal impact on the\nCollege and its students. It is true that\nwe would be derelict in our duty to\nour members not to be voicing our\nreservations to those who may\nchoose to listen.\nAs for Mr Swift's rant, I am sorry\nthat he has allowed his prejudices to\nget in the way of objectivity. It is\nfairly inevitable with any organisation such as ours that those whom the\nmembers of the Union choose to represent them are seen as being part of\nclique. However all Union meetings\nand elections are open to all members of the Union, save for a couple\nof understandable situations such as\nthe Union Disciplinary Committee.\nMechanisms exist for members to\nhold the Union's officials, policy,\ndecisions, elections and constitutional principles to account. If we were\ndoing a bad job on your account,\nwith your money and in your name\nthen I would hope that the membership had the courage to seek corrective action. However, if people wish\nto sit bleating on the sidelines without participating or providing constructive suggestion then could I respectively suggest that they either\nput up or shut up.\nThe remainder of the inaccuracies\nin M. Swift's letter seem to be reasonably covered by Mr Roberts editorial comment below the letter, save\nfor Mr Swift's identity. It may simply be a typo, but Mr A Swift of\nMech Eng II does not seem to appear\nin the College's list of registered stu-dents. It would be a fairly sad day if\nstudents felt that they could not criticise their elected officials without\nhaving to assume a pseudonym.\nAs I am sure that most readers of\nFelix do not wish to see the letters\npage clogged with epistolary\nduelling on this subject may Is ug est to any potential respondents that they\nsave their comments or criticism for\nmy face, in-tray or Email address,\neric.aIls op@ ic.ac.uk. However, the\nbest solution would be to attend the\nCouncil meeting on Tuesday 3rd June at 18:00 in the Union Dining\nHall (papers will be available at the\nUnion Office from 09:00 Monday\n2nd June).\nYours sincerely,\nEric Allsop ICU President\nDear Students,\nBerhanu International Travel\nAgency (BITA) are looking for students for employment over the sum-mer.

Which is a shame, because\nthere is no point in having a reputation as good as ours (as borne out in\nthe league tables), if nobody has\never heard of the damn place.\nIt should be the case that, as in any\nform of league, the top five are well\nknown favourites of the public.\nThere should be friendly inter-uni-vers it y rivalries between streets and\nregions. Estates bedecked in their\nhigher education institution's colours would challenge the scarf\nbearing graduates of another. The\nannual publication of The Times'\nLeague Tables would be anticipated\nlike the FA Cup.\nUnfortunately, whilst other institutions have a high profile,\nImperial's attractions have gone\nunnoticed by the press and public\nalike. That's not to say that\nProfessor Smith gets on the Today\nprogramme or that Dr X is interviewed on the News at Ten, but we\ndo lack the wonderful glitz and paz-zam that say Professor Dawkin's occupation of the Chair of Public\nAnnoyance and Iconoclasm at\nOxford or Professor Hawking's sage-like pronouncements on the\nuniverse from his lair in Cambridge\nseem to manage.\nBut as I said at the start, we can\nonly pause briefly to relish our\nachievement of drawing closer to\nOxford. The London School of\nEconomics is breathing down our\ncollective necks (and how sweaty it\nis too)! We must man the battle-ment s, research deep in our libraries\nand laboratories, draw our scarves\ncloser round ourselves and above all\nget some better accommodation.\nAll in all, the College may get a good solid third, but it looks as\nthough we'll have to get more 2:1s and firsts to pull ahead of our\nLondon rivals and close the gap on\nthe Oxbridge duo and'the acclaim a tion that they receive.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "GUIDO\nUnsophisiicates\nI'm going to confess right now that I think I was\nthe wrong person to review this band and I have an unpleasant feeling that I'm about to\npan an album that a lot of people will like, still\nhere goes.\nGuido is one of those albums that no-one\ncan classify so it gets thrown into the trip-ho\nbin and finds itself nestling uncomfortably\nbetween Lamb and Massive Attack. The music\non the album meanders around to an alarming degree stumbling from the quite nasty jazz\ntinkling s of Pervert to the far more trip-hop\nleanings of Straitjacket and even a kind of bastard funk on Riverbank. The universal factor in\nthese songs is the vaguely irritating voice of\nNeal Smart which drawls its way from harsh\ndistortion, created by singing through a megaphone no less, to straight singing. There are\nalso a lot of instruments here, leading to points\nwhere the songs are suddenly invaded by\nembarrassing blasts from horns and other\nsongs where where it seems like there are\nhundreds of instruments vying for your at ten tion.\nThe album is not entirely without merit, how-ever. The band are at their best when subdued\nand vaguely ominous. This leaves us\nl with an album that is predominately\njazz music of the most rambling kind\na sort of hideous Portishead-lounge\nmusic abortion. I can't really recommend this to anyone unless you like\nFreakpower, in which case you are welcome to\nit...{4).\nYour little sister may want to be in the spice\ngirls but Kenickie are the band you always\nwanted to be in, with the songs you always\nwanted to write. The larger than life Lauren\nLaverne, Marie du Santiago, Emmy-Kate\nMontrose and Johnny X are here espousing\nthe joys of glitter, PVC (its waterproof) and black\ncherry lipstick. They have blazed a trail of\ndestruction through the interviewers brave\nenough to take on\nthese mouth y geordie s. In their\nown words they have\nstyle and they have\nclass; they have credibility too, already\nhaving recorded a session for John Peel.\nYeah, yeah, they are\nprobably younger\nthan you as well.\nWhere have you\nbeen hiding if you\nhaven't already\njumped around your\nbedroom to their\nmany shout y punk-pop singles such as\nPunka and In your\nCar? The album At\nThe Club contains yet\nmore songs fizzing along with handclaps,\nthighs laps, personality and wit. It is produced\nby John Cornfield who has also worked on\nSupergrass' albums, and it shares the captured youth of / Should Coco. There are slow\nintrospective moments such as How I was\nAT THE CLUB\nKenickie\nmade on the album and although they provide\nbalance and depth these are slightly weaker\ntracks - can we believe there are tears behind\nthat all consuming confidence?

Made for around\n\u00a320,000 this first film by 23\nyear old Emma-Kate\nCroghan features a day in\nthe life of five Australian\nstudents. Every element of\nstudent life is included,\nfrom searching for ac como dati on and sex to trying to\ndodge lecturers owed\nwork. Unfortunately the lack\nof money behind the film\nsometimes shows and\nthere's not that much to it,\nbut the characters are all\nendearing and ifs an\namusing way to while\naway an hour or so.\nThe Relic\nThe most decapitations\nsince Highlander and a Poseidon Adventure-esque\nescapade combine in this\ngruesome thriller. Chicago's Natural History Museum is\nthe setting for a battle of\nwits bel we en an evolutionary biologist and the\n\"Kathago\", an evil DNA\nconcoction of reptile, insect\nand human. Humourously\nhandling extremely\nmacabre scenes, including\nbeheaded victims, this is\ns uprising ly enjoyable stuff.\nThe cat-like monster, when\nit finally comes out from the\nshadows, is refreshingly\ndifferent to the usual variation on Alien, and would be\ncute if it didn't have such a fondness for certain parts\nof the human brain.\nDespite a slightly disappointing ending, the joyous\nway in which each victim is\ndispatched means this is\nrecommended therapy for\nexam stress.\nAbsolute Power\ntakes real moral\ncorruption in the\nhighest echelons\nof American\ngovernment and\nturns it into a digestible thriller,\nin which Clint\nEastwood proves\nonce again that\nhe is much more\nthan Dirty Harry\nand The Man\nwith no Name\".\nLuther Witney is\nan ageing cat\nburglar, and is\nset for one more\nhigh profile theft\nto end his\ncareer. His target is the vault of\nWalter Sullivan\n(EG Marshall),\nthe richest man in Washington and the financial backer of\nthe recently elected president Alan Richmond (Gene\nHackman). Witney's plan goes well until he sees Sullivan's wife with an unexpected visitor, the President. While\nwatching the Iwo he witnesses a bizarre murder, and an\nextremely amateur cover-up.Witney becomes the prime\nsuspect in the murder investigation; the police, lead by\nhomicide detective Seth Frank (Ed Harris), want to question\nhim, while the secret service want to remove him since he\nhas seen far too much.\nAbsolute Power starts and ends well, but unfortunately\na subplot concerning Witney's estranged\ndaughter is\nadded to show\nhe has morals\ndespite being a thief. At times\nWitney's antics\nare slightly out-land ish, entering\nhis daughter's and Seth Frank's houses with such\nease that you\nwonder if their\nfront doors were\npurposefully left\nopen. He also\nsneaks around\nthe White House,\ndonning an\nawful fake beard\nand moustache,\nin order to leave\ntaunting messages to those who committed the crime.\nGene Hackmans' gives an impressive portrayal of the\ndisturbing President as his henchmen cover up this inconvenience. He stands in front of the nation openly supporting the bereaved and the apprehension of the culp rif and he has no qualms in ordering the execution of a witness\njust in case she knows too much. Both characters are\nsimilar to those portrayed in Unforgiven, the reformed\njudging the immoral. After the initial tension, the film's pace slacks until right at the end, when it finishes amazingly abruptly. Magpie\nGRIDLOCK^ o Gridlock'd provides a refreshing change to many of the\nstereotypes found in films at the moment. It features drug\naddicts, but they're neither glorified nor patronised. Ifs\nabout two buddies, one black and one white, but ifs the\nblack blok et hafs the level-headed sensible guy and the\nwhite one t hafs the crazy ass dude.\nThe two are Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur, playing Stretch\nand Spoon. If they sound like a jazz band t hafs because\nthey are, along with Cookie, Spoon's girlfriend. When\nCookie OD's and ends up in a coma the Iwo friends\ndecide that ifs finally time to kick the habit and get clean,\nand the film tracks the day that follows. A series of mix-ups means they are also wanted by the police and two\nvillainous dealers but there's something even tougher in\nthe way of finding help - the System. Bureaucracy. Forms.\nQueues. More forms. Spoon takes his mate under his\nwing as they search for the Holy Grail - rehab.\nFalling somewhere between a comedy and cutting\nsocial commentary, Gridlock'd is an impressive directorial\ndebut by Vondie Curtis Hall. He extracts believable performances from his stars and has created a very individual,\nstylish film. Much of the sardonic script is spot-on and he\ncombines this with some truly hilarious moments. At one\npoint the only way the friends can get into hospital and\nhence rehab is to have a critical injury. As a result Stretch\nhas to repeatedly stab his pal with a blunt pen knife in a scene reminiscent of Pulp Fiction's needle-into-heart cl as sic, but far funnier.\nIf there is one criticism of the film ifs that ifs slightly\nlightweight, with too many shots of the duo fleeing from\nthe police and wandering the streets, rather than developing the plot. However, ifs still a very enjoyable film, if\nonly for the great dialogue in places. Chris\nfilm\n\n"

    "content": "4 NEWS\nJCR refurbishment plan in doubt\nNEWSTEAM\nThe future of the Junior Common\nRoom hangs in the balance today as\nCollege officials begin a series of\nmeetings to discuss plans for its\nrefurbishment.\nFollowing years of neglect, the\nJCR has fallen into disrepair. The\nseats-covers are torn, the decor is\ntatty and the lighting is poor, leading\nsome students to declare it \"the eyesore on the walkway.\"\nSpeaking to Felix, Ian Caldwell,\nDirector of Estates, admitted \"The\nJCR is certainly not what it should\nbe... of all the student facilities it\nneeds the most improvement.\" Plans\ndue to be drawn up by IC Estates\nDesign Office may include the relocation of the QT snack-bar, possibly\nPHOTO: ROBIN No, no come back! The 'tatty' J CR may be refurbished for next year.\nt f efc f Week/\nto a more conspicuous site on the\nSherfield walkway. Furthermore the\nwall of the JCR adjoining the walkway may be recessed, in an attempt\nto alleviate the bottleneck at the main\ncommon room entrance. Mr Caldwell commented \"We want to\nkeep the JCR as a flexible space, but\nimprove the environment.\"\nAt the time of going to press it is\nnot yet clear where funding for the\nproject will be found, unofficial estimates of the cost approaching \u00a3400\n000. In the past, JCR refurbishment\nhas been paid for by a combination of\nIC Estates, IC catering and IC Union.\nIf, as precedent would suggest, the\nUnion is asked to contribute as much\nas a third of the cost, negotiations\nmay stall. The 'Memorandum of\nUnderstanding', which outlines areas\nof the Union's responsibility, would\nsuggest that the Union is under no\nobligation to pay for improvements\nto the JCR, which is College-run.\nUnion officials may be reluctant to\npart with such a significant fraction\nof ICU's development reserve before\nfinal ising details of improvements in\nsocial facilities in Beit Quad, planned\nfor next year in anticipation of the\nmedical merger.\nIC don appointed charity chief\nMATTHEW BENNETT Dr James Deutsch, a Silwood park\nlecturer, and expert on cichlid fishes\nin lake Malawi, has been appointed\nChief Executive of Cruisaid, a London based AIDS charity.\nDr Deutsch, who is himself HIV\npositive, applied for the job after volunteering for another AIDS charity,\nthe AIDS treatment project. He left\nhis job as lecturer in biology to start\nthe new job on 1 May, but will\nremain connected to Imperial as an\nHonorary Lecturer whilst working\nfor Cruisaid. He will work for a trial\nperiod of six months, with the option\nof an extended contract covering several years.\nFrom studying the explosive evolution of lake Malawi cichlids, Dr\nDeutsch finds himself at the head of\none of the largest AIDS charities.\nCrusaid aims include increasing the\npublic awareness of AIDS, removing\nthe stigma attached to carriers of the\ndisease, raising money to improve\nthe quality of life for HIV and AIDS\npatients and helping them to maintain their dignity and independence.\nThe charity supports institutions and\ncharities, providing hospice and\nrespite care and furthering research.\nCrusaid also funded the creation of\nBritain's largest HIV clinic, at the\nChelsea and Westminster hospital.\nThe charity is further hoping to raise\none million pounds to expand the\ncentre into become \"the first truly\nintegrated and HIV patient treatment\nand research centre.\"\nRecently, the charity merged its\nhardship fund with that of the\nTerrence Higgins Trust. Dr Deutsch\nhas reiterated his commitment to\nworking in close conjunction with\nother HIV and AIDS charities, with\nthe aim of establishing a \"unified\nagenda for meeting the needs of people with the disease in light of\nimprovements in treatment.\"\nOn the subject of treatments, Dr\nDeutsch is positive about the new\n'multi-drug' treatments now avail-able, which have been shown to prolong life, especially in cases where\nthe disease is diagnosed early. Dr\nDeutsch has stressed the need for\nreliable, effective treatments; without them, many potential sufferers\nsee little or no benefit in taking an\nHIV test.\nDr Deutsch spoke to Felix about\nhis hopes and aspirations for the new\njob. He sees himself taking on such\ndiverse duties as \"welcoming people\nto charity benefit dinners and theatre\nopenings to working with other\nAIDS charities and agencies to meet\nthe needs of people with HIV and\nAIDS as the epidemic changes in\nlight of new treatments.\" Dr Deutsch\nhas already been interviewed on\nradio concerning himself, his\nappointment and AIDS as a whole.\nDr Deutsch applauded Imperial\nQueers (IQ) for their efforts in keeping the Imperial community\ninformed about the disease. He\nadded that while IC students seem to\nknow about the dangers of unsafe\nsex, the number of new HIV cases is\nrising rapidly among young people.\nHe places great importance on safer\nsex campaigns, concluding that\n\"condoms really are the solution to\nlife's ills!\"\nDr Deutsch urges everyone to take\npart in Britain's largest HIV and\nAIDS fundraising event, 'Walk for\nLife', taking place on June 8. The\n10km sponsored walk in London\n(with similar events happening\nacross the UK) is still open for regis-t ration. "

The remaining Universities\nthen receive points based on their\nperformance relative to the best. The\n\u2022e ac bing and research grades are calculated slightly differently; each of\ntee is based on the grades recieved\nby different departments in the asses-ex cerci ses carried out earlier\nyear, and in these Imperial made\nstrong showing.\nThe teaching points are weighted\n^1to the research points.

IC's large\npopulation of researchers meant that\nour staff-student ratio was graded, as\nlast year, at a perfect 100 whereas\nIC's lowest score, 67. was again that\nfor accommodation. This is a significant improvement on last year's score of 34 but remains among the\nlowest for the top 50 universities.\nOther London colleges fared little\nbetter in this category, reflecting the\ndeficit of Hall provision and inordinate rents facing students in the cap i tal.\nOther major improvements over\nlast year include the 39 point increase\nin library spending, raising this\nyear's total to 83, and bringing it\nmore in line with spending at other\ntop universities.

    "content": "\"Whafs that woman doing on the posters?\" This was\nthe question eating away at every on' s sub con cio us, having noticed the new more sensual approach to\nadvertising used by the IC Choir for their Summer con-cert. In fact, there was no obvious reason for this picture to be featured, but then we couldn't think of a more enticing way to advertise a choir concert our-selves, so we let it pass.\nThis year, the Summer concert presented us with a relatively modern collection of pieces, all written\nbetween 1945 and 1965. The performance started with\nLeonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms (1965). The choir\nwere accompanied by a fair sized orchestra, with a robust percussion section, for this rampaging and complex piece of music. The number of choir members was\nnotably reduced with respect to the usual turn-out and in\nthe Bernstein, the choir frequently found itself overpowered by the orchestra. A highlight of this piece was the\nnervous but very talented choirboy soloist, Gerald Beatty,\nshipped in from the Choir of Westminster Cathedral.\nThe Bernstein was followed by a collection of five Negro\nSpirituals, from A Child of Our Time (1945/1958) sung\nunaccompanied by the choir and a bunch of adult soloists.\nAlthough technically well performed, the style lacked the\nIC Choir\nSummer Concert\nspark necessary to grab the listener, which you might\nexpect this style of music to possess. The blame lies\nequally with the composer, Sir Michael Tippet, and the\nchoir.\nThe concert ended e with Maurice Durufle's Requiem\n(1947), accompanied by a somewhat reduced orchestra,\nand this was where we got to see what the choir was\nreally capable of. The orchestra/choir balance was much\nbetter than for the Bernstein, and the Requiem was beautifully sung. On the whole, the IC Choir, with ifs new con-duct or, Christopher Dawe, and ifs slightly rejuvenated\nwomen-on-posters attitude had a pleasingly refreshed\nair.\nBurak and Maria\nI don't know; you buy a computer and suddenly everyone thinks that you're an expert. All sorts of things start\nlanding on your desk, such as this little package, a language tutor from Europress. The cover claims that the\nprogram uses \"proven natural methods\", which seems\na less than promising, but lets stop w hinging about the\ncover and load the thing up.\nThankfully the application is not too system hungry,\nrequiring only a486 DX with 4Mb RAM and 4Mb of\nfree hard drive space, although when it says that it\nneeds a SoundBlaster compatible soundcard, it\ndeclines to mention that you need a microphone.\nHowever, this quibble aside, the user interface becomes\nimmediately workable with no instruction whatsoever,\nand much to my annoyance I really started to enjoy it. I chose the Spanish CD, in spite of the general pleas\naround the office for me to try the English tutor. [Believe\nme - his du lc it Tyneside Spanish sounds like someone trying to stad a car but failing - Ea]\nIt uses the \"celebrated\" and \"globally praised\" 'Rosetta\nStone' method, which submerses the user completely in\nthe language, and uses thousands of photographs to ere\nate the associations with he words, meaning that, if used\ncorrectly, the user thinks in the chosen language rather\nthan translates from their mother tongue. Another major\nEuropress\nLanguage Labs:\nSpanish\nfeature is that the program gives in tst ant feedback to your\nverbal, written and acc soci at at ive input, which gives a real\n'classroom' feel. I found myself reacting instantly to the\nstimuli! and even wanting to go faster, a desire for which\nRosetta Stone caters wonderfully. I started learning at a truly astonishing rate, and I know this sounds like a something an advert might quote (believe me I wanted to be\nnasty about this program) but it does work in exactly the\nway it says it will. Irritatingly, there are no irritating little\nfeatures I'd like to latch onto at this point of the review; it is\njust nicely skeletal in ifs structure yet slick in ifs present a tion, very quick to get into and a fine language tutor.\nThafs about it really. Mr Trout\nii\\ im i30059? multimedia\nFelix's summer special is\nout on June 18th. Please note: there is no issue of Felix on Friday 20th June\n\n"

AF\nDespite my being a focus\nfor the frustration of Sf\nMary's students, I felt\nthat this article neatly\nsummed up the concern\nfor the future of ICU and\nthe other CCUs. AF\nIt seems that Imperial College students wish\nto keep medics at a safe distance and they\nare now showing their resentment at our\nimpending invasion by writing bitter editorials in Felix. However, the issue concerning the evolving relationship between St\nMary's and Imperial is far wider and more\ntwo-sided than this. Mary's medics have a greater resentment at being unseated from\nwhat we see as our home (in a physical and,\nfor want of a better word, spiritual sense)\nand have felt strongly over this for some\nyears. However, only now, when firm decisions about our future are being made, is our\nfeeling being truly noticed by the lethargic\nstudent body at Imperial and, whilst bitter\neditorials were written, they were perhaps\nsimply a reaction to articles printed elsewhere which claim every decision made to\nbe a glorious victory for Mary's and a cucumber up the arse for Imperial.\nThe to-ing and fro-ing of victorious\nclaims and bitter rebukes in Felix began at\nthe beginning of February after the\n'Question and Answer' session with\nProfessor Caldwell and Professor Swanson.\nThe conclusions of that meeting were basically promises from Professor Swanson\n(Deputy Rector of IC) that the funding for\nICSM will remain at it's present level and\nwill continue to be paid through College in\ncontrast to the other constituent Colleges\nwho receive their funding through Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU). We were also told\nthat we could continue to play as a Medics\nteam in BUSA and some other smaller\nissues were decided, probably in our favour.\nThe conclusions we can draw from this are\nthat i) Prof. Swanson will listen to our concerns and will be reasonable in helping out\nand ii) if we don't ask, we don't get. OK so\nfar? Good. However, the headline in Felix\nwas \"Medics Secure Independence\" which,\nin a couple of areas, we have done but, Alex\nFeakes, Editor of Felix, saw this article as\n\"a stirring story of triumph in the face of\nadversity\".\nAnd perhaps he was right, but I believe\nthat he must realise the fact that this imminent change, in one way or another, scares\nor worries every one of us and so any decisions which go some way to alleviating\nsome of these fears will be celebrated in a way which is perhaps victorious. However,\nfor Mr Feakes to go on to accuse us of being\n\"selfish\" is simply short-sighted.\nOf course we are being selfish. We are\nbeing uprooted against almost all of our\nwills and, whilst we realise that without the\nmove, Mary's would have a very short life-expectancy indeed, we are merely trying to\nensure that despite the geographical\nchanges, little else about what is a fantastic\nplace (though St Mary's, of course, has it's weaknesses) alters perceptibly. The supposed \"deprivation of other students of\nfunds for their activities\" is, bluntly, not our\nconcern and this is something which the\n\"...other students\" must raise with the\nCollege.\nUltimately, this has been College's free\ndecision and it must be assumed that it has\nbeen fully considered, including it's knock-on effect across the whole student body. To\ncriticise us directly for taking away from the\nmembers of ICU is a pointless twisting of\nfact. We are not \"a room full of baying medical students\" any more than ICU students\nare a University of simpering apathetic s. We\nare simply concerned and are doing everything in our power to make ICSM a worthy\nsuccessor to Mary's. Unfortunately, duplication (and even trip-li cation) of undergraduate services is a necessity if future students are to study on\nthree such widely spread sites so economics\nstates that more funds are required.\nI understand that perhaps our actions will\nserve to divide the campus into medics and\nnon-medics but to claim that this will be\n\"detrimental to the substance of this institution (Imperial College)\" is unwarranted\narrogance. Last year, IC rag week raised\n\u00a3920 between 6000 students. St. Mary's rag\nraised upwards of \u00a330 000 between 600 stu-dents. A mere week after Mary's rag week\nICU sabbatical positions were once again\ndecided by the Paddington vote (something\nthat has been repeated this year). If these\nthings are a measure of IC substance (and\ncan there be better indicators?), then perhaps division was always inevitable any-way.\nA couple of weeks after this editorial, a letter was written to Felix attempting to put\nforward the Mary's point of view.\nUnfortunately, this letter slipped down the\nunproductive slope of being aggressive and\nconfrontational (hypocritically something it\naccuses Alex Feakes of). For several years\nnow \"St Mary's xenophobia\", a trait peculiar to all London Medical Schools ever\nsince their inception, has extended to IC.\nI have already skimmed the surface of\nwhy this has occurred but, unlike Alex\nFeakes and Nick Jenkins, I don't believe\nthat this is something we should be rapidly\nbeginning to unravel. Of course, it has a detrimental edge to it but after 3'/2 years at\nMary's( as opposed to just one exploratory\nterm), I 've realised that without our xenophobia (which, for the most part is purely\nposturing - just visit the pavilion bar after\nany big rugby game) we would lose our\nfierce pride. And it is this pride which drives\nus to our fantastic achievements and makes\nMary's the undeniably formidable place that\nit is.\nThis is just one debate of many to come\nand it is important to realise that aggressive\ntriumphal is m is not wanted at IC any more\nthan snide jealousy and resentment are well\nreceived at Mary's. This whole process is\ninevitable and, as far as Mary's are con-cern ed, continuity is what is wanted and\nneeded. It is undoubtedly going to require a lot of work but we will continue to strive to\nobtain everything that we reasonably can.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 3 0 TH MAY SIR RON V VOR 7\ncost, most efficient administrations in the country.\nAs we can, and did, argue numbers somewhat\nfruitlessly, I leave you to draw your own conclusions. Suffice it to say, that 1 have heard a variety\nof views on this subject recently, somewhat at odds\nwith this vision of loveliness. \"College has frankly\ngot to sharpen up many of its areas of activity\",\n'The College cannot afford to go round in circles\nas it often does\", the method of allocating teaching\nmoney by formula has been described as \"abdi ca tion of management'\". \"Senior academics are\nprobably the worst perpetrators of ill-informed\nchatter.\" The last quote, lest you were wondering,\nwas made by the Rector.\nSharpening up areas of activity inevitably means\nservices such as catering, cleaning and security, all\nof which impact heavily on students. These days it\nis becoming progressively more unusual to find an\norganisation trying to do everything in-house\nthemselves. As is abundantly obvious, the core\nof it. What was less apparent from the Rector were\nthe potential problems. A senior member of IC\nrecently told me that there is a real worry that the\n\"old College\" will be neglected as the medical\nschools hog the limelight. There is also concern in\nsome quarters about the speed of the mergers,\nwhich will happen in less than 10 weeks; there are\nstill conflicts arising from the far simpler Mary's merger which took place in 1988. The mergers present an enormous opportunity to strengthen the\nCollege. We shall become the largest UK university by turnover, which will give us some serious\nclout. But within IC, the medics will have 40% of\nthe personnel and 70% of the money. Money is\npower and that's a lot of money.\nThe changes are also a big incentive to reform\nthe way College is run. Rationalisation should be at\nthe top of the agenda, given the obvious overlap\nbetween the various merging institutions. Some\npruning has taken place, but only where people\nhave retired, as far as can be determined. Sir Ron\ndents, whose interests are also of considerable\nimportance, begin to be affected. I can, thankfully,\nonly think of isolated examples where this has or\ndoes occur. The Rector did say that he \"would be\nsurprised if we have no voluntary redundancies by\nthe turn of the century.\" Time will tell.\nA number of points become clear as a result of my\ninterview with the Rector and conversations with\nother illuminati in College. Firstly, Imperial is\nabout to go through a very major transformation,\nwhich on the whole will be very beneficial but is\nnot without pitfalls. This must be acknowledged at\nevery level in the College. Opportunities must be\nseized, since they will almost certainly not present\nthemselves again for many years.\nOne thing that has become abundantly clear over\nthe course of this undertaking is the lack of transparency in Imperial's undertakings. The evasion\nand unnecessary secrecy which are the hallmark of\nmany dealings that the 'authorities' have with the\nvs Voice of Reason\nactivity of Imperial College is teaching and\nresearch, and (after prompting from the Rector)\n\"pastoral care of the students\".\nWe are not a cleaning company, catering is not\nour thing and, while accepting that security is\nslightly different from the previous two, it cannot\nbe argued that we must keep it to ourselves. Given\nthe near-glacial pace of change in this area, I was\nencouraged to hear that the Rector has \"no pos i tion\" on who should own these services. Less comforting was the very pessimistic stance on contracting out- only problems seemed to be identified, rather than opportunities; if it is such a bad\nidea, why are organisations all over the world moving in this direction?\nTo be fair, it is vital that one approaches these\nmatters carefully, otherwise we, the students, will\ninevitably suffer most. God forbid what would\nhappen if catering was contracted out and got\nworse.\nThe medical mergers are probably the biggest challenges facing the College. \"It is a win-win situ a tion\", he said, which, I think, most of us agree it\ncould be. Probably the most obvious grievance felt\nby the South Ken students is the apparent special\ntreatment given to our medical brethren. The\nRector was reassuring on the level of social facilities in the BMS, describing them as \"no more than\nstudents have in any larger department...much less\nthan they wanted.\" This has the potential to turn\nvery ugly if the medics don't get what they were\nexpecting, though it is good to hear that steps are\nbeing taken to coax the medics into broader\nCollege life.\nYou have all heard the marvellous advantages of\nthe BMS for us all, and I for one agree with much\nseems to favour re-deployment, rather than red un dancy, which is all very well, but rarely delivers\nthe goods.\nSuch laudable compassion is not limited to the\nRector; a senior member of the Sherfield staff\nrelated a story of a man who was up for red und an cy. This was put to a senior member of the\nManagement and Planning Group (IC's effective\nhead honchos), who asked \"does he have afa mi ly?\" Gentlemen, we are not running a charity. The\nRector rightly said that \"it is true that universities\nhave tried to look after their staff...to try to be a good employer\", which of course is essential for\ngood morale. But let us not get carried away with\nthis benevolent attitude, to the point where stu-students are counterproductive, and invariably\nresults in egg on the faces of the powers that be.\nThis a view, to be fair, is supported some senior\nadministrative staff at IC, and hopefully will give\nthe necessary impetus. Students feel much more\ncontented if they feel that it is not the case of the\nrulers and the ruled. As for Sir Ron himself, I was\nbroadly impressed. There are clearly areas where I cannot agree with his stance, a feeling I suspect is\nmutual! He is a very adept performer, whose work\non the Dearing Committee is vital for the defence\nof Imperial's needs. A man with a lot on his plate\nat the moment, I am sure that he will concentrate\non the nitty-gritty of IC once the grand pro jets are\nup and running.\n\n"
