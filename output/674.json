A cold windy day at Harlington falls somewhat\nshort of this, but nevertheless ten intrepid\nmen (our eleventh arrived at lunch) grave the\nelements to take on Southampton in the\ncrucial game of our qualifying group.\nIC batted first with Gareth Fish playing\nsome rather cavalier strokes before lobbing a catch to mid-off. Dave Jones on the other\nhand, having been dragged out of Mech Eng\nreading room at 9:30am and wearing an\nassortment of other people's kit was having\ndifficulty seeing the ball let alone hitting.\nHowever he and Roger Wilson pushed the\nscore along to 85 before Dave was eventually\nout. At this point the middle order staged a dramatic collapse, Chirs Cole's impression of\nDerek Randall however did provide some\namusement for those who weren't trying to\nkeep warm inside. In the end we were all out\nfor 132 which we knew wasn't really many\nruns to defend.\nAt the beginning of the Southampton\ninnings we took the wickets of their two\nopening batsmen in the first two overs and\nsuddenly we were in with a chance. Howeyer\nat this stage one Southampton player decided\nto smash the ball to all parts of the ground\nand there was little anyone could do to stop\nhim. Fortunately we got him out before tea\nbut it seemed unlikely we could win. However\nafter tea Chris Cole, bowling with the wind,\ntook a couple more wickets and gave us a chance again, but in the end Southampton\njust crept home leaving us to drown our\nsorrows in the bar and look forward to\nSaturday's game.\nThe AGM will be held on Friday 25 May at\n7:00pm in the Volleyball Court. Papers are up\nfor those wishing to stand for posts on the\nBadminton Exec. All members of the club are\nwelcome to stand, whatever their ability. I dare say there might be a little drink in\nSouthside afterwards.\nOn Sunday 6 May, three members of the IC\nJudo Club went to the LJS in Stockwell for a grading. Jim Dawson, at his first grading,\nthrew his first opponent for i jp on, and got a well deserved yellow belt. Caroline Scott,\nrecently elected next year's Captain, was\npromoted to green belt, not helped by some\ndubious referee decisions. Modesty prevents\nme saying how well Graham West did, but\nsuffice it to say I was promoted to brown belt,\nafter two straight wins.\nIn addition to Cathy, Ian Nevitt, Sarah\nParker and Chris Dunn were elected onto\nnext year's exec.\nThe last scheduled practise is next Tuesday.\nThose wishing to continue Judo may do so at\nUL U on Friday evenings. A social event has\nbeen provisionally arranged for Thursday 21\nJune, further details will be available on\nTuesday.\nPage 10 Friday, May 18, 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Letters WM\nConsoc\nSmear\nCampaign\nDear Pallab\nMay I say how sorry I was to\nsee that members of the\nFederation of Conservative\nStudents at Imperical College\nhave apparently decided to\nlaunch a smear campaign\ndirected against the National\nUnion of Students.\nIn his letter to FELIX last\nweek, Graham Brown alleges\nthat the report of the two\nImperial College Union visitors\n. to the NUS Easter Conference\nis, in effect, untrue. These\nallegations are not only an\ninsult to the integrity of those\nwho attended the Conference\non behalf of ICU, but are\napparently based on no more\nthan hearsay. To the best of my\nknowledge Graham himself did\nnot attend the conference. It is\ntherefore hard to see how he can\nclaim to have firsthand\nknowledge of events occur ing at\nthe conference unless he\npossesses remarkable powers of\nextra-sensory perception.\nThe whole point of sending\nIC Union visitors to the\nconference was to establish for\nourselves whether harassment\nand intimidation is rife at NUS Conferences as has been\nclaimed in the past. I would far\nrather place my trust in the\naccounts of independent and\ntrustworthy Union officers who\nwere actually present at the\nevent than in the ranting s of an\nindividual who shows clear\npolitical motivation in\nattempting to undermine the\ncredibility of the NUS. The last thing I would wish to\ndo is accuse Graham of\nfabricating these stories in a deliberate attempt to mislead\nImperial College students.\nHowever, I would be most\ninterested to see Graham\nproduce hard evidence to\nsubstantiate his allegations.\nSince libel is a criminal offence\nin civil law, I have no doubt that\nhe will be writing again to\nFELIX so as to make his\nposition crystal clear on this\nmatter.\nI am happy to be able to\nreassure your readers that, far\nfrom helping other colleges in\nLondon to d is affiliate from the\nNUS as Graham suggests, I will\ncontinue to point out to them\nfrom an imp arita l position both\nLeftert-to-the-Edifor\nJdL\u2014\u00bb\n:Letters-fo-f he fr Wor the dangers and benefits of\npursuing such a course . of\naction.\nYours more sincerely than Mr\nBrown\nPeter Burt\nDemocracy?\nDear Pallab\nEver since entering this\nuniversity I have been bitterly\ndisappointed with the Union. I knew it was 'right wing', I knew\nit was run by 'unfeeling\nbastards'. What I didn't know\nwas that it was undemocratic,\nthat the majority of IC students\nhad no say in its affairs, and\nthat it metes out justice\naccording to personal prejudice.\nInstead of calling quorum\nherself, as any union leader\nconscious of her responsibility\nto uphold democracy in this\nCollege, Gaynor just sits and\nfrowns when quorum is called.\nInstead of abandoning the\nU GM, because it is not large\nenough to be representative,\nand organising another next\nweek and public ising it properly\nso that all students will know\nabout it, the Union hacks just\ncontinue with their reports,\nknowing their decisions cannot\nbe overturned by the students,\nand they hold all power.\nTake, for example, their\ndecision to ban a Union\nmember from aUG M. Of\ncourse the Exec should take\ndisciplinary action against\nstudents who break Union\nrules, but no Union member\nshould be prevented from\nattending aUG M. This\namounts to expulsion from the\nUnion, and if Gaynor wants to\nexpel that member, then let her\nsay so now. It is a grave state of\naffairs when the Exec can meet\nin private and secretly ban a Union member from attending aUG M without having any\nappeal or even consulting that\nU GM. So let's have an end to ad hoc\nexpulsions from the Union, and\nan e rfd to in qu or at eUG Ms and\nlet's see if the Exec during their\nlast term of office will pay as\nmuch attention to democracy as\nthey do to alcohol.\nOne final note: 6 hours a year\nis not much time. If every Union\nmember gave this up to attend\nUG Ms then we would see\ndemocracy done, and there\nwould be no need to call\nquorum. I say this, because the\nExec should be saying it, only\nthey're probably in some\ncommittee meeting talking to\nthe College administration.\nPlease Gaynor talk to the\nstudents as well.\nYours angrily\nJohn Martins\nPS: It was me who called\nquorum, and if anybody tries to\nintimidate me or attack me\nagain I will inform the police\nand consult legal advisers on\nthe possibility of action\nagainst ICU members or ICU itself.\nDestroyed\nCredibility\nDear Pallab\nPallab Ghosh in last week's FELIX has probably destroyed\nany remaining credibility I might have had. It appears all\nhe can do to oppose my views is\na vicious character assassin a tion.\nIn The Phoenix I wrote a serious short story about a man\nin prison for rape, who believes\nin fascism and is slowly being\ndestroyed. I fail to see how this\ncould be described as 'porno-graphic', a 'little jerk off or\n'degrading to women'.\nThere are attitudes in this\nworld that we should all seek to\nunderstand; our attitudes towards each other that result in\ntorture, physically and men-tally.\nWe degrade those we disagree with or seek to use, we\nattack their mental abilities, we\ncall them names, we laugh at\nthem and mock them. The Jews\nwere laughed and jeered at in\nNazi Germany, Negro slaves\nwere a centre of amusement in\nthe 19th century, it seems this\nCollege supports a similar\nenter tani ing degradation of\nwomen. Women fuck pigs and\ndogs in front of cameras so we\ncan laugh. It's individual freedom they will shout! Michael\nNewman's at wat anyway! It's all a good laugh!\nWhen will we realise that\neven when those who torture or\ndegrade are enjoying themselves it does not become a mere\nlaugh? When will we realise that\nto assist them is to support\nthem?\nI have called all IC students\npimps, I think we are far worse,\nI think we support the\ndegradation of women and\nconsequently their oppression,\ntorture and rape.\nYours sincerely\nMichael P Newman\nLife Sci 2\nPoison\nTipped Pen\nDear Sir\nThe impressive rhetoric\ndelivered by Steve Marshall\ndrew my attention to your letter\ncolumn two weeks ago. I am\nwhole-hearted ly in favour of\nsuch provocative language and\nhave long since rejected the 'be\nnice' attitude of the 'middle of\nthe road'.\nI hope, therefore, that Steve\nMarshall will proceed to use his\nundoubted talent to provoke\ndiscussion on more important,\nrelevant and demanding issues.\nMay I influence his eagerly\nawaited subsequent publications by citing the fact that\napproximately 4,000 students at\nthis College couldn't give a toss\nabout the social impact of their\nselfish pursuit of academic or\nfinancial success. Science and\nengineering are meaningless\nand dangerous disciplines if\nthey are not treated foremost as\na service to humanity.\nTherefore I suggest he uses\nhis poison tipped pen in a more\nconstructive manner to stir\nthese murky waters of Imperial\nCollege.\nA Causebrook\nEE1\n(Steve Marshall graduated from\nImperial College in 1980, was\nFELIX Editor for the 1980-1\nsession and has been leaving\nCollege ever since-Ed.)\nPage 21 I Friday, Mar 18, t9S41I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "professional institutions, local media, industrial and business concerns,\nand schools. Next year's INCOST may be useful in making such\ncontacts. Individual students and their parents can continue to help by\ncontacting MPS, con cill or s and businessmen and pointing out the\nimportance of investment in education.\nAny efforts that the EAC may make to improve the public image of\nstudents will be futile if they are thwarted by the activities of other\ngroups within College. Few people are likely to support our case if\ncertain students carry on organising pornographic film shows, throwing\ndecaying organic matter around Putney, and generally maintaining a reputation for drunken ess and thug ger y. London\nAt present the University of London Union is the most active 'umbrella'\nrepresenting student unions in London. However, there is a great deal of\ncurrent discussion on the feasibility of setting up a London region NUS\ngroup. If such a body was to form, it is likely that emphasis on the\nbroader issues facing London students is likely to move away from ULU\nand towards the new group, leaving ULU to concentrate on academic\naffairs alone. This could be very damaging to IC Union, since at present\nmost of our contact with other student unions is via ULU. There is\ntherefore a danger that we could become still more isolated from the\nremainder of the student body through non-membership of NUS.\nULU next year has the potential to be far more relevant and effective\nthan it has been recently. Nevertheless, ULU will only work if there is\nadequate input from constituent unions, and it would greatly benefit\nImperial College Union if any of next year's officers were taken on the\nadmittedly demanding extra duties of being an active ULU hack.\nCollege\nExternal Affairs must, in future, have a much higher profile in Union\nactivities. Cutbacks in the amount of money being spent on Imperial\nCollege will mean less technical and administrative support, less new\nequipment, and fewer new initiatives in teaching. These will all have an\neffect on the academic standards of Imperial College graduates, and the\nUnion has a role to play in ensuring these standards do not drop. Many\nstudents are still unaware that Government policies have a direct impact\non the quality of teaching, time spent in the laboratory, and shortages of\nlibrary books. The Union must continue to work on the Academic Affairs\nfront to prevent teaching from suffering unu d ly from financial\nconstraints as well as highlighting and opposing the root causes of the\ndanger.\nDespite the image of the stereotyped Imperial College student, this\nyear's work has shown that, by and large, students are concerned atthe\neffects of education cuts and are prepared to act against them. The key\nto getting student involvement in such matters is to minimise the amount\nof effort an individual student must put in. It is not enough to put up\nposters and write articles in FELIX. Union officers must make an effort to\nbreak away from the Union Office and UGMs and actually talk to\nordinary students about these matters. Sabbaticals in particular must\nshow far more involvement in doing this, since to a large extent they are\nseen as the leaders of the Union.\nA mini-campaign in the first week of the new academic year, with a high External Affairs presence at the Rector's Speech and Freshers' Fair,\nw oud l go a long way towards nurturing an interest in Government\nEducaiton Policy, but follow-up work in letter-writing and petitioning\netc together with a major spring term campaign, is essential in\nmaintaining this interest. Obviously a great deal of work will be involved\nif such a campaign is to succeed, but this work will be made far more\neffective if other interested groups within College, such as political and\ndebating societies, campus trade-unions, or the College Press Office,\nare approached for assistance.\nA bit of self-indulgence\n'Many people in higher education pursue the hopeless illusion that the\nfuture of universities, polytechnics and colleges can be treated on its\nown. They want the cuts to be resisted but in a political vacuum. But\nhigher education policy cannot be abstracted from the ordinary process\nof politics. It is tied up with privatisation and cruise missiles and the\nCommon Market. It comes as part of rival packages and cannot be\nbought and sold singly. It is the vain attempt to deny or judge this central\nfact, the instinctive commitment to an apolitical and so anaemic\ndefence, that really explains any lack of bite in higher education fight\nback against the cuts'.\nA quotation from the leading article of the Times Higher Education\nSupplement, March 2 1984.\n>\nThe most important part of all\nLots of people have been very, very helpful to me during my time of\noffice. Special thanks must go to Pat, for typing excessive amounts of\npompous verbiage for me, and to Karen in her role as the source of all\nknowledge. I must also thank the long-suffering External Affairs\nCommittee, and above all else, everyone who marched, lobbied, wrote,\nsigned, leafletted, filled in questionnaires, at ten ed meetings, or\notherwise helped with or participated in External Affairs Committee, and\notherwise helped with or participated in External Affairs events this year.\nTo all those who didn't: why not get involved next year?\nBest of luck to everyone for next year. It will be a difficult time for the\nExternal Affairs Committee, but keep up the good work and remember:\nDon't let the bastards get you down.\nRed Pete\nICAAO\nThis year problems associated with Academic Affairs have not been in\nthe forefront of College life, but things have been rather quiet. This\nstems from a lack of desire on the part of the Academic Affairs Officer to\nattempt radical changes. Nevertheless, various matters have come to\nlight this year, few of them new, that have been sorted out to some\ndegree or another.\nAtthe beginning of the year the third year undergraduate students at\nManagement Science, were faced with having to attend events within\ntheir departments which clashed with other arrangements throughout\nCollege such as the Rectors Reception and Freshers Fair. When this\ncame to light, the Department of Management Science at first denied it,\nbut then pointed out that they had not timetabled anything for the\npostgraduate 'fresher s'. It seems that there is no College rule that the\nfirst two days of term should be kept clear for second, third, and fourth\nyears although only the Department of Management Science arranges\nanything. Complaints about this department date back to at least 1971.\nThe problem is that once the first few days of the first term are over, they\ntend to be forgotten about. This year I feel that we should get in before\nthe event, rather than after, so I intend to start up discussions again with\nProf Eilon and Peter Mee, over the summer. Another old problem which\nhas come to the surface again this year is that Geologists and Mining\nEngineers tend to be very much out of pocket after field trips. There\nseems to be very little which can be done to alleviate the problem at a College level. The departments are aware of the difficulties, but the fact\nthat the problem is country-wide lends itself to consideration by the\nExternal Affairs Officer.\nIt seems that the old problems are running rife again this year, since\nthere still seems to be widespread dissatisfaction at the standard of\nMaths lecturing in non-mathematical departments. The problem stems\nnot only from a widespread need for lecturer training but also results\nbecause the departments try to push too much into the syllabus.\nAs Academic Affairs Officer this year I have sat on several College\ncommittees: Board of Studies; Admissions Poilcy; Vacation Training\nand Education Technology. (There has only been one meeting of the\nEducational Technology Committee this year, which I was not able to\nat ten ed). It is sometimes difficult for undergraduates to attend College\nmeetings since they tend to be held at times which clash with lectures or\nlab time. For the meetings which I have attended, I feel bound to\nquestion my worth. Although occasionally I have been able to make\nuseful comments most of the committees are long standing ones and\ntend to move very slowly. It is very difficult for a student who attends\nperhaps only two or three meetings to gain any feeling of continuity, and\nto be aware of the niceties of the committee.\nThis year I have had a bare minimum of Academic Affairs meetings\nand do not feel that this has been particularly disaster o us. There is such\na large chunk of student representative bureaucracy be te we en the\nacademic reps at the grass root level, and the IC Academic Affairs\nOfficer that most difficulties can and should be dealt with well before\nthey reach the ICAAO. However this means that the Academic Affairs\nOfficer must trust the system to bring to his attention the true problems.\nThis is best achieved through informal discussions with dep reps and\nconstituent college academic affairs officers rather than through\nregular formal meetings where there may be nothing to discuss. In\ngeneral I think that this approach has worked fairly efficiently this year,\nand feel that it should be continued next year. I wish Graham Thorpe the\nbest of luck in tackling the same old problems next year!\nJoanna Claydon\nIC Academic Affairs Officer\n\n"

One of the major contributing factors to this follows on from\nthe recommendation that the residence should be essentially funded on\nthe basis of a self balancing loan financed scheme ser vied from income,\nbut College now realise that a large gap exists between going property\nprices and the likely income from present levels of student rents.

On a number of occasions this year we have felt that\nalthough the student representatives continually reported their\ndissatisfaction with the standard, quality and presentation of the food in\nthe refectories, the solutions for a number of our complaints appeared to\nbe the improvement of the environment in which the food is eaten.\nAlthough I agree that pleasant surroundings are desirable in a refectory,\nI do not believe they will make up for poor food quality and extortionate\nprices. During the year it appeared that the refectory committee were\nunwilling to make decisions on the major objectives of the refectory\nsystem ie whether each outlet should be functioning on a break-even\nbasis or how much profit the bars should be making. It was always stated\nthat in the past the system has worked\u2014however I feel this was more\nluck than judgement.\nI have been disappointed with the management of the refectory\nsystem within College\u2014the situation often ed appeared as if no one\nreally knew what was happening. The number of occasions when the\nstudent representatives questioned why the system should be managed\nin such a way, was only outnumbered by the number of times it was\nreported that someone \"would look into it'. Chris has fully documented\nrefectories in her report\u2014I don't believe I need to report any more.\nShop and Suggestions Committee\nI was asked to take over the chairmanship of S&C Committee in the\nspring term. I did so hoping that this would improve the communication\ninto the refectory system. I failed dismally. It appeared that we were\ncontinually minuting the same problems meeting after meeting with\nlittle having been achieved to solve them at any point. I do not believe\nthese committees work well as the basic problem lies with the quality of\nthe food, not in talking about it meeting after meeting after meeting.\nUnion Refectory\nThe dissatisfaction of the refectory system offered by College caused\nthe Union to investigate the possibility of taking over the Union\nrefectory.\nICU submitted proposals to College in late March, indicating their\ninterest in running the present refectory as a snack bar outlet under IC\nUnion control. The objective being to provide a complementary service\nto the present College facilities available, providing a simple hot and\ncold food during the lunch period, and snacks mid morning and\nafternoon.\nIt was envisaged a committee would be set up as a means of\ncommunication between the Union and the manager of the outlet, and\nwould consider problems such as suppliers of food, long term fabric of\noutlet etc. The manager would be responsible for ordering of stock, day\nto day running etc. College have agreed to the Union's proposals for the\nrefectory outlet, however the final discussions regarding capital\nexpenditure, financial aid from College and personnel matters are still to\ntake place. Chris and I will be meeting the senior College personnel\ninvolved to discuss these issues at the end of May.\nAlthough the sabbaticals originally began work on this project, I am\ngrateful to Hugh Southey and the internal services committee for their\nhelp during the final stages of the proposal, indicating that a strong\ncontinuity through to next year will exist, which will ensure that the\noutlet is managed effectively and efficiently. This is undoubtedly one of\nthe major achievements during this year, and I wish everyone the best of\nluck for next year.\nWELFARE\nThere are numerous aspects to welfare problems at IC, some of which\nhave been solved this year, some of which are unlikely to reach a more\nsatisfactory solution than at present.\nHealth Centre\nThe continual problem of a long waiting list and 'all day' open clinics has\nincreased this year. The Health Centre has attempted to alleviate the\nproblem through introducing a ticket system at the open\nclinic\u2014however this has done little solve the problem as the centre is\noverworked with the present level of staff.\nRape Alarms\nAt joint Council last year, policy was made that every female student\nwould De enim ea10 a rape alarm if they felt this necessary. Both Chris\nand I have always been dubious as to the use of these hand-held rape\nalarms as we felt they were unreliable and possibly dangerous to the\nvictim as well as the attacker. We investigated the possibility of\ndistributing a different model but have had limited success. I would like\nto recommend that next year's welfare officer thoroughly investigates\nthe sources of supply of rape alarms if this policy is to continue and (ii) is\nresponsible for the distribution of the alarms.\nWelfare Handbook\nI was disturbed to find that there were a number of inaccuracies in the IC\nWelfare Handbook 'But were afraid to ask', I also felt it lacked\ninformation directly related to IC. I hope this situation will be remedied .\nbefore the Handbook is reprinted this year.\nWelfare Assistant 1\nI was extremely pleased that Karen Stott was appointed as a permanent'\nmember of staff this year. She is an invaluable asset to Student Services\nand our welfare service.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nJudgements made at the House of Lords during the past eighteen\nmonths regarding the terms and conditions under which ordinary\nresidence of the United Kingdom was considered, leading to the\ndecision of whether home or overseas fee status is applicable, has had a significant effect on a number of students at IC. Many students\npreviously classified as home students now have to pay overseas fees. I had to deal with a number of queries at the beginning of my term of\noffice, with many students being in a financially desperate state.\nFortunately, in most cases the departments involved were able to cover\nthe extra fees for the remainder of the research period. However some\nstudents suffered from the decisions. One of the outcomes of the\njudgement was that some students may be eligible for a refund in fees\nfor the 1982/3 session. This may have affected about 50 IC students.\nCollege are awaiting a decision on a test case presently in the Courts\nbefore they take any further action.\nPOSTGRADUATES\nMy involvement with the postgraduate sector of IC has been very low\nthis year. Although I have had a fair amount of communication with\npostgraduates through clubs, societies and financial problems, my\ninvolvement has not really extended beyond those issues. However, I would like to thank Jeremy Rudd (Silwood) and Chris Hendy for their\ninvolvement in postgraduate issues, and congratulate them on an\nextremely successful joint Postgrad party held at Silwood in March.\nCONFERENCES\nThis year the sending of delegates to conferences has been one of the\nmain issues of discussion, with a decision to send delegates to NUS\nConference as observers being made at Council and subsequently\noverturned at a UGM. However, a number of delegates have attended\nconferences this year.\nPresidents Informal\nI attended this two day conference in Bradford. Although the intentions\nand objectives of the conference were good, I did not really feel that\neither I or ICU had benefitted to a are at extent. I would suggest to next\nyear's Exec that this conference is probably more applicable to the\nExternal Affairs Officer than the President.\nBars Working Party\nAgain I attended this conference with three other delegates from IC. I found this conference informative, useful and interesting and would\nrecommend that at least the Deputy President and President should\nattend next year.\nULU Training School\nI was unable to attend this due to illness, however, reports indicate this a worthwhile venture for sabbaticals to participate in.\nNUS\nEventually a decision was made (and upheld) to send two delegates to\nNUS Conference. Hugh Stiles and Dave Rowe attended as observers,\ntheir general impression appeared to be that although NUS was\ndeveloping into a better organisation, the benefit ICU would gain\nthor ugh affiliation was not worth the affiliation fee of \u00a315,000. In my view\nIC Union should not re affiliate to the National Union of Students. I do\nnot believe the moral argument is valid as I feel the NUS do not have as\nmuch bargaining power as they might like to believe. Their success this\nyear with negotiations on the student maintenance grant and travel\nawards has been minimal. I do not believe IC Union's affiliation would\nalter the situation. The \u00a315,000 is better spent within IC Union.\nINCOST\nJim Boucher and Joanna Claydon, represented ICat INCOST 1984. The\nConference appears to have been extremely successful. The delegates\nreturned with the recommendation that IC host INCOST 1985. The\nsubject of the conference will be Biotechnology. Discussion at Council\nindicated a favourable response to the idea. During my discussion with\nCollege both the Rector and John Smith indicated support for the\nconference and John Smith was able to commit College into financially\nsupporting the venture, for which I am indebted as there is no doubt that\nwithout this financial support we would not have been able to proceed. I am at present writing to a number of companies and interested parties\nasking for support both financially and through participation. I will\ncontinue to administer INCOST 1985 until the end of my term of off ice. I anticipate approximately 50 delegates attending INCOST 1985, which\nwill be held between April 13-18,1 wish next year's Exec sucess with the\nventure.\n\n"

    "content": "IN COST'84 The theme of INCOST 84 was\nthe social effects of Information\nTechnology. Most valuable\ncontributions were made in the\ndiscussion groups which were\ntimetabled every day and\nfrequently overran allocated\ntimes. There were also\nscheduled a number of lectures\nand visits, which gave a certain\namount of background technical\ninformation. The lectures and\nvisits were intended to provide\nan appreciation of the\npossibilities of the new\ntechnologies, the implications of\nwhich were discussed afterwards\nin groups.\nThe theme itself was\nsubdivided into five different\nsections: the implications to the\nhousehold; recreation time,\nbusiness; education; and the\nindividual. In order for discussion\nto be more effective the\nparticipants were divided into\nfour groups each day.\nThe fact that the conference\nwas given in English, the second\nor even third language of most\nparticipants, posed fewer\nproblems than expected, although the ability of some\n.lecturers and delegates varied\n\u2022considerably. Some heated\narguments arose because of\nmisinterpretation of a phrase\nbut, in general, effective\ndiscussion was hampered by a lack of committee etiquette\nmaking ICU Council seem\ndecidedly peaceful and democratic. The Dutch appeared to have the knack of\nthrowing a discussion into total\nd is a ray just as it was reaching a logical conclusion. In fact, it\nbecame obvious that the group\ncould never come to a unanimous decision. The\npolitical stance of the delegates\nalso varied considerably, from\nthe arch-capitalists to the Dutch\n'Greens'.\nAfter the Mechanical Engineers' Annual Dinner and\nDance, for some reason called\nthe Cuba night, on the first\nevening, followed by a traditional\nraw herring breakfast and a champagne tram tour of\nHelsinki, social events were\nconfined to evening activities.\nThe IC delegation gave the rest\nof the delegates a lesson in how\nto get absolutely devastated yet\nstill turn up for each morning's lectures. Memorable highlights\n. (depths!) were Jo's blissful\nignorance of the contents of the\nfree drinks given away after the\nChemical Engineers Dinner (and\nsubsequent regrets!), and Jim's breath the morning after a heavily spiced Russian meal\namply washed down with vodka.\nThe idea of having an Opsoc\nchairman helped enormously on\nthe song evening when the\ndelegates, and totally bewildered\nFinns, were treated to an IC bar\nnite version of Of Alouette and\nSloop John B. On the organisation side the\nFinns have an em or mou s advantage over other student\nunions in that they have the\nresources to own and run a very\nimpressive, modern conference\ncentre. The campus is the\nOlympic village of the 1952\nGames and students pay the\nequivalent of \u00a312pw for single or\ndouble rooms, better equipped\nthan any IC block, all of which\n' are run by the Union. Through\nletting of its facilities the Union\ncan boast a turnover in excess of\n\u00a34m pa. Particularly impressive\nwas the standard of cleanliness of\ncampus facilities and the respect\ngiven them by students. Even\nafter late night parties,\ncomparable to Carnival, there\nwas no evidence the next\nmorning of anything having\ntaken place.\nThe degree system is totally\ndifferent with student loans being\nused for courses lasting up to\nseven years part or full time\nwork. Engineering students have\nto undertake industrial work\nafter basic studies and complete\ntheir degree with a Master's thesis. Having said that there is\nno evidence that the students are\nany better than IC graduates but\nthey do have very pleasant,\nspacious departments.\nThrough informal discussion\nand formal presentations by each\ndelegation, we learnt a lot about\nEuropean students' organisations. In general, apart from\nFinland, other countries unions\ntend to be much more bureaucrat if c and inefficient. In\nspite of our limited resources, we\nat IC appear to have a more\nefficient organisation, with better\naccountability, which is less top\nheavy than our European\ncounterparts.\nJo Claydon\nJim Boucher\nJim Boucher-drunk in Finland\nThe Shape of\nThings to Come\nIn the sabbatical elections David Rowe promised to\" Bring FELIX back from the dead\". Here he gives some of his plans for next year, and asks for your help. Next year there are going to be a lot of changes in FELIX. Between now and October I'm going to look carefully at each\nsection in the newspaper to see\nhow it can be extended,\ncompressed or re-designed. But\nFELIX is meant to be your\nnewspaper and I am particularly\nanxious to find out what you\nwant it to be.\nCartoons\nUnfortunately IC is loosing three\nvery good cartoonists at the end\nof this year. Are there any\nbudding artists out there who\nwould like to try their hand? If so\nthen please drop in to the FELIX Office some time.\nPage 6 \u2022 BH HH Hn i Advertising\nIf. on the other hand, you want a career in the advertising industry\nthere is a place for you on FELIX next year. We need someone to\nco-ordinate ad bookings and to\nsell FELIX to advertisers.\nof those horrible logos (for which\nI must accept responsibility).\nFeatures\nI hope to continue having regular\nfeatures from clubs and societies.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean a lot of work on your part, and is\nthe best way of public ising your\nclub's activities. Any newly-elected club captains who are\ninterested in a feature can discuss\ntheir plans with me this term.\nWhile on the subject of clubs\nand societies I would ask all\npublicity officers to start\nplanning their posters and\nhandouts for Freshers' Fair.\nThere is always a rush for\nprinting to be done in the week\nbefore term starts and so it is best\nto get it done this term or during\nthe summer.\nFinally, if anyone is interested\non working on FELIX next year\nin any capacity, then please come\nalong. No previous experience is\nrequired, and no great\ncommitment is expected. If you\njust have a good idea for FELIX next year, then please feel free to\ndrop in to the FELIX Office to\ndiscuss it.\nSport\nName. Sport is one of the areas that I promised to change.

    "content": "The new committee and the revised structure of Union Transport\nseem much more reasonable from an unbiased Union standpoint, but as\nRCC Chairman I am unhappy with the way that Union Transport has\nslipped away from RCC in only four years, especially since I seethe new\nscheme of things leading to an increase in transport costs for RCC clubs\nand therefore an increase in the transport subsidy claimed. This is\nalmost certain to strain the finances next year, since the proposed RCC\ngrant income wholly comprises the additional grants of Waterskiing and\nParachuting and Parascending. I hope that next year the CCU's and\nother MSC's will acknowledge the fall in their transport costs and will act\nreasonably when RCC approaches UFC for additional finance.\nThe RCC ExeG felt that the business of the new committee had the\npotential for a lot of work for RCC\u2014possibly more than the Chairman or\nVice-Chairman could handled. Therefore, the dormant post of\nTransport Officer has been revived to provide the RCC representation\non the committee.\nGeneral\nThe use of a computer program to pe form the RCC accounting has\nproved its worth again this year especially at RCC Exec meetings, when\nthe state of any club's finances can be reviewed in the knowledge that\nthey are a maximum of one treasurers' meeting out of date. Like all past\nRCC Chairmen I urge all the other MSC's( and any other part of the\nUnion which may be interested) to take up the computerised accounting\nsystem. This year the use of the College mainframe to perform the\naccounting has moved onto a formal basis thanks to the generosity of\nICCC in letting RCC have a user num beV specifically for that purpose.\nThe composition of the RCC Exec this year has proved very\nsuccessful: RCC divides into two sections, 'indoor' and 'outdoor'. This\nyear has seen an 'indoor' chairman and an 'outdoor' vice chairman\nresulting in informal, well-balanced, unbiased decision making. I therefore recommend to future RCC's that they seek to unite the two\nfactions in the top two student posts for the good of their clubs and for\nthe good of RCC.\nThis being my fourth year on RCC, I was aware at the start of the\nsession that the same old questions cropped up again and again at\nGeneral Committees and to overcome this, information sheets were\nproduced for CC club treasurers and for RCC club chairmen detailing\nhow to set about doing things in RCC and mentioning as much RCC\npolicy as possible. To my mind these sheets have been a success; I am\nsure that the club chairmen have, this year, had a much better idea of\nwhat they can and cannot do. It is my intention that these sheets be\nrevised and reissued next year.\nFinally, I would like to thank my Exec who have all been wonderfully\nconscientious in the execution of their duties, the Union Exec for\nassisting me over the course of the year and the RCC Club Chairmen all\nof whom have given time up to explain to me just what their clubs\nactually do.\nYou have all helped RCC run smoothly for the benefit of all. Thank\nyOU' Hugh Stiles\nRCC Chairman\nSCC\nThis year has seen a tighter control in the running of S CC clubs and\ngreater cooperation between them with increased activities. As a result I believe that the S CC is starting to work together as a group of similar\nclubs, rather than as isolated units.\nEVENTS: At the Freshers Fair the clubs were separated into four\ngroups; the current affairs clubs, the religious clubs, the miscellaneous\nones in Sherfield and those in the Union; each set were grouped\ntogether ine one room and had an SCC poster advertising them. Thanks\nare due to Mr Terry Quirk and f he Quills publishers for allowing us to\nreproduce their poems. Unfortunately, due to a mix-up, the Overseas\nStudents Committee had been allocated one stall for about ten different\nclubs, in the room containing the SCC pressure groups; as a have lost\npotential members here, but the aggregate membership of all SCC clubs\nhas nevertheless increased considerably this year. The largest clubs are\nthe Industrial Society (approx 400), Wellsoc (approx 350) and SF\n(approx 250). During the year three new clubs were formed (Socialist\nWorkers, Pooh Bear and here at last, QT), while the Social Democrats\nhave re-formed. An attempt was made to restart PATA, while an\nAlternative Technology group may still be in the pipeline.\nDuring the year, SF, Wellsoc etc have filled the gap left when Ents\ndecided not to have regular film shows; Wellsoc celebrated their 20th anniversary, and have found two more to celebrate next year. Pimlico\nConnection have lost the services of Dr Sinclair Goodlad, after nine\nyears of help, but I am pleased to note that Council awarded him\nHonorary Life Membership for contributions to Pimlico, STOIC and\nWellsoc.\nThe Conservative Society and the CND held four successful joint\nevents; the Bah'ai, Islamic and Jewish societies held a religious week,\ncoordinated by Nigel Young; there was the Christian Societies' Contact\nWeek; and twenty clubs from SCC and OSC participated in the Human\nRights Week, coordinated by John Sattaur, which was* the most\nimpressive of the three HRWsto have been held in College. I would like\nto thank the FELIX staff for the help in producing the supplements and\narticles for these events and all others. The current affairs groups have\nhad a very active year, this being reflected in the Social Colours\nnominations received by the SCC, and WIST have been heavily involved\nin the production of a report for the Women in Science and Engineering\nYear.\nFINANCE: This year has been a great improvement inefficiency in the\nrunning of clubs. In particular, the finances of each club have been\nunder stricter control, with all clubs now keeping a detailed and up-to-date account book. This requires a large effort by each club treasurer,\nbut it probably leads to a greater awareness of budgeting through the\nyear, which enables better control of the money supply. As a result, the\n, SCC has been able to purchase a secondhand cine-projector and a tea\nurn. The expenditure of these items is only a little more than the annual\ncosts to the SCC of hire. Dr Robin Smith, The College Senior Tutor and\nSCC HST is stepping down at the end of this term. He has been\nexceptionally efficient and helpful for the past two years, and he, too,\nhas had HLM awarded by Council.\nFINALLY: This year has Seen the beginning of the formation of an\nSCC identity; clubs have been encouraged to take an active part in\ndecision making, which has been most democratic this year (!!), and to\ncoordinate their events more closely with each other. I would like to\nthank the S CC committee for their help this year, and wish Jonathan\nGerson, S CC Chairman-elect, and the clubs, success in the future.\nR JE Graham\nSCC Chairman 1983-4\nPUB BOARD\nThe job of any Major Sub-Committee Chairman seems to consist mainly\nof sorting out problems; this year has been no exception as far as\nPublications Board is concerned.\nThe session began with the events surrounding the resignation of the\nHandbook Editor Adrian James. Here both the editor and the Exec were\nto some extent at fault, the difficulty arising through a lack of\ncommunication. In future years, both parties must ensure that the\nHandbook is adequately checked before printing. Adrian James did,\nnevertheless, do a very good job, and produced a fine Handbook.\nFELIX this year has been a controversial as ever and editorial freedom\nhas been preserved. Whilst this is a healthy position to be in, future\neditors and Execs should realise that editorial freedom and efficient\nrunning of the Union need not be mutually exclusive. Pallab has\nsucceeded in attracting a large and enthusiastic staff and producing a FELIX that has always been lively and, increasingly, well read.\nThe Phoenix this year, contrary to all expectations, has been\ncontroversial in respect of one article. In spite of this it is a fine magazine\nand the editor, Tony Atkins, has excel le ned in producing a magazine\nthat is in the best traditions of recent years.\nThe Alternative Prospectus has, for the third year running, been\nproduced by an AP Editor. In previous years the Academic Affairs\nOfficer had this responsibility. I feel that the move to having a specialist\nI editor has resulted in dramatic improvement in quality and I am pleased\nj to note that Council have recognised this in the awarding of an AP\nI Editor's pot.\nIC Radio remains the only student radio station in London, and goes\nfrom strength to strength. Under the able leadership of Neil Collins the\nstation has attracted a large and capable staff. The friendly atmosphere\nin the station is reflected in the large number of fresher s who have\nstarted working on IC Radio this year.\nIn spite of internal difficult is, STOIC have succeeded in broadcasting '\na full program\u201e<t> ver the closed-circuit system to the Halls and Common\nRooms. It is hoped that the new leadership will resolve these internal\ndifficulties and that the station will continue to thrive.\nIt has been evident to me, at times, that a degree of animosity has\nexisted between certain of the Publications. This is particularly counter-productive, and both parties should realise that if each is to function to\nits full potential then this must stop.\nIn spite of this, publications at Imperial College are in a very healthy\nstate, and are the envy of colleges and universities throughout Britian.\nThe range of publications that we produce is unrivalled, and as for\nquality, we rank among the best. If the level of capital expenditure\nachieved this year is maintained, and students continue to be interested,\nthen things can only improve.\nFinally, I would like to thank our Honorary Senior Treasurer Steve\nCook, who took over this year and has done a splendid job. Thanks are\nalso to Hugh Southey who took over as Pub Board Chairman on my\nresignation.\nDavid Rowe\nINTERNAL SERVICES\nThe performance of the Internal Services Committee this year has been\npatchy. On the plus side ISC has played a major part in the Union\nrefectory takeover, a move that the Union should have thought about\nearlier. However, on the minus side, ISC often performed in an aimless\nmanner. To counter this ISC is drafting a list of policies that it feels it\nshould be pressing for. Hopefully this will result in things such as a new\nservice till.( Anyone with an idea for services for the Union to provide\nshould contact me in the FELIX Office.)\nThe committee members of ISC have sat on several college\ncommittees.\nREFECTORY: This committee can (and does on occasion) totally\nignore student representatives. On issues such as pricing where student\nsuggestions are sensitive but unpopular they are often ignored.\nSUGGESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS: Sometimes tends to ignore\nfood and concentrate on furniture. However, in general, it is prepared to\nget to the root of problems.\nSHOP: An excellent management committee.\nLIBRARY: There were few problems.\nBOOKINGS: Apparently no problems.\nBAR: Many improvements in bar management by the committee e. In\nparticular the revision of bar pricing.\nFinally, I would like to thank everyone who has helped this year,\nChristine, Gaynor, Sean, Jean, Pat, Dave, Martin, Pete, Diana, Pallab\netc.\n\n"

There are a great many\nblack students at Imperial who would find not only the presence of a representative from such a brutal and devi sive regime abhorrent but would\nalso be offended by the fact that such a person was speaking at the invitation\nof a Union society. Other colleges refuse a platform to declared racists and\nfascists.\nOn the other hand if universities do not provide a forum for free thought\nthen what hope is there for free speech and debate?

Pallab Ghosh\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nUNION\nAGM24 May Great Hall l pm This Week's Puzzle\nFor this, I am indebted to 'Rupert Bear'. It's a logic\npuzzle which is better than the usual, and even\nthough I said I'd make them easy this term, I 'll make\nan exception this week.\nThere is an old tradition in the physics department\nat Primelia College. Every year, at the end of the\nautumn term, there is a Christmas Test to see how\nthe first year students are getting on. Unfortunately\nthere is another well established tradition that if a student finds out that he has failed then he waits\nuntil lunch time before climbing to the top of the\nQueens Tower and jumping off. One year, after\nreceiving all the results, Dr Keith Bamight, Head of\nthe department, had an idea to help the struggling\nstudents without the possibility of any fatalities. He\nwrote notes to all the first year students listing those\npeople who failed, always leaving out the name of\nther person to receive the particular note if he was\nalso a fail er. This way, he thought, the people who\nneeded help would get extra support from friends\nwithout actually finding out that they had failed.\nAfter delivering all these notes in the afternoon, he\nrelaxed knowing that the students wouldn't show\neach other the lists at the risk of causing\nunnecessary damage to the Queens Lawn.\nAfter five days without anyone jumping, Dr\nBarnight thought everything was alright. However,\non the sixth day after delivering the notes, the six\nfresher s who failed all went up the tower and jumped\noff. Assuming there is at least one failure, how did\nthe fail ers know that they had failed?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday, please. \u00a35\ncheque, courtesy of Mend-a Bike, for the randomly\nselected winner.\nLast Week's Solution\n80809\n124)10020316\n992\n1003\n992\n1116\n1116\nOf 25 correct solutions, the randomly selected\nwinner is R BH Tan of Chem Eng 3 who must know\nwhere to pick up the cheque from by now.\nThanks Neil.\nIf anyone wishes to apply for the job of Puzzles\nEditor for next year, could they please contact me by\nWednesday week (30 May) with a few puzzles.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince ConsortRf,SW?\nTel 01-589 5111 ext n1048 or internal 2881.

    "content": "the reductions in the student maintenance grant, the decrease in\nstudent travel awards and the abolition of ILEA. Peter has expressed the\nview that the sabbaticals and Council have not supported the External\nAffairs Committee. Personally, I did not stand on a politically inclined\nplatform and have felt that my priorities lay with many other aspects of\nthe Union, which may have led to my involvement with External Affairs\nbeing less than that of my pre des ses sor.I have attended GU C( essentially ULU Council) as a representative of\nIC Union, however in my opinion the committee has very little to offer IC.\nThe internal sabbatical structure of ULU has been put under great strain\nthis year, which has lead to a loss of direction of any objectives it\noriginally had. GU C has functioned, but has suffered in my opinion from\nthe political inclinations of the other London colleges in attendance.\nInternal Services\nThe Internal Services Committee was set up for the first time this year. It\nhas worked well, being actively involved in the discussions on the\ntakeover of the Union refectory. I hope it continues to work well next,\nyear under its new chairmanship.\nRag\nRag looked doomed at the beginning of the year with the failure of the\nRag Chairman, however thanks to Sean, Dave Parry and James Benbow\nand their active involvement during the summer and autumn term it has\nsucceeded beyond anything I could have imagined. The CCUs have\nbeen active with many different stunts and have contributed\nwholeheartedly to the Rag Charity appeal. I believe the Rag total this\nyear is hoped to reach \u00a37,000.\nUnion Finance Committee\nI was please that the responsibility for the finances of the IC Union\nreturned to the Deputy President this year. Chris, has chaired the\ncommittee with great expert ese and a responsible attitude, which has\nresulted in a more balanced financial view of the Union by both major\nsub-committees and CCUs. My thanks must also go to Dr Ken Weale the\nsenior treasurer of IC Union who has exhibited great patience and calm\nw nen we have continually introduced further financial commitments\nonto IC Union.\nUnion House Committee\nI have regularly attended House Committee and am pleased with the\nprogress that has been made in redecorating and refurbishing Union\nareas. However, both Chris and I have been fed up of moving furniture\naround the Union Building that clubs have borrowed but not replaced.\nUnion Transport Committee\nI have been more involved in transport matters than many of my\npre des ses s or s. This year we proposed certain changes to the IC Union\ntransport system, which has resulted in a larger number of clubs and\nsocieties regularly using Union vans rather than having to hire\nexternally. Due to this re-vamping of the bookings system I have\nnegotiated a deal with Budget Van Hire, so that minibuses may be hired\nat rates lower than standard commercial charges. On one or two\nweekends during the summer term, a shared costing exercise was used,\nin order that no club suffered financially from being unable to use a Union van. This worked well and I intend to charge the summer tours on a similar basis. Next year I have recommended that the Hon Sec is\nresponsible for transport, as this ties in well with the extra aspect of\ninsurance incorporated due to the external account being set up with\nBudget.\nCOLLEGE COMMITTEES\nGoverning Body and Finance and Executive Committee\nThese are the two most senior committees within the College structure,\nboth are chaired by Sir Henry Fisher and are attended by senior College\nadministrators and College Governors. IC Union has three\nrepresentatives on these committees, who have observer status. On\nseveral occasions this year :we have been given opportunities to voice\nour opinions on matters ranging from the progress, or lack of it, on the\nfire alarm installation in Southside, the 28 UGC questions, to the\ndevelopment of the Harlington Gravel with a view of possibly \u00a31,000,000\nbeing made available to expand the sporting facilities at IC. I feel that\nthese meetings are exceptionally valuable to the student representatives\nas a vast amount of internal College business is discussed, often\nproducing immediate action after discussion at these committees.\nCollege House Committee\nThis is a smaller, internal version of Governing Body and F&E, and\nchaired by t ne Rector. It deals primarily with matters relating to\nresidences, refectories, estates and conferences. Again, Chris and I, as\nstudent representatives have been vocally active on many issues, stating\nour dissatisfaction with aspects of the Estates and Refectory sections of\nCollege. In general, this is not the committee to initiate internal'\narguments crit is ising the inefficiency of certain aspects of the College\nadministration, however we did raise a number of issues during the\nspring term meeting as we were frustrated by the lack of progress being\nmade even though we were continually reporting our dissatisfaction at\nlower committee levels. This has resulted in something being\ndone\u2014however whether College are able to improve efficiency in certain parts of their administration must remain as a long term objective.\nOverseas Students Committee\nThis year the committee has been actively involved in the recruitment of\noverseas students from certain areas. This is directly linked to the\nCollege objective of attaining a40% postgraduate level and restrictions\nimposed by the UGC.\nGraduate Studies\nThis committee is concerned with the postgraduate sector of College. It\nis notable that many of our postgraduates are unable to complete their,\nstudies in the allocated three year period, which often results in financial\nproblems. I am grateful to Chris Hendy for his support on this\ncommittee.\nWelfare Committee\nI found this an unusual committee\u2014it appears to make very few\ndecisions, but receives reports from various sectors. This year we hae\ndiscussed the Health Centre, student cou ncel ling, student residence\nand women students.\nAthletics Committee\nAn interesting committee chaired by Sir Toby Weaver. It was\nunfortunate this year, that for the first time in many years, two fatalities\nin the Sports Centre had to be reported. The first involved a University\nCollege student who committed suicide in the rifle and pistol range, the\nsecond, a tragic accident, in the swimming pool where Christopher\nDarkes. an Elec Eng first year drowned. On behalf of the Union I expressed condolences in both cases. I was able to attend Chris's funeral in December. One of the notable achievements on the\ncommittee this year was the agreement that the entry charges to the\nSports Centre would not be increased for the 1984/5 session.\nAthletics Ground Committee\nA thoroughly enjoyable committee. My thanks to Mick and Ann\nReynolds for their work at Harlington\u2014Ann's catering has been well\nreceived by all. It is pleasing to report that the attitude of the committee\nis that any surplus in the bar or catering accounts should be spend on\nstudent needs. The mid-term reduction in bar prices was greatly\nappreciated by sportsmen and women. The only disappointing report\nat the final meeting this year was that Mick and Ann were still awaiting\nwork on their kitchen by the Estates section, first reported two years\nago. To quote Peter Mee, the chairman, \"the student representatives see\nthis as a further confirmation of their views of the Estates Office.\"\nHowever, further to Peter's memo to the Estates section, action was\ntaken with ih hours, and Mick and Ann may even have a modernised\nkitchen by the end of this session.\nStudent Residence Committee\nThis committee has functioned well this year, although there have been\noccasions where decisions appeared to be 'railroaded' by the Chairman\nafter possible indications that further discussion was necessary.\nMeetings have often proved frustrating due to the continual lack of.\nprogress made by the Estates section on many important projects.\nFollowing the Lauwerys report on residences last year, many of the\nissues discussed at SRC were directly related to the report. A College\nnotice, published in February cleared up many uncertain aspects of\nresidences, re it te rating the College commitment to obtain a minimum of\nanother 125 residence places, as the loss of the Fremantle is expect e ed in June 1985, with many of the smaller Head Tenancies being lost atthe\nend of the current session.\nOne of the more controversial aspects of the College notice included\nthe transfer of messenger and security personnel costs onto the\nresidence account. The initial figure discussed was in the region of\n\u00a390,000. The chairman of SRC, Don Monro and I discussed messenger\nand security personnel with the Chief Security Officer and eventually\nproposals were put before John Smith that resulted in the service being\ncosted at approximately \u00a340,000. It remains to be seen whether or not\nthe proposed service will function adequately, although both Don\nMonro and I believe that students must take an active role in\ncontributing to the efficiency of any security service. Personally, I also\nbelieve that, apart from a notable few, security guards employed by the\nCollege are totally uninterested in their responsibilities and actively\ncontribute towards the failings in our security service rather than\nattempt to improve them.\nThe appointment of the Managing Surveyor (Residences), Peter\nHallworth, initiated several discussions. Peter is on second ment from\nthe Estates section and his primary responsibilities will be the upkeep,\nrefurbishment and management of College residences. In recent\nyears Wardens have found it almost impossible to get prompt action on\nmany occasions where work has been requested. I hope this\nappointment will improve the situation.\nControversy has also predominated this year over the occupancy of\nthe Southside penthouse flats. I am disappointed to report that,\nalthough the reasoning has been continually questioned, it appears that\nthe Southside flats will in future be occupied by academics. On a similar but more satisfactory note, the Rector has agreed that the Linstead flats\npresently occupied by academics, will be put at the disposal of the\nStudents Residence Committee as soon as possible, for use as student\naccommodation.\nOne of the issues, on SRC actively taken up by the student\nrepresentatives this year was the loss of Gerrard Mansions. As this\naccommodation is unfurnished it was felt that College had acted\nunfairly in failing to inform students taking up the accommodation atthe\nbeginning of the session that the loss of the accommodation at the end\nof this session would happen, thus making re app lica it on impossible and\nthe financial outlay on furnishings heavy. I am pleased to report that the\ndecision was taken to renegotiate the lease for a further 12 month period\nwhich was satisfactory to all concerned.\nIt has been a great concern of the SRC this year that the loss of a large\nnumber of residence places will occur at the end of the 1984/5 session. A great deal of work has been done by Michael Arthur, Don Monro and\nJohn Smith in searching for suitable new accommodation. Although we\nhave viewed several properties this year, none have proved to be\n\n"

    "content": "Futures\nA Computer Called\nALICE stands for Applicative\nLanguage Idealised Computer\nEngine. Although it sounds\ndifficult, what is on the way is a completely new type of computer\nwhich combines revolutionary\ndesign with amazing simplicity.\nThe Japanese have nicknamed\nthe technology 'fifth generation'\nbut ALICE is all British.\nThe ALICE team are based in\nthe Department of Computing\nand are led by Dr John\nDarlington.\nIn order to understand how\nALICE works, it is necessary to\nhave a quick look at the\ncomputers we are more familiar\nwith.\nFrom the first computer made\nfrom valves, from the smallest\nZX80, to the ultra-fast Cray,\nalmost all computers have a 'serial' architecture. This means\nthat the computer, no matter how\nfast, does only one thing at a time. This is reflected in the\nstructure of the languages\nused\u2014machine code, Basic,\nFortran, Pascal and Algol 68 all\ndo just one thing at a time\" (with\nvarying degrees of efficiency).\nFundamental physics governs\nhow fast computers can operate,\nand although commercial\ncomputers have not yet reached\nthose limits, it is becoming ever\nmore difficult and expensive to\ngain increases in speed. While it\nmay seem to many that\ncomputers work fast enough as it\nis, there are many problems\nwhich actually take computers\nmany hours to solve.\nSome such problems have a very regular structure that can be\nexploited, for instance modelling\nthe behaviour of all the molecules\nin a crystal, or predicting air\npressure and temperature at\npoints on a grid map. For these\npurposes the Distributed Array\nProcessor or DAP was born. This\nconsists of any array of many\n(usually 4096) small computers,\nwhich are serial, but work\nsimultaneously, like an army. To\nfully exploit these, DAP variants\nof familiar languages such as\nFortran and Pascal were\ndeveloped allowing single\ncommands to work on arrays.\nDAP programming has become\nhighly fashionable in some fields,\nbut not all problems can be\nconveniently fitted to the DAP. What is really required is a computer which can divide any\ntask into a lot of simple steps and\nperform each of these steps\nsimultaneously.\nPage 4 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe ALICE team: Victor Wu, Sandra Evans, Ian Moor, John Darlington,\nTony Field, Mike Reeve, Martin Cripps and Roger Bailey.\nImperial College is a centre of excellence for\nscientific research, yet not many people hear about\nthe pioneering work being carried out here. This\narticle will be the first in a series of articles on\ninteresting scientific work being carried out at\nImperial. This week we kick off with the work being\ncarried out in the Department of Computing on fifth\ngeneration computers.\nTo achieve this goal, both a new architecture and a new type\nof language were necessary.\nResearch on the so-called\nDeclarative Languages has been\ngoing on for about ten years, and\nhas now split into two fields\u2014the\nlogic languages and the\nfunctional or App li cat ive languages. Basically, the\ndifference is that rather than tell\nthe computer exactly what to do\nat each stage, these languages\nprovide either a set of logical\nconditions (Prolog) or functions\n( Hope) and some initial conditions and then the\ncomputer works out how to slot\nthem together to give the\nrequired result. Prolog, Hope\nand similar languages work\nabout ten times slower than\nconventional languages on\nconventional machines.\nALICE will use the functional\nlanguage Hope, and this should\nwork ten times faster than a high-level language on an equivalent\nserial computer. Any other\nlanguage will be able to be\nimplemented on ALICE, but the\nadvantages will be lost.\nIn functional languages, a data\nstructure called a 'packet'is used.\nThe packet has three parts: the\nfirst is a reference which tells the'\ncomputer where to put the result\nonce it is calculated, the second is\na function like 'square' or 'add\ntwo numbers' and the third is an\nargument, which is of the right\ntype (one number or two in this\nexample) and may be a reference\nto another packet. Packets can\nonly be processed when their\narguments have been reduced to\nthe appropriate form.\nThe hardware consists of three\nsections: the 'pool' where all the\npackets are stored, the 'agents'\nwhich delve into the pool, fish out\npackets, process and return them,\nand the 'telephone exchange'\nwhich allows the agents to\ncommunicate with the pool.\nThe telephone exchange chip\nhas been custom-designed and\nbuilt to allow the fastest possible\nswitching speeds (tens of\nnanoseconds). The agents have\nbeen designed to use the\ntrans put er chip, a British\ninvention which seems to fit the\nbill exactly. However, it is\neventually hoped to have a VLSI\ndesign (ie everything on a very\nfew large chips). At present,\nALICE has not yet been built,\nbut its operation has been\nsuccessfully modeled on a conventional computer.\nThe design allows any number\nof agents to be used, however, as\nthey work in parallel, the more\nagents, the faster ALICE will\nwork. A computer with two\nagents will work 1.6 times as fast\nas one agent. As the number of\nagents becomes larger, the\nincrease in speed from each drops\nto about 0.3, but adding more\nagents can never make the\nmachine slower.\nThe first ALICE will be no\nbigger than a small fridge.\nEventually, ALICE'S of all sizes\nwill be available: small enough\nfor the desktop, large enough for\nthe biggest problem. ALICE is a completely general purpose\ncomputer which will excel at any\ntask. It is also a very flexible\ndesign, as to double the capacity\nand increase speed you will just\nneed to buy another ALICE and\n'bolt it on' to the one you already\nhave.\nALICE\nARCHITECTURE\nI Friday, May 18, 1984\n'agents'-two trans put ers each\nthe custom-made\n'telephone exchange' chip\nallows communication\nbetween agents and pool\nthe 'pool' is composed of\nsmall sections of memory\nwhich are connected to the\nexchange via trans put ers \u2022 ^ \u2022 Hi FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "EXEC NEWS SPECIAL\nANNUAL REPORTS PRESIDENT'S REPORT\nINTRODUCTION\nAs the President has overall responsibility for the running of IC Union\nthe annual report of the person holding this office is usually an\nassessment of the many and varied aspects of IC Union, as well as a report on issues which have been the direct responsibility of the\nPresident.\nThis year is the first in three years that the Union has not lost one or\nmore of its sabbatical officers. I believe that the Union has functioned\nmore effectively than in recent years due to team work of the\nsabbaticals. A friendly, working atmosphere in the Union Office\ngenerates a smoother more efficient Union and hopefully produces\nmore results.\nOne of the major disruptions in the Union Office this year came with\nthe loss of Jo, our receptionist, in early April. Jo left us to return to her\noriginal vocation, graphic design, and is thoroughly enjoying her new\njob. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for all she has done\nfor IC Union and wish her the best of luck with her new job and in the\nfuture.\nThe loss of a receptionist put more pressure on Jen, Pat and the\nsabbaticals due to the increased workload. As ever both the staff and\nstudents coped amazingly with the extra work, and I am extremely\ngrateful to all the Union officers, especially Jo, Hugh and Ian, who\n'stepped in' and helped when the office was under strain. There is no\ndoubt that the Union would have suffered without the extra support of\nthese people.\nUNION GENERAL MEETINGS\nUnion General Meetings have usually been quo rate this year. I feel this is\ndirectly related to the discussion of issues that are relevant to the\nstudent body within IC. Although issues such as student grants, the\nInner London Education Authority, and human rights have been\ndiscussed, there is no doubt that the majority of people attending UGMs\nwere more interested in the 'Freedom of Choice' and NUS motions.\nHowever the importance of the UGM as a body to which the sabbatical\nofficers are ultimately responsible should never be lost. I have been\ndisappointed and angered this year by certain individuals, who because\na decision has not 'gone their way', have called quorum either at the\nbeginning of the meeting, or at a point during the discussion when it is\nobvious that their feelings are not in the majority. Personally, I feel that\nthese people who advocated democracy and responsibility, do not live\nup to their own expectations and certainly do not live up to mine. When\nsuch incidents have occurred it was pleasing to see so many people\nremaining to ask one or two questions.\nCOUNCIL\nThis year, although this committee has been fairly active I have felt that it\nwas unable to discern between matters of immense importance to the\nUnion and minute a. Issues such as the takeover of the Union refectory\nraised little discussion, whereas minor changes to student\nrepresentation on College committees appeared to be extremely\ncontroversial. However, the attendance at Council this year has been\nextremely encouraging with no meeting failing to be quo rate. The Executive\nThe Executive met this year only when relevant issues needed to be\ndiscussed or after a certain time lapse. There is certain feeling amongst\nsome Union officers that the Executive this year has not fulfilled its\nfunction, but although the Executive has not functioned as well as I might have liked this year, I do not feel that their opinions are fully \"\njustified. I believe the Executive committee is essentially an information\ncommittee, which takes decisions on everyday matters but makes policy\nonly when the time scale involved prohibits the issue being discussed\nbeforehand by Council. This year the executive has had to make\ndisciplinary decisions, some of which were overturned by various\nappeals. Dealing with the disciplinary actions made me realise that the\nUnion disciplinary procedure needed updating. I presented the updated\nversion at Council which was approved; I would ask this UGM to\napprove this updated version, with the inclusion of the\nrecommendations of the last appeals committee.\nCONSTITUENT COLLEGE UNIONS\nThe Constituent College Unions have in general functioned well this\nsession, and have been active in many different ways. Certain events\nfielded have caused controversy within the Union and its members,\nresulting in many motions being tabled at IC Union General Meeting,\nwith some decisions being overturned from one meeting to the next.\nI was disappointed by the attitude taken by some of the Constituent\nCollege Union newspapers during the IC Union sabbatical elections,\n. which contributed towards the decision of the elections committee to\ndisqualify one of the Presidential candidates. Whilst I am aware of CCU\nautonomy, I would recommend that if in future aCC U newspaper\ndirectly contravenes ICU ele c it on rules then that paper should cease to\nbe funded through IC Union sub vent ion. MAJOR SUB COMMITTEES\nAs usual the major sub-committees have worked well and been very\nactive. The regular meet in s serve as a useful forum for information to the\nsabbatical officers. It was my loss that I was unable to attend as many as I would have liked.\nAthletics Clubs Committee\nAt the beginning of the 1983/4 session IC Union affiliated to the\nUniversities Athletics Union, in order that sportsmen and women would\nbe given the opportunity to compete on a national level. The results\nspeak for themselves, with IC winning the national finals in volleyball\nand water polo, being runners-up in a6 a side cricket, winning regional\ncompetitions in many sports as well as individuals from IC being chosen\nto play for the UAU team, in some sports. With full representation in all\nsports next year, this can only improve.\nI am extremely grateful to College and John Smith in particular for\nproviding special grants so that the sporting facilities at IC could be\nimproved. This included the installation of shower facilities in the\nvolleyball court and the initiation of a loose weights facility in Southside.\nSportswomen at IC have also received recognition this year, with\nLadies Rugby making their debut TV performance in a large bubble bath\nat Harlington.\nOverseas Students Committee\nOSC suffered many problems at the beginning of the year with the\nelection of its officers and attendance at meetings being low. However\nwith the appointment of a new chairman the situation is quickly\nimproving. A new society was formed this year, the Nigerian Society\nwho have been exceptionally active since their formation.\nPublications Board\nControversy reigned early in the Union publications this year, with the\nExecutive censoring certain articles in the IC Union Handbook. It was\nfelt that some articles reflected too much of the Editors own views rather\nthan providing general information about IC Union.\nThe Rag Mag also caused controversy, with a delegation of women\ncoming to see me to voice thier complaints. Nothing came of this\nincident, as the Executive were satisfied with the contents of the Rag\nMag.\nAgain the annual publications of the Phoenix and the Alternative\nProspectus were produced, the quality of both being high.\nFELIX, the newspaper of Imperial College Union, exhibited a certain\nstyle this year that caused major discussions both on Council and in\nCollege. The style and personal comments in many articles caused\nCollege to produce an alternative magazine, Fido, expressing views that\nhad not been published in FELIX, as well as different types of articles.\nAfter the publication of Fido, Council made known its views on FELIX,\nwhich I hope were noted by Pallab. From my own viewpoint, I was\ndisappointed that I had to continually correct inaccuracies that had\nbeen reported in FELIX. My only other comment on FELIX this year is\nthat my personal opinion of the Editor is not very high!\nRecreational Clubs Committee\nThe activity of many RCC clubs appear to have increased this year, with\nmany achieving national notoriety, including hang-gliding and chess. A new innovation in RCC this year was the introduction of first aid courses\nfor the safety officers in the 'hazardous clubs'.\nSocial, Cultural and Amusements Board\nAs usual the societies in SCAB have excelled themselves, in their\nvarious productions and debates, lol an the, Gallileo, the choir\nproductions and Debsoc's debates being well supported by both\nstudents and staff.\nSocial Clubs Committee\nWith the increased activity of a number of the clubs, the notoriety of\npeople invited to speak at many of the clubs meetings has also\nincreased. In many other colleges the reaction to controversial speakers\nhas been violent activity would occur at IC, clubs have had to ensure\nadequate security whenever speakers have been invited.\nUNION COMMITTEES\nAcademic Affairs\nThis year academic affairs have had a lower profile than last year,\nhowever I believe many departmental representatives have worked well\nwithin their departments.\nExternal Affairs\nPeter Burt, EAO, has put a tremendous effort into his post this year,\nguiding the committee into an active? involvement in campaigns against\n\n"

    "content": "HARLINGTON GRAVEL\nLast year a paper was presented at Governing Body outlining the\nUnion's recommendations for the use of monies obtained from a gravel\nextraction project at Harlington. I have discussed this issue with Dr John\nStocks, the Union advisor on extraction, however as the project is long\nterm, little has developed this year. Test bore holes were driven over the Easter vacation the results of which are expected to be available in the\nsummer. Tenders will then be invited for the contract around\nAugust/September. The successful contractor will then have to obtain\nplanning permission which may take up to five years. The exploration is\nestimated to take a minimum of ten years after that.\nUGC RESPONSE\nIC Union was asked to reply to the UGC '28' questions on 'A Strategy for\nHigher Education in the 1990s' by College, in order that the Union's viewpoint could be incorporated into the official College response to the\ndocument. The Union' did compile a response, however, I felt that\nalthough we expressed our views on many of the questions, we\ndisagreed with the fundamental assumptions on which the questions\nwere based, and found it difficult to relate IC Union's activities to any\nfuture strategy. Under no circumstance were we willing.to commit IC\nUnion to a decrease in future funding. My than xs to Peter Burt for his\nexceptionally active involvement in the Union's response to the UGC\nquestionnaire, and the organisation of an open meeting to discuss the\nCollege's response.\nTELEPHONES\nDuring the initial months of my sabbatical I regarded telephones as\nhighly frustrating due to the slow progress that was made on repairs etc.\nHowever this improved 100% during the autumn term, and I must thank\nMr Burridge for the prompt service we have received in recent months. I am also grateful to him for his advice and cooperation in establishing the\nUnion's requirements within the new electronic telephone system due to\nbe operational next September. I wish him the best of luck with the new\nsystem, I have a feeling he might need it.\nSPORTS SHOP/LONDON STUDENT TRAVEL\nOne of the early decisions taken by the Union was in asking LST to\nvacate their premises on the walkway. This arose through the\nrequirement of the site for a sports and regalia shop and the absence of\nany income from LST. The sports shop is functioning well and I am\nindebted to Roy Hicks, the Bookshop Manager and Chris, for the\namount of work they have put in to make the shop a success.\nSTUDENT TRAVEL AUSTRALIA\nWith the loss of LST in September, we had a vested interest in reintroducing a travel centre into IC. STA are now installed in the JCR and\nI believe are providing a more satisfactory service to both students and\nstaff. Best of luck to all the staff in the IC office.\nCOLLEGE DINNERS\nWe were asked what would improve student attendance at College\nDinners. We suggested they be held on a Friday evening, have a bar\nextension and a disco or jazz band. The most recent of these events,\nalthough did not have a bar extension, was held on a Thursday and was a buffet format. However I believe it was enjoyed by all, and suggest that\nthe autumn term would be the more suitable time for such an event.\nAlthough I believe the dinners are value for money, I feel that the\ndifference in price between staff and student tickets is far too small.\nSOUTHSIDE\nThe myth of the Southside move, remained inconclusive during my year\nof office. I do not believe there is any possibility of the Union ever\nmoving to Southside. I have always viewed the project as an expansion .\nto Union facilities rather than as a replacement site.\nHowever progress this year has been slower than at a snails pace. I came into office expecting the central la und re tte and gym facilities to be\ncomplete by mid September. As I reported in one of my UGM reports 'as\naccustomed as I am to the incompetence and total ineptness of the\nEstates section, even I find it hard to believe that for a project originally\nintended to begin in Easter 1983, they could have mismanaged the\nproject so effectively as to be months behind the fourth schedule'. I now\nbelieve the central la und re tte is complete apart from a number of\nsecurity problems, however rumour at the moment indicates that two of\nthe washing machines may have been stolen, before the la und re tte is\neven open. The gym area is also complete, but whether the lighting in\nthe area is a de qua e for sports use is debatable. Security in Southside\nhas been discussed in every Presidents report for the last n years!\nAlthough things are actually moving at last the delays have been\nendless\u2014with the Estates section delaying work until the GLC ap-proved, I can only say that the Estates delay factor was prom in ant yet\nagain! The latest security proposals include a double door system with\nthe outer being on an ASSA key system, the inner on a key card system.\nThis will mean that the inner doors will be locked on a24 hour basis.\nNaturally there has been a delay in the installation of the doors and\nuncertainty after a final decision had been made as to whether or not the\nkey card system was suitably secure for student use.\nMentioning the fire alarm system in Southside makes me shudder\u2014I cannot believe the failure of this system. After handing over the contract,\nat the end! of the proposed schedule (only 3 months behind the original\ndeadline), the fire alarm has continually set itself off for no apparent\nreason on average of once daily. My only comment is that the Estates\nsection appear to get more and more incompetent as the weeks go by. I can only hope for an improvement in the future\u2014it surely can't get any\nworse.\nThe only successful venture in Southside this year has been the\nWeights Facility\u2014in which the Union played an active role\u2014after\ncontinual delay by College. My thanks to John Smith for the funding of\nthis facility.\nAT LAST\u2014THE END\nAs usual my thanks must go to all those people who have helped me this\nyear, especially to leu an Thomas, Peter Mee and John Smith in College\nadministration\u2014they are a pleasure to work with.\nTo attempt to thank Jen, Jo and Pat in the Union Office would be an\ninsult\u2014I can never express how much we are indebted to them for their\nhelp and support at all times this year. I hope we are able to find as good\na replacement for Jo, and warn future Presidents to dread the day when\nJen has to leave the office.\nI have enjoyed working and nearly all the Union offices this year and\nam grateful to a special few for all their help and advice. Sean, the token\nman in the office this year, has added spice and originality to the\noffice\u2014the quote 'There's never a dull moment' is so applicable when\nSean's around. Chris, in her sabbatical term as Deputy President has\nexcelled all expectations\u2014her work on bars and refectories has been\namazing. My thanks for her support and friendship throughout the year.\nIt only remains for me to wish Ian the best of luck next year\u2014and hope\nthat he, Dave and Eric enjoy their year of office as much as Ih ave.\nGaynor Lewis\nICU President 1983/4\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT\nIntroduction\nIt has been an interesting exercise concentrating into one report the\nefforts and anxieties of a year's work as sabbatical Deputy President.\nThose who read it may consider it long and over detailed yet whole days\nor weeks of thought, discussion and action on several topics have each\nhad to be compressed into single sentences. I have tried to concentrate\non information that will be useful next year and on subjects about which\nI have felt deeply, I hope that this report conveys an impression and\nflavour of the Deputy President's job to those interested.\nFINANCE.\nThis is one of the single largest and most time consuming\nresponsibilities of the Deputy President involving as it does the\nchairmanship of Union Finance Committee as well as responsibility for\nthe budget and estimates of the Union.\nUnion Finance Committee\nThe biggest problem this year was the high commitment to equipment\nexpenditure on the five year plan scheme which left little un allocated equipment fund for unforeseen expenditure. Policy has now been\nadopted to prevent this by limiting the five year plan committed\nexpenditure to about three quarters of the equipment fund. Major\npurchases from the fund this year have been boats, a hang glider, as no oke it able, a phototypesetter etc. There is still a lot of confusion and\nmis comprehension about how the 5 year plan system works and I urge\nofficers to check policy so that their clubs are not caught out next year.\nBudget 83/84\nOn the whole spending has matched the estimates drawn up last year,\ntwo factors have cushioned what could have been a very tight year,\nthese are an increase in Conference bookings income and a saving in\nsalaries due to the delay in replacing the Union receptionist\nEstimates 84/85\nIt is premature to make much comment on these as at the time of writing the final figure has yet to be confirmed. The single largest change in\nexpenditure is due to our affiliation to the Universities Athletic Union\nallowing us to play sport nat in ally \u2014this tips the balance even further to\nclub expenditure which is a most laudable change. On the income side\nwe have over the past couple of years increased non-sub vent ion income\nsignificantly through increases in Conference and Union bookings\nincome and through further commercial ventures, the STA office being\nthe most recent. This has enabled us to increase our activity faster than\nthe increase in College sub vent ion but it is difficult to envisage how we\nwill be able to sustain this increase in 'privatised' income making the\nestimates progressively more difficult in the coming years.\nCompiling the estimates gives a DP a good insight into the workings of\nsections of the Union. On the whole offices were most helpful with the\npreparation of estimates and I found it a difficult task imposing cuts but I was pleased to be able to avoid the ugly Major Sub Committee CCU\nrows of last year.\nAccounts and Audit\nThis year saw a change in the College accountant responsible for the\npreparation of Union accounts and provided an opportunity to try a change in style. Though not wholly successful I am sure that with a year's experience Ray Taverner will produce a set of accounts that are\nmore relevant to the activities of the Union at the end of this financial\nyear.\nI have also worked with the Internal Auditor on several aspects of the\nUnion accounts, particularly the revision of the 'Financial Procedures'\nbooklet, and on improving aspects of the accounting system.\nThe changes of responsibility within the Finance Section have lead to\na few awkward patches over the last year particularly with interpretation\nof the VAT regulations and it will make life much easier for Dave if a clear\nruling is given as to the responsibilities of the Finance Section.\n\n"

    "content": "ACC\nI am pleased to report that it is possible to be ACC Chairman for two\nconsecutive years, pass my exams and enjoy it! This has been important\nbecause of long term changes and improvements which require a certain amount of continuity; I am of course referring to UAU.\nAfter many years of indecision as to whether to affiliate or not, ACC\nand ICU decided to affiliate for 1983/4 session, but unfortunately were\nunable to enter all sports. However, ACC gave a very creditable account\nof itself by winning the national finals in Water Polo and Volleyball,\nrunners-up in 6 a side indoor cricket, quarter finals in Rugby 7 a side,\nand current success for 11 a side cricket. Individual and team\nperformances in other sports including basketball, squash and fencing\nhave likewise proven to be a headache for southern Universities who\nsurely could not have expected such high calibre sports teams from\nImperial.\nWe have set a danger ou sly high level of success in UAU which I hope\nwill be continued for many years. I hope that rugby, football and hockey\nlive up to the challenge, and I wish all clubs the best of luck next year.\nThe extra competitions have certainly given a new lease of life and\nrekindled interest to the clubs involved this year, and provided much\nmore scope for sports men and women at Imperial. 1\nOn campus facilities have also received a boost this year, with the new\nweights room, showers and changing facilities in the volleyball court\nand the (delayed) completion of a gym in Southside, all very kindly\nprovided by College and Mr John Smith.\nThe new weights room was dreamt up by Boat Club who, along with\nRugby Club, put a lot of hard work into its formation and setting up. It\nhas been extensively used by all sectors of the Union, and has been run\nvery efficiently with the kind cooperation of Cliff and his lads at the\nSports Centre. Furthermore, no increase in sports centre f changes for\nnext session will ease the financial burden for the sports enthusiasts..\nThe introduction of an exercise bike in the multi-gym was intended for\nthe ladies who found the multi gym not entirely fitting to their needs. It\nseems to have been well received and used extensively, though whether\nthe ladies have had chance to use it I'm not sure.\nAfter five years of use, the volleyball court has male and female\nshowers which will be greatly appreciated by its many users. Thanks\nmust go to the Queensgate Trust and Mr Smith for the provision of\nfunds. But oh for a generous benefactor to build a proper sports hall!!\nI had intended that the martial arts clubs and table tennis may enjoy\nnew facilities in Southside for at least half of the season, but Sims and\nRussell (Contractors), had other ideas. I apologise to those CIUDS w no may have been disappointed and look forward to the grand opening this\nsummer.\nOut at Harlington, the facilities seem to have been better than the\nperformance of some of our teams (sorry football 1st team). Mick and\nAnne Reynolds and the ground staff have continued to provide the\nexcellent service and support for IC students. Coupled with the new\nlower bar prices, I hope that Harlington users will continue to enjoy\nthemselves on and off the field.\nThe Harlington Gravel scene progressed slowly, with Dr John Stocks\nRCC\nClub News\nThis year has seen the formation of two new RCC clubs: Waterskiing and\nParachuting and Parascending both of which are now running\nprogrammes of regular activities. The large number of first and second\nyears involved in the formation and running of these clubs augur es well\nfor their continuation as active members of RCC in the years to come.\nOn a less cheerful note, three clubs were wound up by RCC; these\nbeing Art Club (their lighting equipment being passed to SCAB),\nAngling Club again (their fridge passing to Photosoc) and Railway\n(whose 3\" gu age live steam loci 'Dymphna' is currently being recovered\nfrom a past member, possibly for use at Rag events).\nClub Activjties\nAll RCC clubs have been active this year (membership being overall well\nup on last year) although the independance displayed by one or two to\nthem has given cause for concern.\nSome clubs have been designated 'Hazardous' by the RCC Executive\nand they have all submitted safety policy'documents to RCC and to\nCollege. It is to be hoped that these documents, essentially laying out a safety framework for running trips, will finally lay the spectre of\nMountaineering Club's Christmas 81 tour climbing accident to rest. The\nhazardous recreational clubs were all offered the chance to send a number of members on a British Red Cross First Aid Course paid for by\nRCC. As a result RCC now has some 25 extra qualified first aide rs.I hope\nthat the same scheme can be worked next year. Thanks to those who\ntook part and especially to Roger Serpell for running the course.\nTours so far have featured YHA, Caving, Gliding and Balloon and\nacting as Union adviser on the committee. Trial bores were carried out\nduring Easter which will be used for inviting bids for extraction. The\npromised millions of pounds are still many years away but my successor\nmust keep on top of the developments.\nAnother year of indifferent, expensive service by Capital Coaches to\nHarlington may at last have some competition. There is a possibility of\ncontracting a new. cheaper, punctual, reliable coach operator for next\nyear, and now that RCC have very kindly agreed to let some other clubs\nin the Union occasionally use the Union vans (especially the new 17\nseater i. it is hoped that the inconvenience of having to travel long\ndistances to compete may be re due ced. It has not been a year entirely without low points. It is with great\nsadness that I must report on two tragedies during this year. Chrisopher\nDarkes accidental y drowned in the Sports Centre despite the valiant\nefforts of the sports staff, and a student from UC committed suicide in\nthe Rifle Range Security and safety procedures were reviewed in the\nlight of both of these, but it still remains a mystery how Christopher\ndrowned.\nWithin ACC. two items topped the discussions during the year,\nathletic colours and tour grants. The Exec felt that the whole procedure\nand criteria for awarding colours needed serious reconsideration,\nespecially to prevent devaluation and worthlessness of such awards.\nThe new guidelines seemed to have worked reasonably well and awards\nthis year probably reflect activity and ability much more so than in\nprevious years. It is a pity that ICU Colours Committee doesn't want or\nsee the need for a similar review or common sense approach!\nTour grants necessitated an EGM as the gap between available funds\nand this year's 'holiday fantasies' disguised as tours widened further. It\nseems perfectly clear that distance will have to be penal is ed in future; it\nis true that it is entirely illogical to fund a team tour to Gloucester at the\nsame level as a tour to Europe, or anywhere else overseas. Next year's Exec will have to sort this problem out early in the new session to avoid a repetition of this years ill feeling.\nI would like to take this opportunity of commenting on a point raised at\nthe same meeting \" ACC and the Union exist to tu no the elite, to t ne detriment of the rest of the Union\". I can sum my feelings up in one word\nBOLLOCKS! We don't have sufficient funds to carry out all that we\nwould like to do at present. How can anyone sensibly expect preferential\ntreatment because they consider themselves to be better than everyone\nelse? I suggest that they sacrifice a good education and turn\nprofessional if they are that good, and leave ACC and the Union to put\non as many sports and facilities to benefit as many students as possible.\nFinally, the success of ACC is a function of the level of input, interest\nand commitment from club captains and the Exec. I would like to thank\nthe ACC Exec: John (especially for lively and interesting sports pages in\nFELIX), Steve, John, Tim. Gabbv, Graham and Pete, Dr Dave Chadwick\nfor his continued support and patience as Treasurer and Jen, Pat and\nJo in the Union Office. There are hundreds more who should also be\nthanked here and I apologise for not mentioning their names.\nIan Bull\nACC Chairman\ndetails of summer activities are awaited. It is however known that\nMountaineering are planning an expedition to Equador and that Caving\nhope to be going to Peru.\nFinancial\nThe money so far has held out well, but with the pressure on funds from\nsupplementary claims brought on by an overall increased level of\nmembership (especially where outdoor activities are concerned since\nthese require travel subsidy) it looks as though the subsidy on summer\ntours may have to be below.\nThe use of Five Year Plans has been high this year with Billiards and\nSnooker purchasing a fourth table and Hang Gliding procuring a secondhand hang glider and a very competitively priced micro light engine. In addition Canoe Club have continued to build up their fleet of\nplastic kayaks\u2014these being stronger than fibre-glass and consequently\nhaving a much longer life.\nTwo new Five Year Plans have been submitted; one from Photosoc\nwho do desperately need an injection of cash and equipment and the\nother from Waterskiing who, realising the potential cost of their sport\nboth to themselves and to RCC (through subsidy), are seeking to\npurchase much of the facilities and equipment they would otherwise\nhave to hire.\nTransport\nThis year has seen the demise of the old Transport Committee, which\ntook over the running of the Union vans from RCC in early 1980, and the\nquashing of the Priority User System which gave certain RCC clubs\nwhat some people would claim was an unfair precedence when it came\nto booking out the Unions vans.\n\n"

The report states that the\nCollege has so far managed to\ncope with spending cuts,\nalthough with 'no little inconvenience to staff and students',\nand finished the year 'still on\ncourse', being able to make small\nadvances in 'selected areas of\ndevelopment'.\nIC and the Cuts\nIn the present situation with\ncontinued education cuts the\nstate of the College finances is of\nparticular interest.

    "content": "f ter tur.A DREAM OF FLYING\nImperial College Gliding Club\n- was the first university gliding\nclub in Britain and is 54 years old\nthis year. It is affiliated to the\nLa sham gliding club in Hampshire, which is one of the\nlargest gliding centres in Europe.\nTo go up in a glider has always\nbeen an ambition of mine, so\nwhen Dave Keene, captain of the\ngliding club offered me the\nopportunity to spend a weekend\nwith the club I jumped at the\nchance.\nThe usual procedure is for club\nmembers to either make their\nown way down to Lasham, or to\nget lifts from other club\nmembers. Lasham's facilities are\navailable all year round, every\nday of the week to IC club\nmembers. However, most\npeople just go down for the\nweekend. Any number between\nfive to fifteen students spend a weekend at Lasham, it depends\non the time of year.\nIn the bad old days members\nhad to make do with the Lasham\nclub's bunkhouses for accommodation which used to\nbe so grim that even the rats\nmoved out. Dave told me that no\nmatter what the weather or time\nof the year the overnight\ntemperature of the bunkhouses\nwas always the same\u2014bloody\ncold! Since then the club has\npurchased an old scout hut\nwhich accommodates 14 people.\nIt has all the mod cons: a kitchen,\ntoilet, hot and cold water and,\nmost important, a para fin heater.\nOn arriving at the scout hut on\nFriday I discovered that the old\n. hands had bagged the bunks\nclosest to the heater. It wouldn't have been so bad had I bought an\nultra expensive, thermally\ninsulted sleeping bag like\neveryone else had. Foolishly I bought along a sleeping bag I found in the FELIX Office. Whilst\nit served a useful purpose\naccommodating former Editors\novernight in the FELIX Office, it\nwas definitely not the thing for a scout hut in the middle of the\nexposed Hampshire country-side. I shivered consoling myself\nwith the thought that it would be\nwarmer in the morning\u2014I was\nwrong.\nI awoke to a bleak February\nmorning. An icy cold wind swept\nacross the snow covered airfield.\nI emerged from my sleeping bag\nwith trepidation about the forth\nFELIX\nWhilst most people are content just to dream of soaring like a bird\nacross the skies, members of Imperial College's Gliding Club actually,\ndo so, every weekend. Pallab Ghosh reports on a day spent with the\nclub.\nThe Club's high performance ASW19 waiting to\ncoming day. After a hearty\nbreakfast of hot baked beans and\ntea at the clubhouse we put our\nnames into the ballot. The order\nin which names are drawn out\ndecides the order of flights. Next\nwe had to push out all the gliders\nthat were going to be used that\nday from the airfield's main\nhanger. Although it is possible to\nhire Lasham's gliders for flights\nmost enthusiasts group together\nand buy their own glider. The\nclub have three single seat\ngliders, a K8 for early solo flying,\na Club Libelle for intermediate\nand cross-country flying and a high performance ASW19 for\ncross-country and competitions.\nWhile waiting for your turn for\nyour flight you are expected to\npush other peoples' gliders into\nplace for take off. The enthusiasts are very much a community and the emphasis is\non cooperation and working for\neach other.\nSoon it was my tum to go up. I was just to be a passenger with\nan instructor at the controls\nbehind me. I was strapped in the\nchecks were made and we were\nready to go. There are two ways\nfor a glider to be put up into the\nair. It can be towed up like a kite\nby a purpose built tow truck or\nby a light aeroplane. Aerotows\nare more expensive but do take\nyou higher and you get more time\nin the air. Because of the\nconditions that day aero tows were out.\nI saw the tow truck in the\ndistance move off. The tow rope\nslithered quickly like a snake\nalong the ground as the slack was\ntaken up\". The glider jolted\nforward and within a few seconds\nthe ground fell away from under\nus. The glider slowly climbed to a height of about 1,500 feet. You\ncould see nothing but white sky\nand hear only the roar of the\nwind.\nSuddenly the tow rope was\nreleased and momentarily we\nsank, my heart was in my mouth.\nPanic and exhilaration filled me. I was flying on the edge of the\nelements away from the frenzy of\nlife on the ground. It was like\nflying in a dream, gliding\neffortlessly over the ground, and\nfeeling totally free.\nOnce up the glider sinks back\nto earth at about 200ft/ min. My\npilot was searching for lift to keep\nus up. The search and util is ation of lift is the basis of gliding. A I Friday, May 18, 19841\nbe launched\ngood thermal can send a glider\n' up 600ft a minute.\nI, like most people who go up in\na glider for the first time, was\ni hooked. For students who have\n;time and money the next stage is\n!to fly solo. Before being allowed\nto fly solo a pupil has to undergo\na certain amount of training in a two seater glider with a qualified\ninstructor. There is no minimum\nnumber of hours to be flown,\npupils are sent solo when their\ninstructor is satisfied they are\nsafe and competent, usually this\ntakes between 40 and 60 flights.\nThe club receives a generous\nsubsidy from the Union which\nreduces costs to about \u00a33 per\ntraining flight.\nOnce solo you have just\nbegun. The next stage is to pass\nanother series of tests to be able\nto cross country. To be able to\nspend several hours gliding in the\nair. This is really what gliding is all\nabout.\nAnyone interested in be\ntaken up for a flight with a vi\nto joining or taking part in t club's summer activities sh\nsee Dave Keene via Chem Eng\nUG letter-racks or through t Union Office\nHH H HUI Page 7\n\n"
