    "content": "FELIX SCIENCE10' Cannabis: A scientist's view\nCannabis usage\nThe pros\n- Alcohol and tobacco are more addictive.\n- It can help make various medical conditions\nmore bearable to live with, for example can-cer, HIV, MS, glaucoma.\n- Cannabis appears to be good for the heart.\nThe cannabis plant\nThe cons\n- Cannabis is psychologically addictive.\n- Users can show aggressive behaviour when\nin withdrawal.\n- Cannabis use could lead to 'harder' drugs.\n- It has a higher tar content than tobacco and\nso has a higher risk of lung cancer.\n- Users can have trouble controlling blood\npressure and so are prone to fainting.\nA scientific history\nThe cannabis drug is from the plant Cannabis\nIndica, probably first found in India and related to nettles. It has been grown for 'medicinal\nand recreational' purposes for thousands of\nyears. Most of British cannabis resin ('black',\n'soap bar', 'hash') comes in from Morocco, with\nthe herbal cannabis ('grass', 'weed', 'skunk')\ncoming in mainly from Jamaica. There is an\nincreasing trend for 'homegrown' cannabis.\nMost cannabis is smoked, often along with\ntobacco, but it can be eaten, often with much\nstronger effects. These effects include\nincreased talkativeness, relaxation and heightened experiences of sound and colour.\nThe main psychoactive ingredient in\ncannabis is called THC, but this is only one of\nover 400 chemicals. THC interferes with brain\nfunctions by producing signals very similar to\nthat of the brain's neurotransmitters, but with\na random pattern. The effects last for about\nfour hours and there is no 'hangover' as such.\nSometimes the effects of a high cannabis\ndose can be unpleasant, producing hallucinations, panic, paranoia and nausea. Some users\nhave short-term memory loss because the\nparts of the brain controlling memory have\nbeen disrupted. Some research has suggested\nthat prolonged use can permanently affect the\nmemory and the ability to learn.\nCannabis smokers inhale far more tar than\ntobacco smokers and so there is an increased\nrisk of lung cancer.\nCurrently cannabis in its herbal and resin\nform is a class B drug carrying a penalty of up\nto five years in jail for possession. The Home\nSecretary, David Blunkett has, however,\nrecently suggested moving it down to class C, and experimental schemes have been introduced in some areas to relax police regulation\nof the drug\nMedicinal uses of\ncannabis\nIt seems likely that soon the British\nGovernment will introduce legislation to allow\nthe use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. It\nhas been shown to help reduce nausea associated with chemotherapy, help increase the\n'Skunk'\nappetite of AIDs sufferers, help relieve eye\npressure for people with glaucoma, and to help\nrelieve muscle pain.\nThe condition that cannabis has been associated the most with is Multiple Sclerosis. MS\nis incurable and sufferers have balance problems, muscle spasms, incontinence and\ntremors. A large number of sufferers have said\nthat cannabis helps ease these symptoms, particularly spasms, pain and bladder control. But\nmany are breaking the law while attempting to\nease their suffering.\nDoctors can prescribe Nabilone, containing\nTHC, but patients complain about 'getting\nstoned', because the pain relieving ingredients\nhave yet to be separated from the 'mind bend-ing' ones.\nFor more information see bbc.co.uk/science\nResearch proposal competition:\n\"Why I need 16 contact lens holders\"\nWinner - Wai-mei Chan\nIn response to angry farmers, grounds-men\nand gardeners, a research opportunity has arisen in the prevention/minim is ation of crop and\nflowerbed damage by moles. I propose to\nselect 16 moles to experiment (humanely)\nupon from a mole community. The aim will be\nto train them to apply their contact lenses once\nthey have surfaced and ascertain whether they\nhave disturbed a place of agricultural/horticultural significance or a designated mole habitat.\nIf they find that they have done the latter they\nwill know that they can dig more extensive burrows there, however if not, they will know to\nleave that site as delicately as possible, never\nto return, and pass the message onto other\nmoles.\nAs contact lenses will be easily scratched\nand damaged in the harsh conditions of a burrow under construction, it is necessary to have\nfunding for 16 contact lens holders, which can\nbe attached to the moles via utility belts. (The\nlenses being funded by the Moles' protection\nleague). Let me prove that people and moles\ncan live together in peace.\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "TP\nFELIX11 Atomic clocks\nWe'll meet in a moment... err... in 5,345669543 seconds\nThe current most accurate clock (NIST-F1 fountain clock) neither gains nor loses a second in\nnearly 20 million years. Rather accurate. To\nunderstand how this super clock reaches such\naccuracy let's first remind ourselves what a clock is. All clocks have two basic components:\nThe nist-1 clock\na constant process to mark the increments of\ntime and a means of keeping track of the increments. For example, your grandfather's pendulum clock increments time with the oscillation\nmechanism of the pendulum. Christian Huygens\n(a Dutch scientist) made the first one in 1656\nand its error was less than one minute a day.\nWhile Huygens' clock (or your grandfather's pendulum clock) is a mechanical clock, the\natomic clock is a quantum-mechanical clock. In\nother words, its working is based on quantum\nphysics (physics of the ultra small). Essentially,\nthe incremental component is given by the radiation frequency that causes the maximum transitions of the clock's atoms (NIST-F1 uses\nCaesium 133) to another state. In English?\nWell... According to quantum mechanics, subatomic particles can only exist in discrete states\nand not at in between states (electrons have two\nhyperfine states). Generally, an atom remains in\nits hyperfine state. But when prodded by electromagnetic radiation at a specific frequency, it\nwill switch to the other state. For Caesium the\nspecific radiation frequency is 9,192,631,770.\nOr in other words, when the radiation frequency\nis 9,192,631,770 a maximum number of\nCaesium atoms undergo a \"hyperfine state\"\ntransition. As frequency is expressed in [s1]( per second) it is obvious (...hopefully) that the\n9,192,631,770 beats define exactly 1 second.\nThe idea of using hyperfine states for a clock\nwas first proposed by U.S. physicist Isador Rabi\nin 1945.\nAfter this preamble, you can now understand\nthat an atomic clock: 1) filters atoms by selecting those in one hyperfine state, 2) radiates the\nselected atoms by microwaves, 3) measures\nhow many changed atoms there are (fluorescence detection), 4) tunes the microwave generator to the frequency that causes the maximum transitions. This optimal frequency (or\nnumber of oscillations) represents 1 second.\nSo now why do we need such accuracy?\nInnumerable communication and navigation\nsystems as well as synchronising systems\n(between computers,...) rely on it. One example is the GPS (Global Positioning Satellites)\nsystem. GPS determine the position of a receiver anywhere on Earth by timing the arrival signals from four GPS satellites and doing a quick\ncalculation to tria ngu late its position. Each\nClocks clocks clocks...\nnanosecond (billionth of a second) of error\ntranslates into a GPS error of one foot. Thus\neach of the 24 GPS satellites contains four\natomic clocks.\nMore information on clocks:\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/Genlnt/Time/time.html\nWant to check your computer's clock against\nthe official U.S. atomic clock?\nhttp://www.time.gov/\nFrangoise Mei\nResearch proposal competition cont.:\nRunner Up (sorry no prize but I thought I'd print it) - Edward Hunt\nInspired by the character \"Eyeball Paul\" from\nthe Kevin and Perry movie, I have devised an\nexperiment to establish whether drinking shots\nthrough your eyes really does get you drunk\nfaster than conventional consumption.\nFirst I will round up 32 sober imperial students (!) and lead them to my underground lab.\nEach will be thoroughly examined in mental\ncoordination using the classic book \"1001\nTricky Tongue-Twisters for Kids\". They will then\nin turn be given a small amount of alcohol (left-over un drinkable Tesco Value Vodka). Half will\nbe given ordinary shot glasses and half will be\ngiven contact lens cases full of vodka. These\ncases (which must be the double ended type)\nwill be ideal for delivering a swift alcohol shot\nto each eye. Each sucker will, after their shot,\nbe given a twenty minute exam in tongue-twister dexterity by my lovely assistants. It will\nbe noted, for each subject, how long after the\nshot it took for their mental abilities to drop.\nThe expected outcome of these tests will rev-ol uti on is e the drinks industry. I will release a new line of spirit packaging based on lens case\ndesign and become fabulously, fabulously rich.\nThe remaining profits will go to Imperial\nCollege, removing any need to merge with any-bugger, ever.

Ten years and 6 albums\nlater, they release a 'Best Of\ntitled Forever Delayed.\nThose who don't know the\nManic Street Preachers can buy\nthis album without hesitation as\nit contains almost all of their big\nhits. You will discover one of the\nbetter UK bands of the last ten\nyears. For hardcore fans, rush for\nthe limited edition version: there\nis an extra CD of some of the\ngreatest remixes of the band's hits by Chemical Brothers,\nAvalanches, Massive Attack,\nMogwai... which is reason\nenough to buy it. Moreover, you\nwill find songs from old albums\nthat you don't know. Forever\nDelayed also includes two brand\nnew tracks and three which have\nnever previously been available\non an album.\nThis compilation is worth looking at. All the songs are reasonably good. Put the CD in and\nleave it playing till the end. The\nManic Street Preachers have\nexplored many different styles of\nmusic, this album shows the way\nfrom debut to nowadays. In these\ntimes where 'Best Ofs' are fashionable,( Elvis Presley, Rolling\nStones) Manic Street Preachers\nrelease a decent one. Don't miss\nit - this will keep you occupied\nwhile waiting for their seventh\nalbum! Mike\nThe Lollies\nTaste\n4 / 5\nmiA ft\n\u2022 Ml \u2022 J IB r The Lollies - the name says it\nall. It's an innocuous moniker\ndesigned to lull the listener into\na false sense of security, as does\nthe sound itself - colourful keyboards and catchy hooks mask\nthe lyrics of singer Kate\nSt.Claire. Her words are always\ntongue, often cutting and at\ntimes simply brilliant.\nBut back to that name for a second. I 've not tuned in to the\nentertainment scene for a while,\nbut I'm pretty certain Steve\nLamacq has been raving about\nthis North American trio.\nThe Lollies (it's such a Lamacq band-name), are up\nthere with those other Evening\nSession favourites The Vandals.\nAs for the album itself - opening batsman Flavah Of the\nWeek has The Lollies taking\nseveral shots at the state of popular culture and the Dandy\nWarhols (or are they?), and has\nthe album's first great lyric:\n\"Indie c red? 'Ha! I'm just a ho!\nSell my wedding photos to\nHello!\".\nCall the Girls is an anthem for\nthe females out there who aspire\nto living like Daria; Office\nRomance is a cheeky tale in the\nvein of Princess Superstar (only\nless explicit, unfortunately).\nChannel Heaven is a decent\nBelle & Sebastian pastiche and\nJamestown Massacre is an\nattack on prom queen-culture\nwith Taste's second great lyric:\n\"Fernme Fatale all dressed in\nblack/Varnishcrack and\nmarathon sling backs/ Wear that\ndress like a ball and\nchain/Lipstick smeared like\nnovo caine\". The Lollies never stop trying\nto be amusing or ironic and this\nstops the album from being an\nexcellent debut. Sonically and\nlyrically, it borders on lightweight and silly too often. It will\nbe interesting to see if time will\nmature their sound and sharpen\ntheir wit. What is certain though\nis that The Lollies are part of a new wave of bands reinventing\nthe indie scene - The Strokes,\nThe Datsuns, the Yeah Yeah\nYeahs. The Lollies are as i rr ever ent, intelligent, hip and self-con-s cio us as they come.\nRobin Som\nSingles\nAthlete - Beautiful\nSimple, catchy songs with\ndecent vocals and in st rumen tal, and then ali sorts of\nstrange noises added on the top\nof it all. This is what you can\nexpect from this up and coming\nband. Athlete's new single is no\nexception and is one of their\nmore \"chilled\" offerings.\nPleasant chords and synth\nstrings await you with this one.\nThe lyrics are straightforward\ntoo - singer Joel Pott is describing something beautiful.\nThe overall effect is impressive and pretty close to beautiful in itself. The heavier instrumental towards the end is the\nonly extra thing this song needs\nto convince me that it deserves\nfull marks, and it does so con-vinci n gly.5/5 Robin\nThe Liars - Fins To Make Us\nMore Fish-Like\n\"Can you hear us? CAN YOU\nHEAR US?\", my stereo suddenly screams after what sounds\nlike a bunch of primary school\nkids banging saucepans on a washing-line. This shouldn't be\ngood but for some outlandishly\nobscure reason it is.\nThe Liars are the next band\nin the line of punk-meets-electronica but these New York lads\nmight just have that extra bit of\ninsanity to carry them through.\nWith their brilliantly named\nalbum already receiving critical\nacclaim and fantastic track\ntitles like Pillars Were Hollow\nAnd Filled With Candy, where\ncould they possibly go wrong?\nThis 3-track EP has been\npainted with punk stripes. A dedicated craze surges through\nevery lyric with screeching\nbacking vocals thrown in for\ngood measure. Fast beats and\nenergetic riffs will get you dancing before you realise it.\n4/5 Keira\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk I thought that blok e was a girl until this week\n\n"

Simon wasn't happy. But, since they\nare both very different, rather than choose one\nover the other, I decided to include both... Liz\nMAGIC Harry's world has been recreated with stunning\nvisual style, with superb special effects: Dobby\nthe house-elf equals anything Mr. Lucas has done\nrecently, cars swoop with verve and realism and\nthere are spiders that would induce severe\narachnophobia in the most passionate en tomo lo gist. It is directed with a grandeur that perfectly\nsuits the mood of the film, and the pace is fairly\nrelentless. Beware though, there are a number of\nsections that will make you squirm by their very\nchee sines s. Added to this, the kids' acting is still largely\nawful, even if things have improved since the first\nouting. Ron still does a Mr. Soft impersonation\nwhen he's frightened, Hermione still has the over-annunciation of a school presentation and Harry\nis rivalling his wand for sheer woodiness. The\nteachers have all settled into their roles nicely,\nwith the late Richard Harris bringing an understated humility to Dumbledore, but the star of the\nstaff room would have to be the OTT Gilderoy\nLockhart. Whether you love him or loathe him\nwill depend mainly on how much the sight of\nBranagh makes your fists itch.\nI could sit here nitpicking about any number of\nthings in the film, but overall it remains a very\nenjoyable way to spend an evening. The humour\nof the novels is cleverly captured and the story\nremains in-keeping with the book - well-structured and intriguing. It is a much darker affair\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk\nLook! What's that over there? An acting coach?\nthan the first film, with some pretty scary scenes\nfor hardened students, let alone quivering 8 year\nolds. But go on, get in touch with your inner wizard - it's certainly a lot cheaper than the mer-chandi sing. Ben\nTORTURE The second installment of the Harry Potter series\nwas always going to be a sure money earner.\nUnfortunately this did nothing to motivate the\nproduction of the good film. The story was ripped\nand slashed and at times incoherent, whilst there\nwas little else to compensate for that. As much as\nthe books can be hugely absorbing at times, this\nICU CINEMA TUESDAY26 TH NOVEMBER18: n \u2022 - SIGNS(12)2 D:3D NINE QUEENS(15) THURSDAY2 BTH NOVEMBER1 B. OO - NINE QUEENS(15) ZD I30S IGN5(12) THE CINEMA IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE UNION DIRECTLY ABOVE THE MAIN OFFICE. TICKETS( AS ALWAYS) ARE \u00a3 3\nEACH, OR \u00a3 5 FOR BOTH FILMS film could be repulsing.\nThe story, both imaginative and intricate on\npaper, is allowed to drown in an extremely indolent screenplay. The plot never flows. Columbus\ncan be excused for skimming away many of the\nminor stories and complexities (at two hours,\nforty minutes the film can already be tediously\nlong) but he left the film without direction. The\nscript was terrible, containing too many cheap\nand nauseating lines and the soundtrack was\njammed with melodramatic strings - the experience was similar to sitting through a three-hour\nWerther's Original advert.\nThe best acting seen was probably Dobby the\ncomputer-animated \"house-elf\" - one of the highlights of the film. Smith (McGonagall), Rickman\n(Snape) and Branagh (Lockhart) created their\ncharacters excellently, but unfortunately Harry,\nRon and Hermione did not live up to expectations.

I was horrified last\nTuesday to see a small brown\nmouse scurrying along behind\nsome seats.

I took this opportunity to\nask as many important people as\npossible about top up fees and\nthey're opinion of our lovely Mr\nSykes. David Davis (Deputy\nLeader of the Opposition) was violently against top up fees but did\nadmit that the bill may well get\npassed when it goes to govern-ment. A lovely little man who is\nthe mp for somewhere in\nBedfordshire talked for a good 20\nminutes before I realised he was\ncunningly avoiding giving any\nopinions on anything, clever little\nscamps these politicians. Another\nterribly suave mp, who was also a party whip ( how funny is that? I spent a long time confirming with\nhim that it was his job primarily to\nwhip people) really liked the graduate tax idea and also admitted\nthat Sykes was a conniving little\nbastard (not quite his words, we\nwere in polite company, but the\nlook on his face was explanatory\nenough). The general consensus is\nthat the top universities do need\nmore money but that top up fees\nare not the answer, or at least not\nright now.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT27 R Success on the Water\nBill Mason's last year as chief\ncoach of Imperial College Boat\nClub ended with strong performances by the eight crews that\ncompeted at Henley Royal\nRegatta in July.\nFour crews in total progressed\nto the semi-finals on the\nSaturday. In the Temple\nChallenge Cup, the 1st eight\nnarrowly lost to their main\nrivals, Oxford Brookes by half a length. Both crews were pushed\nto the limit, so much so that\nOxford Brookes were arguably\ntoo tired to beat Harvard in the\nfinal.\nIn the Grand Challenge Cup\nfor eights, an Imperial College\ncomposite crew comprising rowers from the national squad\nwent out to a German national\ncrew in the semi-finals. In the\nVisitors Challenge Cup for cox-less fours, the Imperial College A crew were beaten in a tight race\nagainst a composite crew from\nOxford Brookes and Imperial\nCollege. It was later revealed\nthat Imperial College's3 man,\nTim Perkins was suffering from\ngastroenteritis during the com-petition. The composite crew\ncontaining Dan Marret and Dave\nGillard of Imperial went on to\nwin the event in a controversial\nfinal requiring a re-row when a flock of geese wandered on to\nthe course.\nOther crews of note included\nthe second Temple Cup eight\nwho lost a narrow race to a strong crew from Marist College,\nUSA. Finally a pair from Imperial\nraced the South African world\nbronze medallist s, worrying\nthem off the start going out in a well publicised race.\nFour members of the Temple\nCup eight, George Whittaker,\nHugh McKenzie, Ed Johnson\nand John Weale, went on to win\nsilver in open cox ed fours in the\nNational Championships. This\nexperienced crew raced with\ntenacity over the 2000m course,\nonly being overpowered by the\nwinning crew from\nNottinghamshire County in the\nlast 300m. This ended a successful regatta season that saw various wins\nat the Metropolitan, Docklands\nand Reading regattas. Imperial\nalso sent an eight to an invitational student regatta in\nValenciennes, France, where\nthey beat Dresden of Germany to\nwin the final. Special note\nshould go to the new members\nof the club who won novice\ncox ed fours in convincing style\nat Putney Town regatta.\nThe women's squad prevailed\nthrough a difficult year and produced strong performances from\na small base. At Women's Henley Regatta, Cathy Burgione,\nKelly Cummins, Ali Elsey Helen\nEllison, and cox Seb Pearce\ncompeted in the College cox ed fours event. They raced with\ndetermination and skill against\nthe much bigger, but younger,\ncrew of Eden High School,\nCanada, but were unable to prevent them slowly edging out a1 length lead by the finish line.\nComfort was to be drawn from\nthe fact that it was the closest\nany crew got to Eden in the\nevent.\nImperial College was also well\nrepresented at the various international regattas during the\nsummer months.\nAt the World Championships\nin Seville, Steve Trapmore, Luka\nGrubor and Kieran West from\nImperial College, together with\nTom Stallard of Cambridge\nUniversity and cox Christian\nCormack of Leander competed\nin the men's cox ed fours. They\ndominated the event, rowing to\ngold in the final in commanding\nfashion. This adds to their\nimpressive Olympic gold they\nachieved in the British men's eight in Sydney 2000. Imperial's Dan Ouseley also rowed in the\nBritish men's eight this year in\nSeville to come 6th place over-all, a most respectable result\nconsidering their initially poor\nperformances at the preceding\nWorld Cup regattas. James\nHaddow, who cox ed the Temple\nCup eight, went on to steer the\nBritish lightweight men's eight\nand came 5th in the final.\nOther international appearances included Angus Rivers,\nwho rowed in the cox less four at\nthis year's under 23 regatta, the\nNations Cup. Seb Pearce cox ed the British men's eight at the\nWorld University\nChampionships. Ironically this\nwas the Oxford Brookes crew\nwho beat the 1st eight in the\nTemple Cup at Henley.\nMarret and Gillard, along with\ntheir Oxford Brookes crew mates, represented England at the\nCommonwealth Regatta. More\ncontroversy was in store when\nthey had to re-row for the bronze\nmedal against former Queen's Tower members John Langley\nand Tom Morgan. Once again,\nthey won the re-row and\nachieved bronze, proving that\nfitness over 4000m is a more\nprudent tactic these days. Helen\nEllison and John Weale rowed\nfor Wales at the\nCommonwealths, with Ellison\nwinning bronze in the women's eight.\nSimon Dennis, former member\nof the British Olympic gold\nmedal men's eight from Sydney\n2000, has now taken over as\nthe Boat Club's new head coach.\nHe inherits Bill Mason's24 year\nlegacy of consistent success as a coach at the top of British row-ing. It includes 17 wins at\nHenley Royal Regatta, 15 World\nChampionship medals, and\nnational chief coach for women\nat the Atlanta Olympic Games,\nand many who have been\ncoached by Bill have risen\nthrough the ranks to enjoy successes in the national team. He\nwill now work in a more supportive role as Director of\nRowing at Imperial.\nA dinner to celebrate Bill's life\nand work at Imperial will take\nplace on Saturday 30 November\nat the Hilton Olympia, London.\nTickets are available from\npeter.holt@ic.ac.uk.\nSki & Snowboard Club\nTIGNES - \u00a3 3 0 9\n13,h22 nd December 2002\nPrice includes accommodation, travel, 6 day\nlift pass, insurance, social program, guiding,\ndiscount card and black tie fondue night.\nema ii ski@ ic.ac.uk\nor come along to Southside Upper Lounge on\nMonday or Wednesday lunchtimes.\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk All match and event reports are welcome.\n\n"

    "content": "2 0 MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX Kosheen\nFriday 25th October, Brixton Academy\n4/5\nOn the final night of their latest\nnational tour, Kosheen played a powerful, emotional and thoroughly\nenjoyable set at a packed Brixton\nAcademy.\nFor the uninitiated, Kosheen are\nDJs/producers Markee Substance\nand Darren Decoder, together with\nvocalist Sian Evans. Their debut\nalbum Resist was released last year\nand is still going strong, having\nspawned four Top 20 singles, most\nnotably the thumping, hypnotic\nHide U. The key advantage they\nhold over so many other groups is\ntheir near-unique ability to blend\ntogether flowing, addictive melodies\nand powerful drum 'n' bass beats.\nRight from the very first note, the\ncrowd were hooked - many of them\ndidn't stop jumping up and down all\nnight. I'd say this was due to the\nsheer energy and emotion generated\nby the band, but I suppose the\n10.30pm start (and the resultant\nmore-time-in-the-pub factor) also\nhad a part to play.\nKosheen played through most of\nthe fifteen tracks on Resist, beginning with the title track and ending\n75 minutes later with Catch, part of\na rare encore. They also showcased\nsome new material, which, under-stand ably, didn't go down quite as\nwell as the familiar album tracks.\nSadly, having watched Kosheen\nplay such a supremely confident set\nat Pacha earlier this year, I couldn't help feeling that the size of Brixton\nAcademy didn't quite suit them. The\ncomplete absence of the guy on the\nelectronic 'cello was a disappoint-ment, and perhaps they should\nhave readjusted the levels slightly to\nmake the vocals more audible.\nBut overall, this was another special performance from one of the\nvery best live bands around - a band\nwhose stock just keeps on rising.\nDave\nThe Lsbertines-f Supergrass 3/5\nMonday 28th October, Shepherd's Bush Empire\nAfter a band that didn't register in\nmy memories of this concert, came\nThe Libertines. I was unbelievably\nexcited due to their brilliant album\nwhich sweats and en erg is es. Ragged guitars shot through their\nfirst notes with 'The Horror Show'.\nWas it a bad omen? As I expected,\nthe guitarists were shaking a rhythmically, going haphazardly from\nleft to right on the stage.\nThe songs followed each other,\nthe musicians dropped their instruments and fell into the blackness of\nthe stage without a look behind,\nwithout a word. Everything was\ndepressingly quick: I was deeply\ndisappointed. They didn't pay any\nattention to the audience, there\nwas no show as such, they were\nalmost puppets dancing on a stage\nwith music from a CD. Why? They\nwere lost in the space of a stage\nwhere we can't see the audience\nsweat, perhaps they need more privacy to enable exclusivity? Is this\nthe attitude London's supposed\nfinest are supposed to have? It\nseems very unlikely that they were\nurged by the Supergrass not to do\ntoo much.\nHowever, it is never easy to play\nfor people that you think didn't come for you (even though I met a lot of people that came for the\nLibertines exclusively), but I think\nthat you should give all that you\nhave in your in order to make the\nvibration fly above the concert hall.\nNevermind.\nThen came Supergrass. They\nhad the material to make a show\nwith video cameras that threw online images of the band on the bottom wall, images of oscilloscopes,\nbut they had the elusive touch as\nwell. The audience was bewitched,\nthe power was flowing. But the big\nmonkeys (not the singer) were\nbehind the railings as the crocodiles in front of a castle to ease\nyour frenetic dance, in and on the\naudience. Everybody was having\nfun and it is so better when both\nparties can get their kicks.\nNelson\nThe\nPolyphonic\nSpree\nThere are very few people in\nmusic who wear a grin as large\nas Spree frontman Tim\nDeLaughter.\nAfter the initial wave of hype,\nthe public seemed to have lost\ninterest in this lot. Thankfully,\nthis second coming (on the day\nof the Lord) shows why they\nwere proclaimed as the best live\nband around in the first place.\nThe band walk out to a fervent crowd and launch into\ntheir near-perfect album. The\nfirst thing that smacks you is\nthe frenetic energy of Spree.\nA line-dancing brass section\nand head banging choir section\nare the order of the day. You can\nunderstand why they are sometimes referred to as a cult, since\nit is virtually impossible not to\nbe taken in by their overwhelming enthusiasm.\nA special band needs a big\nleader, which can be found in\nTim. At times it looks as though\nhe is tapping into some otherworldly force, to bring spiralling\nharmonies and never-ending\nsing-a longs.\nIt's The Sun is turned from a haunting ballad into an epic\nromp, and the new material,\nespecially 2000 Places,\nbecomes an instant crowd-please r, although the inevitable\nfavourites remain Hanging\nAround and the rollicking\nSoldier Girl where Jarvis Cocker\nis brought on to try his hand at\nchoir practice!\nIt's hard to imagine that The\nEmpire will witness this much\neuphoria in the near future; if\nyou managed to leave without\nat least a spring in your step,\nyou truly do have a heart of\nstone. Whatever religion it is\nthey subscribe to, I'm sure\nthey'll have a lot of converts in\nthe coming months.\nDeepesh\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Comments, queries and complaints to the usual address\n\n"

If\nyou're not sure what a worldview\nis then Jason has written about\nthese strange creatures on the\nright. We are Christians and members of His People church (the one\nthat meets in the Drewe lecture\ntheatre at Charing Cross). Besides\nthis we run small groups in halls\nand we do worldview surveys,\nwhich is where this comes in!\nOver the next months, years or\npossibly page, depending on the\npopularity of \"Paradigm Shift\",\nwe'll be publishing our results and\nother \"interesting things\" to keep\naway the boredom during your\nlectures, or make it worse depending on your worldview!\nWhat do we do?\nhe survey contains nine ques-ons, from which it is possible to\ndetermine one's worldview. The\nquestions will be considered in\nu ture \"Paradigm Shift\" articles,\nprovided it lasts that long! There's about six of us on the team and\nwe go out on Wednesday after-noon s, armed with our clipboards\nto find some respondents. Surveys\ntypically last between ten minutes\nand two hours and are normally\nenjoyable for everyone involved.\nThey usually end up more like\nconversations than just questions\nand answers, because the whole\nidea of them is to find out why\npeople believe what they do, and\nthey're often interested in finding\nout the same about us too! So if\nyou've got a deadline in two hours\nand you see the clipboards coming\ntowards you then my best advice\nis to run for your life!\nWhat is a worldview?\nI like the formal definition by John\nSire in his excellent book \"The\nUniverse Next Door\" in which he\nasserts that a worldview is a set of\npresuppositions which we hold\nabout the basic makeup of the\nworld. In other words, a worldview\nis first of all an explanation and\ninterpretation of the world and\nsecondly, an application of this\nview to life.\nIn some sense a worldview is\nlike wearing the correct pair of\nspectacles; it must provide the\ncorrect prescription for making\nsense of the world and like a pair\nof spectacles must offer focus.\nSupernaturalism\nHello and welcome to worldview\nof the month. Dictionary.com says\nthat super naturalism is \"The belief\nin a supernatural agency that\nintervenes in the course of natural\nlaws.\" This doesn't help much,\nthough, because we've only got rid\nof the -ism! To go further we must\ndefine what the supernatural is.\nWhat do you think about when the\nword \"supernatural\" is men-tio ned? Ghosts and goblins? Well\nDictionary.com doesn't exactly\nmention these, but it does say:\nl. Of or relating to existence outside the natural world.\n2.Attributed to a power that\nseems to violate or go beyond natural forces.\n3.Of or relating to the immediate\nexercise of divine power; miraculous. So it's quite a broad worldview,\nwith Islam, Christianity, Judaism,\nHinduism and Buddhism being\nthe major supernatural is tre li gions. Of course many people\nbelieve in something beyond the\nnatural world without falling into\nthese categories and the sheer\nquantity of films and books that\nhave references to the supernatural shows that there is a genuine\ninterest in it.

    "content": "FASHION FELIX IC GT5JLE\nTHIS SEflSOn I SHALLflEfTIOSTLy\nName - Alex\nDepartment - Chemistry\nYear - 2nd Favourite Shops - Camden\nMarket, Karen Millen, New\nLook, Brighton Laings\nHow would you describe your\nstyle? - Hippyish\nWhat's your favourite access o ry? - Sarongs, great over\ntrousers!\nSo what will the self respecting\nLondoner be wearing this winter?\nWell probably what they always\nwear, but the shops will be stocking the latest trends and here is\nwhat will be included.\nSo what are this season's essentials? Corduroy, in beige or\nblack, for trousers, skirts, hats,\nbags and blazers. This is probably\none of the strongest looks for this\nseason, the cord trousers or skirts\nshould be worn with a chiffon\nflowery blouse for women and\nwith a flowery vintage shirt for\nmen. However don't mix and\nmatch cord, especially not black\nand beige together.\nVintage or retro gear is still\nhere, this time for men's shirts\nand women's accessories like\nbags and shoes.\nWinter is the time for big, snug-gly coats and this season's style is\nsheepskin. This is carried over\nfrom last winter but this winter\nsheepskin is less subtle, the coats\naround at the moment are very\n70's with exotic trims and big\nhoods.\nThe final essential item is a skinny scarf, the longer and louder the better. It should be knitted\nand probably strip y in all the\ncolours of the rainbow. French\nConnection have a mens strip y scarf which is slightly more subtle\nfor \u00a325, it is imaginatively called\nMens multi stripe scarf.\nNow for women we have four\nstyles for you to choose from.\nThere's gothic, starlet, grungy and\nretro sport.\nWhat about gothic? Sorry but\nthis does not mean that Slipknot\nt shirts or leather trousers are in,\nthis season's gothic look is less\nscary and more sexy! Floaty chiffon is teamed with crochet knits\nin black, with highlight colours of\nclaret (dark red) and plum (dark\npurple).\nA good key item for this trend is\na black, layered chiffon skirt e.g. Topshop for \u00a338. This can then\nbe worn with a crocheted black or\nplum coloured top for a sexy party\noutfit.\nSo who wants to be a starlet?\n20's and 30's glamour is back,\nbut this time with a Hollywood\ntwist, a slightly darker version of\nMarilyn. This is the ultimate party\nlook for all this years Christmas\nparties, with sexy satin dresses\nand faux fur. Over the top glamour\nis the key with sequins and\nGlam with chi fff on and fur\nembroidery, covering every inch.\nThe key item for this look is the\nsheer wrap, worn over plain strap-py tops, these look incredibly gorgeous and come mostly in gold or\nsilver tones. Topshop do a beautiful wrap, which is white with\nbrown sequin detail for \u00a345, none\nof these wraps are cheap due to\nthe embroidery or sequin detail on\nthem, but they are a good investment as they can be worn with a range of things.\nWith the Starlet look comes the\nRED matt lipstick, great if you can\nwear it but makes most people\nlook like the undead.\nHow about grungy then?\nNirvana are back and with them\ncomes a new edge on the grunge\nlook, where blok ey items like\nparkas, bomber jackets or combats are combined with ultra feminine chiffon tops or skirts. This\ntrend includes the military look,\nwith faded khaki and retro military badges etc. However camouflage is not back in and should be\navoided at all costs! Mango do a fantastic green military coat for\nfashion.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\nFELIX FASHION IC GTyLE\nHE \u00a351with belt and gold stud detail.\nIf you're intending on visiting\nthe gym sometime soon to shed\nsome pounds and get a head start\nbefore Christmas then you'll be\ninto retro sport. Well the 70's had\nto be in somewhere, with jogging\nbottoms, zip tops and t shirts, all\ncovered in retro logos and in\nbright colours. Not to be worn all\nat once but the zip tops and t shirts look great with jeans.\nSo you've got your outfits sort-ed, how about the accessories?\nBoots and shoes have evil looking\npointed toes this winter, very\nCruella De Vil! Mainly in black or\nbrown but plum features in the\nshoe department as well.\nBright red lipstick is always a good colour and Office do a pair of\nankle boots in this colour called\n'Pili Demi Boot' for \u00a369.99.\nHandbags are still essential and\nhave tassels, embroidery etc. or\nare found in plain black leather.\nTrends for men this season are\nSki sport, retro and navy.\nThe a pre s ski look, without the\ndod gy sunglasses. Lots of knits in\nthis look, with a slightly retro\nedge, including this seasons odd-Chunky Knits to keep you warm\nest the trend the 'alpine sweater';\nthe ones with snowflakes and\nbright colours on, very strange!\nAlso zip tops with retro stripes\nand again a strangely 70's feel.\nThese knits are worn with\ndenim or tweed trousers and big\nparkas or gil lets( sleeveless\npadded coats).\nRetro, ah, that word again! This\nseason's retro is an excuse to\nwear flamboyant shirts, with floral\nprint and frills... only for the very\nbrave.\nTopman has a lovely green paisley shirt for \u00a325, it is actually\nnicer than it sounds, which would\ngo well with a pair of flared jeans.\nCord flares and blazers are big\nand colours should clash but\ntastefully so, if there is such a thing.\nThe skinny scarf look comes\nunder this heading and looks fab\nwith a retro style blazer.\nNavy is a slightly odd trend that\nhas sneaked in to cover the more\ntailored look, but includes other\nitems.\nBig thick white woollen knits\nare included in this trend, as are\nstripes in navy blue of black.\nMen never seem to do much in\nthe way of accessories but an\nitem I think is fantastic is the\nMonkey Beanie, from Topman for\n\u00a310, v cute!\nNow it is time for me to impart\na bit of fashion wisdom, as we are\npoor students there is no point\ntrying to follow every trend and\nchanging your style every month.\nIt is better to simply buy some\nof the key items, which can be\nbought relatively inexpensively.\nWe now have an email address,\nwhich is: fashion.felix@ic.ac.uk,\nso please email us with articles,\nshop reviews or just suggestions.\nLet us know what you'd like to\nhear or send us a review of your\nfavorite shop.\nGail\nPhotos courtesy of Topshop\nand Topman\nFirstly I would just like to ra ahh h! Some smart arse pointed out to me\nthat Cosmopolitans shouldn't have crushed ice in them. Well ra ahh h to that, I like crushed ice, my housemate has (well had because it\nbroke) an ice crusher and how many students do you know who can\nbe bothered to chill glasses beforehand?\nAnyway, to make your margarita you first stick salt to the rim of your\nglass. Rubbing a wedge of lime around the rim does the trick. Now\njuice a couple of limes and stir in a couple of teaspoons of sugar to\ntaste. Into a cocktail shaker put in some ice cubes, 2 measures of silver tequila, 1 measure of triple sec and your lime juice. Shake and\nserve over ice, crushed ice in my opinion but if not, who cares? If you\nthink the crushed ice melts too quickly, drink faster. By the way, when\nI say a measure I think I mean a double but these recipes have only\nbeen tested in a drunken haze. My housemates seemed to appreciate\nthem even without the recommended baby orchid garnish.\nfashion.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

Liz,\nis obviously not interested and\nquickly gets drawn into a yoga\ncult leaving a terrified Dave to\ntravel round on his own. He\nlurches round the country, getting\nill, offending people and trying to\nsee what travellers do all day.\nMost of the time he's genuinely\nunhappy but miraculously by the\ntime he's back home in the pub\nthe worst bits are forgotten and\nhe proudly realises he has managed to rack up the obligatory\ncollection of stories he will need\nfor the start of university.\nIf you have been been travel-ling, this is your Bridget Jonesyou'll sit there going \"that's so\nright\" and chuckling. You'll have\nbeen through most of the situations and met most of the people\ndescribed. It's incredibly sharp,\nhonest and funny.\nIf you haven't been travelling,\nthen this is a brilliant expose of\nwhat those guys who turned up\nwith weird hair and tie-dyed\ntrousers in the first year did, having spent their gap year on some\nparent funded gnat-milking expedition to the wilds of a country\nyou've never even heard of. You\nabsolutely must buy it.\nTom Kingham\nPenguin Books; ISBN: 0140272658\nAtomised\nMichel Houellebecq\nOnly buy this book if Spar has run\nout of bog roll, and you have\ncholera plus a runny nose. It's unmitigated crap. By the time I'd finished it, I was so angry that I'd devoted part of my life to it.\nCounting the bobbles on flock\nwallpaper would have been better.\nIt's supposedly a study of relationships in our \"atom is ed\" so cie ty. Two half-brothers, Michel, a molecular biologist, and Bruno, an\nunsuccessful teacher, wander\ndepressingly through their lives,\ngetting laid occasionally and\nspouting philosophical crap.\nIt's supposedly a telling insight\ninto the dysfunctional state of\nmodern life. Apparently France is\nin danger of becoming a third\nworld country through the failure\nof religion, moral decay and laziness of the population. Many people don't like France, but this\nseems to be going a bit far.\nI do cerebral occasionally but I know enough science to realise\nthat the biological diatribes are\nwell off the mark, which made me\nsceptical of the philosophy. I feel\nbad s lagging off a book - it's meant\nto be an outpouring of the soul,\nlike stripping naked in front of the\nwhole world. And here I am pointing and laughing but no, I can't be\nnice about it - even the naked\nwoman on the front cover is ugly.\nTom Kingham\nVintage; ISBN: 0099283360\nFaced with a far from appealing\nfront cover, which is a prime\nexample of bad-taste wallpaper,\nand probable choice of several of\nthe characters within, I had my\nreservations. However, Simon\nCrump's book of three short stories surprised me by being both\nhighly enjoyable and thought\nprovoking. As they say, never\njudge a book by its cover!\nThe first story, Monkey's Birthday, introduces you to a Monkey's Birthday and Other Stories\nSimon Crump s street of rather un savoury characters whose lives are inter-twined. Their personalities,\nrevealed through a highly\ndescriptive narrative of the mundane objects and routines which\nfill their lives, left me wondering\n- just how many homes are littered with free gifts from lager\npromotions?\nEnglish Electric is a depressing\nforay into the downfall of a man\nafter being made redundant.\nShort and not very sweet but\neye-opening all the same. The\nfinal story, Early Doors, introduces you to the highly entertaining world of a con man and\nhis new wife. Has he finally\nmade it big?\nThese three stories have a colourful cast of characters, perhaps stereotyped, but that is to\nbe expected in such a small\nspace. I did enjoy the stereotypes and Crump uses them to\nhis advantage, injecting them\nwith a surprising amount of\nhumanity. As a result, his characters are fully rounded and live-ly, inciting you to care about\nthem.\nIf you prefer to avoid the less\ndesirable side of life, then the\ncast of wackos, drunks and con-men may not be for you. But if\nyou want your eyes to be opened\nto different outlooks on life, and\nto investigate the motivations for\nsome of the most depraved\nsocial behaviour, then perhaps\nthis is the book for you.\nThere's some strong social\ncomment here. For example,\nMonkey's Birthday ends with a crime, depicting the perpetrator\nas a passive agent driven by circumstances and situations. I'm not sure if this book should be\ntaken as an authority on these\nsituations. After all, it's just the\nauthor's personal insight, but it'll\ndefinitely spark thought in your\nown mind. On a more superficial\nlevel, this is thoroughly enter-tain ing;a personal through-the-keyhole into the lives of a diverse\nrange of lively characters.\nRebecca Purvis\nBloomsbury; ISBN:0747557691\nbooks.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The Charter stipulated that the new\nmayor must be presented to the Sovereign for\napproval and to swear loyalty to the Crown.\nSaturday 9th November 2002 saw the 675th Lord Mayor's Show and City & Guilds College\nUnion once again co-ordinated an entry on\nbehalf of Imperial College. This year's float\ncelebrated the 100th birthday of Boanerges,\naffectionately known as Bo1\n, one of the vintage vehicle mascots of the Faculty of\nEngineering.\nGenerators purred into life, lights lit up, silk\nflames started billowing around and the air\naround the float was filled with floating voices whispering \"testing\" into the microphone.\nThe rest of the students accompanying the\nfloat began to trickle in, including members\nof Skate Soc (on skates...) and Juggling Club\n(to juggle). After 1 lam the float finally began\nto move off, edging forward with Clementine\nand Jezebel bringing up the rear. Clem\nappeared to find itself the chosen base for\nSTOIC, who were along to film the event.\nIn true Imperial College fashion one of our\ngenerators chose this particular moment to\nfail, shutting down the all important sound\nsystem (probably much to the relief of the\nmarching band in front). With panic rapidly\nsetting in as we pulled out into the main procession Bo' and Derrick set out to make up\nfor the absence of sound with quick-fire\nusage of their horns while enthusiastic students scrambled over the float to try and\nrepair the broken generator (we are engi-ne ers, after all). A few minutes later this plan\nof attack was abandoned and the team started to work on moving the sound system over\nto the other generator. The lights and silk\nflames were reluctantly unplugged, leaving\nfour hideously expensive pieces of silk hanging forlornly across the side of the float.\nInevitably the wires were too short and the\npower plugs in the wrong place, but eventually the sound system came back to life and\neveryone on the float was able to breath a sigh of relief.\nThe rest of the parade went almost without\nincident, with Honourary Secretary Dan\nLehmann calling the 'Boomalaka' to welcome\nthe new Lord Mayor as we passed his stand.\nThe weather held out surprisingly well given\nthe torrential rain the day before and the\ncrowd lining the streets were entertained by\nthe antics of Skate Soc (equipped with their\nFred and Barney Flintstone costumes) as well\nas by Tom Williams and Mustafa Arif sitting\non Derrick and leaning radically from side to\nside every few seconds pretending to turn\ncorners. The BBC proceeded to do their part,\ncapturing the Imperial procession on screen\nfor nearly a minute.\nIt was well past mid-day when we finally\npulled over to stop for lunch. An adjustable\nspanner borrowed from the RCS Motor Club\nwas put to work on the broken generator and\nafter much cursing and hanging over the front\nof the float it spluttered into life. The return\nparade back to London Wall took about an\nhour and passed mercifully almost without\nincident though sadly the BBC didn't get a chance to capture our float in its full two-gen-erat or glory, with silk flames billowing. As\nalways the show was great fun for those who\ntook part and superb publicity for Imperial\nCollege. Assuming the money can be found,\nthere can't be any doubt that we'll be back\nagain next year.\nMore information on the show can be\nfound on-line at http://www.cgc u. net/lms/\nOliver Pell\ner lal dj: bar: food ambient or soul: funk: jazz every Wednesday and friday on the first floor of the union building plus: new catering menu served at your table Panini served with Salad I Chips/Potato Wedges/Onion Rings/Mushrooms\nRice, Nachos or a Tortilla Indian Samosa served with Salad ant\nPizza: Gourmet and Vegetarian | Side Salad, Hot Dog Spicy Chicken Fillet Burger\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

However, staff\nprotesting outside buildings\nmade up only a fraction of those\naway from work, as many others\ndeclined to cross picket lines,\nregardless of their support for\nstrike action.\nMany departments, such as\nPhysics, officially cancelled lecturers for the day, but in others\nmost lectures ran as normal.\nAt Imperial College Union, the\nstrike had little effect on student\nservices, despite some members\nPicketers were in good spirits, but cold..\nof staff walking out for the day.\nFour of the main staff unions -the Association of University\nTeachers, Unison, NAFTHE and\nAmicus - called a strike to\nprotest about the amount of extra\nmoney awarded to university\nworkers in the capital. It has\nbeen fixed at \u00a32,134 since 1992\nbut the unions would like to see\nthat rise to around \u00a34,000.\nOne member of technical staff\non strike told Felix, \"We are very\nbitter that management get\n\u00a316,000 London allowance and\nthey won't even talk to us.\"\nDespite the strike, no talks\nwere scheduled between the\nUniversity of London and staff\nunions to resolve the dispute.\nUnison announced that a focus\nof the strike would be the\nQueen's visit to King's College,\nwhere she is expected to open a new library.\nThe AUT's general secretary\ntold the BBC \"When reasonable\nstaff are pushed to strike, vice-chancellors should sit down with\nthe unions and seek a resolution.\nSo far, they have not done this.\"\nAW\n'Speaker Van Man' Is Back\nA regular feature of life at\nImperial College returned this\nweek when men selling speakers\nout of the back of a van started\npestering students.\nThe \"speaker van man\" phenomenon crops up each year.\nThe van's passengers call a student over as if to ask directions,\nclaim that they've had a delivery\nof speakers rejected and that\nthey are trying to shift them at a knock-down price.\nIn the past, the speakers have\nfound to be either broken or of\nvery low quality. Buyers have\nalso been asked to take the\nsalesmen to cash machines, and\nphysical threats have been made\nagainst those who refuse to buy.\nCollege Security strongly\nadvise students to stay away\nfrom the vans - so far this week\na white van and a green van\n(S904 NGW) have both been\nused, and there may well be\nmore - but can do nothing to\nstop them as long as they remain\non public roads.

So, the real challenge lies in\ntrying to convince people that you are the best\nman or woman for the job. This is where web\nsites like this become useful and frankly I am\nwilling to take advice from all directions if it\nwill improve my chances.\nThere are many different websites claiming\nto offer good advice and millions of job vacancies but I think this is one of the best. Clearly\nlaid out with a lot of information including a particularly useful section on company profiles.\nThe frequently asked questions covers anything\nfrom what to put in your CV to how to find out\nabout studying abroad. If you register (very\neasy) then they will provide you with individual\nadvice on your CV as well as informing you of\njobs that are likely to be of interest. Once registered you can also display your CV on line for\nemployers to find you. I have always rather fancied being head hunted but I think that is a little unlikely.\nBy the way non-final years, it might be a good idea for you to start looking too, don't Junkyard far forwards So, your so-called friends have sent yet another really annoying forward. The first problem is\ntrying to open it - I usually get a message saying \"This attachment type is not yet support-ed\", pray tell me what does that mean? If you\nmanage to access the damn thing then there\nis a really high probability that it is not funny,\nnot relevant and is certainly not worth your\nmailbox megabytes. Then it gets worse, you\nhave to reply to whoever sent it to you without\nmentioning their really poor sense of humour.\nWell, guess what, I have discovered an entire\nwebsite dedicated to them. Just what you\nalways wanted. A true time waster and a brilliant way to annoy all your not-so-favourite\nfriends.\nMany of these you will probably already\nhave been subjected to but this is a really\ngood way to waste valuable time . While the\nforwards are divided into categories such as\n'famous quotes' and 'heaven jokes' they are\nunfortunately not titled. Which means you\nhave to open it to find out what it is.\nIn fact, I am now beginning to wonder why\nI am reviewing a badly-designed, totally useless website. I remember, we all like to piss\npeople off from time to time.

    "content": "FELIX FILM REVIEWS17 RABBIT PROOF FENCE STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: EVERLY N SAMPI, TI ANNA SANS BURY, LAURA M DNA GH AN PHILLIP NOYCE PG93 MINS BTH NOVEMBER If films wrote history, we'd be screwed. Forget\nAttila the Hun, Ivan the Terrible and Hitler; in the\nall-time definitive list of most evil entities the\nworld has ever known, the English would be sitting pretty at Numero Uno. With the exception of\nGerman and perhaps Russian, diabolical megalomaniacs always have English accents. Then\nthere's Braveheart, The Patriot, Titanic and\ncountless others. Blighty-bashing is the most\npopular sport in Hollywood, and with Mel Gibson\nin particular. And if you've ever talked to an\nAussie, you'll know that it's almost their national\npast time.\nRabbit-Proof Fence is a tale of the subjugation\nof Australia's native Aboriginals in the name of\nHer Majesty. This is still a most controversial subject Down Under, and one of 'Straylia's most\nshameful legacies. Up until 1970, half-caste\nchildren could be removed from their homes and\nsent for education in white environments. They\nbecame known as the Stolen Generations, and to\nthis day the Australian government refuses to\nThey're all the same size really, it's just an optical illusion.\napologise for its treatment of them.\nAlthough this is a tale of the plight of\nAustralia's indigenous inhabitants (and it raises\nsome pertinent questions about Australia's policies on this subject), it is more concerned with\nwhat the Aussie film industry does best - which\nis making simple yet subtle movies about the\nnature of human emotion. The plot (based on a true story) centres on the plight of three half-caste girls, who are taken from their Aboriginal\nmother in the 1930s. They are moved 1500\nmiles to be educated as servants, on the orders\nof the Minister for Aboriginals, Mr. Neville\n(Kenneth Branagh).\nRefreshingly, the filmmakers have shied away\nfrom making an anti-English movie, although it\nmust have been tempting to do so. Mr. Neville\ncomes across as a decent and honourable man,\nalbeit with badly misguided views about race and\nequality. In a line laced with irony, he laments, 'If\nonly they could understand what I'm trying to\ndo'. These days, the boot is most firmly on the\nother foot.\nIn a film where lines of dialogue are few and\nfar between, a hugely effective visual narrative\nmore than fills the gaps. Stunning cinematography powerfully conveys the vastness and wildness of the Australian outback, while the three\nlead girls, Molly (Everlyn Sampi) especially, manage to convey much simply through body language and facial expression. The acting in general is astounding considering most of the children\nfeatured had never even seen a movie before, let\nalone acted in one.\nA word must be said too about the music. If\nthis were a Hollywood film (and thank God it\nisn't) we'd have sweeping scores and sentimental interludes. The way that things like this are\nmanaged produce an emotional movie despite\nfilming in an almost understated style; by letting\nthe story do the talking, if you'll pardon an\nincredibly bad pun.\nIt wouldn't be excessive to say that this is one\nof the best Australian films I 've ever seen,\nalthough come to think about it, that doesn't necessarily mean much. One anecdote might convince you though: in a near-packed cinema, no\none left until well after the credits had started\nrolling. Even if you disregard everything I 've said\nabove, you have to take that as a sign of a powerful film. David\nSUPER TROOPERS STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: JAY CHANDRASEKHAR KEVIN HEFFERNAN, LYNDA CARTER JAY CHANDRASEKHAR151 \u2022 \u2022 MINS15 TH NOVEMBER Now, just before you nylon flares-wearing\ndisco babes get all excited, this is not a film\nabout ABBA. Sorry. But on the upside, it is\nabout State Troopers. For those among you\nwho have never seen a Smokey and the\nBandit film (and why not?!), State Troopers\nare a) a branch of American law-enforce-ment, b) stupid and c) wear beige. Oh, and\nthey only have jurisdiction over roads. Which\nis weird, but does make for a nice little subplot to hang the Jackass-style shenanigans\non. It's been decided that the people of\nSpurbury are only naughty enough to warrant\n(ged d it?) one local law-enforcement agency,\nand so the boys in brown and the boys in\nblue go head to head in a bid to crack (ooh,\nthey just keep coming...) a big drugs case.\nIt must be pointed out here that the actual\nplot matters not - you'll all be too busy\nchortling and rolling around the floor among\npopcorn crumbs and mushy M& Ms to give a toss. This film is hysterical! Written by a group of mates going by the odd name of\n\"Broken Lizard\", the film encompasses all\nmanners of sick, twisted, filthy and downright daft humour. The Troopers amuse themselves in the slow Vermont town by pulling\nover stoner s and freaking them out 'til paranoia sets in, shagging women in exchange for\nignoring speeding violations, and having\nmaple syrup drinking competitions. Oh, and\nthey keep brawling with the local cops which\ndoes not help their case much...\nAll in all, this makes for a very entertaining\nromp, and did cause us to laugh very loudly\nwhilst proper journalists sneered and acted\nall professional. Which I think is a high recommendation for any film. The acting isn't great, and the simple plot may be an issue\nfor some, but what really sets this film apart\nfrom others of its ilk is the group dynamic of\nBroken Lizard. These are blok es who you\nknow are good friends - the kind of friends\nwho spend all their time chuckling about cartoons and taking the piss out of each other.\nThey are the friends Monica, Chandler and\nCo. will never be and the kind of friends\neveryone wants. Amazingly, this rapport carries to film beautifully - Broken Lizard wrote,\nacted and directed the entire thing. And you\njust know they had such a wicked time doing\nit.\nGo see this with your own mates, and if\nyou don't have any, go see it to find out what\nyou're missing out on. Feel-good, funny and\nwith a special appearance by Wonder\nWoman. What more do you want?\nLiz\nAmerica's finest? Don't we all feel that little bit safer now..\nBUFFY SEASON5 DVD CERTIFICATE:15 RELEASE DATE:15 TH NOVEMBER In the most harrowing series yet, Buffy faces\nsome serious evil, including Dracula, a demon god, a bratty baby sister and the\ndeath of her mum. The teen messages the\ndirectors love to force-feed fans are slightly\noverly played, and irritating Riley is still not\ndead, but the series is worth it to see the\ndarker turn Whedon et al are taking. Extras\nare pretty standard, with director's com-ment aries, scripts and behind the scenes\nlook at stunts. Liz\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS Various\nWe Are Skint\n3/5\nThis 'Best Of album uses the\nmoney-spinning concept of putting all of one record company's biggest artists, as well as their\nnewest on a double CD and\nhopefully introduce fans to those\nnewer acts.\nBetter known tracks are\nplaced on CD 1 - That Was Then\nand new tracks on CD 2 - This Is\nNow. This means the first album\nis full of tried and tested\nfavourites including Fatboy\nSlim's Rockafella Skank, Xpress 2's Lazy and Bentley\nRhythm Ace with Bentleys\nGonna Sort You Out. Stick this\non in your hall bedroom and it's a ready-made party. This is what\nall dance compilations aspire toa good mix of recognisable but\ntotally non cheesy tracks that all\nsound different.\nHowever, the second CD. takes a little more effort. It\nincludes tracks by most of the\nsame artists as CD 1 - Lo\nFidelty Allstars and Midfield\nGeneral both appear again, but\nthe tracks are as yet unknown.\nThe direction Skint is heading in\nseems to be away from big beat\nand towards a slightly darker,\nfaster club sound. Listen to it a few times and favourites for\nfuture hits will emerge. There'll\nbe plenty of screaming in clubs\nwhen these tracks kick in!\nThis will be good at a party,\nbut definitely better when it can\nbe put on towards the end when\nyou just want to stop the uninvited but wasted guests falling\nasleep and drooling on the floor.\nI conclude that this is an\nexcellent CD for the purposes of\nlooking cool and also having\nsomething you'll want to listen\nto - sort of a cross between Ibiza\n2002 and some mixmag compi-la tion. It also has a very cool\ncase (worth mentioning, as can\nbe important to the style con-s cio us). Also, for Skint fans,\nthere are exclusive tracks so\nworth getting hold of to own\nthem before any one else does.\nHow many reasons do you\nneed?\nSarah\nDavid Gray\nA New Day At Midnight\n3/5\nIt's been a long time coming,\nthis much anticipated follow-up\nalbum to White Ladder.\nPredictably, the first thing that is\nasked will be how it compares to\nWhite Ladder, something I'm sure David Gray tried to avoid by\ngoing on tour and just staying\naway for a few years. However\nthe expectation is still there.\nThe album starts promisingly\nwith Deari in the Water, a slow\nsong with a lot more forceful\naccompaniment than is usual in\nDavid Gray's songs. It has a good\nguitar riff before each verse.\nCaroline is upbeat with a busy\ndrum beat in the background.\nThe guitar is also prominent with\na good solo. It then starts to slow\ndown to White Ladder territory.\nKangaroo has a clever beat\nwhere it actually hops to sound\nlike a kangaroo.\nHowever the middle of this\nalbum start to sound a bit stale\nand dull. Last Boat to America\nhas an interesting xylophone at\nthe beginning but it carries on for\nthe whole song. Nothing much\nhappens in the song and it just\ngets boring. Luckily the last few\ntracks of this album carry on\nfrom the start. Be Mine has a good rousing chorus from the relatively tranquil verses.\nLyrically, the songs talk about\nlove themes and loss. Other Side\nis about the loss of his father.\nYou can tell a lot of his emotions\nare in the lyrics. This album is\nsufficiently different to White\nLadder while retaining what\nDavid Gray does best; good slow\nemotionally charged songs.\nOscar\nAlbums\nGluecifer - Basement Apes\nBasement Apes? Well, judging\nfrom the CD sleeve, this\nScandinavian collective does\nlook a bit hairy, scary and sunlight deprived. Formed in '95 in\nOslo, after meeting each other\ndown a dark alleyway (pro ba bly), this band likes to rock.\nAnd they do. Tracks such as\nRound and Round (which might\nas well have been by AC/DC)\nand Easy Living, a single\nreleased earlier this year, will\nhave you flexing those neck\nmuscles and wishing you had\nlong greasy hair to frantically\nwhip around, helicopter-style,\nlike the annoying girl in front of\nyou last night at the gig. With\ntitles such as Biff Malibu and\nRaldo Useless (that's the band-members' names, not the\nsongs, by the way), Gluecifer\ncould be mistaken for extras in\nthe Norwegian porn version of\n'Mystery Men'. However, they\nplay their instruments like the\nbest of them, which are always\nperfectly complimented by\nvocalist Malibu's convincing\ngrowls.\nAlthough the tracks vary in\nstyle from fast-paced rock to\nonly-slightly-less-fast-paced-and-more-thoughtful rock,\nGluecifer's refusal to be monotonous is endearing, and basically distinguishes them from\nthe rest.\nThese basement apes swing\nthrough the trees grunting, with\nintention and retro-class, their\nmusic not particularly evolved\nin style, but definitely in quality.\n4/5 Radha\nCOMPETITION TIME\nThe very nice people at\nSkint Records, home to\nFatboy Slim have generously given away a Skint DVD\nand CD for you lot!\nE mail us three of Skint's rost re to win these.\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Let's go pole dancing!\n\n"

Belinda and\nKatherine did an amazing job\ndefending and passing strong\nballs up the wings to Anna and\nFrances. Ysanne, even though\nshe was nursing a very painful\nhangover, did well helping out\nKate, who also had a great\ngame, putting in a fantastic\neffort throughout. They were\nboth really unlucky not to score\nfrom their midfield positions.\nClare was able to whack balls\nhard and fast up the right hand\nside and this combined with\nsome awesome runs straight up\nthe middle from Marriane made\nthe team look very impressive\nindeed.\nAll that needs to be said is\nthat the Ladie's seconds are a superb team and that spirits are\nrunning really high.\nIt was just unfortunate, how-ever, that we didn't manage to\nscore and allowed the opposition to get four particularly\nsneaky goals past us.\nBut well done gir lies! And\nespecially well done to Jenny for\nactually getting us organised\nthis week - she's slowly learning\nhow to be a great captain and\nwe have high hopes for her in\nthe future.\nVirgins Trounced\nIC Virgins 0 - 22 Brighton\nAlthough there has been some\ndebate whether Jenny pulled Ash\nor Ash pulled Jenny, there is no\nquestion over the fact that Aleks\npulled a16 year old (Porkwell's brother) so the Porkwells have had\nall the action really.\nGetting back to the rugby -Looking at the opposition before\nkick off, it looked like it would be\nan even match and so it was for\n60 of the 80 minutes. Our play in\nthe first half can only be described\nas beautiful. There was low tack-ling, running both forwards and\nfast and hands were good especially in the torrential rain.\nNotable good runs were made by\nGemma and Ash and only a lack\nof support prevented us from\nstorming into the lead. The end of\nthe first half (a good 5 minutes\nearly) found is camped in our 22\nand not a little pissed off.\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe second half started as the\nfirst had finished, playing on the\nhalf way line for a good 15 min-ute s. Unfortunately, after that it\nwent tits up and they scored their\nfirst try after sustained pressure on\nthe 5 yard line. After this, we kept\nour heads up for a good 10 minutes before we decided to roll over\nand die, and they put three more\ntries past us in ten minutes,\nenough said. By this point, we\nwere dropping like dead flies, with\nthe captain off the pitch, the vice-captain - who may have cracked\nher ribs - writhing in agony, and a handful of minor complaints, it\nwas all too much, and the game\nended a couple of minutes early to\nput us out of our misery. Women\nof the match were Monkey and the\nAsh Meister who were both lush.\nHaven't got a game for a couple\nof weeks now, so don't be too\nupset when you haven't got anything interesting to read in next\nweek's Felix... hehe.\nAs usual the turn out for the second race of the series was somewhat down on everyone's favourite\nParliament Hill course. Perhaps\nthis was because it was the rain,\nor maybe Jeff's reputation for\norganising successful transport to\nthe race venue had preceded him.\nWhatever the cause, it didn't seem\nto affect the overall quality of the\nfield, which turned out to be superior to the first race.\nIn the men's race several\nnotable absentees and a strong\nturn out from Brunei meant that IC\nA team was unable to maintain\ntheir impressive second place\noverall from the Parliament Hill\nleg. Finishing third, however, still\nleft us above all the ULU colleges\nand only beaten by two PE teacher\ntraining establishments. Captain\nDave Mulvee ran the fastest time\nof the day coming individually\n10th and was closely followed by\nChris Mullington, thus setting up a personal rivalry. UL captain Oli\nThwaites was finally back to\nsomewhere near good form, whilst\nteam legend Gavin 'the Gopher'\nmade an appearance for yet\nanother IC sports team.\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of\ndepth in the team this week, the\nBs and Cs couldn't quite live up to\nthe standards set previously, but\nwith the expected return to full\nstrength next week this result\nshould be reversed.\nThe women maintained their\nexcellent start to the season with\nthe As and Bs coming 5th and 8th respectively, with the As being\n2nd of the UL colleges just behind\nKing's.

    "content": "CLUBS FELIX Cherbourg Trip It was a Friday afternoon when\nwe left South Kensington in a big\nred smelly minibus, which we singularly failed to crash, and\nhopped along the road using two\nhands to change gears. After a quick meal, safety brief and putting on of lots of extra layers we\nleft Portsmouth Harbour in the\nearly evening, stuck the motor on\nand pointed the boat for France.\nAbout twelve hours later we\narrived in Cherbourg, a bit tired\nand cold but otherwise fine, having motored almost all the way as\nthere was next to no wind.\nUnfortunately all the weather\nforecasts we heard were implying\nthat this was definitely the calm\nbefore the storm, with each forecast predicting that the gale force\nwinds would arrive sooner rather\nthan later.\nSince being stuck in the middle\nof the channel in howling winds\nand rain was not quite what we\nhad in mind, and nor was being\nstuck in Cherbourg all week while\nthey went on - although maybe it\nwould have been nicer than lectures - we decided to head home\na little earlier than we had originally planned. We left Cherbourg\nsome six hours after arriving, having indulged in the necessities of\nquick nap, some breakfast, show-ers, a trip to the hypermarket for\nchocolate and alcohol, and lunch.\nAs we left we checked the\nengine and fuel like the good\nresponsible sailors that we all are\nand in a still non-existent wind\nmotored back towards England\nfeeling rather as if things were too\nboring to be true. And so they\nwere. Two hours later and our\nengine started to make very\nstrange noises, so we turned it off,\nnever guessing that it would not\nturn back on again. Half the crew\nretired down below at this point,\nand spent the next few hours with\ntheir head in the engine trying\neverything they could think of\nwhile the other half stayed resolutely on deck in the cold - mainly because they couldn't get down\nbelow as the steps had been\nremoved to get at the engine - and\nconcentrated on sailing as fast\nand efficiently as possible in what\nwind there was. Soon we were\nstorming along towards home and\nthe shipping lanes, with a stiffening wind, but no engine. We\ndecided that it would be safer to\ncontinue on our way than to turn\nback, considering the weather\nforecast, and settled into two\nwatches to sail through the night.\nThankfully the wind held pretty\nconstant and ten hours after our\nfirst sighting of the Isle of Wight\nand a lot of big ships later we\nfound ourselves back in the\nSolent. Still with no engine. We\nobtained permission form the\nPortsmouth Harbourmaster to\nenter the harbour under sail,\nsomething which is normally for-bidden, and considered berthing\nunder sail. This is a tricky\nmanoeuvre which would have\nbeen possible, but had it gone\nwrong there were an awful lot of\nboats around to hit and we had\nno back up engine to allow us to\nreverse out the way.\nAfter a lot of decision making\nwe phoned the marine equivalent of the AA, who sent a guy\nout in a rib to help us in, and\nthen fixed our engine in two minutes since we had ran out of fuel.\nTurns out the fuel gauge was\nwrong...\nIf you are interested in coming\nsailing with us then come to one\nof our meetings which are held\non a Monday at 6pm in southside bar, or visit our website for\nmore information.\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/yacht\nImperial College Union, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nNovember 20\n8:00pm1:00 am( Bar 'tn 12)\n\u00a31/pint Tetley & Carlsberg\n(In dBs, from 5-7 or longer while stocks last)\nDiscount Jugs of Cocktails\n(All night in the Pradise Bar)\nDry white and soft red wine \u00a31/125ml( in Paradise Bar from 9-11 or longer while stocks last)\nTry the new hot\nParadise Bar catering menu\n\n"
