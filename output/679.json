    "content": "Mooney for\nthe chop?\nDear Sir\nThe other day I was in dire need of some\nvictuals and being in the vicinity of\nSouthside Refectory I steeled myself to the\ntask of eating amongst hordes of nubile\nAmerican female students.\nUpon entering the refectory I saw writ\nlarge on the board \" Lamb... with courgette s\", so I decided to avail myself of\nthis wonder o us dish.\nImagine my surprise when the lamb upon\nentering my mouth tasted suspiciously of\nbeef\nFeeling a little cheated I attempted to\ncontact the manager but was told he was not\naround, nor has he been since!\nI recall an incident in 1982 in which lamb\npasties turned out to be beef. Mr Mooney\npromised it would never happen again. It\nstrikes me that refectories could not care\nwhat they serve to their customers just so\nlong as they get the cash with which they may\nchange the decor every six months.\nYours on an empty stomach\nDave Parry\nTrouble\nat mill\nDear Editor\nDuring Monday and Tuesday (August 13\nand 14) student cleaners and their\nrepresentatives met with College heir arch y of the SAC scheme, namely Gill Davies and\nanother member of personnel.\nThe main proposals put forward by the\ncleaners on Monday were: free\naccommodation for the student cleaners, as\nin the Summer Letting Scheme run by\nMichael Arthur; higher hourly rates for next\nyear (rates which have remained static at\n\u00a3 1.70 per hour for the past three years); and\nsome type of remuneration for the breakfast\nvouchers unused and left as tips for the\ncleaners by the guests. It should be noted\nhere that all breakfasts are paid for by the\nSAC at \u00a32.30 each regardless of whether or\nnot they are used.\nDuring the first meeting the \"college\"\nspent most of their time listening to the\nstudent cleaners' requests and trying to\n2\nconvey how they had no control over the\nbreakfasts they had paid for.\nThe second meeting, on Tuesday, was\neven more fruitless in that the first sentence\nuttered by Gill Davies was essentially \"After\ncareful consideration we are unable to offer\nany concessions.\" This came as no surprise\nto the representatives of the student cleaners\nwho have become accustomed to the College\ndoing nothing for anyone but themselves.\nMuch time was spent by the College in\ntrying to express how their hands were tied\nby predetermined budgets, and that the\nCollege and ultimately the students would\nbenefit from the profit of over \u00a3'/4 million\nmade by the SAC Scheme, but that it was\nimpossible to aid the student cleaners by\nproviding free accommodation; that \u00a38 per\nweek already deducted would make a great\ndifference to the \u00a336.04 take-home pay\nwhich the cleaners receive to survive on. The\ndifference between watching every penny\nand living.\nCollege tried to insist that the SAC cleaning employment open to students is\nprimarily a part time job\u2014not intended to be\n'self-sufficient', a point not even touched\nupon in the advertisements and interview for\nthe job.\nThe general feeling of the cleaners in the\nSAC Scheme is that the College\nadministration is once again proceeding in\nits typical manner of total disregard for\nstudents, students without whom the College\nwould not exist.\nYours\nStudent Cleaners of the SAC Scheme\nA sort of\npatriotism\nDear Sir\nOnce again the season for international\ncompetitions is upon us and I expect most of\nyour readers (being true patriots) have been\nglued to their television sets eagerly lapping\nup the triumphs (and disasters) of their\nrespective national teams.\nHowever, I feel that the time has come to\npoint out that, whilst a little friendly rivalry\nis no bad thing, such blatant setting of nation\nagainst nation can only serve to bolster the\naverage citizen's latent jingoistic instincts\nleading inevitably to an increased level of\nnationalism and possible insularity in the\ncompeting nations.\nObviously were such attitudes to become\nprevalent in the world, they could only serve\nto heighten the political tensions between\ncountries and ideologies and so lead us ever\nnearer to the nuclear precipice.\nThus I ask all true patriots, if they truely\nlove their countries and wish to keep them\nfrom the Holocaust to join the Soviet Union\nand her satellites in boycotting the Olympics\nin order that world peace may be\nmaintained.\nYours ever so sincerely\nHugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nFriday 17 August 1984\nFELIX\nBreakfast\nThe reason behind the summer letting of\nSouthside and Linstead rooms to tourists is to\nraise money to sub sid is e student rents during\nterm time. It is an economically sensible policy.\nThe fact remains, though, that over the last\nthree years the rent charged to tourists has risen\nand the student term time rents have risen, but the\nwages paid to SA C cleaners have dropped in real\nterms.\nThe College reasoning behind this is complex.\nThey have to maintain a relatively large cleaner\nworkforce all through the summer, even during\nslack periods, so that they can cope with the\noccasional arrival and departure of large parties\nof tourists. At the same time they have to\nmaintain 'differentials' between wages paid to\npermanent cleaners and those paid to student\ncleaners. The College authorities are also,\ndoubtless, aware that there is never any shortage\nof applicants for posts as summer cleaners.\nButfor the College to claim that they keep the\nwages low so as to keep student rents low is\npatently absurd when one bears in mind the way\nthat the SAC wastes money on breakfasts.\nThe SA Cfinances are arranged thus:for each\nroom let to a tourist, SAC pays a certain amount\nto the residence account. This benefits students\nduring term time. But for each tourist the SAC\nalso gives the Refectory \u00a32.30 for breakfasts.\nMost of these breakfasts remain uneaten and so\nMooney makes a massive profit for the\nrefectories by \"under catering\".\nIf the College authorities were really\ndetermined to keep student rents down they\nwould discontinue this absurd policy at once.\nDinner\nIt is the conviction of Hindus that me cow is a sacred animal. Once again, Mr Mooney's staff\nare wrongly describing beef as lamb (see letters),\nand so Hindus eating in Southside are likely to\nhave committed what they would regard as a grave sin.\nIt is intolerable that refectory staff should\nmake such crass errors. The sincerely held\nreligious beliefs of others are worthy of more\nrespect.\nMaz\nToday Maz Fellows, the FELIX phototypesetter\noperator, leaves Union employment.\nDuring her five years at College, Maz has\ngiven un stinting service to the Union, above and\nbeyond the call of duty.\nI join with my five immediate predecessors in\nthanking her from the bottom of our hearts, and\nwishing her all the best for the future.\nThanks also to Hugh Stiles, J Martin Taylor,\nDiane Love, Peter Rodgers, Pallab Ghosh, Mark\nSmith, Pete Dawson, RS Scorer, PeterBurridge,\nLen Moulder, Chris Hendy and Pete Coleman.\nFelix is published by the Editor for, and on behalf of,\nImperial College Union Publications Board, and is\nprinted by the Union Print Unit, Imperial College,\nPrince Consort Road, London SW7.

    "content": "POST GRADS H Some Aspects of Postgraduate Life at IC\nHendy, C.H. Postgraduate Group Chairman 1984/5\nAbstract\nAlcohol and sex in relation to the activities of a postgraduate are discussed in intimate detail. Supervisors and\nTutors from all departments are named and all their faults exposed The words work and thesis are carefully\navoided.\nKey-words\nBitter-Lager-Bushmills-Guinness-Daley Thompson\nIntroduction\nThe Postgraduate Group (PGG) is the biggest individual group at\nImperial College. It also has the distinction of being independent in its\naffairs and actions (similar to the CCUs). To run properly, it is\nnecessary for all PGs to become involved in its activities and those of\nthe students union. In this report a review of last years activities is\ngiven and events and opportunities for the future discussed.\nMethod\nThe original methods, as employed in October 1983, were to get as\nmuch involvement in the PG G as possible. After the initial success of\nthe Ploughman's lunch, apathy set in until February, when a flurry of\nactivity resulted in the organisation of a joint Silwood/South\nKensington party.\nIn April it was discovered that the PG G had no constitution. This\nwas quickly remedied and a new constitution was passed at Joint\nCouncil in June.\nAs for the future of the PG G, an excellent committee has been\nformed for next year (see appendix), and it is hoped that the\nexperienced gained this year will be used to good effect.\nThe most important piece of equipment used in this year's work\nhowever was alcohol. This simple yet highly effective liquid was used\ntime after time to induce favourable results and will be used extensively\nin all forthcoming work.\nResults\nBoth social events held were successful especially the Silwood party,\nwhere I am sure all 70 plus people who went from South Ken enjoyed\nthemselves. (Apologies to those two or three people we left behind,\nhope the walk home wasn't too bad!!!)\nDiscussion\nOverall the year has been reasonably successful. I hope that those who\nattended the social events have enjoyed themselves and not suffered\ntoo much the next day!! I feel next year could be the most important\nfor PGs at IC with the College Governing Body recommending a change in student percentages from 25% PGs to 40% PGs it is\nimportant that all Postgrads start to make their presence felt. The\nStudent Union is run by undergraduates for undergraduates.\nEvents lined up for next year include a fresher sPG party in the\nHolland Club on 2 October, preceded by a general meeting of the\ngroup. Numbers will be limited so watch the fresher s Felix for details\nabout tickets. There is also a cricket/sports day against Silwood on 9\nSeptember. Anybody interested in participating or spec ta ting, please\nsee a member of the committee.\nI must apologise to all those PGs who have applied for membership\nof the Holland Club but have yet to receive your membership cards. I am afraid I can only blame this on the incompetence of the\nmembership secretary and you may assume your membership has been\naccepted.\nFinally, if you are in the process of writing your thesis or your first\nyear transfer report may I wish you luck. I hope you have as successful\na1984/5 as I am sure the PG G will.\nConclusion\nToo much beer makes you fall over.\nAcknowledgements\nI should like to thank Jim Brannigan for being my main support on\nlast year's Committee, John Passmore and Doug Armstrong (past\nChairman) for their help and support, last year's sabbaticals for their\ninterest, Jenny Rudd and Andy Hamilton from Silwood Park and,\nfinally, all the barmen in college for their ever attentive service.\nYou may have noticed that the abstract has nothing whatsoever to\ndo with the content of this report. It was the only way I could think of\ninducing readership.\nAppendix\nChairman Chris Hendy Zoology\nSecretary John Passmore Mines\nTreasurer Jim Brannigan Biochemistry\nUndergraduate Liason Sean Davi s Physics\nOrdinary Members Paul Monsan Mines\nDiane Love Physics\nUl U Itavel\nis now on campus\nFELIX Friday 17 August 1984 7\n\n"

    "content": "COP1 NI ON Resources - where\nthe market fails\nThe miners are on strike, and it is said that pits are uneconomic.\nThere is a glut of oil, and the world population increases by a million\nevery four days. These are some of the problems that RS Scorer\nconsiders here, together with a stern warning for the future.\nFrom growth into recession.\nIn the last ten years we have seen a complete turnabout in the economic scene. The\naverage world citizen has become perceptibly poorer whereas for a thousand years\nbefore, it had been (incorrectly) thought that\neveryone would become more affluent.\nMany environmentalists foresaw this\nchange, the final indicator being that only\nsince 1973 have we failed to find new\nreserves of oil faster than we are using it up.\nWe don't blame governments for the\nrecession, nor for failing to prevent it; but we\ndo blame them for not expecting it, for not\npreparing for more of it, for not recognising\nit, and for having the wrong remedies now\nthat it has begun.\nLong before 1973 many environmentalists\nand some economists said that economic\ngrowth could not go on for ever, and that\nmessage was inherent in the writings of\nMalthas even before economic growth got\ngoing in earnest. Some economists have\nasserted, and still continue to assert, that\ngrowth can go on indefinitely, and they have\ntried to redefine their terms to that end. But\nwe can't eat computers or produce materials'\nout of serving each other; and, as if in answer\nto all problems, some economists have declared it to be a reliable law of nature that a material scarcity causes a substitute to be\ndiscovered.\nThe cost of population increase.\nAn increase in the number of people\nmeans an increase in material consumption;\non top of that more affluence means more\nmaterial consumption per person. The world\npopulation increase was roughly 60 million a year in the 1960s,70 million in the '70s,80 million in the '80s, and promises to be 90\nmillion a year in the 1990s. Merely to\nmaintain the present average level of\naffluence, extra resource consumption\nwould have to be enough to provide for a new\ncity of a million people every four days.\nImagine the rescue effort that would be\nrequired if the fabric of 90 cities each housing\na million people, their schools, public ser-vices, roads, etc had to be provided anew\neach year. That is a measure of the material\nrequirement for the affluence level of the\nworld to be kept where it is today: imagine\nhow it would detract from all the other things\nwe wish to do. Then realise that it is happening today and we are failing to provide for\nthe next generation.\nHow growth happened.\nThe era 1945-1973 was one of unprecedented growth. We used up the worlds stock\nof raw materials much more rapidly than\nduring the destructive periods of each of the\ntwo wars. Middle East oil became available in\nplenty, and its exploitation was based in the\nalready industrialised countries. Their idea of\nthe price of oil was the cost of getting it and\nrefining it plus a 'generous' royalty of, say,\n50% to the 'owners'. That resulted in oil\ncosting about a dollar a barrel in the 1960s. We saw the 'economic miracle', exemplified particularly by the recovery of\nGermany. But in reality it was no miracle at\nall, for who but a fool could fail to make a fortune on oil at a dollar a barrel when having\nthe technology to convert it into products\nworth a hundred dollars? If the price were\nnow a hundred dollars, there would be plenty\nof people able to make a profit out of it, and\nby the standards of history we would be very\nwell off, for the products of oil would still be\ncheap in terms of a day's wage.\nCoal in trouble through overproduction.\nIt is difficult to sell all the coal produced in\nBritain because oil is too cheap, and that is\nbecause people continue to act as if oil will\nflow for ever.\nOil is cheap, in the sense that it is easy to\nget, almost like picking up money lying in the\nstreet. But it ought to be priced at its value,\nnot at the cost of getting it. Then coal could\nalso be sold at its value, and no coal pit in\nBritain would be called uneconomic.\nIt is ironic that we have a butter mountain,\nand vast milk, grain, and wine surpluses in\nthe EEC because the Community practices\ngross interference in the market, although\nthe EEC was created in order to let the\nmarket operate freely. The marketplace\nremedies of lowering the price (within the\nCommunity) or closing the least economic\nfarms are not used: some of the surpluses are\nsold to Russia at a knock-down price.\nThe correct remedy when it comes to a valuable mineral resource, which can only be\nmined once, would be to work out all mines\nat whatever cost because, once closed, a pit\nbecomes unsafe to re-open, and so any\nresidual coal would be lost for ever. But the\ndictates of the marketplace are now followed\nand some pits are declared 'uneconomic'.\nWe should remind ourselves that had not\nOPEC forced up the price of oil in the 1970s, Friday 17 August 1984\nour North Sea oil would not now be ecu\nno mic. Until we learn to price fuels according\nto their value instead of the cost of getting\nthem, the marketplace is the wrong judge of\nfuel policies. Actually the nonsensical\nargument has gone one stage further: discussions have been started about opening an\nopen-cast mine, under private management,\nin the Forest of Dean, although it has been\ndeclared a conservation area and is one of\nour few remaining forests. The object would\nbe to obtain cheaper coal which could\ncompete in the market with oil as an energy\nsource. This would make the coal mountain\nan even more ridiculous aspect of our\ncivilisation.\nThe people mountain.\nThere comes a moment in the history of\nthe fossil fuel civilisation when it must\nconcern itself about posterity. For the last\n200 years industry and technology have\nvisibly and significantly improved the welfare\nof people, and it has depended absolutely on\nthe use of fossil fuel. We have behaved as if\nthe source of fuel were infinite; but it is very\nfinite, even in terms of human history which\nin turn is only a tiny bit of biological evolution.\nWe are now at the turning point, and the past\nis no longer the best guide to the future.\nThe excess of people has come about\nbecause all the constraints on increase have\nbeen removed as if they were bad because\nthey reduced the amount of human life. The\nfirst battle, for life, has been won; but the\nsecond, to control the amount of it so that it\nmay be fully enjoyed, is being lost.\nThe growth of population has reached a point at which we cannot care properly for\nthe children. Several countries have\npopulations half of which are under the age of\nsixteen. There is no hope for them of\nparticipating in the material and intellectual\nlife which we enjoy. Although the battle to\ncontrol the population explosion seems\ndesperate - without hope, it must be pursued\nbecause we must preserve pockets of human\nculture which can outlast the terrible\nvengeance of nature against our species. If\nwe save all the children we heighten the\npredicament. We do not know what future\nevents will do to them, but the cool\nextrapolation of numbers to 8 billion in 2025\nand 10 billion in 2050 is a condemnation to\nindescribable squalor and deprivation.\nBefore then social upheavals of a kind as\nyet unknown will result from the contrasts of\npoverty and wealth. The misery has already\nbegun; make no mistake!\nWhatever else we do, we should not\ndetermine our policy for the most basic\nresource of our civilization - fuel - on the basis\nof 'profit now', but that is what the governments of several wealthy countries are\nengaged in.\nRS Scorer is Emeritus Professor of\nTheoretical Mechanics in the Department of\nMathematics, Imperial College.\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CFEATURE: FEATURED\nImperial College is to have a new electronic telephone system to\nreplace both the present internal and external systems. The new\nexchange is presently being installed and should become operational on Saturday 1 September. The new system will offer a wide\nrange of facilities, many of which will be available to users by\nmeans of special codes.\nAt present the College has two entirely separate\ntelephone systems for internal and external calls.\nThe former uses an automatic exchange with\nextension-to-extension dialling for 2600 extensions, whilst the latter requires that one of the 1400\nextensions is manually connected to an external\nline by the operator each time a call is made.\nThis situation requires that each user has two\ntelephones, each with a different number. This\nmeans twice as many instruments and connecting\nlines to be maintained. The totally manual nature\nof the external exchange means that a large number\nof operators (up to ten) are required for busy\nperiods, whilst it is not possible to make external\ncalls at all when the switchboard is unmanned.\nIn addition both systems are old and increasingly\nprone to breakdowns. The internal system was\ninstalled 25 years ago and is obsolete so spare parts\nare very difficult to obtain. The external exchange\nwas bought second-hand 15 years ago\u2014it is\nbelieved the Science Museum are interested in\nhaving it (as an exhibit!) when the College has\nfinished with it.\nThe new exchange will utilize the existing wiring\nof the present internal exchange, reconnected to the\nnew equipment. The system, a Northern Telecoms\nSL1 exchange, is all-electronic. This means that the\nnetwork is controlled by a computer, rather than\ncircuit wiring as in a conventional exchange. The\nsystem's software controls the switching of calls\nand the various facilities which are available. The\nrange of facilities can be modified simply by\nchanging the software.\nThe Changeover\nAll the 2600 extensions on the existing internal\nsystem will be on the new system, unless the\ndepartment concerned has not asked for an\nextension to be retained. On the changeover day, 1\nSeptember, all telephones will have new numbers,\nwhich will be arranged in departmental groups.\nThis means that of the four figure number, the first\ntwo indicate the department whilst the last two will\nusually be consecutive with others in the same subgroup or section of the department. A new telephone directory will, of course, be issued before the\nchange of numbers takes place, as will new cardboard number discs for dial centres.\nAfter its introduction the new system will\noperate in parallel with the present external\nexchange for about two weeks. During this time it\nwill only be able to make internal calls. On the 15\nSeptember the old external switchboard will shutdown as the new system will become able to make\nexternal calls. This will complete the changeover to\na single-instrument system with extension-to-extension dialling and automatic access to external\nlines. Operators will only be required to answer and\ndirect incoming calls since external lines will be\navailable to authorized extensions by dialling a two-figure code.\nInitially the present internal instruments will still\nbe in place, but of the 1400 extensions which will be\nable to make external calls 1000 will soon be\nequipped with modern push-button Statesman\ninstruments. As a preparation for this some offices\nhave already had British Telecom plugs fitted so the\nnew instruments will simply be delivered and\nplugged in after the changeover. These will replace\nsome of the very old instruments on the present\ninternal system, and in due course the remaining\nmuseum-pieces will be replaced with newer dial\nphones.\nRestrictions on External Calls\nThere will be no restrictions on internal calls\u2014any\nextension can dial any other at any time. External\ncalls will, however, be strictly controlled. There will\nbe five categories of instrument (see table 1) each\nwith different access to external lines. In addition\nan extension may have time restrictions on the\nmaking of external calls on College business. The\ndifferent categories of extension do not indicate a physical difference\u2014the software controlling the\nsystem contains instructions about the type of call\neach extension can make, and the times it can make\nthem. The category of each extension is decided by\nthe department concerned, and can be changed if\nrequired simply by re-programming the system.\nOne other restriction will be on certain barred\nnumbers which it will not possible to dial on the\npublic exchange. These numbers are programmed\ninto the system and cover such things as recorded\ninformation services. Nor will it be possible to dial\n100 for the operator on the public exchange, since\nthis would allow calls not permitted by the College's restrictions to be placed through the operator. Directory enquiries will still be available,\nhowever.\nPersonal calls can be made by the user of any\nextension able to make external calls. A different\ntwo-figure code will be dialled, and each month a bill for every such extension will be produced by\nthe system and sent to the extension user. The\nrestrictions on calls will not apply to personal calls,\nsince the College will not be paying for them.\nIncoming Calls\nThese will be routed through the operator as at\npresent. Since the new switchboard will have only\nincoming calls to handle it will have only half as\nmany operator positions as the old one.\nIncoming external calls will be indicated by a different ringing tone to internal calls, so it will be\npossible to tell if your caller is in College or not. If\nthe extension requested by the incoming caller is\nbusy with an internal call a tone will sound to\ninform the user that an incoming call is waiting. He\ncan then speak to this call whilst holding the\nexisting call, and then switch between the two, by\nthe recall button. (Not all phones will befitted with\na recall button initially.)\nNearly all phones will be able to receive incoming\nexternal calls, even if they cannot make outgoing\nones. The only exceptions will be phones in 'public'\nplaces such as corridors, lecture theatres, etc.\nSafeguards against abuse\nThe new exchange, being a computer, offers\nextensive safeguards to prevent abuse of the\nsystem. Each month the head of each department\nor administrative section will be sent a statement\nwith the total amount spent on external calls by\neach extension in that department. Academic\ndepartments will be responsible for their own\nphone bills to encourage them to keep a close watch\nfor any abuse.\nIf the head of department suspects abuse of any\nextension he can ask the exchange supervisor for\nfull information on all calls dialled from it,\nincluding all numbers dialled, duration and cost.\nThis information is all stored by the exchange every\ntime a call is made but is not normally used, partly\nbecause of the enormous volume of such data. It is\nonly available to heads of department on request.\nTELEPHONES\n- the new system Pictured above: the new\nStatesman instrument.\nAbove right: one of the oldest\nphones still in use in the\nCollege.\nSpecial Deal\nUntil recently it was thought the College would\nhave to manage with its present telephone systems\nfor several more years due to financial stringency.\nThis was despite the urgency of the situation, with\nincreased unreliability as the struggle to keep the\nold equipment working intensified. A special deal\nwas negotiated with British Telecom, however, to\nsupply one of the latest state-of-the-art exchanges\non very favourable terms, at a cost of less than \u00a3 1 m. This has been possible because of the prestige\nthat BT attach to supplying the College's new\nsystem. It is expected that they will use the College\nas a showpiece to promote the system throughout\nthe world. This should have the additional benefit\nfrom the College's point of view in that BT should\nbe especially anxious to get it working properly. As\nPeter Burridge, the College's Telephone Engineer,\nadmits the system will be well tested at 1C \u2014no\ndoubt numerous bright-sparks will soon be\nattempting all sorts of new tricks with what is after\nall a computer with 2600 terminals. If it can survive\nand work well here it must surely be a world-beater!\nClass Restrictions\nUnrestricted\u2014can make local,\ntrunk and international calls.\nSemi-restricted\u2014-can make\nlocal and trunk calls only.\nSemi-restricted\u2014can make\nlocal calls only.\nRestricted\u2014cannot make any\noutgoing calls, but can receive\nincoming calls.\nE Fully restricted\u2014cannot make\noutgoing or receive incoming\nincoming calls\u2014for internal use\nonly.\nAll extensions except class E can receive\nany type of incoming calls, during the hours\nwhen the switchboard is manned.\nIn addition to the above restrictions there\nmay be time restrictions, eg calls may be\nbarred between 9:00am and 1:00pm, at the\ndiscretion of the department.\nTable 1\nSpecial Numbers\nEmergency 999\n(Fire, Police, Ambulance)\nHealth Service 3333\nGeneral College Information 4444\nTelephone Faults 5555\nMaintenance 6666\n(Normal Hours)\nMaintenance 7777\n(Outside normal hours)\nTelephone Information 3430\nNightline 6789\nFacilities available\nThe facilities available are of two types: those\nrequiring pre-arrangement with the telephone\nexchange; and those accessed by dialling special\ncodes. The codes for the latter type are listed in\nTable 2. Each facility available is described below.\nNote that the availability of some facilities will be\nrestricted.\nFeatures Requiring Pre-Arrangement\n1. Group Call Pick-Up\u2014This allows any user\nwithin a pre-arranged group of extensions to\nanswer a call to any other extension within the\ngroup, by dialling a code. This will be useful if\nseveral extensions are together in one large office.\n2. Call Pick-Up\u2014Certain authorized extensions\nwill be able to answer a call directed to any other\nextension which is ringing, by dialling a code followed by the extension number.\n3. Hunting\u2014If an extension within a pre-arranged\ngroup is engaged, any call to that extension is\nautomatically routed to the next free extension in\nthe group. Can be used to route calls to a deputy or\na secretary when the head of a section is busy.\n4. Call Forward\u2014No Answer\u2014Similar to hunting,\nbut operates if an extension is not answered within\na fixed time, when the call is transferred to a second\npre-arranged extension.\n5. Do Not Disturb\u2014The switchboard operator can\nmake an extension appear busy to incoming calls,\nwhilst calls can still be made from the extension.\nWill not be widely available!\n6. Intrusion\u2014Use of this code by specially\nauthorized extensions will enable them to intrude\non an established call. The system sounds a 'warn\ntone' to the parties in the established call. Use of\nthis facility will be very restricted!\nFeatures Accessed by Use of Codes\n1. Access to Other Systems\u2014Direct dialling to the\nSilwood Park and Southside/Linstead systems will\nstill be available, but different codes will be used.\nAccess will also be available to the College Travel\nAgents, but the direct line to Senate House will no\nlonger be available.\n2. Ring Back\u2014If a number rung is busy the caller\ncan, by dialling a code, request the system to complete the connection as soon as it becomes free,\nwhen both phones will ring simultaneously. This\ncan also be used if there is no reply to a call\u2014the\nsystem completes the connection as soon as the\ncalled extension is used and subsequently becomes\nfree (which indicates the user has returned to his\noffice). Such requests can be cancelled by use of a second code, and automatically lapse after eight\nhours.\n3. Short Codes\u2014These are lists of frequently\ndialled external numbers which are represented by\nthree figure codes published in the College telephone directory. To use one dial the facility code,\nfollowed by the short code. Users with secretarial\nfeature phones can have their own list of short\ncodes.\n4. Call Forward\u2014If a user will be away from their\noffice they can forward all calls to any other\nextension by dialling a code and the extension\nnumber. The request can be cancelled by a code\ndialled at the user's extension, or by a different code\nat the remote extension.\n5. Transfer, Enquiry, or Conference\u2014Whilst\nspeaking to a caller, on an internal or external call,\na user can by operating the recall button hold the\ncall and dial a third extension to transfer the call, to\nmake an enquiry or to set up a conference. It is\npossible to set up a conference between up to six\npeople, one of whom can be an external caller.\n6. Broker's Call\u2014Similar to Transfer, etc., but\nafter operating the recall button a code is dialled\nwhich prevents the call on hold hearing the conversation between the broker and the third extension.\nThe held call can be internal or external.\n7. Save\u2014Use of the Save code stores the last\nnumber dialled if an extension or external number\nis busy, or not answered (external calls only). The\nnumber is re-dialled by dialling the code again.\n8. Alarm Call\u2014By entering a code followed by a time in 24 hour clock a user will receive an alarm\ncall at the time specified.\nNotes:\n1. During the early part of next term demonstrations of the new system will be held. For students,\nthese will be at 12:00noon and 2:00pm on Monday\n15 to Wednesday 17 October in the Great Hall. A video describing the new system will be shown in\nthe Sherfield foyer after the changeover.\n2. If problems are experienced then the operator\ncan be contacted by dialling 0, or recalled during a call by using the recall button and 0. There will be a special number for enquiries about use of the telephone system, 3430.\nRecall buttons will already be fitted to all new\ninstruments issued and they will be fitted to existing\ninstruments in due course. Until one is fitted facilities requiring its use will not be available to that\nextension.\nFacility Code\nOperator 0\nRecall Operator RO\nExchange line(personal calls) 91 (or # where fitted)\nExchange line (College calls) 92 (or * where fitted)\nAccess to College Travel Agent's switchboard 93\nAccess to Southside/Linstead system 94 followed by staircase no.\nAccess to Silwood Park system 96 followed by Silwood ext no\nTransfer call, Enquiry call or Conference R. followed by ext. no.\nRing Back R11\nCancel Ring Back 21\nIndividual Short Code (feature phones only) 12, followed by code\nCommon Short Code 23, followed by code\nCall Pick-Up 13. followed by ext. no.\nGroup Call Pick-Up (in pre-arranged groups only).... 27\nCall Forward 14, followed by ext. no.\nCancel Call Forward R24\nCancel Call Forward from remote extension R25, followed by ext. no.\nBroker's Call R17, followed by ext. no\nSave Number R18\nAlarm Call 26, followed by time in 24hr clock\nR Recall Button\nNote: Where R appears, the facility shown will be available only to those phones with a Recall button fitted.\nTable 2\nFriday 17 August 1964\n\n"

    "content": "nm n Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nNew Hall for Imperial?\nPlans are being developed by the College to erect a new Hall\nof Residence in Princes Gardens. It is expected that the hall\nwill house about 150 students, mainly postgraduate, in high\nquality accommodation.\nThe College Secretary, John\nSmith, has announced that an\narchitect has been engaged to\ndraw up plans for a building on\ntop of the present Sports Centre.\nThe proposed building would be\nof the same depth and height as\nGarden Hall and be designed to\nbe in keeping with the existing\nbuildings around Princes\nGardens.\nIt has been suggested that the\nstudy-bedrooms should be of a higher quality than Southside\nrooms; they may contain toilets\nand showers en suite, or be\narranged on a flat let basis.\nThis new scheme replaces\nearlier plans by the Student\nResidence Committee to buy an\nexisting building. No suitable\npremises could be found that\nwere cheap enough to become\nself-financing after a reasonable\ntime. The proposed hall has the\nadvantage that it could be let\nduring the vacation under the\nSummer Accommodation Scheme, in order to raise revenue\nto offset the increased cost of\nbuilding over purchase of\nexisting premises.\nThe proposed site for the new hall.\nScience Parksplannedfor\nSouth Ken and Sil wood Imperial College is planning to develop research centres\ndesigned to facilitate the transfer of technology to industry.\nThe centres will be based at Silwood Park and South\nKensington, and will be known as 'Science Parks'.\nThe scheme consists of small\nunits of between 500 and 10,000\nsquare feet. These will be let to\nindustrial concerns who sponsor\nresearch at IC, and who wish to\nhave representatives on site.\nThe major part of the\ndevelopment will be at Silwood\nPark, the College's field station\nnear Ascot. There is a five acre\nsite at Silwood containing\nderelict war-time buildings which\nis being considered for the siting\nof units totalling 60,000 square\nfeet. The major attraction of the\nSilwood site is the nuclear reactor\nsituated there. The units will also\nbe of interest to those industrial\nconcerns involved in environmental research.\nThe other development will be\nat South Kensington in the\nvacant area adjacent to the Old\nChemistry building. Part of this\nwill house a small group from\nSinclair Research Ltd; the rest of\nthe building will comprise chiefly\nsmall research and development\nunits. The plans may result in the\nloss of about six car parking\nspaces. The lawn which is the site\nof the proposed extension to the\nNew Chemistry Building will not\nbe affected.\nThe College have engaged\nInvestors in Industry (31) pic to\nconduct a feasibility study for\nboth sites. If plans do go ahead\nthen it is expected that 31 will\nprovide the necessary capital\noutlay for the building work. The\nCollege will act as landlord, and\nwill collect rent from letting the\nunits.\nCollege Secretary John Smith\nsaid that it was unlikely that the\nscheme would raise a lot of\nmoney directly in the short term.\nIts advantage would be in making\nthe College more attractive to\nfirms sponsoring research.\nScience Parks already exist at a number of British Universities\nincluding Leeds, Hull, Bradford\nand, notably, Cambridge.\nNew chair\nin Nuclear\nEngineering\n\u2022 A new chair in Nuclear\nEngineering has been created in\nthe Chem Eng Department. The\nfirst holder of the chair will be\nProfessor Norman Franklin FRS\nOBE CBE who was head of the\nNational Nuclear Corporation\nuntil April.\nFranklin, 60, was a lecturer at\nthe University of Leeds until 1955\nwhen he joined the UK A EA, rising to the post of Managing\nDirector and Chief Executive in\n1971.\nThe new chair is being jointly .\nfunded by British Nuclear Fuels,\nUK A EA, and the CE GB. \u2022 Dr LS Kershenbaum has been\nappointed Senior Tutor for the\nCollege, in succession to Dr R Smith. He takes up his new post\nfor four years from October 1.\nFree! Friday 17 August 1984 No 679\n\n"

He played\nrugby football for the University\nof Oxford, and for Wales in 1938\nand 1939, always treasuring the\nmemory of his selection.\nAppointed to the Colonial\nAdministrative Service in\nTanganyika in 1940, as an\nAdministrative Officer, he\nquickly gained promotion, becoming Private Secretary to a series of Governors from 1943 to\n1947. From 1947 to 1949 he was\nseconded to the Colonial Office\nas one of the most able\nadministrative officers of his year\nand in 1958 and 1959 was\nAssistant Special Representative\nfor Tanganyika at the Trusteeship Council of the\nUnited Nations. In 1959 he was\nmade Minister for Constitutional\nAffairs in Tanganyika, later\ntaking over the portfolio for\nSecurity and Immigration at a time of great political ferment\nand popular agitation, while\nbeing at the same time\nresponsible for the planning of a major re-organisation and\nexpansion of the Police Force\nwhich was then about to be\nintroduced. He was Minister for\nInformation Services until the\ndate of self-government on 1 May\n1961, having for some months in\n1960 been Acting Chief Secretary. His record was\ndistinguished and there was no\nassignment in which he was not\noutstandingly successful. He was\nmade an OBE in 1957 for his\nwork in the Arusha district. In\n1961 he was awarded the\nMedaille de la Belgique\nReconnaissante for services to\nBelgian refugees and in the same\nyear he was made CMG for his\nservices as a Minister.\nHis second career in administration followed his\nretirement from Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service when in\n1962 he was appointed, from a large field of candidates, to the\npost of Secretary of the College\nand Clerk to the Governors of\nthe Imperial College of Science\nand Technology. It was a time of\nmajor expansion and reconstruction at the College taking\nplace under the leadership of the\nRector, Sir Patrick Linstead.\nOnly the Blackett Laboratory\nhad been completed and all but\none of the other buildings on the\nsite were under construction or\nadaptation under the \"Jubilee\nScheme\". Mickey Davies adapted quickly to the new\nchallenge, moulding a committee\nstructure and administrative\nmachinery to ensure effective\nconsultation, communication\nand control in appropriate areas.\nHe steered the Administration\nthrough the further expansion of\nthe \"post-Robbins\" period in the\nmid-sixties, through a time of\nstudent pressure for greater\nparticipation in decision-making\nprocesses which marked the late\n60s and early 70s during the\nRectorship of Lord Penney, and\nsubsequently, until his decision\nto retire in June 1979, serving the\npresent Rector, Lord Flowers. A man of drive and dynamism,\nanalytical ability, conscientiousness and good humour, he\nplayed a pivotal role in the\ndevelopment of the College,\nwhile still devoting a full part of\nhimself to his family, his friends\nand his hobbies. He was awarded\nHonorary Fellowship in 1979.\nShortly before his departure\nfrom the College he delivered a valedictory lecture which he\nclosed by quoting from WH Auden: \"When Ifind myself in the\ncompany of scientists Ifeel like a shabby curate who has strayed\nby mistake into a drawing room\nfull of dukes.\" He need never\nhave felt ashamed; many\nscientists and engineers who\nhave been or are associated with\nImperial College will regret the\npassing of Mickey Davies and\nacknowledge their immense debt\nto him as will the many others of\nhis former friends, colleagues,\nand acquaintances.\nHe leaves a widow, Elizabeth,\nand three children, Jennifer,\nPhilip, and Peter.\nFELIX Friday 17 August 1984\n\n"

    "content": "E REVIEWS; CINEMA\nAllen a schmuck\nIn Broadway Danny Rose (PG)\nWoody Allen plays a theatrical\nagent who gives a lot of advice.\nOne piece he leaves out is that\nfamiliarity breeds contempt and\nAllen is slowly but surely\napproaching the point where the\ntwo merge. Danny Rose is not a bad film, just it has been released\nrather abruptly after the overrated Zelig and is similarly short.\nAgain Allen casts Mia Farrow\nopposite him but whereas she has\ntransformed brilliantly from the\nerudite physician of Zelig to play\nTina, a restless peroxide moll,\nAllen is basically playing the\nsame character (schmuck) again.\nHis megalomaniac approach\nto film-making\u2014he writes,\ndirects and has most of the\nlines\u2014is such that he neglects\nsuch essentials as developing the\nsupporting cast and plot. The\nscreen-play has been noticeably\nstretched, even at a meagre 85\nminutes.\nAllen meets Farrow through\nhis protege, lugubrious cabaret\nstar Lou Canova (also Farrow's lover\u2014a fine cameo by Nick\nApollo Forte) and a misunderstanding involving these three,\nCanova's wife and another of\nTina's men, a poet ma fios a leads\nto much merriment and mayhem.\nThe two stars are being pursued\nby two hit-men wielding baseball\nbats (mindless rather than\nmenacing) whilst Lou drinks\nhimself silly prior to a showcase\ngig at the Waldorf before\nrepresent a ties of national\ntelevision and a Las Vegas night\nspot.\nDespite all this, beautiful black\nand white photography, a novel\nstructure (a group of comics\ntelling Danny Rose stories),\nRose's exotic roster of acts and\nthe magnificent Mia Farrow, the\nfilm still failed to move this\nwriter\u2014strange, the couple\nbeside me laughed like drains.\nMia Farrow as Tina Vitale the\nwidow of a bumped off gangster in\nthe new comedy, 'Broadway\nDanny Rose'.\nMan has long been fascinated with the creation of automata that\nmimic the form and actions of our species. A new exhibition at the\nVictoria and Albert Museum's Boilerhouse Project attempts to cast a historical and cultural perspective against the forthcoming era of\nautomation\u2014dispelling commonly held myths by showing a range of\nmaterial from science fiction film clips to a modern industrial robot.\nThe star of the show is probably a mechanical android made by\nMcAndroids of Brixton, a partly mobile tailors dummy that shows\nhow far we have to go to achieve anything near human form or\nmovement for our machines. The exhibition is small and a little short\non content, but could make an interesting distraction if you care to\nwander in from Exhibition Road one afternoon. Robots runs until 25\nOctober.\nMA Smith\nRECORDS\nSummer Singles\nApril Showers\u2014Abandon\nShip\nWith a light \"Everything But\nThe Girl\" feel, Beatrice Colin,\nand Jonathan Bernstein release their first single on\nChrysalis, and quite an\nachievement it is too.' Abandon Ship' has an\nunobtrusive but memorable\nmelody, and words that\nactually mean something! It\neven has a great B side 'Every\nTime We Say Goodbye'. What\nmore could it need to be\nsuccessful\u2014a ban from Mike\nRead perhaps?\nTracey Ullman\u2014Sunglasses\nI guess it must be difficult to\nfind songs for a voice that can\nonly manage 3 notes, and it\nlooks like they've run out right\nnow. Although a certain chart\nsuccess, with probably a very\ngood (and very expensive)\nvideo, this is really dreadful.\nBring back the Wombles!\nAdventures\u2014Another Silent\nDay\nThis is more like it. An intriguing double vocal from\nTerry Sharpe& Eileen Gribben, backed by a gospel\nchoir, gives it a feel quite\nunlike anything I 've ever\nheard. And yet, when I play it,\nmy feet start tapping, and I end up whistling the tune all\nday. The best debut single I 've\nheard in a long time. Buy it!\nThe Colour Field\u2014Take\nAs a longtime fan of the\nSpecials and Funboy 3, I always look forward to Terry\nHall's singles, but this second\nsingle from his new band, is\nalmost as disappointing asthe\nfirst ( The Colour fi eid'). Despite a clever' hook' melody, and very deep,\npseudo Paul Welle/ lyrics, the\nsingle cannot be considered\nin the same league as songs\nlike' Ghost Town' or 'Lunatics'. The B side is the\nclassic 'Windmills of Your\nMind', reworked as a chart of\nde spa ration, which works out\nreally well\u2014but who buys a single for aB side?\nSpandau Ballet \u2014 I 'll Fly\nFor You\nFrom the latest hit album\n' Parade', this has been considerably remixed, and the\n12' at least, has 2 very different\nversions. The vocal 'AA' side\nhas the distinctive Spandau\nFeel, but the 'A' side Glide\nVersion is a real mood piece,\nwith loads of strings, and\nwhispered vocals. Whatever\nyour opinion of the Spandaus,\n'Parade' is a classic album,\nand this, one of the best tracks\nfrom it. But then, it's not 'hip\nto enjoy trendy bands like this, so you'll probably put it down\nanyway.\n8 Friday 17 August 1984 FELIX\n\n"
