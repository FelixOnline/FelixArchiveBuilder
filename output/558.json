    "content": "Dear Colin\nInspired by the pool of intelligence\nthat wrote last week's letter on the\na) hardness of concrete\nb) virtues of grass\nc) disgusting inaccuracies\nflaunted by Mr O 'Boyle.\nI have decided to add my piece\nto the ever increasing anti-concrete/\npro-grass/Beit Quad-sectors plea.\nFirstly, I am aware that the first\naim of the designers was not that\nof beauty to Imperial College\nstudents. No: they had a larger\nscale of things in mind. They\nthought (honest, they did) only to\nmake it a lovely sight from the sky.\nYou know, the beautiful radial\nspokes patterned out in stabs and\nthe intrinsic beauty of the barbeque\npits. I really believe they were\nmerely thinking of the air passengers\nstuck over London with absolutely\nnothing to do except stare with\nrapture at our newly constructed\nmarvel.\nI feel this well meaning scheme\nhas been grossly slandered. How\ncould we fall and break our arms\non grass? As Messrs Attenborough,\nBellamy, Attenborough and Evans\nstated grass has soothing properties.\nHowever the wisdom of the design\nis obvious \u2014 who likes being\nsoothed? Everyone likes to wake\nup in the morning, jump out of\nbed, breath in fresh air and get\nthreatened by a concrete slab.\nGolly, who p pee, gosh, goodness\nis it not wonderful to know that all\nthe decisions made here have been\nbased totally on concern for the\ncitizens of College, nay, not\nCollege, for England, nay not\nEngland but the world!!!\nYours with a sincere feeling of\nsafety in the hands of such decisions,\nPerry, I even sing about it, Como\nKevin, I always play on it, Keegan\nMichael, I wish it was there, Brown\n(Maths 2)\nDear Sir\nWith reference to the letter on\nsecurity which appeared in FELIX,\nmay I throw more light on the\nsubject of which Messrs Clark and\nStevens should make themselves\naware.\nBack doors in many cases are\nleft open by students and staff who\nare too idle to use main entrances\nafter the said doors are locked. At\nPhysics, it is usually people from\nHuxley who come to the main\nentrance to gain easy access to Beit\nHall, and once opened these doors\nmust be locked again by key and\nbearing in mind the fact that only\none security guard operates at\nweekends, the building could, and\nis sometimes, open for an hour or\nso at a time whilst the guard is\ndoing his rounds. Situations like\nthis occur in most buildings, and yet\nthe College will be cutting the\nnumbers of guards and messengers.\nI would now like to talk about\nSouthside security having three\nyears experience in that department\non night security.\nWho breaks the glass in doors\nand windows to allow access to the\nintruder? Usually drunken students.\nI cannot count the number of\ntimes the glass in the entrance\ndoors to Keogh Hall have been\nsmashed during the night.\nThe entrance door to Stan's Bar\n(which I think should be done away\nwith) is often latched back by\nstudents on leaving, after it has\nbeen secured. I once put it to Mr\nMellows and the late Mr Dawson\nthat instead of students having\naccess keys to Keogh-Selkirk and\nFalmouth-Tizard entrances everybody at night uses the main entrance\nand if necessary have their passes\nchecked. (This would possibly have\neliminated the rape, and would\ncertainly help to keep out intruders.)\nIt would also prevent students from\nwedging the doors open to allow late\nfriends to gain entry to parties, etc\nand sleeping in the baths.\nI have on numerous occasions\nfound it necessary to evict people\n(strangers) from the Union Room\nabove the Radio Room after they\nhave been given a key to sleep\nrough. After l our years on night\nsecurity I would say that most of the\nnon-security is caused by lack of\ncooperation from students and staff,\nand a severe lack of manpower.\nYours\nF Adamson\nMessenger Bio/Chem\nPS: If you would care for a wider view\non College security come and see\nme.\nGoodTime Had By All At FELIX Rally\nThe Annual FELIX Motor Rally\ntook place on Sunday15 th June. The event was won by a team from City and Guilds College Union with nine y four\npoints. The team members were: H Cur wen, J Armitage,\nB Stevenson and S Ridd. An Imperial College Union Executive team was second with s event two points and a team\nfrom the Royal College of\nScience Union third with sixty-five points.\nThe event consisted of three\nsections. Firstly, each team had to collect twenty items of\ntreasure. These items ranged\nfrom a kettle to a photograph\nof Ian Botham to a fifty pence\npostal order made payable to\nIC Charity Rag. The organiser\nof. the event was most d is appointed to find that no team\nhanded in a certain item \u2014 a copy of the1980' Mayfair' calendar!\nLondon. Each team were given\nthe location of the answer and\nthe appropriate clue. The answers ranged from eighteen\ninch high letters on the side of\na pub wall ( Fine Beers and Spirits), which three crews spotted, to the tiny maker's name of a type of socket on a drainpipe in the City. Surprisingly, no teams spotted that\none!\nThe second section consisted The final part of the rally was\nof a series of clues around a series of clues taken from\nengraving and plaques located\naround College. The teams were\nnot told the locations of the\nanswers \u2014 they had to find\nthem. One of the clues referred\nto the plaque under the Union Archway only six feet from the\nFELIX Office door \u2014 only half\nthe teams spotted the answer!\nGenerally, a good day was\nhad by all who competed and\nfinally, congratulations must go\nto the winning team from City\nand Guilds Union.\nMartin Watson\nPINBALL \u2014 Past Feelings on this\n'sex machine'\nThis letter was first printed in FEUX on 28th February 1975.\nDear Sir\nDuring the one and a half years that I have\nbeen at this college I have noted with interest\nthe strange and ostensibly emotional involvement many male students have with Mr\nGottleib's game of pinball. I would like\ntherefore with your leave, to examine this\nphenomenon using the much ridiculed and\nmaligned, though basically correct, techniques\nand theories of psycho-analysis developed by\nJung, Freud and the more obscure T Endur.\nIt does not require very deep analysis to\nexpose the motivation of this 'game'. The\npinball machine is merely an extension of the\nphallus, whilst the operation of the flippers\n(nipples?) with passionately convulsive pelvic\nthrusts is a sub-conscious sexual intercourse.\nAttaining an orgasm is thinly disguised as the\n'replay'; the 'tilt' when exuberant thrusting has\naffected the machine is the selfish premature\nejaculation due to insufficient self control. The\ncaco pha nous bells and buzzers and flashing\nlights of the submissive; reclining machine all\nserve to hold reserved for the beauty of the\nfemale body. Pinball has become a primitive\nsex substitute. How often do you see women\n'playing the silver ball' and have your readers\nnever been struck by the incongruity of this\nsight?\nI think that my observations will make clear\nto many of your more sensitive readers the truly\nprimitive nature of the lusts and desires of\nmany students at our illustrious college. The\npromulgation of the image of the Imperial\nstudent as a beer drinking, pinball playing,\nsuper virile male and the competition between\nrival factions within the college for supremacy I find pitiful l and nauseous. I hope that my\nanalysis, the truth of which cannot be doubted,\nwill serve to lead those who are penitent\ntowards the path of truth, beauty and virtue.\nFloreat Collegium!\nAnnabel Listz\nPINBALL\nUPDATED\nPinbal) originated in the days of the\nancient Greeks who used to play a game\nwith. rocks and holes on a hillside. Through the ages, the ancient game has\ncaptivated a wide variety of participants\nfrom seventeenth century schoolboys to\nthe members of the court of Louis XIV. In 1836 Charles Dickens referred to a contemporary version of the game in the\n' Pickwick Paper s'.He described the Peacock Tavern where me be rs of the Pickwick Club \"beguiled their time chiefly\nwith such amusements as the Peacock\noffered, which was limited to a bagatelle\nboard on the first floor\".\nBagatelle remained a fairly popular pastime which still survives today. However, in the late 1920s the introduction of a coin chute heralded the\nbeginning of a new era and started a new\nindustry.\n(continued on back page)\n2\n\n"

The J CR DOES NOT belong to the Union during the summer vacations. It is hired out to people by College and\n\"\u2022he Union gets two-thirds of the revenue. So don't get unduly\nperturbed when you find the J CR being used by conference\ndelegates while you may think they are taking over facilities which\nfirst and foremost belong to y cJ b rightfully. During the summer\nvacations they don't.So please bear these facts in mind as\narguments such as the ones pointed .to above have in the past led\nto a reduction in the revenue to the Union from hiring out the\nJC R.M Phil/PhD Supervision\nIn the last instalment of PG Tips you were informed about what\nthe Graduate Studies Committee was doing about ensuring proper supervision of research students. Well the efforts have\nproved to be fairly successful and as of now at least eighteen\ndepartments in the College either already have or have agreed to\ntake one or more of the following steps to ensure the welfare of\nresearch students: (i) appointing aPG staff/student committee; (ii)\nappointing aPG tutor;( iii) appointing an' advisor' to each research student in addition to his/her supervisor; (iv) appointing\na thesis committee to regular is e transfer from M Phil to PhD;( v) limiting the number of students under one supervisor at any one\ntime, and( vi) having an annual review of the research students in\nthe department.\nMSc Nuclear Fuel Technology\nYou would perhaps remember that the safe y aspects of this\ncourse were discussed in these columns before. But more serious\nthan that is the fact that the College has no policy regarding\nrestricting admission of students from countries that have not\nsigned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to this course. This I think is a rather pathetic situation. Considering that it is very\ndebatable as to which aspects of nuclear technology can be used\nfor civil purposes and which for military, it would only seem\nprudent to take adequate policy measures to restrict admission to\nthis course.\nOver And Out\nIn this last instalment of PG Tips I would like to mention the\nnames of those who devoted a considerable amount of their time\nto the activities of the PG Group.

The motion disallowing any lending of boats to\nS As was proposed by Mary Attenborough\n(Rep for K Pratt) and was spoken to by\nDare Afolabi (Rep for Dave Lyons). E Lindsay( speaking for herself) spoke against the motion. Another round of\nspeeches was called for and D Everett\n(Rep for F Sinclair) further enlarged the\ncase and T Hillyer (Rep for J Passmore)\nagainst. Dare summed up and a vote was\ntaken on the motion, which was carried.\nAt this point and during the subsequent\nhour many of the representatives then\ndeparted. There by leaving those they claimed to represent, unrepresented, and those who cared about democratic discussion of student affairs to carry on for a further five hours.\nNext up came a discussion on College\nsecurity; this reared its head again in motion s.IC Radio outlets in Evelyn Gardens was then discussed, J Armitage\nopposing this increased amenity on grounds that students might not be able\nto use the on-off switch. However, despite\na spirited attempt to vote IC Radio out of\nexistence, a decision to push for outlets in\nthe Gardens was made.\nMalcolm then went on to present a large portion of his Annual Report verbally and the meeting managed to remain in open session even though L ST was mentioned. The Annual Reports were\naccepted in a pretty passive way.\nThe ICU Reps on the College com-mitte es were then elected/ chosen/ coerced. Governing Body and F&E Reps\nbeing voted by STV giving Wo d gera chance to show his credentials as a vote\ncounter extra ordinaire, John Passmore,\nRae Snee and Bob Bradley (next year's ICU A AO) eventually winning. Just before a recess was taken the Hon Sen Treasurer, Dr Ken Weale, was presented\nwith an engraved tankard to commemorate\nhis retiring as College Tutor. The President\npointed out that Ken has been Union Treasurer for twenty-five years and he\nhoped that he would continue for a lot\nlonger. Council then gave Ken a standing\novation.\nAfter a break of three-quarters of an hour, which included the sampling of\nBreakspear es and plastic bread, the meeting returned to order and started to\ndebate the many motions that had been\nsubmitted: day g lo paper, mileage rates,\nSouthside Residents on the Mews Residence Committee and P WP were discussed. However, the most discussion\ncame on College Security, the Nuclear\nTechnology Course and IC Radio in the\nbar.\nThe meeting voted on quite a strong\npolicy calling for tighter security.

They\nprovided a few, much needed minutes of\npleasure to anyone who had time to kill\nor who was looking for some new form of\ndiversion in the depressing times that\nprevailed at the start of the pinball era.\nMany students at Imperial College are\nattracted to the brightly lit machines in\nthe halls of residence and Union Building.\nListening to players who are able to talk\nabout how they feel about pinball can give\nan insight into its strange appeal.\nRoger, a young hot blooded student,\nwho has been playing the game since his\nearly days as a student says: \"Obviously\nall the aggression you put into a game\nmust have some cathartic effect if you\nneed to get rid of aggression. But it's a bit\ndouble-sided in releasing frustration. I mean, if you want to get rid of frustrations\nyou've faced with the problems that you\nmight just run up a series of bad games\nand that in itself will produce other\nfrustrations.\n\"So you're balancing between frustration\nand satisfaction and maybe this delicate\nbalance produces the urge to keep trying.\nWhen asked how good he was at it,\nRoger replied: \"I wouldn't say I was a particularly good player, but that's6 ne of\nthe great things about pinball. You don't necessarily have to be all that good to\nenjoy the game because you're learning\nall the time. The more you pl hy the better\nyou get as long as you're willing to let\nyourself get involved.\"\nMike, a student who regularly plays\npinball said: \"It's a special form of\nsatisfaction. Not a compensation for any\nlack of achievement in your day to day\nlife. I get a lot of satisfaction from\nstudying during the day but I still like to\ncome along here afterwards.\n\"Pinball provides a little bit of extra\nexcitement. It's a self-imposed challenge.\nNobody forces you to play. There's no\npunishment for failure and there's no\nthreat involved. The only contest is\nbetween you and the machine.\n\"It's a simple diversion, a compact do-it-yourself entertainment kit. A mechanical\nform of solitaire. You challenge the\nmachine on strictly defined terms which\nreally give the machine the upper hand.\nPush it around too much and it will tilt\nand you lose your score. There's no way\nyou can penal is e the machine \u2014 except\nby beating it. But even then all you get\nout of that is a replay \u2014 just another\nchance to enter the one-sided contract.\n\"But naturally you're only .too happy to\ntake on the challenge again. If the\nmachine beats you after that you don't mind too much because you know you've\nhad your share of success.\"\nTom, a computer scientist, said that he\nsees his battle with pinball as a form of\nprotest.\n\"Machines and computers control so\nmuch of our everyday lives and there's not much you can do about it. So it's nice\nto meet a machine you can fight.\n\"There's normally no way you can get\nyour own back on other machines and\ncomputers. Sure, you can kick them and\nshout at them, but that only increases\nyour frustration. With pinball you get a chance to beat a machine on its own\nterms.\n\"There's a lot of skill involved. It's you\nagainst the machine. Your reflexes,\nknowledge, assessment and timing against\nthe machine's efforts to get that ball out\nof play. And getting that ball out of play\nis the only way a machine can beat you.\n\"In a game lasting only three or four\nminutes, a player can run the whole\ngamut of emotions: the joy of a superbly\ntimed skill shot; intensifying excitement as\na bonus builds; suspense as a ball hovers\ngently, trembling on the lip of a high-score\nroll over; fear as the ball rockets swiftly\ntowards the flipper gap; panic as the ball\nscreams out of the firing chute, straight\ndown the playfield and out of play without\nscoring; love as luck plays her part and\nguides ball after ball away from the exit\nlane and down the run-on track to the\nflippers; despair as luck deserts the players\nand lets the ball spill from the run-on\ntrack's rim down the exit lane; hope as\nju bil i ation at the hard crack of the replay\nfrustration and dejection as the machine\ntilts . . . all this compressed into less\nthan five minutes! If a film director could\ninspire half those response from an\naudience in an hour and a half he'd be\nlauded as a genius \u2014 yet you can find it\nall in Pinball.\"\nEDITORIAL\nThe speed of Shakuntala's multiplication will be recorded in the Guinness\nBook of Records. Why don't we try to break more records next term at IC?\nHow about a team attempting to break some of the more obscure records for\nRAG.... Talking of RAG we have raised \u00a320,000\nMartin Watson did a grand job with the FELIX Rally, last Sunday, despite\nthe National Front arranging a Rally outside RS M! which resulted in all parked\ncars being towed away from Prince Consort Road. Thank-you to Tim, Dave,\nIan, Maz and also to Give Dewey for being a guest paste up artist this week.\nIf you'd like to have your copies of this year's FELIX bound then bring a set\ninto the office ASAP,( by next Friday).\nJust before I say Cheers! for the last time I 've got space to include some of\nthe highlights from my annual report to Council.\nMy first issue of FELIX was published on Friday 10th August 1979. This\nedition and the next eight were published while I was Acting Editor of\nFELIX. Three issues were published during the summer vacation for the\nPost Grads. These concentrated on the High Court injunction served by\nJohn Shuttleworth, but also included articles describing the redevelopment\nof Beit Quad and several film reviews.\nThe Freshers' FELIX was hurriedly put together a week before term\nstarted because the result of the High Court case was only known a week\nbefore the start of term. There had been obvious problems concerning the\ncourt case and resignation of a member of the permanent staff.\nFELIX has encouraged advertisers by inserting details of advertising\nrates in the major directories. Phone calls to past advertisers have also\nhelped to make 1979/80 a good year for revenue.\nIn the autumn term of 1979 the size of FELIX on average twenty pages\nper week. Many students helped collate and fold FELIX and I was pleased\nto have the support of the C CU publicity officers in being able to include\nregular comprehensive articles on Guilds, Mines and RCS. The ICU Exec\nalso provided articles; some serious, some amusing.\nThe letters page during the autumn term was full of controversy. Frank\nJames caused much correspondence by wr i ring that 'anti-intellectuals take\ncharge of the CCUs and thus perpetrate their own kinds of beer-swilling\nlout'. The Occupation of the Senior Dining Room on Ocotber 16th caused\nmuch comment and several other topics including: abortion, lack of photo\ncredits, policy passed at ICU UGMs all helped to increase the size of the\nFELIX letters' page. Some weeks three pages of FELIX were devoted to\nletters.\nThe spring term began with IC ladies rugby team getting extensive\ncoverage in the national press. FELIX were the first to realise the\njournalistic potential of the ladies, but I regret that the coverage in the\nExpress and Sunday People was bad publicity for the team and IC.\nOn February 1st FELIX was able to photograph panellist s attending IC\nfor the BBC Radio Quiz and by the end of the recording we were able to\npresent Barry Took with a finished copy of FELIX. This demonstrates our\naim to be as up-to-date as possible with news coverage in FELIX. However,\nthis has meant that the printer, Ian Morse, has had to work\nlate on Thursday nights. News coverage was helped by the co-operation\nwith the IC Radio News Dept. FELIX gave news copy to IC Radio for\ntheir bulletins and ICRN helped FELIX with its news coverage.\nOn 19th February I was involved in an accident while running to take\nphotographs of a 'bank raid' at the College bank. During my two week\nstay in hospital, Roger Stotesbury became Acting Editor of FELIX. He was\nambitious and produced three good issues of FELIX. I was pleased to hear\nthat many students helped Roger during this period.\nThe summer term, far from being uneventful has produced some of the\nmajor stories to affect IC this year. The siege of the Iranian Embassy and\nthe demonstrations by IC students caused many letters to be written to\nFELIX.\nOn Friday 13th June FELIX published a photographic review of the year\ncontaining over sixty photographs.\nSummary\nThis year has seen several new ideas including the questionnaire, a greater\nemphasis on photographs, the start of a regular section on IC Radio.\nMany first year students have worked on the paper and hopefully\neveryone has gained from getting involved in FELIX.\nThere have been many problems. I wish that I had had more time for\npreparation, but taking over in the summer vacation meant that I had to\nlearn the job as I went through the year. I would like to thank everyone,\nfor their help especially since my accident in February.\nGood luck to Steve Marshall \u2014 it's a hard job \u2014 there's nothing like\nbeing Editor of FELIX. _ A I MID Cheers' COLIN PALMER c ne ers.

The captain of the\nday was Andy Harris who duly lost the\ntoss, but luck was with IC as the\nopposition put IC in to bat first.\nKenrick and Turner opened. Kenrick\ntaking his first and last strike giving\ncatching practice to square leg off the\nfirst ball of the day. Harris came in and\nmade 27 before edging a catch to the\nkeeper. Scoring was slow due to\nArthur not being able to find-his lawn\nmower, and boundaries were hard to\nget. With only forty minutes to tea and\nthe score on 74, Turner was out for 33\nattempting to hit a ball onto the M4. He\nmissed. From a position of 74 for 2\nwickets fell fast. At 92 for 7, Morton,\nwho had been dragged out of a meeting was sent in to hit out and to\nget 150 runs on the board by tea but\nthe booze at the meeting must have\ngone to his head; the first ball was\nmissed (perhaps the ball was difficult\nto see through the haze of alcoholic\nfumes) and the second he was out\ncaught. A useful 17 not out by Mitchell\ngave IC a final score of 119 before\nthe last wicket went down in the last\nover before tea.\nKenton Traders made an auspicious\nstart to their innings. IC's bowling\nstrength, in the form of Bob Dean,\nlumbered out of the long grass to let\nhis first ball go. The outside edge was\nstruck and Harris made a superb catch\nat second slip. Dean's second ball was\nsimilar to his first, the batsman played\nthe same stroke and Harris made an\nidentical catch. At this point the\nremaining nine fielders wanted to\nknow whether they were required or\ncould they go to the bar and watch\nDean and Harris finish the game!\nIt was not that simple. Dean took\nanother two wickets in his fourth over\nand another in his fifth when the score\nstood at 19 for 5. The Traders then\nmade a recovery to 102 for 8 and were\nwell on their way to winning the match\nwith one batsman scoring fast but\nMorton was to redeem himself by\nunsuspecting ly throwing down the\nwicket at the bowlers' end when the\nbatsman was just ambling to complete\nwhat should have been an easy run.\nWith only one over to go before the\nclose of play the Traders defended .\ntheir remaining wicket solidly to make\nsure of a certain draw. With fielders\nclustered all round the bat the last ball\nof the day was bowled by Silva; the\nbatsman gave the catch IC so badly\nneeded and Fifield, looking death in\nthe face had he dropped it, held on. A match which could have been lost,\ndrawn or even tied was won on the\nlast ball. Who said cricket was a boring game?\nTeam: M Kenrick, P Turner, A Harris\n(capt), P Silva, R Fifield, A Hunter, P Hewkin, T Mitchell, N Morton, G Brereton, R Dean.\nWATER POLO\nOn Tuesday 10th, IC had their last\ngame of the season against Penguin.\nExams badly affected team selection\nand we only managed to get seven\nplayers in the pool and no substitutes.\nCliff Spooner opened the score for\nIC with a clever shot, positioned in\nfront of the goal. Penguin were\nplaying very aggressively and their\nmarking was rough and rather dirty,\nso they managed to score three goals\nIn succession and took the lead. Andy\nSmith scored our second goal, after\nreceiving the ball from Dimitri Papaconstantinou, to make the score 3-2 to\nthem at the end of the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter Cliff Spooner\nplayed at the goal and our performance\nimproved markedly. Pat Porter and\nNick Last tightened their marking in\ndefence and they did not let Penguin\nscore again. After a goalless second\nquarter, we equalise d at the end of the\nthird quarter with a shot from Phil\nMills, despite their continuous dirty\nmarking, which resulted in five of\nthem being sent off during the game.\nSteve Taylor organised our game in\nmid pool and we scored two more\ngoals in the fourth quarter, with Phil\nMills and Andy Smith. The final score\nwas 5-3 to IC.\nThis game was for the fourth division\nof the Middlesex League. We have\nwon all the matches this year and,\nwith two more matches to be played in\nOctober, it is more than certain that\nwe will be promoted to the third\ndivision next year. Every player of the\nWater Polo Club should be congratulated for this remarkable achievement.\nTeam: Steve Taylor, Cliff Spooner,\nPat Porter, Andy Smith, Phil Mills,\nNick Last, Dimitri Papaconstantinou.\nCheers!\nDimitri\nREVIEW HH HH HI FAME (AA, Alan Parker)\nFollowing the enormous success attained by Midnight Express, director\nAlan Parker has chosen a rather unusual subject for this, his third film\nproject. Fame is a musical drama set in New York's High School For The\nPerforming Arts \u2014 a state school which gives needy children the chance\nof going to a sort of stage school. Here they learn dance, drama and\nmusic as well as the normal school subjects.\nThe dramatic al content is basically designed to show the realities of\nsuccess and failure, tracking the development of eight main characters\nduring their time at the school. Comedy and music are contrasted with\nthe tragedies of life in New York, as well as the risks of being a performer.\nThe film is split into sections, ranging from the auditions to their\neventual graduation. Starting at a lively, happy pace a noticeable change\noccurs midway through the film as tragedy and suffering start to play a large role as they did in \"Express\". This is not necessarily a bad thing, but\nI personally found the ecstatic jamming in the school cafe far more\nenjoyable than the latter scenes. The music is very enjoyable too \u2014\nespecially the electronic creations of Bruno, a young man who thinks he\ncan replace the music teacher's orchestra with banks of organs and\nsynthesisers.\nThe various developments in the plot are expressed through a sequential look at the eight characters. This immediately leaves gaps and\nyou may find that particular characters receive inadequate time.\nUnfortunate as this may be, the switching from one person to another\nmaintains the sort of pace which is necessary for a film lasting over two\nhours. The climax is a graduation ceremony which ends very abruptly and\nleft me wondering what happened to the various people in the end \u2014 did\nthey make it or not? Did they capture the elusive \"fame\" that they\nsought? 1 don't think that even a follow-up could explain.\nDirector Alan Parker attended the screening, which was especially\ndesigned for students. He was faced with the ordeal of a question and\nanswer session afterwards, but managed very well to brush off a bar age of\n\"pseudo\" questions, mainly from hypersensitive art students. Money, he\nadmitted, was the primary reason for the project, but this also meant that\nthe film should be broadly entertaining. 1 think he succeeds admirably and\nmanages to provide a fascinating insight into an unusual subject.\nMy advice is to see the film if you are at all interested in a piece of well\npresented entertainment. Don't leave it too late, however as it is really a period piece and will not mean very much when the mood is different\nFame opens on July 24th at the Empire, Leicester Square.\nFilms to look out for over the summer: at the end of the month\nNijinsky will be released as well as Romero's Zombies ( a real sick ie). In\nJuly The Black Stallion reaches our shores, after making a great impact\nin America. Clint Eastwood appears in Bronco Billy and Allan Carr's Can't Stop The Music (with the awful Village People) will no doubt\ncrash into our lives. A new Neil Simon, Chapter Two, should soon\narrive as well as Kung Fu in 3-D with Dynasty. I shall be awaiting a date\nfor Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which stars Jack Nicholson and\nshould be a real storm er. Have a good summer.\nMark Smith\nACCOMMODATION The Welfare Centre has just\nreceived details of a number\nof inexpensive fiats for\nOctober in the Brixton area\nfor two to four people.\nContact the Welfare Centre\nfor further information.\nFor sale frame pack for\nmountain climbing (made in\nUSA) in good condition with\npadded shoulder straps and\nhip belt.
