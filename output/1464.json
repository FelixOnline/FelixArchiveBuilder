    "content": "PAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE 10 11\nPAUL\nGARTON\nGOES TO\nSPACE\nT\no become an as-tronaut, you must\nknow physics, so\nPaul buys three\nheavy textbooks\nat the Barnes and\nNoble in town. He straps them to\nthe back of his bicycle with the loving tenderness of a parent buckling\nin their youngest child.\nTo become an astronaut, you\nmust be fit, so Paul runs three miles\ndown the road daily to meet his father\u2019s car coming back from work.\nAt the weekend, he just keeps running until he has to catch the bus\nhome. He leans his head right back,\nsweat-drenched and sticking to the\nPVC on the back seat, panting at\nthe sky as it keeps pace on the other side of the window. Invariably,\nit is a patched-and-washed, faded\njeans, Indiana blue.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Jack Garton\u2019s boy,\u201d says\nMrs. Patterson, a couple of rows\ndown, nudging her dozing hus-band. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go into space.\u201d\nMr. Patterson wriggles from her\nsharp elbows. His voice is a wholesome snarl of phlegm. \u201cWhat\u2019s he\ngonna do? Run there?\u201d\nPaul Garton reads and he runs.\nAnd he reads. And he runs. Whenever he can, in between these two\nthings, he tilts back his head and\nlooks up.\n*\nIf you ask me to pinpoint the exact\ntime I decided to go into space, it\nprobably wasn\u2019t Saturday afternoon at the planetarium with my\nfather when I was five. Neither\nwas it dressing up as Neil Armstrong for Halloween in 1971. The\nexact time I decided to go into\nspace was 1973, when John Glenn\nhad been on the lecture circuit for\nabout four months and ended up in\nWayne County. 1973 was the year\nwhen John Glenn stopped by his\nold colleague Henry Duke\u2019s, shared\na beer with him on the front porch\nand met my eyes in the middle of\nhis talk the next afternoon at the\ntown hall.\nI remember the sky had been\nperfectly clear that day and that\nI had stuck my arm up in the air.\nJohn Glenn must have picked it out\nin that crowded room: that seven-year old\u2019s arm, earnest and unblem-ished, stretching to the moulded\nceiling plaster like a sapling.\n\u201cWhat is it, son?\u201d John Glenn\nturned his keen eye on me. These\nwere the same eyes that had surveyed our earth as a whole; these\nwere the eyes of the man who\u2019d\nshot from the ground and floated\non the periphery, watching whilst\nwe were putting our kids on school\nbuses and reading the morning\nnews. I had almost cracked my\nwrist on the plastic chairs, snatching back my arm so quickly.\n\u201cWhat was it like, sir?\u201d\nJohn Glenn grinned. He sank\nback into his chair a little, folded his arms across his chest and\ngrinned.\n\u201cYou know, every time I\u2019m asked\nthis question, I try to find better\nwords to answer it with,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I still haven\u2019t found anything\nthat quite does it justice.\u201d Then he\nlooked straight at me and it was\none of those moments of complete\nepiphanic clarity that other people\nmight write love songs about.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to go and see it\nfor yourself,\u201d he said.\nA man cleared his throat at the\nback of the room, as though he\nwanted to add something, but\nchanged his mind. This man was\nHenry Duke, Wayne County\u2019s very\nown astronaut, but I didn\u2019t turn\naround, I didn\u2019t even know who\nHenry Duke was. I just perched on\nthe edge of my plastic chair and my\nheart thumped. I was seven years\nold then, but I wouldn\u2019t be forever.\nOne day, I\u2019d be seeing the world as\nBY JADE HOFFMAN\n12 13\n\n"

    "content": "PHOENIX 2\nWELCOME\nTO\nPHOENIX\nEDITORS\u2019 FOREWORDS\nKAWAI\nWONG\nGUO HENG\nCHIN\nDAN WL\nWAN\nI\ncan\u2019t image what H.G. Wells would have made of this iteration of the beloved magazine he founded in the 1887 as the\nScience Schools Journal. I\u2019d like to think he\u2019d be proud.\nThis PHOENIX is an annual, its original form. It\u2019s an annual\nthat has moved on with modern times. Formed by students\nfrom an institution steeped in such history and tradition, 2010\u2019s\nPHOENIX is hopefully adhering to its founder\u2019s literary ethos; H.G.\nWells\u2019 novels explored the still ludicrous notions of time travel into\nthe future. And here we are, in a new decade, paving the way forward\nfor PHOENIX.\nMost importantly however, is that PHOENIX features the pho-tography, sketches, paintings, poetry, prose, and stories of Imperial\nCollege students. PHOENIX 2010 does just that.\nThe editorial team were keen to focus in on life at Imperial from\njaunty and creative angles. We called out for anything that was related to life in College, be it a poem on the social failings or a photo of\nthe Library. Throughout, I hope you\u2019ll see things that you recognise\nand can relate to. We\u2019ve even dedicated a whole feature to Collegebased contributions and profiles, all of which epitomised our experiences at Imperial for us.\nI\u2019m so glad that in my position as felix Editor-in-Chief, I am able to\nsimultaneously orchestrate such a wonderful and historic publication in PHOENIX this year.\nI hope you enjoy the double-release of PHOENIX and felix, because I definitely had fun constructing it.\nN\negative capability, said Keats, is when man is\ncapable of being in uncertainties, mysteries,\ndoubts, without any irritable reaching after fact\nand reason. In a predominantly science and engineering environment that is Imperial, uncertainty and mystery is not well tolerated \u2013 they must be dispelled with rigorous experiments, ruthless fact-seeking and\narduous calculations. Which is good of course, for what is\nImperial but one of the premier science and technology university in the world?\nPHEONIX is an oasis of creative expression. There is no\nirritable seeking after explanations in art. Art is free form,\nit teases the mind with mysteries and uncertainties. Take a\nlittle sip from the well of stories after that long hard day of\ntrawling through dry journal papers. Sit down and rest your\neyes on the photographs and drawings after cracking your\nhead on that seemingly unsolvable problem sheet.\nEverything in PHOENIX is \u2018made in Imperial\u2019. This magazine was made possible by the Imperial students who contributed their artistic work and my fellow editors who invested so\nmuch time and effort to produce it, a big round of applause\ngoes to you guys.\nAmidst the pummelling stress of studies and courseworka,\nlike the eponymous mythical bird, let PHEONIX keep creative expression alive.\nH\now people try to vilify Imperial as a cultural desert!\nThis allegation is reduced to a blurred cacophony,\nwhen the enthusiastic response overwhelmed our\nmailbox and we had to expand its size several times.\nIn words and in pictures; on paper and on canvas;\nin two dimensions and three, they are all well-thought out pieces.\nBoth students and staff have tackled words, crayons, oils and film\nwith great aplomb. The glorious result is here for all to see. I am\nextremely thrilled to be part of this creative process.\nThe artworks presented here covered almost every aspect of\nlife. Infatuation, love, compassion, ageing, fantasy, sex, sexuality...\nSome works are more difficult to define, and are definitely up for\ninterpretation.\nAs an artist myself - whose art takes the form of numbered pages -the thrill of seeing a blank page blossomed into something enjoyable\nis truly rewarding.\nAnd here, I urge students to explore their imaginations. Understanding the working mechanism of the world is without a doubt\na creative process. But the appreciation or creation of something\ntangible, aesthetically pleasing and literally sound adds fruits to the\nmost fruitful of all lives.\nMy thanks extend to Dan and Guo Heng. They endured innumerable meetings, tirelessly toiled through the process of selecting\nmaterials, editing the flow of the artwork as well as laying out this\nmagazine. I hope you enjoy PHOENIX as much as I do.\nPHOENIX is produced and published in association with Felix, the student newspaper of Imperial College\nManaging Editors: Dan Wan, Kawai Wong and Guo Heng Chin; Editorial Director: David Paw; Art Director: Alexandra Ashford\n\n"

    "content": "13\n12\nJohn Glenn saw it, like a marble on\nthe tarmac.\n*\nBetween 1980 and 1984, Wayne\nCounty High School\u2019s library registers one hundred and twenty\ncounts of checking out just one\nparticular video tape. All but three\nof those stamps in the inside of\n\u201c1969 \u2013 The Eagle Has Landed\u201d are\nfor Paul Garton, who watches and\nre-watches that tape so much in\nthe A.V. room he can tell you every\nflicker of light on the greyscale horizon and every scuff of static on\nthe audio track.\nPaul holds the rewind button\nand his finger is sure, steady, as\nthe machine pulls it all back. Neil\nand Buzz jump up and down, they\ntake down the American flag, they\nleap backwards into the rocket and\ntake off. On the winter solstice, he\nrides his bike up Hoosier Hill with\na thermos of hot blackcurrant to\nwatch the longest night of the year\nunfold in all of its soaring, speckled glory. He can hear the crackle\nof that 1969 news report in his ears\nas he pounds his feet on the ped-als; he can feel the warm sizzle of\nthat old tape reel glowing in his\nteeth and bones when he powers\nthrough the cold.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Paul,\u201d says his older brother, Frank. \u201cI think you\u2019re\nnuts.\u201d Frank\u2019s girlfriend smiles\nover the dinner table, fork full of\nspaghetti.\n\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s romantic!\u201d she\nsays.\nPaul watches that tape over and\nover, and he reads, and he runs,\nand he rides his bike to watch the\nsolstice shake off the sun in a twen-ty-nine degree night. How romantic the whole thing is, Paul doesn\u2019t\nreally know. His first girlfriend is\nsixteen and sleeping in her home in\nOhio when he\u2019s cycling up Hoosier\nHill in 1982. He doesn\u2019t know it;\nthe first time he meets her is 1986,\nwhen he\u2019s sat on the floor outside\nhis dorm room door and she\u2019s in\nbed with his college roommate.\n*\nHere\u2019s a strange dream I\u2019ve been\nhaving since I was eleven years old.\nIn this dream, I\u2019m twenty-some-thing, as athletic and as tall as I\u2019ve\nalways wanted to be. I see myself in\nthe reflection from the reinforced\nglass of my helmet, looking out\nonto that vast blackness I\u2019d only\never seen before in double-page\nspreads of The Encyclopaedia of\nSpace. Silence.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cYou had us worried for a minute\nthere, Eagle.\u201d CAPCOM\u2019s crackled\nresponse.\n\u201cCommencing untethered space\nwalk, Houston.\u201d I say, seeing the\nearth down there \u2013 that hazy bluegreen marble.\n\u201cYour wife and kids are here,\nEagle.\u201d\nI\u2019m reaching for the airlock door.\n\u201cMy wife?\u201d\n\u201cAnd your kids.\u201d\nWhen I\u2019m turning the door han-dle, I realise, in that numb and\noff-handed way in which thoughts\noccur in dreams, that CAPCOM is\nactually my dad\u2019s voice. I idly wonder when he got this new job, wonder if he\u2019s still going to be working\nat the second-hand car dealership.\n\u201cListen, Eagle. We have a message for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m listening, Dad.\u201d\nI step outside, putting my feet\nout to no resistance. Like John\nGlenn said, it\u2019s a thing that cannot\nbe described. It\u2019s like floating, but\nit\u2019s not. It\u2019s like falling, but it\u2019s not.\nOver the radio, there\u2019s some static.\n\u201cListen to this, Eagle.\u201d\nAnd, whilst I\u2019m there \u2013 suspended out alone, hovering uncertainly\nlike those preserved things in the\njars at the Museum of Natural History \u2013 my Dad starts to play me\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s\n\u201cFortunate Son\u201d. I don\u2019t really question it; I listen to it, like he told me\nto. I\u2019m thinking about the times he\nplayed it to me and Frank in the\ncar on the way to visit our grandparents and can almost see us\nboth down there \u2013 tiny, clockwork\nmovements \u2013 driving up the I-69\nwith Frank giving me a dead arm in\nthe back. Lights \u2013 street lights, car\nlights, whole cities start to switch\non and off, and the small earth\ntwinkles gently. When Perth is on,\nParis fades out. When Oslo lights\nup, New York darkens. The process\nis smooth, flowing and undulating\nwith an eerie, mesmerising beauty.\nI take off my helmet to get a better look. I breathe in; I feel okay.\nI\u2019ve never told anyone about\nthis dream, can\u2019t really see why I\nwould. Not even when I was in the\nhospital did I think to mention this\ndream but I had it every month or\nso, almost exactly like this. Sometimes CAPCOM played me some\nCSNY.\n*\nPaul\u2019s college roommate is Jerry Secker, a loud, broad-shoul-dered American History major. If\nprompted to describe him, Paul\nwill say that Jerry is one of those\nguys who, when asked casually if\nthey\u2019re feeling hungry at all, will re-ply, \u201cI\u2019m always hungry.\u201d If prompted to describe Paul, Jerry will shrug\nhis Atlas-worthy shoulders and\nsay, \u201cHe\u2019s an alright guy, you know?\nQuiet. All he does is read and run.\u201d\nOn February 20th, 1986, Jerry\u2019s\nhaving sex with the girl Paul\u2019s going to marry but, since Paul hasn\u2019t\nmet her yet, he sits out in the corridor with one ear pressed to his\nportable radio, listening to the\nnews report on Mir.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jerry mutters when he\nopens the door. Paul doesn\u2019t mind\nand says so.\n\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201d the\ngirl asks, appearing in the doorway,\nhurriedly dressed and sheepish.\n\u201cThey just launched Mir,\u201d says\nPaul.\nJerry frowns. \u201cWho did?\u201d\n\u201cThe Soviets.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s bad, right?\u201d\nThe girl giggles and lands an\nendearing punch on Jerry\u2019s bicep.\n\u201cNo, silly, it\u2019s that space thing, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a space station,\u201d Paul nods\nand smiles a little at this girl Jerry\u2019s\ngot his arm around. \u201cThey\u2019re not\nbombing us or anything.\u201d\nOn this exact day, twenty-four\nyears ago, John Glenn became the\nfirst man to orbit the earth in four\nhours, fifty-five minutes and twen-ty-three seconds.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of cool,\u201d says the\ngirl. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, by the\nway?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Paul,\u201d Paul says.\n\u201cI\u2019m Joni,\u201d she says and steps out,\nbarefoot, into the corridor to shake\nhis hand. When she leans in, the\nneckline of her sundress falls open\nand Paul glimpses, beneath the\ncotton, the pale-skinned contours\nleading down to her breasts. Joni\ncontinues to sleep with Jerry for a\nweek and a half, and after that she\ndates a boy called Howard for a\nwhile, but she marries Paul in 1991.\n*\nI attribute almost everything that\nhappens to me, the good and the\nbad, to meeting John Glenn that\none time when I was an impressionable seven-year old. If I ever\nmet him again, I think I\u2019d ask him\nto come with me when I apologise\nto Joni. I would explain to him that\nhe should probably have never\ncome down to Wayne County,\nnever picked my skinny arm out of\nthe crowd, never had a beer with\nHenry Duke in the Indiana spring.\nSometimes, now, I think that if\nI had met Henry Duke instead of\nJohn Glenn, things would have\nbeen a lot different. But Henry\nDuke isn\u2019t allowed to hold talks,\nor visit schools and town halls,\nat least, not if NASA\u2019s PR department hears about it. And they hear\nabout it. He wrote three articles\non his space-travel experiences\nthat were all blocked before they\ncould even feel the cold breath of\nTime magazine\u2019s overaggressive\noffice air-conditioning. They were\nblocked before he\u2019d even licked\nthe stamps to send them. The best\nHenry Duke ever did, in the twen-ty-eight earthbound years before\nhis death, was to write bitter letters\nto the Your Say pages of minor astronomy magazines under pseudo-nyms. Even then, he was painfully\naware that his efforts were futile\nresponses to similarly dispirited\npeople who never found a thing\nthat made their lives feel full. He\ngot little comfort from it.\nI never met Henry Duke, or his\nangry wife, or his angry son. I only\nheard about him, five years after his\ndeath, from the man who shared\nthe hospital room with me. I think\nsometimes that I\u2019d like to have met\nhim; we\u2019d have a lot to talk about.\n*\nJoni turns up at the restaurant\nPaul works at one day in October.\nShe orders coffee and a slice of\ncheesecake, and tells Paul that she\u2019s\nstopped seeing Howard, didn\u2019t\nknow why she\u2019d even started going\nout with him in the first place. The\nfirst time they sleep together, Joni\u2019s\nelbow knocks his Mir shuttle replica off the dresser and it lands as\nseven splintered bits of acrylic on\nthe floor.\n\u201cShit, Paul,\u201d she says and stops\npulling off his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll\nget you another one.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t\nneed the replica; I\u2019ll see it when I\nget there.\u201d\nOne of the things that Joni loves\nso much about him, the thing she\nusually says first when asked, is the\nway he is so sure of himself. Joni\ndoesn\u2019t know if she wants to watch\na movie or go bowling; Joni still\nisn\u2019t sure she picked the right meal\nlast night at dinner. But you can\nask Paul, and he\u2019ll say \u201cbowling\u201d,\nand he\u2019ll say \u201clasagne\u201d, and Joni\u2019s\nalways admired that. She doesn\u2019t\nknow if she wants to go into drama\nor teaching, but Paul says he\u2019s going to go into space and he does.\nHe doesn\u2019t always talk about\nspace, though. Paul and Joni also\ntalk about music that they like,\nchildhood pets and favourite TV\nshows. Paul knows that, of the\nthings Joni does and does not want,\nthat she wants to sing at least once\non Broadway and that she never\nwants to have to ask her parents\nfor money. Joni knows that, of the\nthings Paul will and will not talk\nabout, he will not talk about his\nfather\u2019s experiences in Vietnam.\nThey don\u2019t always talk about space,\nand music, and parents. Twice,\nthey talk about children\u2019s names\n\u2013 Emily, Jason, Sophie. Once, Paul\nasks her to marry him and she says\nyes.\n*\nWe went to couples counselling,\non Joni\u2019s persuasion, once after I\ncame back. My guess was that this\nall happened whilst I was away,\nthat maybe people we knew started\ndoing things like this \u2013 going to sit\ntogether on leather sofas in the city\nto tell a stranger that you\u2019re so sick\nof each other. I agreed to go, just so\nshe would stop asking.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much I want\nto be sitting in the room when you\ntell some man we\u2019ve never met all\nthe things about me that you hate,\u201d\nI said, but we were already in the\ncar on the way there.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much you\nwant anything,\u201d Joni muttered to\nthe window. I turned up the car radio but did not recognise the mu-sic. It turned out that the therapist\nwas a woman, anyway.\nI tried to listen as Joni told this\nwoman about all the things wrong\nPAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE\nOn February 20th, 1986, Jerry\u2019s\nhaving sex with the girl Paul\u2019s\ngoing to marry but, since Paul\nhasn\u2019t met her yet, he sits out in\nthe corridor with one ear pressed\nto his portable radio, listening to\nthe news report on Mir.\n11\n10\n\n"

The figure of Disney\u2019s\nMickey Mouse, who encompasses both black and white, is apparently surrounded by tall and foreboding\nmembers of the Klu Klux Klan , whilst apparently explaining the absurdity of the situation. This serves to highlight the\nludicrous nature of racism as a concept in today\u2019s society, where it is possible for a cartoon character to be scrutinised\nover issues of race and a society of ill informed and closed minded people wearing dresses can become a taboo. It\nseems that it requires 2D thinking to explain the flaws of racism to such people, so maybe it is time to stop fearing the\nuse of their image as such mindless hatred deserves no control over what we may think and say.\n\n"

Look at him all like,\n\u2018where\u2019s my keyboard? I can\u2019t do my puzzles without a keyboard.

Your clothing is an expression of your personality and is a window into your soul, therefore you should look stupid\nand pretentious. As a guy, wear a dangly earring in your right ear, not\nbecause you\u2019re gay, but because you\u2019re alternative. Complement this with\nsomething stupid and dangly around your neck. As a girl try wearing a\ndark shade of lipstick that matches your Victorian child\u2019s dress with those\nweird shoulders. Remember girls to always look up to the right, as this\nmakes you look pensive and creative. The right hemisphere of the brain\nis your artsy side. You may notice that the female art student in the picture above is actually looking up to the left, but she\u2019s non-conformist and\ndoesn\u2019t conform to brain hemispheres.\nRemind people that you\u2019re an art student by\ntelling them you just \u201cget things that they\ndon\u2019t\u201d. Talk about yourself and how you\u2019re\nso complicated and depressed, yet enigmatic and avant-garde. If the conversation\nis veering towards something non-you re-lated, quickly turn the topic back to yourself by asking them if they\u2019d like to hear the\npoem you\u2019ve written. If all else fails, just sit\nthere and pull the \u201cUgh you\u2019re so narrowminded\u201d look, depicted above.\nStep 2 is talking about yourself; Step 3 concentrates on talking about all\nthe amazing places you\u2019ve been. Now as an Art Student you hate others engaging in your one-sided conversation so avoid this by going to\nreally obscure locations and finding a small quirky inscrutable club or\nbar. You can eliminate the dreaded possibility of another member of the\nconversation having been to your chosen venue by making it up. Shakespearean sounding names work great, like \u2018Othello\u2019s\u2019 or \u2018the Iago\u2019 or just\nput random words together like \u2018tin sprinkle\u2019 or \u2018spandex soldiers\u2019. Well,\nmaybe not Spandex Soldiers, but I had such a great night at Tin Sprinkle\nthe other night. It\u2019s in Spurt. Oh my God you\u2019ve never been to Spurt? You\nknow it\u2019s like really far East London, just north of the Tempest Avenue.\nIt\u2019s like so indie and everyone there is like really on my level you know?\nOh man, you guys just don\u2019t get me.\nArt Students don\u2019t do art, they do interpretive art, which is easy.

His mother had been one of\nthe Berringtons of Somerset, an\nold family that could trace its heritage all the way back to the Bayeux\ntapestry \u2013 \u201cRichard Berrington\nhas been worked into it, holding\na horse you know\u201d \u2013 and its tyranny over the farmers that worked\non the Berrington estate almost as\nfar. Deidre Berrington had been a\nbeautiful, intelligent, lively young\nwoman destined for great things,\nuntil she met Archibald Lane, a\nviolinist with no money and no talent to speak of outside of Cornwall.\nThey met at a party, they danced\nwell into the early hours and at\ndawn they fled to Dover and got a\nboat to France.\nThe family was in uproar. Who\nwas this man with the common\nname that their Deidre had run\naway with? She had left a letter,\nclearly explaining her absence and\nexpressing her hope that she would\nsee them all again soon. The family took the letter and put it on the\nfire, then wrote to the lawyers and\nhad her name removed from the\nfamily tree.\nSo when Archie and Dee returned to England they found the\ndoor to Berrington Manor closed\nfirmly against them and settled in\nLondon to a miserable marriage.\nFive years later Archie left, fed up\nwith his wife\u2019s ineptitude at darning socks and boiling potatoes, and\nDeidre threw herself on the mercy\nof an aunt who took in her and her\nson, Freddie.\nThe next fifteen years weren\u2019t so\nbad. Deidre dropped her husband\u2019s\nname and sat quietly during afternoon tea visits to Berrington Manor until slowly her parents got used\nto her being around again. They\ndidn\u2019t care very much for her son\nthough, so she continued to live\nwith her aunt who thoroughly enjoyed reminding her how wickedly\nshe had behaved. But for Freddie,\nlife ran quite smoothly. He went to\nboarding school and played rugby\nand cricket \u2013 being a skinny boy\nhe wasn\u2019t very good at either but\nthat never seems to concern gym\nteachers. He worked very hard at\nHistory and got a place to study at\nOxford. The family suddenly started to take an interest \u2013 it was fascinating to them that a non-descript\nviolin-player with an unfortunate\nsurname could produce such an\nintelligent boy. They paid his fees\nand were satisfied with his grades,\nbut in the second year something\nrather unfortunate happened.\nReturning to his room late one\nnight after a dinner where he\nmay have had a little too much to\ndrink, he could hear a faint snuffling sound coming from inside it\nas he fumbled with his keys outside\nthe door. Cautiously he opened the\ndoor and peeped around it to see\na piglet sitting in the middle of the\nroom. Slowly Freddie eased himself passed the door, closed it quietly and surveyed the little animal\nwarily. He had no idea how it had\ngot there but dimly, in the back of\nhis wine-muddled brain, he was recalling a rule that the college had\nconcerning Lord Byron and a bear\n\u2013 or was that at Cambridge?\nProbably at Cambridge, he finally\ndecided, looking up at the clock on\nhis mantelpiece and realising that\nhe had been leaning against the\nwall for a quarter of an hour. The\npiglet, meanwhile, had dragged his\ndressing-gown off a chair and was\nmaking itself a bed. This would\nnever do! Freddie still had no idea\nwho had let the piglet loose in here,\nbut he knew he would have to get\nrid of it and quickly if he wanted\nto avoid be disciplinary hearing.\nCarefully, very carefully, he crept\nacross the rug towards the piglet,\nhis arms outstretched. At the very\nlast minute he made a sort of dive\nat the pig but perhaps not as gracefully as his addled brain may have\npredicted because the piglet shot\nbetween his legs, squealing unnaturally loudly for such a little creature and he toppled to the floor and\ngot tangled in his dressing-gown.\nA moment later a porter was\ncharging through the door, his\nbowler hat tilted slightly backwards\ndue to the speed of his movements,\nand demanded to know the reason\nfor the disturbance. He took one\nlook at the piglet, one at Freddie\nfighting to be free from the clutches of his dressing-gown and shook\nhis head grimly.\nThe next day Freddie BerringtonLane was sent down from Oxford\nfor the disregard of the rule forbidding the housing of unusual pets\nin halls of residents. His great aunt\nvowed that her heart would stop\nwith the shame, but not before it\nwas overcome with palpitations\nat the sight of the bill that was enclosed with the letter, demanding\nthat the carpet in the student room\nbe replaced. Freddie returned to\nhis aunt\u2019s house under a very large\ncloud.\nMeanwhile, Lord Berrington,\nDeidre\u2019s uncle who was currently\nin charge of the estate, had died,\nleaving four daughters and three\ngrieving widows all desperate to\nknow who would be getting the\nhouse. The earlier wives, not to\nbe at a disadvantage to the latest,\nmoved back into the house, refusing to leave until the will was read.\nThe lawyer was called for and pronounced Freddie Berrington-Lane\nas the next male in line to receive\nthe estate. The wives were out-raged. Who was this cousin that\nnobody had ever heard of? Freddie\nwas sent for.\nFreddie arrived at the manor one\ngrey morning and stared up at it\nfrom the safety of the back seat of\nthe cab. He had never been here\nbefore, his grandparents lived in\na smaller house a few miles away\nand his grandfather\u2019s brother had\nnever asked him to visit. The cab\ndriver asked pointedly for his fare\nand Freddie knew it was time to get\nout. Watching the cab drive away,\nhis suitcase feeling heavy in his\nhands, he climbed the stairs and\nknocked on the large front door.\nA grim-faced butler opened it,\nlooked him slowly up and down,\nsniffed and stood back for him to\nenter. He was wearing a black armband and a mournful expression\non his face. Slowly Freddie looked\naround the hall: it was immense,\ndimly lit and deathly quiet. For a\nfleeting moment he considered\nthe possibility that nobody was in\nbut then all at once the three wives\nwere in the entrance hall, bearing\ndown on him with invitations to\nbreakfast and malignant looks in\ntheir eyes.\nFreddie probably wouldn\u2019t have\nlasted in the house until the end\nof the day \u2013 with all the false kind-ness, and angry looks flashed in his\ndirection when the wives thought\nhe wasn\u2019t looking - if it hadn\u2019t\nbeen for Marie-Claire. She was the\ndaughter of the most recent wife,\nwho had caught Lord Berrington\u2019s\neye in a line of chorus girls in the\nWest End \u2013 Marie-Claire\u2019s mother had had the longest legs. This\nthird wife had been living in the\nmanor for under a year and would\nprobably not have managed to\nhold on to her husband for much\nlonger because they had very little\nin common and were constantly\nfighting. She was demanding and\nchildish and he was stubborn and\nimpatient; luckily for her they were\nstill married when the heart attack\ncame along. Her daughter was very\npretty, very polite and very clever.\nShe batted her eyes and smiled and\nFreddie suddenly found himself accepting an invitation to dinner. He\nstayed the rest of the week, and the\nnext, and finally the two divorced\nwives cut their losses and went\nhome.\nMeanwhile, Freddie and MarieClaire had been making plans.\nThey packed up their things and\ngot a boat to France, Freddie returning to the country in which\nhe was conceived and MarieClaire visiting for the first time her\nmother\u2019s homeland. They moved\ninto a little cottage in the South\nwhere Freddie immersed himself\nin History books, eventually one\nday publishing one of his own and\nMarie-Claire\u2019s mother remained at\nthe manor, deserted now of all the\nservants but content in the knowledge that she had beaten the other\nwives for it.\na brief history\n\n"

That\u2019s quite\na feat, and yet I still feel a warm fuzzy\nglow of nostalgia come over me where\nletters are concerned.\nEverything just feels so much better with a letter. Personal correspondence becomes more intimate when the\nlover discards their spell-checker in\nfavour of a fountain pen, and business\nis so much more official when you can\nsee your name through that little polythene window on the front of the enve-lope. Besides this, there is the nervous\nexcitement that a walk down to the\nmailbox can bring and the resultant\njoy when you discover a letter inside.\nAnd then there are the stamps. Tiny\nlittle squares of paper, inconsequential\nin themselves yet they have the power to ferry parcels all over the world.\nAcross borders, across continents,\neven (especially given Royal Mail\u2019s\nwork ethic, or lack thereof) across\ntime! There is also the delicious yet\nalien taste of licking the back of one.\nWhat is it that goes into that gum?\nThat curious, quintessential flavour that lingers on the tongue and\nprompts an absent licking of the lips\nand a fervent wish that Aunt Margaret lived in Russia, not Reading.\nRoyal Mail have kept tight-lipped on\nthe recipe lest it fall into the wrong\nhands and wreak havoc on us all. After much persuasion (and a sack filled\nwith doorknobs), I was able to glean\nsome vital insights. For starters, did\nyou know a stamp contains 5.9 calo-ries? Fascinating!\nBut more importantly, I have discovered the dark secret behind the\nstamp\u2019s secret ingredient. The clue is\nin the licking. As Freud delighted to\npoint out, we humans have an insatiable preponderance to lick things. It\nisn\u2019t surprising, given we have more\nthan 8000 taste-buds on our tongue\nalone. However, trouble arises when\nwe start to lick things that we really\nshouldn\u2019t.\nTo begin with, there are toads. Toads\nsecrete a noxious chemical cocktail to\nput their would-be predators off their\ndinner (which would be them other-wise). And yet we lick them because\nin a few species, the mix is just right\nto have a potent hallucinogenic effect.\nIt makes for quite a high\u2026so I\u2019m told.\nThere are also poison-dart frogs which\nare slightly less fun (and considerably\nmore lethal) to lick.\nDeepening the connection between\nlicking and psychedelic experiences is\nLSD. Little squares of paper, with one\nlick and you\u2019re floating in the clouds,\nlistening to rainbows. Does any of this\nsound familiar? Does it sound scary? It\nshould because in addition to the vast\nreams of paper Royal Mail import to\nmake their stamps, they also import a\nvast quantity of toads.\nThis is the reality of things, as I understand it. The glue on the back of\nstamps is made from toad-sweat. But\nwhy? There are so many other, far\nmore attractive, alternatives. The reason is one of self-preservation. Why\ndo you think we still have letters at all\nin the age of e-mail and internet? We\ndo not buy stamps for letters; we write\nletters to lick stamps. To continue\nbusiness, Royal Mail sought to make\na franking system that people wanted\nto use, and keep on using. The idea\nwas there with LSD on blotter paper\nbut unfortunately, it\u2019s not addictive,\nwhich was the entire point. Also, people tended to do strange things to their\nletters while tripping.\nBeing the wild bohemians that they\nwere, Royal Mail knew there was more\nthan one way to get high and so turned\nto toads. Obviously they couldn\u2019t use\nany of the more fanciful species \u2013\nsomeone might notice \u2013 but after a\ncareful investigation, they found one\nwith just the right balance of addiction\nand psychedelia. And that brings us to\ntoday, where we write with resentment\na torrent of thank-you cards and yet\nrevel in licking the myriad of stamps\nfor them.\nAnd there you have it. The truth. I\u2019m\nnot proud of what I did to acquire it\nbut some things need to be known.\nOf course, you can choose to disbelieve me \u2013 maybe I licked one too\nmany toads myself \u2013 but let me ask\nyou one question. If stamp glue were\nreally something mundane and boring like starch and resin, why exactly is\nstamp collecting so popular, especially\namongst the house-rave scene?\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to go\nand post a letter.\n\u201cThe mix is\njust right to\nhave a potent\nhallucinogenic\neffect. It makes for\nquite a high\u2026 so\nI\u2019m told\u201d\nRhys Davies puts his tongue to toad\nAre you graduating?\nNever got around to writing that article?

    "content": "Phil Sandwell\u2019s brain wanders off its leash\n6\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor\nComment Editor Charlotte Morris\nCharlotte Morris\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 04 JUNE 2010\nA\ncouple of weeks ago on\nthe BBC\u2019s Question Time,\nthe panel lamented the\nlack of women and people\nfrom ethnic minorities in\npolitics. I do believe that the interests\nof the country would be best served by\nhaving a government that completely\nrepresents the proportions of men,\nwomen, religions and colours amongst\nthe British people, but only if all of\nthese people want to do, and are up to\ndoing, the job. Simon Hughes of the\nLiberal Democrats (who have 57 white\nmale MPs) said his party had failed and\nshould introduce positive discrimination to even up the numbers. But\nwhatever happened to the idea of the\njob going to the best candidate?\nI hate positive discrimination. If you\nare not the best candidate then you\nshould not be getting the position. If\npolitical parties start aggressively supporting positive discrimination how\nwill anyone ever know if the candidate\nthey are voting for has any idea what\nthey are doing, or if they were just put\nthere to fill some kind of quota. I appreciate that the current bias towards\nwhite middle-aged men can discourage\npeople who are not really represented\nby the MPs in the House of Commons\nfrom wanting to enter into politics. If\nyou see barely any women in political jobs then perhaps this means, as a\nwoman, you would feel unwelcome in\nthat sort of position. There are few role\nmodels in place to aspire to. However,\nthese issues do not justify giving someone a post because of their gender or\ncolour \u2013 discrimination by any name is\nstill discrimination.\nInstead of promoting people into\njobs just because of their sex or racial\nbackground \u2013 traits which none of\nus can change \u2013 time would be better spent encouraging people from all\nwalks of life to apply for these jobs. In\nthe end, by a law of averages, you will\nend up with the ideal proportions of\nrepresentation without having to resort to positive discrimination. I\u2019m not\nnaive enough to think that this would\nbe a quick process; giving women\nand people from ethnic minorities\nsafe party seats is a much faster way\nto even up numbers in the House of\nCommons. However, it seems that by\nusing positive discrimination as a tool\nto fill quotas the political parties could\nbe giving fuel to people who are sexist\nand racist to say that these MPs are not\nsuited to a career in politics. If it was\nmade clear that every candidate went\nthrough the same rigorous selection\nprocess then surely everyone would be\non an even playing field. Otherwise,\nwe could end up with a collection of\nsubstandard MPs or, worse, a collection of brilliant MPs who are ignored\nbecause they are considered to have\nonly got the job because of their gender or skin colour.\nEquality, to me, is the most important thing any society can aspire to. We\nall deserve the same opportunities, but\nit is up to us to make the most of these.\nI don\u2019t want to be handed a job solely\nbecause of my gender. If positive discrimination continues, and becomes\nyet more aggressive, it will lead people\nto question whether they really got a\nposition on their own merit. This kind\nof discrimination undermines pride in\noneself; how can you be pleased with\nyour achievements if they were given\nto you because of something you didn\u2019t\nchoose and are unable to change? In\nthe world of work it can sometimes be\nbetter to be simply regarded as a human being rather than a sex or a colour.\nPositive discrimination undermines pride\nP\neople think far too much. If\nwe aren\u2019t thinking about our\nexams we\u2019re thinking about\nour work, thinking about\nwhat to do or how to do it.\nWhat I think we all need to do is take\na moment to sit back, breathe deeply\nand relax.\nIn a university environment it is\nonly natural that your brain starts to\nperform in a certain way. In such a\nscience-dominated environment as\nImperial, a special mindset built on\nthe foundations of reason and rationality develops, allowing students to\nbase balanced judgements on careful thought and consideration. At\nleast this is the theory. In practice,\nthe result is more often than not the\nthoughtless overapplication of inappropriate logic, often ending in someone trying to resolve some differential\nequations in their head. While this\napproach is highly commended in the\nfields of rocket science or fluid dy-namics, it is completely pointless in\nresponse to the sorts of questions that\ngenerally arise in day-to-day life. If,\nafter asking someone which cashpoint\nI should go to, they gave me a well-worked and entirely reasonable statistical analysis of why I should go to the\none round the corner, I would look at\nthem blankly and walk away. If, on the\nother hand, someone else told me I\nshould go to the one round the corner\nbecause last time they went there it\nwas sunny, I would happily take their\nadvice without a second thought. Unfortunately, as we\u2019ve all experienced,\nasking an insignificant question often\nreceives a less than trivial response.\nNot only does this force me through\na course of involuntary mental gymnastics to humour, let alone follow,\ntheir argument, it gets me no close to\nwithdrawing my money.\nA symptom of thinking too much is\nthinking too little. This is most often\nmanifested in the form of sitting in\nfront of some form of screen, gorm-lessly staring into the middle distance\nand letting whatever you aren\u2019t really\nfocussing on wash over you. The self-hypnosis is normally broken by either\nthe adverts on 4oD coming on or the\nlecturer changing his PowerPoint\nslide, both of which make you realise\nthat you have very little idea where\nthe preceding fifteen minutes went.\nThis is the vegetative state of the brain\ncaused by either the overuse of or exposure to, among other things, needlessly complicated cashpoint direc-tions. In this powered-down scenario,\nthe mind tries to recover by either\nabsorbing information by osmosis\n(such as when watching the entirety\nof Brass Eye) or becoming dormant\nand impervious to external stimuli\n(such as staring your way through another Thermodynamics lecture). The\nhuman mind is a little like my aging\nlaptop; every once in a while, if you\nwork it too hard, it\u2019ll emit a submissive whimper and put itself in a con-ciliatory, self-initiated sleep mode.\nThe best level of intellectual excursion is when the mind is ticking over\njust enough to keep itself going, but\nnot enough to justify any sort of deep\nthinking. This state of mental-third\ngear is normally attained either when\nlying in a park in the summertime,\nafter an endless conversation with\ngood friends in the small hours of\nthe morning, or when mildly inebri-ated. Best of all is the incomparable\ncombination of the three, when the\nleast-used part of our brains is let off\nits leash and allowed to wander freely.\nImagination, upon entering Imperial,\nis generally confined to the visualisation of situations for the purposes of\nproblem solving, and even then we are\nnormally instructed on exactly how to\ndo that. Much better is when your imagination can breed creativity; while\nthis normally results in the talking\nof complete nonsense, like whether\nBatman and Spiderman could ever be\nfriends or whether dinosaurs would\nmake good pets (answer: definitely\nyes), this is exactly the sort of cranial activity that is good for the soul.\nAs useful and practical as logic is, it\ncan never create, or compare to, the\nfreedom of an unchained imagination\nthinking up absolute rubbish.\nThe brain is a wonderful organ, but\nwe all take it for granted. With the exception of the liver, it is the one part\nof us that we thoughtlessly and thanklessly put under great stress on a regular basis. Once your exams are over\nand you finally have time to relax, give\nyour mind the reward it has earned\nover the past few months. Go and lie\non the grass in the sun and tell someone what the clouds look like.\n\u201cLogic is useful, but\nit can\u2019t compare\nto the unchained\nimagination\nthinking up\nabsolute rubbish\u201d\nEleanor Berry argues that\u2019s there\u2019s nothing positive about discrimination in an equal opportunity society\n\u201cWe all deserve\nthe same\nopportunities, but\nit is up to us to\nmake the most of\nthem\u201d\nAffirmative action has sparked controversy in the U.S. since President\nKennedy introduced it in 1961\n\n"

WHAT\u2019S\nTHE ETHOS BEHIND THIS?\nThe name Ellomennopee (pronounced \u201cLMNOP\u201d) comes from my misinterpretation of\nthe alphabet song as a child. It\u2019s a moniker I\nuse for my works of art and design. Originally\nin 2007 it was the name of my brand of handmade plush toys which sold in retail stores.\nThe success of the toys made me realise that\nsince leaving school, I had neglected my artistic side. From then on I vowed to stay involved in art for my own happiness.\nWHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY PRODUCING FOR IT?\nI\u2019m currently working with some rather austere art supplies to build up a portfolio to show\nto galleries in London.

I\u2019ve\nnoticed a positive feedback effect whereby the\nmore people who know your work, the more\nchances you get for exciting creative projects.\nMy dream would be to be given a huge public\nspace, a huge budget and free reign.\nWOULD YOU SAY YOUR ULTIMATE\nCALLING IS TO BE AN ENGINEER OR\nAN ARTIST?\nUltimately I\u2019m a combination and I would be\nunfulfilled without both in my life.\nASSESS THE CREATIVE SCENE AT IMPERIAL...AND HONESTLY!\nI am impressed with what Imperial has to of-fer, considering it is a science university. There\nare great student societies like PhotoSoc, and\nLeonardo for fine arts which offers weekly\nclasses.

Crystal Castles\n7. Caribou\n8. Yeah Yeah Yeahs\n9. Bob Dylan\n10. Coldplay\nI\u2019ve got a deal for you guys, if you can get Barry White to number 1 next week, I\u2019ll\ndo something unfathomably embarrassing; I\u2019m open to suggestions on the group\nwall. Barry White. Number 1. YES WE CAN! - Kadhim\ning Ellie Goulding, was just about to\ntake to the stage for her largest, probably most terrifying support gig. She\nvaliantly beat her drum and sang her\nsiren pop songs to a largely uninter-ested, half-filled arena. Feeling slightly\nsorry for her, I overexerted myself in\nsupport. Her sound was huge, her\nband was tight and the songs flowed\nout as if she was a Wembley veteran.\nAdmittedly, with that kind of power\ncoming from the enormous stacks,\nwhich hung from the ceiling, it\u2019s hard\nnot to sound overwhelming, but Ellie\ncame through convincingly. Sweetly\nthanking the crowd she humbly left\nthe stage to give way to the force that\nmight be John Mayer.\nSwiftly making our way to congratulate Ellie and see the action behind the\nscenes, we thought it was time to grill\nMr. Mayer. Through a weave of deserted corridors and dressing rooms\nwe came across life. A hub of crew\nall kitted out with torches and radios,\nmusicians a-plenty, security a-leaping\nand a partridge in a pear tree. Despite\nsome misconceptions, backstage is not\nthe drug-fuelled eternal party some\nmay think and there was definitely\nno partridge, there was, however, a\ncertain American guitarist. Being his\nfirst time playing in Wembley, John\u2019s\nnerves must be giving him some kind\nof grief but he didn\u2019t let on; cool as ice\nhe described the venue as \u201cThe Madison Square Garden of the UK\u201d, this is\nprobably true but certainly not on the\naesthetic front. He towered above all\nof us and made little effort to break\nthe ice (fair enough when he\u2019s about to\nhave to break the ice with about 6,000\nadoring fans, he needed all the lines he\ncould get).\nFrom this encounter I learned that\nhe was not going on stage with Pino\nPalladino (bassist) or Steve Jordan\n(drummer), from his \u2018Try\u2019 and \u2018Where\nthe Light Is \u2013 Live in LA\u2019, blues trio al-bums. This left me massively disheartened as to be honest that is the only\nreason I thought he was any good to\nbegin with. Instead he would be playing his soppy love songs. Despite my\nbest efforts I could not get anything\nout of him about what it\u2019s like to be\nin bed with Jennifer Aniston. He was\nwhisked away from us to prepare and\nEllie had just cooled off from her set.\nGiving our love and congratulations to\nher, we took our places to see the man.\nThere\u2019s no question that John Mayer\nhas stage presence, and as he plucked\nhis way through the first few numbers,\nthe largely female crowd showed no\nsign of stopping the relentless screaming and love-struck wailing that seems\nto follow John. He had a tremendous\nband that communicated perfectly and\nkept the wall of sound, behind John\u2019s\nintricate solos, flawless, huge and as\ntight as they could be. There were\nmoments where the backing singers\nhad something not quite right but it\nquite clearly made little difference to\nthe spectacular sound that was coming from the stage. Reeling off many of\nthe hit songs that the girls could easily\nsing along to while lusting after him,\nthe experience was beginning to get a\nlittle painful, as I knew that there was\nfar more talent on that stage than was\nbeing shown. I clearly spoke too soon\nas he then erupted into some tearing\nblues riffs and squealing solos that\ngave me a taste of the John Mayer I had\ncome to know. There were some questionable movements by John, looking\nas though he was getting a bit more\npleasure from his guitar than his guitar\nwas willing to give, but the skill was on\nanother level.\nThere was a constant theme of him\nhaving quite long, one-sided conversations with the crowd that seemed\nto me like he enjoyed the sound of his\nown voice a bit too much. This view\nof him that I had formed was completely redeemed with a little dedication from him to us, our desire to see\nhis blues trio music mentioned backstage must have left an impression on\nhim. Sending his band off and taking\nthe stage on his own, he proceeded to\nplay my favorite blues song of his. We\nwere amazed at what he had just done,\nin a sold-out Wembley arena. With a\nglance and a nod, he brought his band\nback onstage, and fell comfortably\nback into his pop songs, he had done\nenough, he was superb.\nHaving played for nearly two hours\nand having left the stage, he returned\nfor a humble encore, as the applause\nwas never ending. All in all it was a\ndynamic set, with perfect sound and\nglimmers of blues excellence, intertwined with slightly generic love songs\nand hiccups. It cannot be denied that\nhe writes beautiful music and is a living\nguitar legend, despite his skills not fully manifesting themselves this evening,\nthey do exist and he left everybody\nwanting more, well-done Mr. Mayer.\nHe towered above\nall of us and made\nlittle effort to\nbreak the ice, (fair\nenough when he\u2019s\nabout to have\nto break the ice\nwith about 6,000\nadoring fans, he\nneeded all the lines\nhe could get.)\nReviews\nJack White takes more of a backseat\nthan ever before, bringing Alison\nMosshart to the helm of this spooky\nyet sultry blues outfit. The album\nkicks off with \u201cBlue Blood Blues\u201d; with\nbass stomping all over it and Fertita\u2019s\nguitar shrieking in discordant yelps.\nWTF \u2018shake your hips like battleships\u2019\nmeans I\u2019m not quite qualified to say, all\nI know is, it moves my bones. \u201cHustle\nand Cuss\u201d sees them slip into a more\nchilled groove akin to 70s soul band\nFunkadelic, which contrasts with the\nTHE DEAD\nWEATHER\nSEA OF\nCOWARDS\nWARNER BROS\nALBUM\nFor more than a decade now Autechre\u2019s works have tended to be tough\nto approach.

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 04 JUNE 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe comments from\nmy companions as we\nreached the Old Vic Pit\nBar were ranging from\n\u201cooh, this is a nice theatre\u201d\nto \u201cif Jeff Goldblum is there, I\u2019m going\nto go up to him and ask him if he wants\na blowjob\u201d. And I guess these two remarks sum up what the Three Little Maids are all about charming and\nnice with a naughty irreverent edge.\nThe bar itself is small and cute, no\nmore than a anteroom to the Old Vic\nstaircase, with some rather reasonably\npriced drinks on offer (if you\u2019re feeling really posh there\u2019s Tatty for \u00a37.50\na glass). The crowd varies from trendy\nyoung things to elderly theatre goers\nwith the odd celebrity chucked in for\ngood measure (Omigod it\u2019s Neil from\nthe Inbetweeners!).\nBut to the Three Little Maids them-selves, all look charmingly gorgeous\nand well complemented by some\ncustom made bunting and their pianist Leo. The set didn\u2019t exactly start\nwith a bang but the \u201860s medley performed was nice enough, including a\nLily Allen-esque rendition of I\u2019m Into\nStraight, gay and all shades in between\nAfter getting to know the The Three Little Maids, arts editor Lucy Harrold, listens to their perfect harmonies\nSomething Good. The Lily Allen style\nwas later echoed in an untempo arrangement of The Beatles \u201cDrive My\nCar\u201d both with some effective shaky\negg and cowbell action from the girls.\nHighlights of the first set included an\nauthentic trip back to the \u201840s with\nCatagoona Choo Choo ala The Andrews Sisters, an impromptu cameo\nfrom Leo singing Cabaret and a very\nsmooth Moon River with an almost\ndreamlike quality with its lilting melo-dy. The downside with this first set for\nme was the sound quality which made\nit difficult to hear the Maids\u2019 sparkling\nwit and ad-libbing as well as many of\nthe intricate harmonies. Another issue with the venue was the number of\npeople pushing past to get to the bar,\nbut again, there\u2019s not much you can do\nabout this in a bar.\nThe second set contained my absolute favourite number of the night:\nMaid in the Mirror. Yes, you heard me\nright; a girly take on that Michael Jackson classic Man in the Mirror complete with impassioned hand gestures,\n\u201cIf Jeff Goldblum is\nhere I\u2019m going to\ngo up to him and\nask him if he wants\na blowjob\u201d\na few sch-mos and he-hes and some\nvery impressive riffing. Also rating\nhighly was a rather unique version of\nSesame Street, I\u2019d never have expected\nto find a children\u2019s TV theme tune in\na Cabaret set but it was charming and\nvery well done.\nAfter a short break, the Maids were\nback for their final set which took on\na more musical theatrey tone starting with a few Sondheim classics- the\nwell performed, if slightly predictable\n\u201cMaid in the\nMirror...a girly take\non that Michael\nJackson classic\u201d\nYou Could Drive a Person Crazy and\na beautiful arrangement of Send In\nThe Clowns. This was followed by another highlight that caused most of the\ncrowd to burst into fits of laughter- a\nwell judged I Know Him So Well with\nbrilliant impressions of Elaine Paige\nand Barbara Dickson by Kate and Jen\nrespectively.\nThe Three Little Maids definitely\nstood up to their motto of Cheek\nCharming Close Harmony Cabaret,\nit was a fun evening filled with perfect harmonies and some great comedy moments. I\u2019d love to see them in a\nCabaret orientated space so that their\npersonalities could really shine.\nIf you\u2019re interested in where the Maids\nwill be next, check out their website\nwww.threelittlemaids.net!\nT\nhe experience of the production \u2013 highly interac-tive, alternating between\nclaustrophobia, disorien-tating confusion and visual excitement \u2013 was fantastic. Locked\ninside an industrial mill-like structure containing a three-leveled stage,\nthe audience was subjected to varying kinds of theatric abuse: first pitch\nblack darkness, billowing winds and\nthe overbearing sound of an onrushing\ntrain, followed by bribing us, the audi-ence, into good humour through free\nchampagne and multicolored plastic\nballs to throw at each other, and finishing with a group sing-along and a\nHouse of Commons-style ruckus. RSC\nit wasn\u2019t; challenging, different and fun\nit was. Continually moved around the\nstage\u2019s different levels, harassed and\nprovoked, our audience shifted from\nsevere shyness at first to keen involvement by the end.\nThe production company Shunt have\nto be praised for pursuing a change to\nconventional theatre that draws a concrete line between audience and cast.\nThis sought to confuse that boundary,\nforcibly bringing the audience into the\nshow and making them keen partici-pants. Each show becomes different to\nthe last as different audiences react in\ndifferent ways. The fractured narrative\nserves to confuse the audience until\nthey learn to adjust to it.\nThe play itself was not as enjoyable,\nindeed it made little sense, supposedly based around a financial crash\nand loosely following the plot line of\na businessman first seeking start-up\ncapital, then relishing his success but\nwith much of the text cut out by the\nproduction.\nCharacterisation besides this lead\nrole was weak and unneeded, however,\nbecause the priority was clearly the\nvisual, experimentative and interactive\naspect of the show, based in what appeared to be a giant industrial revolu-tion-era contraption.\nA twisted, mute monster moved\nfreely around the various levels of the\nstage, an Orthodox Jewish family lived\nin the bottom stage next door to a\nsteam room, plastic balls fall from the\nsky, it doesn\u2019t make much sense, but\nwas bloody fun nonetheless.\nDominic MacIver\nS\npeculation, why it is the one\ninducement we have to live\u2026\nwhy on earth would you have\nme loosen my purse strings\nand risk my fortune, if you do\nnot promise me some extraordinary en-joyment, some sudden happiness which\nwill open heaven to me?\nPoignant words. Especially in 2010\nwhen we are still smarting from the\ncollapse of a certain banking establishment and all its ensuing economic and\nmonetary chaos.\nWords that would have also been\nsaid with a sense of irony following the\ncollapse of the Union Gen\u00e8rale\u2019s on the\nParis Bourse in 1882. A fiasco that precipitated a recession that lasted well\ninto the following decade.\nIt is the downfall of this financial institution which inspired Emile Zola\u2019s\n1891 novel L\u2019Argent, which in turn\ninspired Shunt Theatre to create their\nown abstract interpretation, Money.\nLocated in an old tobacco warehouse just a hop over the river from\nLondon\u2019s own financial district, the\nShunt Collective treat us to theatre as\nwe have never experienced before. A\nhuge three-storey box, stairs climbing\nits visible side, stands industrial and\nthreatening in the warehouse space.\nQuite a contrast to the scene before it\nwhere the audience sit by the bar under fairy lights, at tables and chairs, as\nushers wearing riot helmets stoically\ngive out coloured balloons. Moments\nlater the balloons are snatched back\nand we are forced out of our seats, up\nthe iron stairs and into the pitch black\nbox itself.\nFor the next ninety minutes the cast\nof six baffle us, astound us and even\nsometimes scare us with their random\ntake on Zola\u2019s story.\nNeur, his girlfriend, the steam room\nguy and the spooky, painted and half-naked acrobat that inhabits the rafters invite the audience in to answer\nback, participate (if brave enough) and\nto even throw balls at them. You will\nnot have seen a play in which you are\nrelocated upstairs after half an hour\nto watch the action two floors below\nthrough Perspex floors. You will have\nnot been served champagne mid-show\neither, or sung along to Randy Newman, karaoke style. And nor will you\nhave had a Willy Wonka\u2019s factory experience where the \u2018vessel\u2019 you reside\nin ejects steam, blows air and reverberates all around you. Nor is it likely that\nyou will ever witness a play that unfolds around, above and below you\u2026 at\nleast for quite some time.\nMoney is virtually unfathomable\nfor the most part. But for all the pain,\nadrenaline and fear inflicted on our\nsenses: who cares!\nCaz Knight\nShunt Collective\u2019s play Money sets our hearts racing\nWant to see it?\n5 pairs of tickets for a performance on Tuesday 8th of June at\n7.30pm are available FREE to\nthe first FIVE people to send an\nemail to:\nnahum@shunt.co.uk\nMoney is booking until\nSeptember\nHALF PRICE TICKETS are also\navailable for selected performances in June (Tue, Wed & Thu)\nTickets are \u00a310 (Normal price\n\u00a320) Book online at\nwww.wegottickets.com/f/971\nPromotional Code: 5hunt\nwww.shuntmoney.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "with our relationship. I remember\nthat she said things about her af-fair, my absence, my unresponsive-ness. They both mentioned my\nchildhood, which I thought was\nslightly strange and intrusive, but\nI didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 I couldn\u2019t\nstop staring at the wall.\nThe therapist stopped Joni, final-ly, turned to me and asked: \u201cWhat\ndo you think about that, Paul?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was on Mir,\u201d I began and\nJoni leant forwards. \u201cOne of the\nRussian guys \u2013 he\u2019d already been\nthere a while when we arrived \u2013\nasked us to bring up a book of\npaint swatches because there\u2019s almost nothing there that isn\u2019t black\nor white. He\u2019d spend whole hours\nafter work, flicking through this\nbig, glossy Dulux paint book, gazing at the colours.\u201d\nThe therapist nodded and fur-thered, gently: \u201cHow did you feel\nabout that, Paul?\u201d\nI glanced at her, shrugged my\nshoulders. \u201cOh, it was okay.\u201d I gestured to her purple emulsion office\nwalls. \u201cThese walls \u2013 Amethyst\nFalls, right?\u201d\nJoni listed more things she didn\u2019t\nlike about me until our appointment was over.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take the bus back,\u201d she\nsaid to me, when we were leaving. I\ndidn\u2019t try to stop her and she didn\u2019t\ncome home. We didn\u2019t go to counselling after that.\n*\nPaul buys Joni a white-gold ring\nand they move together to Houston\nwhen he\u2019s accepted into the candidacy training program at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Centre. In the\nprogram, Paul makes friends with\nDenny Buller \u2013 a native to Texas,\nwho jokes about never leaving the\nstate except once, to travel for two\ndays and two hundred miles straight\nup. Denny Buller and his wife Karen\ninvite Paul and Joni around for barbeques at the weekend. Joni gets a\njob teaching drama at the local elementary school but quits in 1994\nto have their first child, a girl, called\nSophie. Paul buys Joni a pair of diamond earrings, buys Sophie a crib\nand begins training for STS-75 to\nMir, estimated launch date: February 17th, 1996.\nPhysics is not enough for the\nPAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE\nJohnson Space Centre, and Paul\nbrings home colossal textbooks\nwith reams of diagrams and fine-print on microbiology, chemistry\nand materials science.\n\u201cAt least you\u2019ll be fit!\u201d jokes the\nlibrarian, but Paul ups his running\nto five miles a day, just in case.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this, Paul,\u201d Joni yells.\n\u201cAll you ever do is read and run.\u201d\nShe slams the door when she takes\nSophie to the park but she comes\nhome later, kisses him and says,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 I know how much this\nmeans to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to be better,\u201d Paul prom-ises. He calls her from work when\nhe\u2019s going to be late; he tells her\nhe loves her. Sophie learns how\nto walk and talk. Paul learns how\nzero-gravity effects regulatory proteins in bacterial gene expression,\nbut Denny thinks faster, can run\nfor longer and he gets the placement to join the three Russian cosmonauts out on Mir.\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch the next one,\u201d Paul jokes\nat Denny\u2019s weekend barbeque but\ndrinks a bit too much and yells at\nJoni in the kitchen when they get\nhome.\nThe next weekend, Paul leaves\nSophie with his parents, and takes\nJoni to New York. They see her favourite show on Broadway and he\npulls her close to him in the hotel\nbed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he tells her. \u201cI know\nthat I\u2019ve been difficult, recently.\u201d\nNeither of them can imagine,\nthen, Paul wrecking the family car\nin April 1997, or Joni packing a\nsuitcase and moving to her sister\u2019s.\nThis is still January, 1996. Whilst\nthey are in New York, Denny\u2019s\nwife, Karen catches measles from\nher nephew; Denny is quarantined\nfor three weeks and the director of\nthe Johnson Space Centre replaces\nhim with Paul on STS-75.\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch the next one,\u201d Denny\njokes on the phone to Paul, and\nhe brings his wife cups of tea until\nshe\u2019s well. Paul still reads and runs\nand goes to work, but he\u2019s crossing\noff days on the calendar like kids\ncounting down to Christmas and\npointing out Orion to Sophie in the\nmiddle of the night.\n*\nI\u2019m trying hard, these days, to figure out how I could have gotten\nthings so wrong. I\u2019ve retraced my\nsteps to Hoosier Hill on the winter\nsolstice and visited the house Henry Duke used to live in. I even tried\nto get an appointment to see John\nGlenn last month, but ended up\nsitting in an uncomfortable chair\nin his offices for two hours, staring at a huge framed photograph\nof a young John Glenn posing,\nhelmet under arm, in front of the\nAmerican flag. I\u2019m trying to decide\nwhether I will be Henry Duke, divorced and angry, or John Glenn,\npolished and proud.\nIn spring, on Thursday the 22nd\nof March, the space station Mir\nwas officially de-orbited. It re-en-tered the atmosphere in the early\nhours of Friday morning, breaking\napart over the South Pacific. It had\nbeen whole when I was there, and\nmade of aluminium \u2013 not acrylic\n\u2013 but that was then, and Sophie\nturns seven next week, so I\u2019m trying hard.\nSince coming out of the hospi-tal, I\u2019ve been going to visit Denny,\nstill in Texas, still firing up the barbeque at the weekend, and we talk\nthings over.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Paul,\u201d he says, flipping burgers in the sun. \u201cBut I don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019re nuts. Did something\nhappen to you up there?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing happened at all,\u201d I\nsay, and it\u2019s the truth. NASA\u2019s psychiatrist visited the hospital and\nspent some time with me, trying\nto assess whether or not I was plotting a lawsuit or something. The\nguy in the bed next to me urged me\nto sue, told me about Henry Duke,\nand told me I had a really good\ncase. He\u2019s probably still there.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go and say sorry to\nJoni,\u201d I tell him.\nHe nods wisely, flattens the red\nmeat on the grill. \u201cSure, that\u2019s a\ngood idea \u2013 but you need to know\nwhat you\u2019re saying sorry first,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cBecause she\u2019ll ask you and if\nyou don\u2019t have an answer\u2026 Well,\nboy, does it drive Karen crazy.\u201d\nBut Karen still answers the phone\nwhen he calls.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t total my car and check\ninto the loony bin, Paul,\u201d Denny\nsays. \u201cYou figure out why you\u2019re\nsorry.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m trying to figure that out,\nbecause Sophie will be seven next\nweek and her father is still making appointments with John Glenn\nand her mother still won\u2019t answer\nthe phone when I call.\n*\nThere is a large portrait of Lyndon\nB. Johnson\u2019s face, jowly and stern,\nin the lobby at the Johnson Space\nCentre. Sophie points at it when\nshe goes in, holding tightly to her\nmother\u2019s hand, but only because\nit\u2019s big \u2013 she doesn\u2019t recognise\nthe face. She might\u2019ve recognised\nJohn F. Kennedy\u2019s face, Johnson\u2019s\npopular predecessor, but Kennedy\nwasn\u2019t from the Lone Star State\nand Texas re-christened the space\ncentre in their son\u2019s name after the\nthird heart attack claimed him.\n\u201cGood luck, buddy,\u201d Denny says\nand embraces his friend in 1996.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not mad, are you?\u201d Paul\nasks.\n\u201cNot mad, no. Maybe a little disappointed,\u201d says Denny. \u201cI thought\nI was all set, ready to go. I wrote my\nletter and everything.\u201d\n\u201cLetter?\u201d\n\u201cSure, you know \u2013 I wrote a letter\nfor Karen and for my folks, in case\nanything happened to me. So they\ncan remember me.\u201d\nPaul raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat\nsounds a little grim for you, Denny.\u201d\nDenny only laughs. \u201cI just like\nthings the way I like \u2018em.\u201d He slaps\nPaul on the shoulder. \u201cGo make\nsure everything\u2019s ready for my arrival up there, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nPaul doesn\u2019t write a letter, and\ndoesn\u2019t need one. Joni tells Sophie to wave at the window and\nshe watches with tears in her eyes\nwhen he takes off. Paul\u2019s parents\nare there, too, and Frank.\nAmong the things Paul takes with\nhim, he has photographs, the book\nof paint swatches and a Creedence\nClearwater Revival CD. Once, Paul\nGarton\u2019s father had driven him \u2013\nnot Frank \u2013 out to the Veterans\nMemorial Park, and told him that\nthere were some days when he\nwished he\u2019d only ever sold secondhand cars.\nPaul makes a two day and two-hundred mile journey as the only\nAmerican astronaut joining a team\nof three Russian cosmonauts who\nare still building and rebuilding\nthe thing. They speak limited English to him and perform tethered\nspacewalks to maintain the space\nstation. Paul\u2019s been assigned the\ntask of eight biomechanical experiments and all are ultimately\ninconclusive.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of sick of this,\u201d Paul says\nto the paint-swatch Russian, one\nhundred and seventeen days in.\n\u201cNASA will send another soon,\u201d\nsays the Russian as some form of\nconsolation. Paul makes a weak\njoke about putting an ad in USA\nToday for a Mir roommate to take\nhis place.\n\u201cProbably non-smoker, right?\u201d\nPaul says. The Russian smiles a\nlittle but says nothing. He holds\na swatch up to Paul, taps a green\nsquare called Willow Creek and\ngives him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cThis one is good,\u201d the\nRussian asserts.\nIn the one hundred and forty-eight days before Denny arrives\non STS-76 to relieve him, Paul\nlearns almost all of the Dulux paint\nnames, Sophie learns to count and\nrecite the alphabet, and Joni has an\naffair with a guy she meets in the\ngrocery store.\n*\nJoni picks up the phone on Saturday evening, after I\u2019ve called four\ntimes. She probably picks it up to\ntell me to stop calling, but I cut in\nbefore she slams down the receiver.\n\u201cJoni, please,\u201d I blurt. \u201cI\u2019ve already\nbought her a birthday present.\u201d\nJoni\u2019s voice is cold, I can hear her\nsister in the background: \u201cJoni, just\nhang up the phone.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, so that\u2019s a good reason to talk to you? That\u2019s going to\nmake things better, right, Paul?\u201d\nshe says. \u201cBuying things. That\u2019ll fix\neverything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d I expect the line to go dead but when it\ndoesn\u2019t, I venture: \u201cI want to come\nand see you; I want to say sorry.\u201d\n\u201cSorry for what?\u201d (Denny was\nright)\n\u201cUh \u2013 for everything.\u201d\nShe scoffs. \u201cI bet you are.\u201d (\u201cJoni\n\u2013 hang up.\u201d)\n\u201cI am, I am,\u201d I start scrambling\nfor words and none of them seem\ngood enough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for never\ncaring enough about you when I\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this, Paul,\u201d Joni yells. \u201cAll you\never do is read and run.\u201d She slams the door\nwhen she takes Sophie to the park but she\ncomes home later, kisses him and says, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry \u2013 I know how much this means to you.\u201d\n10 11 12 13\n\n"

    "content": "Last Tuesday, I went to see Switchfoot\nat the HMV Forum in Camden, as part\nof the UK leg of their worldwide Mess\nof Me tour. The band, originally from\nSan Diego, California, and their music have been variously described as\nsurfer, alternative, rock and Christian.\nWhile the C-word can put some people\noff, it\u2019s refreshing to hear deeper lyrics\nin songs like \u201cThe Sound\u201d (civil rights)\nand it never feels preachy, because that\nis not what the band is about. \u201cThese\nsongs are about things I don\u2019t really un-derstand: God, girls and politics,\u201d Jon\nForeman, Switchfoot\u2019s front-man, told\nthe crowds. I think there\u2019s something\nwe can all relate to in that.\nThe evening started, as all concerts\nmust, in the queue outside. Since\nSwitchfoot isn\u2019t really well-known on\nthis side of the Atlantic, I wasn\u2019t expecting a crush but I was surprised by the\nway the queue snaked around the back\nof the venue and into a nearby business\npark. It was all very amiable, despite\nthe grey early evening drizzle that was\nbeginning to come down. From what\nI (over)heard in nearby conversations,\nthere was a healthy mix of Switchfoot\nvirgins and veterans, like myself. On\nthe door, the bouncer confiscated my\nwater \u2013 I can understand that; London\ntap-water is pretty strong stuff.\nThe Forum used to be an Art-Deco\ncinema and this is apparent in the mu-sic-hall feel to the interior. It is by no\nmeans a large venue but this added a\nmore personal edge to the night. Even\nstanding at the back (which, admit-tedly, was not far away), I still felt really\nconnected to the act. The hall was full\nbut not packed, so there was still room\nfor some healthy rocking out.\nWarming up the crowd was The Audio Cartel, which sounded like a stereotypical rock band. They had a lot of\nelectric guitar riffs...and not much else.\nAfter they left and the techies had fiddled around a bit, a second supporting\nact took to the stage. Again, a band I\nhad never heard of, this time called\nFlood of Red. They didn\u2019t differ too\nmuch from the first act, apart from\nsome head-banging thrown into the\nmix. Overall, they were a bit too much\nhard rock for my liking. It wasn\u2019t until\npast 9 when Switchfoot finally made an\nappearance; I was not greatly amused\nby this since the doors had opened at 7.\nHowever, any gripes I had swiftly\nfell away as the band promptly opened\nwith \u201cNeedle and Haystack Life\u201d from\ntheir new album \u201cHello Hurricane.\u201d As\nI scanned the stage for lead singer Foreman, he appeared on the stairs above\nthe crowd and sang his way through\nthe fans (I\u2019d like to see that at the O2!).\nIn seconds, the crowd was alive with\nexcitement. Switchfoot then dipped\nliberally into their back catalogue to\nplay some real crowd-pleasers; I swear\nthe audience went mental when they\nstarted playing \u201cGone\u201d.\nThe set-list had something for every-one; fast, slow, new, old, it was all there.\nSwitchfoot on UK leg of world tour\nSwitchfoot\nHMV Forum\n1st June\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nRhys Davies queues, parties and gets his water confiscated. You can never be too careful at Christian-rock gigs\n14\nfelix FRIDAY 04 JUNE 2010\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk MUSIC\nEnergetic songs like \u201cOh Gravity!\u201d gave\nway to slower, more balladic ones like\n\u201cYour Love is a Song\u201d before bringing\nthings back up to pace with the likes of\n\u201cBullet Soul.\u201d The crowd loved every\nminute of it. They were jumping and\nshouting and cheering and singing\nalong with everything and Foreman\nplayed them brilliantly. It made for a\nreal collaborative effort. Even without\nthe fans\u2019 copious help, Foreman was\nan impeccable showman, bouncing\naround the stage with near-limitless\npassion and energy. By the end of the\nnight, he was drenched in sweat.\nAs the concert drew to a close, I was\ndisappointed that, given that they had\nplayed so many of their best songs,\nSwitchfoot didn\u2019t play \u201cHello Hurricane\u201d from the album of the same\nname, an instant classic in itself. But\nI should have known better. They had\nsaved it for the inevitable encore, called\nout by the crowd ululating the opening\nnotes while stamping their feet. As a\nsong to go out on, it truly elevated the\nevening to a top-class performance by\na most awesome band.\nSwitchfoot have headed off to Germany now for the next part of their\ntour but if I\u2019ve piqued your interest,\nthey will be playing at the Download\nFestival later this month. Go on, check\n\u2018em out \u2013 you might just like them!\nThey\u2019re all wearing exactly 3 pieces of clothing, must be their thing...\nMore information can by found online:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\nt: 020 7594 9444\ne: accommodation@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nLondon over the\nSummer or you\u2019re\njust visiting for\na few days, keep\nthings simple by\nstaying with us.\nWe\u2019ve got rooms\navailable in\nWilson House,\nPaddington and\nFisher Hall, South\nKensington, which\nare both ideal for\ngetting around\nLondon.\n\n"

They just do one style or a novelty thing like jazzing up pop songs.\nWe do a bit of everything.\nJen: We do just what we want to do, we\ntry not to do things others could do, we\nput a bit of ourselves in it.\nKate: It\u2019s a cross between cabaret and\ncomedy! Our rule is for every serious\nsong, we\u2019ll do three funny songs. And\nwe do always pay homage to our true\nlove, musical theatre. But the 60s pop\nsongs have been going down well in\nour Old Vic Pit Bar gigs.\nAlex: The thing I\u2019m proud of is not\ntaking ourselves seriously, we\u2019re a little\nbit silly and have remained true to our\nindividual personalities and our loves,\nI\u2019ll wank over some Sondheim, Kate\nwill pay homage to Judy Garland\u2026\nMost of you have links with Imperial through MTSoc and MTSoc\ntour, so can scientists make good\nperformers/lovers?\nJen: My boyfriend is a scientist and he\nloves musical theatre.

We did some\ngigs in Jen\u2019s hometown of Norwich at\nthe Sewell Barn which was lovely and\nintimate.\nJen: I like working with these two because they make me laugh. My pleasure\nis to work with such talented people\nas these guys. They have these amazing arrangements and I\u2019d never get the\nopportunity to work with people like\nthem anywhere else.\nKate: I enjoy our banter, we\u2019re never\nquite sure what we\u2019re doing next. Alex\ngenerally plays Mum and I\u2019ll talk until\nsomeone tells me to stop.\nAlex: I feel we have a real partnership\nso that we can trust our instincts to\nknow what to do on stage. We can be\nourselves with people we trust.\nIf the Three Little Maids could be\njoined by 3 Little Men, who would\nyour dream men be?\nAll: Oooh!\nJen: Philip Quast! And Hugh Jackman\n(Alex intercepts with a cry of \u201cNo not\nHugh Jackman!\u201d) And Zubin Varla! He\nwas in Jesus Christ Superstar and he\u2019s\nin Warhorse at the moment.\nKate: Can he be dead? Gene Kelly, and\nhe\u2019d choreograph all our numbers.\nAlex: I would have the Australian\ngod Philip Quast too. Or, I think we\u2019d\npush all of those in the sea if Stephen\nSondheim joined us on the piano. Leo\ncan join in and clap along, or turn the\npages.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite song to sing?\nKate: I know what I like- Chattanooga\nChoo Choo.\nJen: Send in the Clowns as that was\nthe first thing we arranged. Also, Wash\nthat Man as I\u2019m a real Rodgers and\nHammerstein geek. Plus Leo does an\nawesome version of Sesame Street so\nthat\u2019d be his favourite.\nAlex: I like Drive My Car too, we do a\ngreat version ala Lily Allen which the\naudiences love. Three Little Maids ob-viously, our title song. Everyone loves\nit when we do it as an encore as we can\njust mess around and it goes down really well. The other two don\u2019t agree but\nI like closing with Better from A Class\nAct (Lucy at this point cries I love that\nsong!).\nKate: I\u2019m totes over it. It went down\nlike a sack of poo last time. I know my\nfavourite! Man in the Mirror! How did\nwe forget that? It\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ll\never see ever! Jen gets all black on us.\nAlex: Kate rives around on the floor.\nJen: Alex bursts out from a curtain.\nWhat\u2019s in store for the Three Little\nMaids and yourselves individually?\nKate: Worldwide fame, millions in the\nbank, lots of lovers.\nJen: This summer is packed with private gigs. I really enjoy doing private\ngigs because the good thing about\n\u201cI\u2019ll wank over\nsome Sondheim,\nKate will pay\nhomage to Judy\nGarland\u2026\u201d\nthem is that as we arrange our own\nsongs, if someone has a favourite\nsong, we\u2019re happy to accommodate.\nPlus from each gig we get another gig,\nwhich is a bonus!\nAlex: We\u2019re hoping to have some sort\nof Industry launch in London, invite\nanyone who\u2019s interested to see us or\nmanage us or hire us!\n\u201cNo, not Hugh\nJackman!\u201d\nKate I\u2019m doing a musical at the\nYoung Vic, The Human Comedy in\nSeptember.\nAlex: I\u2019m singing in the Stephen Sondheim performer of the year final, hopefully that\u2019ll go nicely. Plus I\u2019m playing\nDesiree in A Little Night Music at\nRAM.\nJen: I\u2019m starting RAM in the Autumn\nbut at the moment I\u2019m a primary\nschool teacher.\nLeo: I\u2019m musical directing Hamlet the\nMusical at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nWe were hoping it would star Tim\nMinchin but sadly he\u2019s turned down\nthe role.\nAlex: I want to play Ophelia! If Leo can\nwangle it. And if it pays.\nAlex Young: \u201cMaid in Taiwan\u201d Kate Marlais: \u201cMaid in Heaven\u201d Jennifer Woodward: \u201cBar Maid\u201d\n\n"

The car, a specially modified\nelectric supercar called the SRzero, is\nbased on a chassis and body from the\nSR8 by Radical Sportscars. It sports\ntwo lightweight motors designed and\nbuilt by EVO Electrics - an Imperial\ncompany. The 1100kg SRzero has a\ntop speed of 200km/h, can accelerate\nfrom 0-100km/h in 7 seconds and is\ncapable of fully charging its 56kWh\nbattery from Thundersky in just 6\nhours.\nImperial\u2019s RGE team testing the\nSRzero against the M25 is part of\ntheir build-up to an attempt to drive\nthrough the 26,000km Pan-American\nHighway in July. Commenting on the\nM25 test, Imperial said that \u2018\u2019part of\nthe project will help assess the performance and endurance capabilities\nof electric vehicles over long dis-tances. We also hope that driving the\ncar across two continents will raise\nawareness along the way about the\nbenefits of electric vehicles and dispel\nthe public perception of electric cars\nas slow and unattractive, with a limited range.\u2019\u2019\nThe move is a step forward for electric cars, following the unprecedented\nperformance of the Tesla Roadster\nwhich additionally travelled 313 miles\non a single charge and was featured\non Top Gear. With the twin motors\nof the SRzero tuned for endurance\nrather than performance, Imperial\nsaid \u2018\u2019it has an average running cost of\none penny per mile and a range of approximately 400km before the battery\nneeds recharging.\u2019\u2019\nThe project is part of the Energy\nFutures Lab, Imperial\u2019s sector for energy research. Director of the Energy\nFutures Lab, Professor Nigel Brandon,\nsaid that \u2018\u2019apart from being great fun,\nwe hope that the Racing Green Endurance project will show the world the\nAlex Karapetian\nAlex Karapetian\nDave thought it\u2019d be like Mario Karts. 2 years later he still hasn\u2019t dropped a\nbanana on the road\nImperial Supercar breaks record\nleaps and bounds that electric vehicles are making\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2019this project\nis also helping the next generation of\nUK engineers to gain valuable experience in the field, which is vital for\ntheir careers and the future of British\nmanufacturing.\u2019\u2019\nThe Imperial team will embark\non their 26,000km journey from the\nnorthern tip of Alaska to the southern tip of South America through 14\ncountries in July.\nFormer Sabb tells students in\nneed of welfare to \u201clearn to\nspeak for yourself\u201d\nChristian Carter\u2019s statement in full:\n\u201cThe university will always need student representation for those students\nwho can\u2019t speak for themselves. For\nthose students who aren\u2019t morons then\nthe sabbatical officers are a waste of\ntime. As a student, ask yourself this\nquestion. Have you ever needed the\nhelp of a sabbatical officer? If the answer is yes, and it was for Welfare or\nEducational purposes then I feel sorry\nfor you and you should learn to speak\nfor yourself and challenge your depart-ment. If it was for a club or society\nrelated issue then your answer could\nprobably be answered by a member of\nstaff. If it was for any other reason then\nyou are a proper hack and probably\nneed psychiatric attention.\n\u201d\nF\normer Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services) Christian\nCarter was asked to give his\nviews on whether students run\nfor Sabbatical positions out of passion\nfor student issues or a cynical desire to\nfluff up their CVs. Instead he suggested that student officers only exist for\nstudents who \u201ccan\u2019t speak for themselves\u201d and ridiculed students who require welfare or educational support.\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\u0005 \u0005 \b\u0007\u0003\u0005\u0003 \u000e\n\u000f\u0010\u0010\u0002\u0011\b \u0003\u0006 \u0005\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0011\u0012 \b\u0005\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0002\u0011 \b\u000f\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0003\u0007\b\u0005\u0004 \u0005 \u000e\n\u0003\u0007\u000f\u0010\n\u0011\u0002\u000f\u0005\u0012\u0005\u0013\u0014\u000f\n\u0015 \u0016\u0017\u0003\u0004 \u0018\u0005 \u0003\u0007\u0003\u0005\u000e \u0007\n\u0018 \u0016\u0017\u0003\u0004 \u0018\n\u0005\n\u0019\u001a\u0019\u0005\u001b\u0011\u001c\u001d\u0005\u0019\u001d\u0019\u001d\n\u001e\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0005\u0001\u0006\b\u0003 \u0001\u0005\u0004 \u0006 \u000e\n\u001f\u0007\u0003\u0003\u0005 \u0014\u001e\u001e\u0018\u0005 \u0004\u0005\u0015!\b\u0002\u0003\u0005\n\u0007\u0005 \u0014\u001e!\u0005 \u0005\u0016\u0018\u0005 \u0004\u001e \u0004\u0003\u0005\u0006 \u0014\n\u0016\u0007\u0005\"\u0003#\u0018 \u0003\n\"\"\"$\u0004 \u001e \u0004\u0003$ \u0007 $\u0016!\nCarter was Deputy President\n(Finance & Services) in 2008/09\n\n"

Drinkers are\ndown in the pubs, clubbers out in the clubs,\ncouples were\u2026 doing whatever it is couples\ndo. Stepping out of the tube station, I am greeted\nby a group of middle-aged ladies all dressed up\nraring to go on the prowl. \u201cHey You!\u201d they shout at\nme; their tights are a little worse for wear, and their\nmake up is a little shoddy but I\u2019m a forgiving guy,\nso I greet them anyway. They aren\u2019t particularly\nattractive and I swear the blonde has some rather\nexcessive hair down her cleavage.\nAfter a couple of minutes, my somewhat\nmisplaced-where-the-sun-don\u2019t-shine brain starts\nto kick into action: the deep, coarse voices, the diva-tastic hair, the unnecessary extra blusher (blue so\ndidn\u2019t suit her). I sigh. At least I\u2019m in the right place.\nAfter a brisk walk through two parks, one friendly\nneighbourhood,onenotsofriendlyestateandafew\nBY TRISTAN BROWN\nalleys, I finally reach the venue. To little surprise,\nI am greeted by a six foot man dressed from head,\nand indeed, to foot in a kimono. Of course I am.\nComplete with a thick and voluptuous wig, had it\nnot been for his massive collar bone or his stubble\nor perhaps the pointed nose, I would have mistaken\nhim for quite a her. Quite an impressive her.\nDear reader, allow me to attempt to enlighten\nyou as to how I managed to get myself into such a\nsituation. I\u2019m a bit of a photographer, I do so enjoy\nit and I take pleasure in lively subjects. Surfing\nthe web for events to photograph leads me to a\nmyriad of options, naturally. The one event that\nreally caught my eye though, was entitled \u201cthe\nTranny Olympics.\u201d Intriguing. Always up for new\nthings, I thought why not? Twenty minutes later,\nafter a quick call to the organiser, I was the official\nphotographer for the Tranny Olympics 2009.\n\u201cTo little surprise, I am greeted\nby a six foot man dressed from\nhead, and indeed, to foot in a\nkimono.

    "content": "\u201cA bunch of crazy guys,\u201d says my friend, when I asked her about her\ninvolvement in Photosoc committee for over two years. \u201cCrazy about\nphotography of course.\u201d More than a hundred years after it\u2019s founding,\nPhotosoc is still the thumping heart of the photography scene in Imperial.\nPhotosoc\u2019s repertoire offers something on the plate for both experienced\nand beginners, for both hobbyist and hardcore enthusiast.\n\u201cJoining Photosoc allowed me to take my photography to a whole new\nlevel. From the trips to exhibitions that are organized and subsidised to\nbeing able to bounce ideas off people to having access to almost any piece\nof equipment I can think of, Photosoc has a lot to offer\u201d said Slobodan\nRadoslavljevi.\n\u201cPhotosoc has a good combination of keen film camera users and\ndigital camera users, plus they have a range of tutorials and talks from\nprofessionals, as well as nice equipments for photo developing,\u201d describes\nCharles Poon, who used to be the photographer for his high school, \u201cI have\nlearnt much from fellow photographers, and find it really easy to enhance\nmy skills especially on film developments and editing photos through\nphotoshop.\u201d\nThe key event that made Photosoc what it is today is the acquisition of\na darkroom in the West Wing of Beit Quad back in 2001. The darkroom\nopened up a whole new facet of photography for its members.\n\u201cUp to this year, I had never had any experience with film photography,\ndealing purely with a digital workflow. Once I attended one of the many\nPhotosoc film developing and printing sessions, I was hooked!\u201d said\nTristan Brown, \u201cI am now an avid film photographer, and can\u2019t think of an\nenjoyable use of an evening than locking myself in the darkroom with a big\nbag of rolls.\u201d\nPhotosoc also serves as a platform for its members to showcase their\npictures. They have a flickr group where members post up picture taken\nduring Photosoc excursions, and an annual exhibition at Imperial\u2019s very\nown Blyth Gallery.\nTheir exhibition this year, It\u2019s a Small World, deals with the microscopic to\nthe epic, challenging the viewer\u2019s perception of size and scale.\n\u201cThis year we tried a couple of different things like trying to display a\ncouple of pieces in the physical form of their subject,\u201d explained Slobodan.\n\u201cIt involved lots of wire and glue and was maybe more trouble than it was\nworth, but was nice to look at.\u201d The results are particularly interesting\nexhibits like the panoramic shots hung with bent iron strips to create a\ncircular display that engulfs the viewers in the landscape, and a sequence\nof water droplet photos hung in a helical cascade which exudes a a sense\nof temporality and motion. - GHC\nPhotography by Jonathan Kim (Photosoc Chair 09/10)\nPHOTOSOC\nIMPERIAL RULE 22 23 24 25 26 27\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 04 JUNE 2010\nFILM\nFilm Editor\nFilm Editor Ed Knock\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJohnPark\nJohnPark\nDirector Shawn Levy\nScreenwriter Josh Klausner\nCast Steve Carell, Tina Fey, James\nFranco, Mila Kunis\nDate Night\nDate Night fails to impress\nWe are first introduced to the Fosters. Claire (Fey) is a realtor and Phil\n(Carell) is a tax advisor. They are married with kids and once a week, they\nhave a date night, an evening spent\noutside their house, away from their\nchildren; just the two of them having\na not-so-special meal in a local steak-house. But their lives have become so\nrepetitive and bland that there is no\nspark anymore. They are both so tired\nall the time and there seems to be no\nsuch thing as passion in their marriage.\nEventually they want a break and\nsomething entirely new. So on yet another date night, they go to a big, fancy,\nglamorous restaurant in the city, without a reservation. Do they manage to\nget a table? Not a chance. But by saying\nthey are the Tripplehorns, they are able\nto steal someone else\u2019s reservation. So\nfar so good: they\u2019re having nice food,\nspending a great time, and things are\nreally starting to look up. But this is\nuntil a couple of mobsters (Common,\nJimmi Simpson) pay a visit to their ta-ble. It turns out that the Tripplehorns\nare in some serious trouble for angering a gangster boss. The bad guys now\nthink the Fosters are the Tripplehorns\nfor obvious reasons and of course, they\nwill stop at nothing to kill them. So\nthe Fosters need to think and act fast:\nrun away from the two assassins, find\nthe real Tripplehorns and clear their\nnames.\nThe familiar concept of mistaken\nidentity works well to begin with, with\nFey and Carell making an incredibly\nlikable but more importantly, a convincing couple. There is nothing extraordinary about these two people,\nboth in terms of their looks and oc-cupation, so it\u2019s not too difficult to instantly relate to them. They\u2019re helpless\nand hopeless while being chased down\nby these two professional killers and\nthis is where their remarkable chemistry pays off. The chase itself is far\nfrom impressive, just some textbook\nstuff that\u2019s hardly anything special but\nit\u2019s the dialogue that comes out of our\nleads\u2019 mouths that at least keeps the\nfilm going with a sustainable, comic\ntone. The outrageously preposterous\nthings the two not-so-special civilians\nend up doing do have their moments\nof solid comedy for which the two outstanding leads deserve a lot of credit.\nWould this have been possible without\nFey or Carell? Very unlikely.\nBut the trouble is, as the film\nprogresses, it presents an incredibly unbalanced, unfocused mix of\naction and comedy that never quite\nreaches the high standards to satisfy\nthe two very different genres. We are\nintroduced to more characters: Mark\nWahlberg is Holbrooke, a security\ncontractor who refuses to put\non a shirt. James Franco and\nMila Kunis are the real Tripplehorns and Ray Liotta is\nthe angry villain. What these\nsupporting characters lack is\nany sense of purpose and\nmemorable quality.\nYes, Wahlberg works\nout and his shirtless\nappearance is very\ndifferent to what\nCarell\u2019s must be\nlike (ha ha), but this\ncannot last long.\nFranco and Kunis are a couple of\ndim, low-life, love-struck\nidiots who get into awk-ward, childish argu-ments. The supporting\ncharacters do not carry\nmuch humour, which is\na shame given the unlimited talents of Fey and\nCarell.\nThe action isn\u2019t much better either. There are some\ngunshots fired and there is the\ninevitable car-chase that the\ntrailer spent so long on adver-tising. But the chase turns out\nOh my Science!\nEdKnock\nEdKnock\nto be something that goes on endlessly\nin a completely adrenaline-free man-ner. The cars look slick, they are capable of travelling at very high speeds and\nthere is explosive music to go with that\nsequence but when this uninteresting,\none-note action carries on mindlessly,\nthat\u2019s exactly when the film starts to\nlose the plot and fails to engage the\naudience thoroughly. Exactly what did\nthe Tripplehorns do to upset Liotta so\nmuch? After a while, this seems lost on\nus, completely irrelevant, and it\u2019s not\nas if the conclusion is at all satisfying.\nWhat started off so well soon turns\ninto a mediocre action/comedy romp\nwannabe. This should have been a lot\nmore character-driven given the talents involved, but director Shawn Levy\nmakes the fatal mistake of loading this\nwith action scenes that are far from\nspectacular. Shockingly unmemorable,\nthe leading pair deserves so much better \u2013 any future collaboration between\nthe two will be more than welcome,\njust not with the same director and writers.\nO\nh God, it\u2019s so ridiculously easy to rip into\nthe scientific accuracy\nof films that I usually\nturn a blind eye and\nhope my intellect hasn\u2019t been permanently damaged by the typical onslaught of pseudo-technical jargon that\nwould make Faraday incinerate his lifetime work and declare humanity isn\u2019t\nworth the benefits of electricity.\nIt\u2019s usually the physicists among us\nwho get to raise their eyes to the heavens\nand groan at the blatant impracticabili-ties of burrowing to the Earth\u2019s core to\nnuke it back into full function and somehow prevent more lightning storms\nfrom destroying global landmarks. It\nbaffles me how movie posters proudly\ndisplay \u2018from the director of The Day After Tomorrow\u2019 as an indication of quality.\n\u201cNeutinos! Mutant! Earthquakes! Noah\u2019s\nArk!\u201d barks a semi-stoned Roland Emmerich at his special effect gurus and\nHey Presto! Six months down the line\nand we have 2012 and a fat pay cheque\nin the pocket of the said lazy German\nb***ard.\nFortunately, my subject, chemistry, is\nusually too dull to receive the special attention from Hollywood. \u201cOh My God\u201d\nis not the obvious reaction to \u201cthe chromium ion is increasing its oxidation\nstate, it\u2019s going to precipitate into a new\ncomplex!\u201d Whereas imagine Jon Voight\u2019s\nsincerely shocked expression when he\nhears \u201cthe quantum intensity of the\nHiggs bosons are reaching critical point,\nfive hundred more joules of dark matter and the galaxy will be crushed inside\nof a black hole!\u201d Oh Jon, remember the\n70s when you used to make good films?\nAfter pulling me out of the shower, my\ntherapist forced me to watch Midnight\nCowboy seven times to heal the mental\nanguish caused by Transformers.\nWhat has triggered this tirade of com-plaining, you might be wondering. Well,\nI settled down to watch Iron Man 2 the\nother day; it was as I predicted, terrible but the abuse Jon Favreau decided\nto give chemistry took me by surprise.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen Iron Man 2 and are\ndwelling in patient anticipation of its\n(not so) thrilling plot then I don\u2019t advise reading on, or in Internet speak -**Spoiler Alert**\nOur hero Tony Stark has developed\na nasty rash due to poisoning from the\nmini nuclear fusion reactor sticking out\nof his chest. It\u2019s alright though, as Sam\nJackson gives him a healthy dose of\nlithium dioxide to treat it. Wait a minute\nSam, you could have used any of the\nthousands of real chemicals to cure this\nmythical condition but no, you\u2019ve managed to force the lithium atom to accept\nthree more electrons pairs than is physically possible. I know I\u2019m being pedan-tic, but any half-bothered teenager with\ntwo C\u2019s in GCSE science could tell you\nthat lithium dioxide is a made up chemi-cal. How hard is it to say di-lithium oxide instead?\nIt gets much worse though. Apparently, LiO2\nisn\u2019t a very effective cure for the\nmetallic blue spider rash and so Tony\ndecides to make a new element him-self. Using a giant spanner and a laser\nhe manages to overcome the problem\nof overcrowding in the Periodic Table\nand make a nice shiny metal. Last time\nI checked, someone hadn\u2019t forgotten\nto discover the element between palladium and silver because there can\u2019t\npossibly be one! I suppose children will\nnow be squeezing toothpaste into the\nbathroom sink: \u201cTrying to make a new\nelement Mummy - just like Iron Man.\u201d\nThese crimes against science combined with Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s face\nprominently displayed on billboards are\nmaking me feel so depressed, I\u2019m rather\ntempted to try drugs. If you need me,\nI\u2019ve gone to see Robert Downey Jr about\na briefcase.\nke, a security\nses to put\nanco and\nreal TripLiotta is\nhat these\nrs lack is\ne and\ny.\ns\nruck\nawk-gung\nrry\nh is\nun-ey and\nuch bet-re some\nere is the\nthat the\non adver-turns out\nthe two will be more than welcome,\njust not with the same director and writers.\nSummer\nHighlights\nScott Pilgrim vs. The\nWorld\nHey, did you see the film where\nMichael Cera played a socially awkward\nteenager? In Scott Pilgrim he breaks\nthat typecast, well a little bit. Based\non the cult comic book series of the\nsame film, the titular hero of the film\nfalls in love with the girl of his dreams.\nUnfortunately, she has quite a history\nand Cera has to shed off his geeky\npersona and battle his new girlfriend\u2019s\nseven exes (not all of them male). The\nfilm is heavily inspired by computer\ngames and has a very unique graphic\nstyle. It looks like heaps of fun from\nthe trailer and Michael Cera\u2019s natural\ncharisma should complement the fast-paced action perfectly. He gets to wield a\nflaming sword - awesome!\nToy Story 3\nJonah Hex\nMegan Fox in a corset. Josh Brolin plays a\ndisfigured gunslinger with supernatural\npowers who seeks revenge against the\nman who murdered his family. There\u2019s\nbucketfuls of action involving dynamite-firing crossbows. Did I mention Megan\nFox in a corset?\nThe franchise that made Pixar a\nhousehold name returns with its third\ninstallment. Andy\u2019s all grown up now\nand is going to college so he donates his\nbeloved toys to a nursery. Not delighted\nby a lifetime of abuse by toddlers,\nWoody, Buzz and gang hatch an escape\nto rival that of Steve McQueen.\nFilm Editor\n\n"

He punched me back, of\ncourse, and was stronger than me\nso I fell down cold. It made local\nnews, apparently, but they didn\u2019t\nuse any names. I woke up in the\nhospital, and didn\u2019t get out for five\nmonths, until NASA\u2019s PR depart-ment-employed psychiatrist certified me fit to leave.\n\u201cOkay, Paul,\u201d Joni says. \u201cWe can\nmeet for lunch \u2013 tomorrow.\u201d\nHer sister groans in the back-ground, \u201cJoni...!\u201d and Joni sighs before she hangs up the phone.\n*\nPaul comes back numb. He doesn\u2019t\nburn up on re-entry; he doesn\u2019t\nsuffer any gravity sickness. He hugs\nhis parents, kisses Joni and holds\nhis daughter.\n\u201cYou seem different to me,\u201d he\nsays to his wife.\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d she says, but Paul\ndoesn\u2019t feel very different. The only\nthing that has really changed about\nPaul is that he doesn\u2019t talk about\nspace anymore.\nIt takes two weeks for him to\nstop assigning every colour he sees\na name from the Dulux range (the\nfront lawn was Green Parrot; Sophie\u2019s eyes were Liberty Blue). It\ntakes three weeks for him to realise\nthat Joni had slept with someone\nelse.\nIt all comes out one evening, a\nfew months since he\u2019s known, and\nJoni breaks down crying after din-ner, telling him how sorry she is,\nhow she wishes it had never happened and how none of it meant\na thing. Paul says nothing, doesn\u2019t\nknow what to say. As far as he\u2019s\nconcerned, this is not a surprise,\nnor was it particularly upsetting.\n\u201cHow can you be so cold?\u201d Joni\nsobs.\nHe considers this for a moment\nbut cannot find an answer. Joni\nwears a different shade of lipstick\nthese days. She has new clothes in\nthe wardrobe he\u2019s never seen her\nwear, there\u2019s new furniture in the\nliving room, different paintings on\nthe wall. It wasn\u2019t just the one-time\naffair that struck Paul upon coming home, it was like some other\nthing had moved in to take his\nplace during his absence and Sophie had gotten taller, and Joni had\ncut her hair.\nOne night, Joni leans over to him\nin bed and says, \u201cYou never talk\nabout space anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been there now,\u201d he\nsays.\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d And Joni\u2019s voice\nis edged with spite, \u201cSo where to\nnow, Paul?\u201d\nOn Mir, they never turn the\nlights off because someone is always working. On Mir, you get\nused to wearing eye-masks when\nyou crawl into your sleeping bag.\nOn Mir, you have to strap yourself\ndown just to take a piss.\nOne night, Paul walks up to\nJoni as she\u2019s washing up at the\nkitchen sink and holds her face in\nhis hands. He studies her features\ncarefully, dispassionately, and she\ndoesn\u2019t move at all.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thing about space,\u201d he\nbegins in a slow and precise voice.\n\u201cIt seems so beautiful, until you actually get there.\u201d\nIn the month after that, Joni\npacks and takes Sophie to her\nsister\u2019s.\n\u201cWe still have the appointment\nwith Dr. Gould, if you want to\ngo,\u201d she says over the phone. Paul\nstands in front of the half-empty\nwardrobe and shrugs.\n\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cShall I pick you\nup?\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ, Paul.\u201d\nAfter their last appointment\nwith the counsellor, Paul is sitting\nalone in their living room when\nhe catches the end segment on the\nnews. The news anchor announces\nthe safe arrival of Dennis Buller\nfrom his one-hundred-and-fifty\nday stint on Mir, and the brief clip\nshows him grinning, waving and\nkissing his wife. Then Frank calls,\n\u201cHey, Paul \u2013 I heard about Joni,\u201d\nhe says. There\u2019s static on the phone\nline; his voice fuzzes and crackles.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\nPaul starts drinking, and then\ngets into the second-hand car that\nhis father had given him (colour:\nVolcanic Splash) to drive to Joni\u2019s\nsister\u2019s. Of the things that Paul\nwishes he did and did not do, this\nis always the first one in the latter\ncategory.\n*\nDenny calls and says, \u201cBe nice, man\n\u2013 don\u2019t do anything stupid, just be\nnice.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good advice,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m\nglad you called.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to lead\nwith?\u201d\nI don\u2019t really know as yet, and\nshe\u2019s already booked a table for\ntomorrow.\nMore than once, when I was in\nthe hospital, I wished I had actually\nwritten one of Denny\u2019s in-case-of-death letters and burnt up coming\nhome. That way I could\u2019ve written\nmyself as I wanted to be remem-bered, and would have saved all of\nthis. I could\u2019ve said to Joni: this is\nhow I want you to remember me \u2013\nand omitted all of the unfavourable\nparts.\nI would\u2019ve said to not remember\nme yelling when Denny was offered\nSTS-75. Try not to think about\nhow many times I\u2019ve promised to\ndo the things I never intended to\ndo. Please do not remember me as\nselfish and callous, but bold and\npassionate.\nI could have said, Joni \u2013 this is\nhow I want you to remember me.\nRemember that you met me after\nwork and I kissed you for the first\ntime in the parking lot. Remember\nthat we rode our bikes around town\non the day we moved to Texas, remember that the sky was full of sun\nand that the neighbourhood lawn\nsprinklers kissed our heels as we\nsped past. Remember that Sophie\nhas my hair, and my nose, even if\nshe has your eyes. Remember that\nI remembered these things before\nanything else, as though they were\nthe most vital things in my life.\n\u201cI think I might start by apologis-ing again, and take it from there,\u201d I\ntell Denny. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d\n\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cListen, Paul, good luck,\nbut I\u2019ve got to go; I\u2019m training for\nthe ISS.\u201d\nWhen he hangs up the phone, I\nsit back and think about, considering how much of my life I\u2019ve spent\nworking towards it, how strange it\nis that I can\u2019t imagine going back.\nAn elderly lady who lives a few\ndoors down \u2013 far enough to have\nnever heard me and Joni yelling at\neach other \u2013 has told me about her\ngrandson, a nine-year old kid in\nWashington who\u2019s dreamt of space\nall his life. She\u2019s asked me for advice and I don\u2019t know what to say.\nI remember what it was like; for\nher seventh birthday I\u2019ve bought\nSophie a bicycle and I\u2019m planning\non taking her and Joni up Hoosier\nHill next winter solstice to see the\nconstellations and the shooting\nstars. I remember what it was like\nto strive for something so magnificent and unreachable, you never\nreally quite believe yourself. But I\nalso remember one hundred and\nforty-eight days of looking at the\nearth like a blue-green marble on\nthe tarmac, where my daughter\nwas growing up, where my brother\nwas learning the family business,\nwhere my wife was sleeping with\na grocery store stranger. I don\u2019t\nknow what I\u2019d say to this lady\u2019s\ngrandson, picturing John Glenn in\nfront of the stars and stripes, picturing Henry Duke typing unhappy articles that no-one will read.\nI\u2019m thinking about Denny, still set\non the International Space Station,\nnever disappointed. I\u2019m thinking\nabout teaching Sophie to ride a bike\none day. Most of all, I\u2019m thinking\nabout lunch with Joni and whether\nshe\u2019ll be as indecisive as ever with\nher meal order, and whether she\u2019ll\never take me back. This is the dif-ference, I realise, in what you will\nleave and what you will want back.\nIf they called me tomorrow, and\nasked me to go back up to the ISS\nright away, I\u2019d probably say thanks,\nbut no thanks. I\u2019d probably say,\nsorry, but I\u2019m meeting my wife for\nlunch tomorrow, and I\u2019m still trying to find some better words.\nMore than once, when I was in the hospital, I\nwished I had actually written one of Denny\u2019s in-case-of-death letters and burnt up coming home.\nThat way I could\u2019ve written myself as I wanted to\nbe remembered, and would have saved all of this.\n13\n12 PAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE\n11\n10\n\n"

If you can\u2019t\nsee at least one person that fits like a glove, you\u2019re it. Unless you\u2019re sitting next to\nTempest van Schaik, that is. She\u2019s a first year PhD student in the Bioengineering\ndepartment by day, and a prolific artist by night. Born in Johannesburg in 1985, she\u2019s been living\nin London for about a year now. Her work has been exhibited across South Africa whilst she\ncompleted a stonking two degrees at The University Of The Witwatersrand in Biomedical and\nElectrical Engineering. During that time, she set up two creative brands, Suzy Pedigree and\nEllommenopee. As she moves onto pastures new (and climates colder), a name has already been\nmadeforherselfhereatImperial.HerpieceshavebeenfeaturedintheImperialCollegeSt.Mary\u2019s\nArt Exhibition and Imperial\u2019s Women in Science, Engineering and Technology photography\ngallery this year.

On my first\nday at Imperial I was still living in a hostel, so it\nwas pretty tough settling in. What I love about\nLondon is how it\u2019s impossible to be bored. There\nare always amazing art exhibitions and concerts\nshowing somewhere, and because of the density\nof universities I\u2019ve been regularly going to academic talks by top thinkers in every field from\nevolutionary biology to religion, psychology and\nclimate change.\nMANY PEOPLE HAVE LAMENTED ON\nIMPERIAL\u2019S NATURAL LACK OF CREATIVITY BEING A SCIENCE-ONLY INSTITUTION. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO\nCOME TO IMPERIAL FOR YOUR PHD?\nI chose Imperial purely from an engineering\npoint of view: for the quality of research in my\ndepartment, the facilities and the engineering\neducation I would get. I expected to have to pursue creative endeavours on my own, outside of\nuniversity.\nTEMPEST VAN SCHAIK\nBorn: 1985 in Johannesburg, S.

With only two surviving members of last year\u2019s bronze winning team, 1st team captain Sam Dennis brought up three new faces from\nthe 2nd team.\nAfter our poor performance in the\nMidlands cup earlier in the year, realistic chances of equalling our results from\nthe last two years and claiming a further\nbronze medal was low. However, with\nregular team practice sessions, the new\nlook team was improving every day.\nThe first round of the Championships\nwas a league of five teams, all to play\neach other in a best of ten, with each\nplayer playing two frames again an opponent from the opposing team.\nWith a 5-5 draw to an impressive\nManchester 1st team, a 9-1 loss to favourites Cardiff 1st, followed by two 6-4\nwins against Durham 1st and Cardiff\n3rd, we finished the first round losing\nout to 2nd place on frame difference.\nThis meant we qualified for the knockout Trophy event, where we had won\nbronze for the past two years.\nLate on Saturday night saw our first\nknock-out match against a strong\nQueens 2nd team. After a 2-0 loss from\nLawrence Wild and a 1-1 draw from\nDuc Tien, we found ourself in a difficult position, especially as team captain\nSam Dennis and Ken Ng had lost their\nfirst frames. These results meant the\nscore was 5-1 to Queens in a first to 6\nmatch. We were feeling down, we were\nplaying bad, all was lost! But then, from\nnowhere, our \u2018B\u2019 team arrived to give us\nsome much needed support. Suddenly\nmorale was high, Ken began winning\nhis final frame and Sam smashed in a\n31 break to take the lead in his match.\nWith these two frames on the board we\nwere 5-3 down with just our very experienced Hari Arora left to play.\nHari\u2019s had thankfully exchanged his\ngeneral \u2018smash everything as hard as\npossible\u2019 playing style for a more con-trolled, technical game. This resulted in\na massively tense first frame where Hari\nrolled in the final blue before having to\nuse the long rest to sink the pink. Final\nframe and Hari needs to win to draw\nthe match level and force a decider.\nTo our horror, Hari found himself 20\npoints behind, but a valiant fight back\nsaw a tight fight on the colours. Good\npots from Hari on the yellow and green,\nfollowed by a fluke from his opponent\non the brown, which was responded\nwith a fluke by hari on the blue (where\nit actually went in a pocket a full 12 feet\naway from the one he was aiming for)\nand a stylish pot on the pink to win and\nA fairytale ending\nICU Snooker beat York in a dramatic fashion to claim gold medal place at the BUCS Championships\nequalise the frame scores to 5-5.\nSam Dennis was nominated to play\nthe single frame play-off game and to\nprogress the team to the semi-finals and\nbe guaranteed at least a bronze medal.\nSam\u2019s pulled through with a series of\nmedium sized breaks and exhibition\nstyle pots, creating a 40 point lead; the\npressure was off. Another couple of impressive pots saw the victory sealed by\nthe captain. Suddenly, the team with no\nrealistic chance of medals found themselves in the semifinals after being 5-1\ndown in a first to 6 match.\nSemifinal match was against Cardiff\n2nd. Having been embarrassingly beaten 9-1 to Cardiff 1st earlier in the tour-nament, the team was adamant not to\nbe beaten by another Cardiff team. The\nmatch started off quite close, with 1-1\ndraws from Lawrence and Duc. With a\nwin from Sam and another draw from\nKen meant we were winning 5-3 going\ninto Hari\u2019s match, so even if he were to\nlose 2-0, at very least me would have\nanother play-off match. Fortunately\nthough, Hari came through for the team\nonce again, winning the first frame to\nsend us through to the final 6-3.\nAt this point, we had out performed\nthe last two years and were guaranteed\nat least a silver medal.\nThe final is played in a slightly different format, instead of adding up the\namount of frames won, every player\nplays a best of 3 match against one op-ponent, and it is the number of matches\nwon that counts. Therefore, with 5 players on each team, the final is won by the\nteam that wins 3 matches.\nThe final against York 2nd started\nwith wins from Lawrence Wild and Sam\nDennis, who\u2019s frame difference for the\nteam tournament was an astonishing\n12 wins to 2 loses, put Imperial 2-0 up\nin the first to 3 match. With Duc Tien\nwinning his matches, it seemed that we\nwere just minutes away from claiming\nImperial\u2019s first BUCS Team Snooker\ngold medal.\nBut things took a turn for the worse.\nDuc\u2019s opponent came back strong and\nwon a close 2-1 match, making the\nscore only 2-1 to Imperial. The final\nseemed to be slipping away as both Ken\nand Hari were losing their matches.\nKen fort back bravely in the second\nframe equalising his match, only to be\nout played in the decider, to lose 2-1 and\nlevel the overall match to 2-2 with, once\nagain, just Hari\u2019s match to be played.\nHari, after losing the first frame came\nout strong in the second, raking up a\n20 point lead. However, with the York\nplayer only requiring one frame to with\nthe match, he came back hard. But with\nthe whole of the 1st and 2nd team behind Hari, he pulled through to equalise\nhis match, meaning the result of the final was all down to his last frame. The\nmatch was finely balanced at 2-2, and\n1-1 in the final match.\nHari, once again made a great start\npulling 20 point clear of his opponent.\nBut once again, the player from York\ncame back strong and was winning going into the colors, just 6 balls left on the\ntable would decide who won gold. Once\nagain, it seemed like the final had got\naway from us with Hari losing so late in\nthe frame.\nButthenHariseemedtogetpossessed\nby some sort of Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan/John\nHiggins hybrid. He played two amazing snookers, and then then kept composure when the rest of the room were\nready to explode with excitement, and\nsmashed home the blue, in true Hari\nArora style, before coolly rolling in the\npink to win gold medal for Imperial\nCollege 1st team.\nOther results from the weekend: the\n2nd team lost to Oxford 1st and Exeter\n2nd before beating Ulster 2nd team.\nThese results meant they qualified for\nthe team shield event where they went\nout to Southampton 2nd team.\nThere was not much success in the\nsingles event, both Ken and Hari made\nit through to the second round before\ngetting knocked out. Sam Dennis however made it through to the last 16.\nAs captain, I would like to Congratulate the rest of the 1st team, Lawrence\nWild, Ken Ng, Duc Tien and Hari Arora as well as the 2nd team Victor Loi,\nLewis Guan, Grace Yip, Nigel Rozario\nand Amish Patel, for all their support.\nWithout them we would have most\nlikely lost to Queens in our quarter final\nmatch. And finally a thank you to everyone showing their support on our website throughout the weekend, especially\nNigel\u2019s mum.\n\n"

    "content": "16\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor\nTechnology Editor Samuel Gibbs\nSamuel Gibbs\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 04 JUNE 2010\nAndroid goes Froyo-tastic\nFeroz Salam shows you why Froyo is Android\u2019s coming of age\nW\nhen Google announced\nthe Android mobile operating system in late\n2007, the reaction it received was at best, lukewarm. Coming\nonly a few months after the release of\nthe iPhone OS, which had taken consumer markets by storm, most analysts\nwere cautious about the announcement despite the fact that the OS had\nthe backing of Google. The first release\nof the open source OS did nothing to\nenthuse them with only a relatively\nsmall number of manufacturers taking\nthe OS on board and producing rather\nclunky handsets; Android proved to\nbe unattractive and sluggish. Along\nwith a relatively small developer mar-ket, there seemed no way that Android\nhandsets could legitimately compete\nwith the gloss of the iPhone or the\nsleek business chic of the Blackberry.\nYet only two years down the line,\nthere\u2019s been something of a revolution\nin the mobile market. As the look and\nfeel of the iPhone OS has remained relatively stagnant, Android has reinvented itself in a new stylish format iterating rapidly with each release building\nsolidly on its predecessor. The developing OS was backed by a lineup of neatly\ndesigned, powerful smartphones from\nmajor mobile manufacturers, which allowed Android powered handsets to\novertake the iPhone to become second\nto the Blackberry in terms of sales figures in the US. With the release of the\nnext major update of the OS Android\n2.2 (codenamed Froyo) earlier this\nweek, Google seems to be looking to\nconsolidate this position, now marketing the system as a mature OS that can\ncompete with the best.\nQuantitatively, Froyo is stunning. It\u2019s\nnot often that the jump from version\n2.1 to 2.2 offers a 450% speed increase\n(yes, that\u2019s 4.5 times faster), but Google\nhas managed to pull it out of the box\nwith some impressive optimizations.\nNeat improvements in the way code\nis run means that Android apps are\nnowhere near the sluggish monsters\nthey were from the first few releases.\nThe browser also got some attention\nin this iteration with Google proudly\nproclaiming that Android now has the\nfastest mobile browser and now comes\npacking in-browser Flash support\nwhile working smoothly with HTML5,\nsomething that the Google execs have\nrightful reason to crow about.\nIn addition, the release also has a\nslew of new features designed to make\nit easier for both developers and users\nto manage the apps they download,\nfrom auto-updates to a new web-based\nAndroid market. Google has been very\nopen about the fact that these improvements have been made keeping\ndevelopers in mind, seemingly looking to expand the Android Market to\na size comparable to that of the incredibly successful iPhone App Store. That\nsaid, it has also managed to throw in\na sizeable number of new features\nfor users too, with a revamped media\nplayer, on-demand movie streaming,\nExchange support and app storage on\nexternal media.\nAll the signs seem to be pointing to\n2010 being the year in which Android\nmakes it big. Slow unsteady beginnings haven\u2019t deterred Google from\npersevering with the operating system,\nand the results have been impressive.\nWith a range of major hardware manufacturers throwing themselves behind\nAndroid, there seems to be a consensus that Android is the way forward\nin an industry looking for an answer\nto the ambitious expansion of Apple\u2019s\nproduct line. Froyo is certainly a firm\nstep in the right direction from Google, with enough for both the consumer\nand the developer to be a very successful release. The number of Android\nproducts to be released over the next\nyear is a testament to the confidence\nthat manufacturers have in this license\nfree platform. So if you\u2019re looking for a\nhandset that\u2019s cheaper and more versatile than the iPhone, you should definitely give Android a good look.\nT\nablets all around us! Yes, it\nseems just like the netbook\nbefore them, tablets are going to be the must have PC\nin the home. Problem is for the most\npart the tablets that we\u2019ve seen and are\non sale now aren\u2019t all that cheap. From\nthe iPad at \u00a3429 the prices essentially\ngo up. Still that\u2019s the price you pay for\nbleeding edge, next generation tech\nright? Yes, but more often than not\nwe\u2019re not seeing bleeding edge, revolutionary or even evolutionary tech.\nMost of the non-ARM based tablets\npack the ubiquitous and often tedious\nIntel Atom CPUs. OK, if you want to\nrun Windows or another desktop OS\nthen you\u2019re going to have to use the\nx86 instruction set, which lumbers you\nwith the Atom unless you\u2019re willing to\ngo the way of the Core 2 Duo CULV\n(that\u2019s Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage\nfor those at home), which often lumbers you with sky high price tags.\nIntel\u2019s \u2018Oak Trail\u2019 Atom based System-on-a-chip, SoC for short, is on its\nway into tablets in the Q1 2011 time\nframe. Similar to Intel\u2019s \u2018Moorestown\u2019\nSoC, which is aimed at smartphones,\nIntel is hoping that by combining the\nCPU with a full chipset all on one piece\nof silicon it will allow thinner, power\nsipping, fanless tablets with the option of running Windows 7 along with\nother OSs like Chrome OS or MeeGo.\nTalking of Chrome OS, it looks like\nwe\u2019re going to see Google\u2019s cloud com-puting, tablet orientated operating\nsystem this autumn on devices. It\u2019s\nlikely that Google will push out a beta\nversion of Chrome OS in the interim,\npossibly even around Apple\u2019s WWDC\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nW\nhat did this past\nweek in tech\nhold in store for\nus all then?\nWell it\u2019s been tablet fever\nover at the geekfest that is\nComputex this week. After\nthe iPad launch last week here\nin the UK, we\u2019re now hearing\nabout a true cornucopia of new\nslate devices.\nFirst up we\u2019ve got the ExoPC\nSlate, an 11.6 inch Windows 7\ntablet running a custom software layer that is both unique\nand incredibly easy to navigate.\nOf note here is that if you do\nneed the full Windows 7 expe-rience, it\u2019s just behind the\ngloss of\nthe Connect Four style inter-face. The device is powered\nby a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N450\nbacked up by 2GB of RAM\nand a 32GB SSD. They\u2019ve even\nmanaged to squeeze in two\nUSB ports, an SD card slot,\nan HDMI out, a webcam and\nBroadcom\u2019s Crystal HD chip\nfor 1080p playback. The touchscreen itself is capacitive and\nsports a 1366x768 resolution\nmaking it 720p. If you\u2019re after\na full Windows 7 experience in\na slate form factor this might\nbe your best bet, but we\u2019re only\ntalking 3ish hours of battery\nlife here so best make whatever\nyou\u2019re doing quick.\nAsus was out in force\nat Computex, this\nyear with its Eee Pad\nrange. The 12 inch\nEP121 sports\nan Intel Core\n2 Duo CULV\nCPU, Windows 7 and a purported 10 hours battery life. 10\nhours is pretty ambitious for\na full desktop OS tablet, but\nAsus has had experience with\nits EeePC line at reaching enviable battery life so I wouldn\u2019t\nput it past them. Just don\u2019t expect it to be all that svelte having to pack a sizable battery.\nAlso onboard the EP121 will\nbe a webcam and \u2018at least\u2019 one\nUSB port.\nAsusalsohada10inchNvidia\nTegra powered tablet running\nWindows Embedded Compact\n7, which is Microsoft\u2019s new OS\nfor ARM powered devices that\naren\u2019t phones, but also aren\u2019t\npowerful\nenough\nfor a full\nWindows 7\ninstall. Other\ndetails are a bit\nsketchy at this\ntime but both Eee Pads will\nrange in the $399 to $499 price\nbracket on launch. Just don\u2019t\nhold your breath for these because we\u2019re looking down the\nbarrel of a Q1 2011 release\nwindow.\nIf you were looking for something to take down digital notes\non, perhaps Asus\u2019 Eee Tablet\n(not Eee Pad) will fit the bill.\nRather unusually, it packs an 8\ninch 1024x768 greyscale TFTLCD touchscreen without a\nbacklight, meaning that it\u2019s\nsimilar in appearance to\nE-ink just without the\natrocious refresh\nrate. Asus is really\npushing this as\na note\ntaking device\nwith a\n2450 dpi\ninput sen-sitivity, a 2MP camera on the\nback for snapping lecture slides\nand a MicroSD slot. It\u2019s got 10\nhours battery life, so it\u2019s not in\nthe E-ink class, but it should\npresent text books and eBooks\npretty well with the ability to\nmake hand drawn notes at the\nsame time. The Eee Tablet will\nbe priced in the $199 to $299\nbracket and will launch in September ready for the back-to-school season.\nMSI wasn\u2019t to be outdone\nby its Thai compatriot outing\ntwo tablets of its\nown. First up we\u2019ve\ngot the 10 inch, Intel\nAtom powered, Windows 7 Home Premium\npacking WindPad 100.\nThe ubiquitous 1.66GHz\nAtom Z530 CPU is backed\nup by 2GB of RAM and a\n32GB SSD, whilst harbouring two USB ports, an HDMI\noutput and a built-in webcam.\nMSI have included their Wind\nTouch UI, a basic skin on top\nof the Windows OS providing\neasy access to applications on\nthe 1024x600 capacitive touch-screen, which should make\nusing the finger un-friendly\nWindows 7 a little bit easier to\nmanage.\nMSI also showed an Android,\nTegra 2 powered 10 inch slate\nwith a more curvaceous look,\nwhich will be aimed at the end\nof the year for $399.\nSlick as a Slate;\nThin as a Tablet\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\ntime frame, to steal some thunder.\nThe problem with Chrome OS, as far\nas I see it, is Google\u2019s other pretty successful mobile OS, Android. As you\u2019ve\nread from Feroz, Android is coming of\nage and is finally at the point of being a\nmature mobile platform. Why is Google trying to split the market with its\nChrome OS? We\u2019ve already seen Android running on tablets, smartphones\nand smartbooks, powered either by\nARM or x86 CPUs. Why doesn\u2019t\nGoogle just stick with Android and put\nthe thoughts and UI paradigm from\nwhat it\u2019s trying to do with Chrome OS\ninto the little green machine?\nIf you want an example of a decent,\nalbeit small, tablet running Android\nyou\u2019ve only got to look at the recently\nreleased Dell Streak. It\u2019s a 5 inch mobile device that does everything your\nphone does, but has just enough screen\nreal-estate to make it as a small tablet.\nIn fact, the pretty impressive Dell\nStreak has been in the news this week\nfor two very good reasons.

Considering how much\nthe Nexus One and iPhone 3GS cost\non contract, the Streak looks like a\nveritable bargain, something that\u2019s re-inforced, quite literally, by the amazing\nGorilla glass that protects the device\u2019s\ndisplay.

The country pledged $1 billion\nin aid to Indonesia in an effort to protect tropical\nrainforests in the country, which are heavily forested for the palm oil trade. The aid programme, and others like\nit, will be used as an incentive for poorer countries not to cut\ndown tropical forests for economic gain. The plan is one of the\nfirst realisations to arise out of commitments of funds made by\nindustrialised nations at the Copenhagen summit. The move\nwas described as positive by climate change scientists because\ndeforestation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emis-sion. Simultaneously, Norway managed to receive the commitment from other industrialised countries for a further $500\nmillion in aid commitments, bringing the total to $4 billion.\nFurther commitments at a tropical deforestation conference\nthis week may bring the total to $5 billion.\nNorway\nT\nhe bonanza in the Gulf of Mexico rolled on this\nweek. The attempt to plug the spill via top kill,\nwhich is a strategy to pump dense mud and perhaps\nshredded tyres into the oil well, failed. An attempt\nto modify the well with a diamond saw and equipped robot also\nfailed when the robot got stuck. Cleanup workers in many reports have claimed that they are under strict orders not to allow\nthe capture or release of images of oil-soaked wildlife: such images were a major source of controversy during the 1989 Exxon\nValdez oil spill in Alaska. The U.S. Department of Justice announced it was opening a criminal probe of BP, Transocean,\nand Halliburton as required under various environmental laws\nwhile President Obama announced that he was in favour of repealing \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d worth of tax cuts for oil producers\nand diverting the funds towards green energy research.\nM\nideast protesters have formed a flotilla that has\nended in tragedy and international uproar. The\nformation, consisting of six ships, under Comoros, Greece, Ireland, Kiribati, Turkey, and\nAmerican flags, carried 663 passengers from nearly forty countries and 10,000 tons of supplies. The plan was to break the\nIsraeli blockade and to deliver supplies to Gaza. Israel initially\nsignalled that it would not allow this to happen and reportedly\noffered to divert the blockade to Ashdod, where facilities had\nbeen established to receive the protesters and transfer their aid\nto Gaza after inspection. What happened next is unclear, but\nwhat is known at this juncture is that the flotilla was eventually\nboarded by the Israeli military, seven protesters were killed and\ndozens injured. Ten Israeli soldiers were injured. An enormous\ndebate over the facts ensues via diplomatic channels, newspa-pers, television news programmes, and YouTube.\nGraduate jobs annihilated by recession\nNew research shows that only a third of graduates expect to find a job after university. Alex Karapetian reports\nG\nraduates leaving University in the coming\nmonths are preparing to\ntake low paid jobs due to\nthe recession\u2019s profound\neffect on employment in the UK. Students are expecting to accept work in\nbars, supermarkets and call centres,\naccording to a press release by High\nFliers Research.\nThe survey of over 16,000 final year\ndegree students showed only a third of\nthe graduates expecting to find a job\nafter University, with only a quarter of\nthose on Arts and Humanities courses\npreparing to find jobs. Graduates face\nrecord levels of debt, with average loan\nrepayments upwards of \u00a318,000 for a\nthree year course and rising to \u00a325,000\nfor some parts of London.\nResearch shows that thousands of\nstudents are considering taking a postgraduate degree course as an alternative to having to find a job, effectively\nremaining within the academic bubble.\nFigures indicate 26% of students intend\nto remain in Higher Education after\ntheir degrees.\nMartin Birchall, Managing Director of High Fliers Research, said \u201cstudents taking courses such as Arts and\nHumanities courses, including fine\nart, drama, dance, music, history and\ngeography are likely to be the hardest\nhit.\u2019\u2019\nto find work\u2019\u2019. Key findings include just\n36% of final year students believing\nthey will start or look for a graduate\njob, while 14% have yet to decide what\nto do next. 45% of leavers describe\nprospects as \u201cvery limited\u2019\u2019 as confidence in the graduate job market is\nat a fifteen year low. 33% will take any\njob they are offered, pinning their lack\nof confidence on the aftermath of the\nrecession. A further fifth also admitted that the scarcity of jobs has meant\nthey\u2019ve had to apply to employers that\nthey \u201cweren\u2019t really interested in\u2019\u2019.\nThis implies that large numbers of\nstudents will undertake low paid jobs,\nfailing to use skills they learnt whilst\nearning their degree for many years.\nThe report shows, however, that while\nthe number of students applying to\ninvestment banks has increased by\na sixth, fewer have applied to Engineering or IT jobs. The most popular\ndestinations for applications this year\nhave been in the media, teaching and\nmarketing.\nThe survey was conducted across\nthirty universities, including Cambridge, Southampton and Imperial\nwith face to face interviews of students\nrepresenting a fifth of the national final\nyears.\nStudents preparing to leave Imperial\nwere expecting to pay back as much as\n\u00a325,700, which is \u00a37,700 above the average debt for students on a three year\ndegree.\n\u201cThe recession may be officially\nover,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u201cbut with a record\nnumber of students due to complete\ndegrees in the coming weeks and tens\nof thousands of last year\u2019s graduates\nstill looking for work, there is widespread concern that competition for\ngraduate jobs has never been fiercer.\u2019\u2019\nBirchall addressed the research\u2019s main\npoints, highlighting that \u201cstudents\nfrom Arts and Humanities courses and\nthose who\u2019ve had little or no work experience during their time are the least\nconfident about the future.\u2019\u2019\nThe High Fliers press release indicates that \u201cmany of this year\u2019s entry\nlevel vacancies will be filled by graduates from the class of 2009 who failed\nI bet you\u2019re sick of hearing about graduate prospects: One week they\u2019re good, the next they\u2019re appalling\n\u2022 Average debt of \u00a325,000\nfor some London\nstudents\n\u2022 Imperial graduates owe\nup to \u00a38,000 more than\naverage\n\n"

Ben Stubbens stood\ndown during the election for Deputy\nPresident (Education) after accepting\na work offer from Rolls-Royce and\nMeera Ganeshadevan withdrew, after\nhaving been elected into the position,\nin order to work for Credit Suisse.\nNaturally, questions have been raised\nregarding the intent of those who\nstand for paid positions in the Union.\nDo Sabbatical Officers really have the\nbest interests of the student body at\nheart or are they in it to further their\nown prospective careers? Is it even\nthat simple? felix was able to speak to\nthe newly-elected Deputy President\n(Education), Alex Dahinten, on the\nissues surrounding Sabbatical positions.\nfelix: With the recent departure of individuals to take up work placements\nrather than contest positions in the\nUnion, do you believe that those who\nstand for Sabbatical Elections have\nthe best interests of the Union and\nuniversity in mind or are they only\naiming for an extension to their CV?\nAD: Having an election this late in\nthe year naturally invites this ques-of running, however at the time I had\nplans to go travelling for a year. Once\nthe elections passed, I began to regret\nmy decision and therefore when I heard\nthat Meera stepped down I felt it was\nthe right decision to make.\nfelix: If you were in the same position as those who left for work place-ments, how would you consider the\nissue?\nAD: It\u2019s a difficult choice to make, since\nyou do always want the security of having a fall-back plan.\nHowever by not letting the students\nknow that you are totally behind your\ncampaign, you are deceiving them. I\nran because I am 100% committed, so\nas far as I\u2019m concerned I will be starting\non the 1st of July (unless of course I get\nan internship offer from Credit Suisse!).\nChris Darby is Equal Opportunities\nOfficer in the Union and newly elected\nAcademic Affairs Officer for CGCU.\nHaving stood for both Union President\nand Deputy President (Education) this\nyear, felix spoke to him in order to determine his reasons for attempting to\nbecome a Sabbatical Officer twice in\nthe same year.\nRegarding running for the presiden-cy, Darby explains that, \u201cAfter the positive change I made as Equal Opportunities Officer, the Union suggested I\nrun for it.\u201d In addition to this, he has\nclear views on what a Union President\nshould be capable of achieving: \u201cIf the\nPresident is in a position of supporting\nwelfare well and is able to take more of\na management role, then that\u2019s a good\nChris Darby: selfless servant or self-serving?\nthing.\u201d Welfare and education are important yet \u201cneglected\u201d issues according to Darby; he believes that there are\ninstead \u201cother priorities\u201d current Sabbatical Officers are too focussed on.\nAs an example, he finds fault with the\nUnion\u2019s handling of February\u2019s \u2018One\nWorld Week\u2019, simply stating that \u201cnobody knew about it\u201d.\nWith regards to then standing for\nDeputy President (Education), Darby\nexplains it as a natural progression,\nstating that he had \u201csupport from people like Ben (Stubbens)\u201d. Discussing\nMeera Ganeshadevan\u2019s departure, he\nfeels that \u201c(Meera\u2019s) heart wasn\u2019t in it\u201d,\nyet acknowledges the \u201cdifficult situations\u201d that those who left for placements found themselves in. Concerning Alex Dahinten\u2019s running for the\nposition, he is far more praisewor-thy, suggesting that, \u201chis reasons (for\nstanding) were much more sincere\u201d.\nDarby is clearly passionate about the\nUnion and the state of welfare across\ncollege, and whereas some may see\nstanding for multiple positions in the\nUnion as an individual merely attempting to further themselves, in this case,\nthe answers seem to suggest otherwise.\n\u201cThe Union\nsuggested I run for\nPresident\u201d\ntion. Many people at Imperial generally think that getting involved in the\nUnion is a CV-filler, however once you\nare involved, it\u2019s pretty clear that it is a\nlot more than that. If you are willing to\nspend a whole year of your life doing a\njob which you do not like or feel you\nwill be any good at, then why run? Even\nthough it is paid, the prospect of being\naccountable by the whole student body\nshould put off the \u201cCV-fillers\u201d.\nFor this election, I feel that all of the\ncandidates were sincere, and had the\nUnion\u2019s interests placed before theirs. I\ncan\u2019t recall anything similar happening\nin the past years.\nfelix: What led you to run for the position now instead of earlier in the\nyear?\nAD: During the first elections, I thought\nAlexander Dahinten\nwas recently elected\nas Deputy President\n(Education) after a\nclose contest with\ndefeated Presidental\ncandidate Chris\nDarby.\nMustafa Arif \u2013 Union President\n2003-2005\n\u201cAll the sabbaticals I\u2019ve known have\nbeen motivated by the best of in-tentions, not for CV points. I turned\ndown a couple of well-paid job offers when I stood for election in 2003\n(and again when I stood for re-elec-tion in 2004). The same was true of\nother colleagues.\u201d\nJenny Morgan \u2013 Union President\n2008-2009\n\u201cI believe that the vast majority of\npeople who stand for election have\nvery good intentions. To be good\nenough to be elected as a sabb it is\nhighly likely you have racked up an\nenormous amount of experience\nwithin the Union and therefore know\nwhat you\u2019re getting into, and feel\nstrongly about issues you want to\nchange.\u201d\nHannah Theodorou - DP Education\n& Welfare 2008-2009\n\u201cUltimately there are more valuable\nopportunities out there - I think it is\nvery rare for people to do it solely for\nCV purposes. If they did, they would\nfind the job very frustrating and will\nget little out of it - it\u2019s reflected in\ntheir work and the effect can be de-moralising for the people they work\nwith.\u201d\nChris Larvin \u2013 DP Finance & Services\n2007-2008\n\u201cThere are many different motivations or types of people who stand\nfor election, and it is usually split\nbetween people that know what\nthey\u2019re doing and people who don\u2019t.\nThere are better ways of enhancing\nyour CV!\u201d\nFormer Sabbs deny running for\nelection to fatten their CVs\nMeera Ganeshadevan and Ben\nStubbens both withdrew after\nreceiving job offers\n\n"

Photosocs exhibition moved through a series of photographs of\nshifting scale, moving from the microscopic to curving panoramic landscapes. As each image remained of almost equal\nproportion, the viewer awareness of their own size becomes\nmore acute and heightened as they walked around the show.\nSome of Leosocs exhibition explored the breaking down and\nreconstruction of familiar icons within a fine art context.\nImages such as Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers and Munch\u2019s The\nScream where dissected and each fragment explored by one\nartist before the painting was remade.

To escapes\nthese feelings, he listened to music on his portable radio which unfortunately got lost\nbecause he was moved several times from ward to ward. He felt that he got \u2018confused\u2019\n(the speckled red and orange fabric, where blobs are coming off like lost memories not\ntotally rooted to what he remembers. Sometimes he felt he was treated like a \u2018blithering\nidiot\u2019. That the doctors and nurses did not heed his requests to find his lost radio. It only\ntook me a few minutes to check where it was for him, but it is the minutae that make\nthe difference; knowing about his feelings of being \u2018trapped\u2019, and that his \u2018desire to get\nout is great\u2019 meant that his radio gained more importance to him, because it allowed\nhim, to at least temporarily escape this \u2018prison\u2019. This trapped feeling is represented by\nthe green and gold vertical striped fabric, which looked like prison bars, but the green\nalso reminded him of the greenery outside - of escaping and getting back to normality.\u201d\n\u201c\nARTOPSY\n\n"
