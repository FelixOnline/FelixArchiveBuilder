The match started in\nreasonable, if cold, conditions, the\nfirst half was very evenly matched,\nending at 0-0. The IC pack evenly\nmatched the Police pack, and put on\na good show in the set scrum s. The\nline defended well, and put the Police\nunder pressure when they were given\nclean possession. The second half\nstarted badly for the College, with the\nPolice flanker going over in the\ncorner for a try, which was well\nconverted by their fly-half. IC re-started, and after the pack won good\nFOOTBALL\nNear draw second-phase ball, the line on it well\ndown the centre of the field. Fly-half\nGrant Hamilton kicked through, and\nwas then blatantly blocked by one of\nthe Police players. The referee\nawarded a penalty try to the College,\nwhich was converted by Grant\nHamilton. IC slowly gained the upper\nhand, and from the Police 22-meter\nline, John Peacock (scrum-half)\npassed to Jason Jenkins (tight-head\nprop), to Frank Millar (2nd row) to\nRob Hargrove (8th man), who scored\nunder the posts after a never-before\nseen display of athletic is m to put IC\nahead. This was converted, and IC\nended up the winners by 12 points to\n6.\nTEN PIN BOWLING\nPigs will be flying, Sheffield flooding\nand the moon will be a lovely shade\nof ultramarine. Why? IC 10 Pin\nBowling Club has finally won! A dishevelled looking Brunei team\nventured down from the backwaters\nof downtown Uxbridge and probably\nwished they hadn't. The 'A' team won by over 350 pins\neven though they lost the second\ngame.\nThe 'B' team won all three games\nthough all three were quite close.\nThe same score was achieved by\nthe ' C team, who bowled very well.\nThe only team to lose was the ladies\nwho, with a player short, didn't stand\na chance. This has been the case all\nseason so if there are any women out\nthere who'd like to join see the\n'What's On' guide.\nThe Club continued its new-found\nwinning ways on Saturday at what is\nthe premier national handicapped\ndoubles event. Six teams were taken,\nwith IC finishing first and second in\nthe handicap and third in the scratch.\nIn the surroundings of fading fifties\nThe Hyde Park Relays, the largest\nstudent relays in the country, will take\nplace on Saturday February 14th. On\nthat day, 1300 runners will converge\non Hyde Park, including a smattering\nof inter nations such as 1984 London\nMarathon winner Charlie Spedding.\nAs well as teams from all over the\nUK, there are entries from as far\nafield as Norway and Holland. The\nevent is organised by the Crosscountry and Athletics Club and we\nhave been fortunate to obtain\nsponsorship from Nike, Barclays and\nFirkin, the latter providing free beer\nto competitors.\nsleaze our teams struggled on the\ndead-end alleys of the Airport Bowl.\nWith balls that had gouges out of them\nbigger than the finger-holes and\nmachinery that sounded like 16th century printing presses, things did\nnot look so good after the first three\ngames.\nHowever, consistently good\nbowling from Chris Wheeldon and\nPaul Gaines took them into first place\nin both the scratch and handicap\nsections. Although overtaken by a whisker in the scratch they easily held\nonto first place in the handicap.\nSuperb bowling by Richard Ingram\nhelped him and his partner Andrew\nTress into second place in the\nhandicap, only 30 pins behind their\nteam-mates.\nThis was a very good all round\nperformance by the six teams, that\nalso included Anita Lee, Nicky\nFletcher, Tim Cordingley, Simeon\nPaster, Nick Brigham, Eric Barfield,\nKashif Saeed and Martin Morris.\nSo, after two successive victories\nis there no stopping this team?\nThe course is a loop around the\nSerpentine starting near the top of\nRotten Row. The relay starts at\n2.30pm with the mens' race\nconsisting of 6 legs and the womens'\nfour. Standards are invariably high\nwith the leading men completing the\n3 mile course in under 13 Vz minutes.\nIf previous years are anything to go\nby, Birmingham and Loughborough\nwill be the teams to watch.\nAlthough the oriente ers have kindly\nagreed to provide marshals, we could\nstill use some extra help on the day,\nthe incentive being a free Hyde Park\nRelay T shirt.\nA fine winter's day at Harlington saw\nanother character testing game from\nthe IC II's. IC began well with Keelin\nand Poppy making things happen\ndown the right flank. Many chances\nwere squandered until J West firmly\nheaded home an S Dunthrone cross\nin the 23rd minute. IC sought to\nstrengthen their lead but their best\nchance was cleared off the line from\n8 yards after a close range shot from\nAdams.\nSOP's brutish centre-forward then\ntook a hand in the proceedings. First\nhe latched onto a poor pass from\nDunthorne and only magnificent\ntiming by J Wreford, the IC keeper,\nsaved a certain goal. Then Wreford\npunted the ball forward, only for the\nSOP midfield to head forward. Their\ncentre-forward reached the ball first\nagain, and his lob shot caught\nWreford stranded off his line to make\nthe score 1-1. Shortly before half-time\nthe same centre-forward caused more\nproblems for IC. From a corner he\nblatantly pushed Rob Kelly, his\nmarker, and then headed the ball into\nthe net. The goal was given despite\nangry protests from Barrow, the IC\nskipper.\nThe second half began poorly for\nIC and things looked grim. But as the\ngame wore on IC began to regain their\ncomposure. Pressure began to build\nup on the SOP goal. Barrow's blistering shot from the edge of the\narea crashed against the underside of\nthe'bar and bounced on the line;\nKeelin's cry of \"lucky bastards\" was\ntreated with a smile by the referee.\nMinutes later Gordon brought relief\nto IC as he confidently shot home\nfrom inside the SOP area.\nWith 8 minutes to go a draw looked\nirn mine n t(e/i? \u00a3t f,). Phil Adams\nthought differently, though, and his\nbeautiful, curled chip shot from 20\nyards became the winner for IC.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nA run in the park\nPolice Violence Super bowl'87 "

    "content": "Letters\nFELIX, Friday February 6th19872 Oppressed\nMinority\nDear Dave,\nI must say that I was rather\nsaddened to read the letter in last\nweeks' FELIX written by Messrs\nReese, Farhead, Rowe and Kennedy\non the appointment of a Lesbian and\nGay Welfare Office. I feel that the\nfollowing points need a specific reply.\nFirstly, the writers mention 'the\nexcellent service provided by ULU.'I assume from the tone of their\ncomments that they are not gay. This\nsuggests that they have never visited\nthe ULU Gay and Lesbian Group;\nhow can they know if it is excellent?\nIn any case, no matter how good\nit may be, it only meets once a week,\nand the number of students attending\nfrom IC is probably low. An IC\nstudent attending such a group for\nperhaps the first time in his/her life,\nwould surely find it a daunting\nexperience.\nSecondly, the writers raise the point\nof minority representation. Leaving\nCouncil out of things for the moment,\ndo they object to the idea of a Gay\nSociety? If so, then they should\nremember that it only takes one\nperson armed with 20 signatures to\nset up such societies as Sri Lankan\nSoc or HamSoc. Statistically it is\nlikely that there are more than 500\ngay undergraduates at IC: Are there\nthat many Sri Lankans or radio hams?\nI very much doubt it.\nReturning to Council, what right\nhave we to deny gay representation,\nat a time when at least 10% of\nstudents of IC may be living in fear\nof discovery by a homophobic 'moral\nmajority'?\nSurely such an oppressed group\nneeds a Welfare Officer?\nYours sincerely\nAndrew Bannister, Geology 1\n...but not\ndifferent\nof discrimination that IC's gay and\nlesbian students receive should expect\nIC Union's support. In this case the\nUnion has decided that the best way\nof supporting gays and lesbians is to\nappoint an Officer to represent them\nand organise a Gay Soc. This is a wise\ndecision. Individuals who feel\nthreatened can reduce that threat by\norganising.\nIt is stupid to argue that minorities\nshould not be represented on Council.\nOverseas students, women, chemical\nengineers and sports players (I believe\nthese are minorities at IC) have\nrepresentatives on Council.\nIf people really object to a Lesbian\nand Gay Welfare Officer they\nshouldn't be so homophobic, then\nthere wouldn't be a need for such a person.\nYours\nHugh Southey, Chem Eng 4\nImpure\nEysenck\nDear Dave,\nI noted with some concern in last\nweek's FELIX that WellSoc is to\ninvite Hans Eysenck to speak on the\n9th of February; the so-called \"world\nauthority on intelligence and IQ\ntests.\"\nAlthough indeed an influential\npsychologist, Eysenck has spent much\nof his time since the early 1970's, and\nthe publication of his book \"Race,\nIntelligence and Education,\"\npromoting not only the idea that\nintelligence is almost wholly\ngenetically determined but, also that\nblack people do not, on average,\npossess the same intellectual\ncapacities as whites.\nEysenck, not surprisingly, has\nfound little favour within the scientific\ncommunity; not only have most other\nnotable psychologists poured scorn on\nhis theories, but opposition has also\ncome from eminent geneticists and\nbiologists too, including Nobel\nLaureate Sir Peter Medewar, who\nhave stressed that environmental\nfactors play a major part in human\nintelligence, and that intelligence\nitself is much too complicated to be\nexpressed by a single IQ score.\nHowever, Eysenck has found\nconsiderable support within the ultra-right, who found that the 'race-science' propagated in 1930's Germany had found a new ally;\nindeed Eysenck's book was soon on\nthe recommended booklist of the\nNational Front. (An alleged interview\nwith Eysenck also appeared in an\nedition of the fascist magazine\n\"Beacon\" in Feb '77, published by\na splinter group from the Front).\nEysenck has also been associated\nwith the openly racist journal \"The\nMankind Quarterly\" (as a member of\nthe Honorary Advisory Board), which\nhas included many articles in support\nof apartheid in South Africa and\nRhodesia, and which has included\nmany references to the work of Hans\nGiinther, the leading pre-war German\n'race-scientist', whose theories\noutlined the \"worth of Nordic racial\npurity\" and \"the perils of Jewish\ncontamination f'I can only hope that WellSoc\nrealises the mistake that it has made\nin inviting Eysenck to College; I hardly think that this kind of racial\nnonsense is what its members want to\nlisten to.\nS Dunlop, Physics 3\nSad PATA\nDear Dave,\nI am writing in reference to the Oliva\nGans lecture against abortion on Jan\n26th which I was unable to attend.\nFirst of all, I found the publicity quite\ndistressing. I had an abortion about\nsix or seven months ago which I am\ntrying hard to forget. The posters\nproclaiming me a 'victim of abortion'\ndid nothing to help the healing\nprocess. When I chose abortion, I chose life for me. Had I a baby at 18\nas I was then, I would never have\nbeen able to put the child up for\nadoption (nor, I believe would my\nboyfriend). I would have ended up\nmarried with a baby, no degree, and\nnot much of a life ahead of me. As\nChas Jackson pointed out, PATA is\nsupposed to show positive alternatives\nto abortion. For me there was no\npositive alternative. For most women\nwho don't want to throw themselves\naway on a child they didn't want, a husband they might n't stick with and\nall career prospects destroyed, there\nare no positive alternatives.\nIt should be the woman's right to\nchoose.\nName wit held by request\nThe Other\nSide\nDear Dave\nIn answer to Chas Jackson's letter\n(FELIX No 760), I would like to\npoint out that a large amount of\nPATA's activities have, in fact,\nemphasized the positive alternatives\nto abortion.\nIndeed, not only is much of our\nliterature devoted to the subject but\nmany of our guests have spoken on\nit as well. Planned for this term is a debate relating to positive alternatives\nto abortion, which will go ahead if we\nare able to find someone from the pro-abortion lobby who is willing to\nspeak.\nAs an example of our activities, I would like to recall a talk given by\nAngela Gracey, of LIFE, at the very\nbeginning of last term. It was called\n\"The Positive Alternatives to\nAbortion.\" In her talk Angela Gracey\nillustrated how voluntary\norganisations, such as LIFE, provide\nsupport to pregnant women who are\nunder pressure to have an abortion.\nThis support, she said, includes\naccommodation, health care, material\nhelp and financial advice (all before\nand after birth) and not least, advice\ngiven on adoption of supposedly\n\"unwanted\" children. Thus, she spelt\nout how a woman who chooses not\nto abort is given help both to choose\nand to bring about a future for her\nchild; adoption, special medical care\nor caring for it herself being a few of\nthe positive alternatives to killing it.\nYours,\nM Soane (PATA Treasurer)\nMouthpiece\nDear FELIX\nFELIX is, I presume, the 'official'\nmouthpiece of ICU. The Union\nhowever claims to be 'non-political'\nand uses this as part of its justification\nfor remaining aloof from the NUS.\nIf this 'non-political' stance is so\nimportant to the Union why does it\ngive so much space (V4 page in this\nissue) to the meetings of the\nConservative Society?\nI want to read, in a student paper,\nabout those issues which are\nimportant to me as a student. If I want\nto read political pro pog and a I will buy\nthe Express (or one of the other Tory\nFleet Street rags).\nNuff said, I think.\nNick Thompson Computing PG\nLight\nFingers\nDear Dave,\nThursday evening some tw at( or\nperhaps t**t) in College thought it'd be a bit of a laugh to steal the lights\nfrom a bike and then return them\nFriday morning with a note saying\n'never leave your cycle lights on the\nbike.'\nAs I don't know who it was, could\nhe please contact me through FELIX\nto pay me \u00a31.80 for bus fares, buy\nmy next week's shopping at\nSainsbury's and get a good kick in the\ngroin.\nYours sincerely,\nIrate Biker\nDear Dt.- 1\nLesbians and gays are not different.\nYet anyone who admits to being gay\nat Imperial College is subjected to\nabuse and ridicule. Statistics suggest\nthat 10% of IC students should be\ngay. How many gay and lesbian\nstudents do you know? IC has a homophobic atmosphere that either\nforces people to hide their sexuality\nor discourages gays and lesbians from\napplying to IC.\nAny group that is subject to the sort\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.

    "content": "Cluba FELIX, Friday February 6th1987 CYCLING\nOn your bikes With the first race of the season\nlooming, the serious racing members\nof the club have increased their\ntraining schedules to include two\nweights-sessions and swimming each\nweek, in addition to maintaining an\naverage of at least thirty miles on the\nbike per day whenever possible.\nWell-established riders Rob Newton,\nSteve Turtle, Andy Major and\nMatthew Whitaker are already\nbeginning to look like a formidable\nteam for the season ahead, with\nseveral new-comers also showing\ngreat promise at a relatively early\nstage in their training.\nDue to Katherine Hunter's unexpected success in the Student\nNational 10-mile Championship last\nyear (where she finished 2nd in the\nwomens' category), the Club would\nvery much like to recruit a full\nwomens' team (of at least three\nmembers) to enter all of the Student\nNational events this year\u2014where they\nwould have a very good chance of\nwinning team prizes. However, since\nKatherine graduated in the summer\nwe now only have one serious female\nmember, and shall have to pass up a golden opportunity for prize-winning\nunless we rectify the situation shortly.\nRacing aside, new touring members\nare also a bit thin on the ground so\nfar. People tend to forget that there\nis a more relaxed side to cycling\u2014\nwe do, in fact organise touring\nweekends on a regular basis, but\ncancel them through lack of support\non an equally regular basis. These\nevents are normally fun, and consist\nfor the greater part of stopping every\nfew miles for cream teas in quaint old\ncottage-restaurants. It would be nice\nto see this side of the Club expand as\nwell as the racing teams.\nThe Cycling Club is here for all of\nyou to enjoy\u2014we meet at 12.30pm on\nThursdays above the Southside Bar to\nplan a programme for the week\nahead\u2014so do come along and talk to\nus if you are at all interested. We will\nbe happy to offer advice on equipment\nand maintenance to anyone in trouble\nand will shortly have a full set of tools\nin the workshop to help you get your\nbike roadworthy.\nAndy Major (Physics II)\nPARACHUTING\nOut of the blue\nEver thought of joining those fearless\ndaredevils who love to throw\nthemselves out of planes at ridiculous\nheights! The next bit wasn'ta sentence\nso we didn't print it. If so then why\nnot join the ultra safety conscious\nparachute club and learn hoe to sky\ndive?\nWe're holding a first jump course\non the 25th and 26th of this month.\nTwo fully qualified parachute\ninstructors will be coming down to\nCollege to instruct you how to\nparachute. The course is only \u00a365 for\nyour first jump and after that any\nfurther jumps will cost you as little\nas \u00a34 a time.\nWe are holding a meeting in the\nLounge (Beit Quad) on Tuesday 17th at 12.30 to 1.00pm. If you want to\njoin the club and learn how to\nparachute come along and we'll give\nyou further details. Could you also\nbring \u00a34 club membership and a \u00a310\ndeposit for the course so we can\nestimate the numbers involved.\nSAILING\nHigh seas The IC team braved the cold and did\nbattle in a friendly match with a mixed\nBristol team. Adam Stork showed\nconsiderable potential with aggressive\ntactics, despite tangling with one of\nthe buoys, but IC were narrowly\ndefeated. In the second race Richard\nJarman led the team in a roundabout\nway but IC's superior boat speed helped them level the score.\nBoth teams revelled in the close\ncompetition and improved throughout\nthe day. The final race was the closest\nof the day. Several of the Bristol team\nwere forward at the start but\nApostolous Leonhidopolous was in\ni hot pursuit for IC. The positions were\nchanging constantly, Ape went to the\nback at one point, but brilliant team\nwork by Richard Brimelow and Sam\nPage gained a winning 1, 2\ncombination. Gareth David suffered\nmajor gear failure on the last leg,\npreventing a clean sweep. The final\nresult was open to interpretation (each\nteam claimed to have won) but we\nowe our thanks to Bristol for\norganising '' 'st weekend of the\nseason.\nTeam: Sam Page (Capt), Richard\nBrimelow, Richard Jarman, Adam\nStork, Gareth David, Apostolous\nLeonhidopolous\nOPSOC\nHigh C's There were two children brought up\nby Little Buttercup, a Portsmouth\nbum boat woman. One infant is\nwealthy, well-connected etc; the other\nis of more lowly descent. At this\npoint, Little Buttercup gets the pair\nmixed up (this seems to be obligatory\nin such cases).\nTime goes by. The child of humble\ndescent becomes Captain Corcoran of\nHer Majesties Ship Pinafore, the\nother is now Ralph Rackstraw a humble fore-mast hand on board the\nvery same ship. Love now decides to\ndo a spot of burgeoning. Captain\nCorcoran has a grown-up daughter,\nJosephine, who loves and is loved by\nRalph Rackshaw. Little Buttercup\nsustains an ill-concealed passion for\nher erstwhile charge, Captain\nCorcoran who is prevented from\nresponding, only by his snobbery.\nThe arrival of the First Lord of the\nAdmiralty, Sir Joseph Porter plus a retinue of sisters, cousins and aunts\nstirs things up a bit. Sir Joseph wants\nto marry the Captain's daughter and\nhis plea that love levels all ranks (in\ncase she should feel in awe of him)\nso affects her that she determines to\nelope with Ralph Rackstraw after all.\nThe attempt is eventually foiled by\nCaptain Corcoran, who is so\naggrieved by Ralph's temerity in\nloving the Captain's daughter, that he\nuses a rude word. This, if we are to\ntrust the historical verisimilitude of\nMr Gilbert's work is a pretty heinous\ncrime. Ralph too is imprisoned by Sir\nJoseph, and Buttercup selects this epic\njuncture to reveal the true identities\nof Ralph and the Captain. Evidently\nthis changes everything\u2014Sir Joseph\nno longer wants to marry Josephine\nnow she is the daughter of a humble\nfore-mast hand so she is free to marry\nRalph. Ex-Captain Corcoran,\nreleased from the toils of his own\nsnobbery, is free to marry Little\nButtercup. For the sake of\nthoroughness Sir Joseph marries\nHebe, an obnoxious cousin of his.\nAlso being performed is \"The\nZoo'' by Sullivan and Rowe\u2014a turgid\ntale of love thwarted by a stern father.\nIt also contains a peer in the guise of\na saxophonist, a lobster in the guise\nof a Pterodactyl, and some elephant\nmanure in a galvani sed bucket.\nAll this takes place in the Union\nConcert Hall at 7.30pm from Tuesday\n10th February to Saturday 14th February. Tickets are a vial able from\nSherfield level 2, the Union building\nentrance (next to Norman's) \u2014at\nlunchtimes and also from the Haldane\nLibrary, OpSoc members or on the\ndoor.\nFILMSOC\nGoing our way? IC Film Society's next presentation,\nthis Thursday 12th in Physics LT1\n(doors 7.30pm) is The f fi'/c fer(1986) starring Rutger Haver (Eureka, Blade\nRunner).\nC Thomas Howell plays a young\nguy who must fight for his life when\nThe Hitcher (Rutger Haver) tries to\nframe him for his ugly crimes.\nSchwarzenegger might make a good\nmacho hero, but Rutger Haver is\nmuch more subtle and never more so\nthan in this breathtakingly taut\nthriller-on-wheels.\nThe tension in the film is piled on\nwith a fork-lift truck, and the suspense\nis almost unbearable. The story line\nworks with the deadly accuracy of\nknife through butter.\nOne reviewer described Haver's performance as \"brilliant and\ndisturbingly dangerous; enough to\nleave you with the impression that he\nis genuinely mad.\" Enough said?\nNext Thursday FilmSoc is showing\nthe highly acclaimed thriller Jagged\nEdge, starring Jeff Bridges and Glen\nClose.\n50p members, \u00a31 non-members,\nmembership available.\nMartin Gans\nQTSOC\nBoxing Following criticism from on high that\nQTSoc has become Dayist, meetings\nhave now been rescheduled from\nTuesdays to Thursdays.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday February 6th198710 A young unmarried woman tries to\nconceal her pregnancy and gives birth\nto a stillborn child. Later the body of\na newly born baby is found stabbed\nto death on a nearby beach. The\nwoman is accused of its murder, and\ndespite the incompatibility of blood\ngroups, the discovery of the body of\nher baby in the field where she buried\nit and the complete lack of any\nsubstantial evidence, charges are\npressed, following the mistreatment\nof the woman whilst in police\ncustody.\nThis is not fiction, it is the Kessy\nBaby Case in Ireland in 1984. The\nstory of Joanne Hayes was not a murder hunt, it was an investigation\ninto the morality of a country where\npre-marital sex and contraception are\nbanned. Joanne Hayes was a naive\nscapegoat.\nFallen at the Drill Hall Arts Centre\nis a one-woman show (by Polly\nTeale), retelling the story from\nHayes' point of view. Consequently\nit deals more with her upbringing, the\naffair with a married man that led to\nthe pregnancy, and life in rural\nIreland than it does with the\ninternational storm of protest against\nthe Irish State that exploded when\nnews of the case broke.\nCarole Pluckrose is superb as the\nconfused Joanne. Julia Bardsley's production deals well with this\ncontroversial story. It is one of those\nstories that would have been\ndismissed as inconceivable had it been\nwritten as a piece of fiction. I greatly\nrecommend you see it before it closes\non February 14th. Liz Holford\nJourney among\nthe dead\nThe title is a perfect summary of the\nplay: an autobiographical account of\nthe central character's life. It is set in\nJean's mind in the past, present and\nfuture and one never knows what is\nreal, allegorical or fantasy, for\nexample Jean witnesses a conversation between himself and his\nfather which they never actually\nhad\u2014but should have. Jean condemns\nor praises all that he has done, is\nplagued by indecision, feels guilt and\nshows great selfishness.\nThe play becomes more unnatural\nand surreal as it progresses. Jean\nbecomes unable to distinguish\nbetween his mother, grandmother and\nall the other people he has hated and\nstripped of their pride. Towards the\nend we discover the reason for Jean's frustration\u2014he is unable to find 'the\nfinal truth'. The whole play climaxes\nwith Jean's harrowing confession of\nhis innermost secrets.\nMost of the acting is good, the\nnaturalistic way in which Jean is!\nportrayed contrasts well with the\ncaricatures of the rest of the cast.\nThere is a lot to take in at one sitting\nbut something with which everyone\ncan identify in Journeys Among the\nDead. I did not understand all of the\nplay. I would have to find out more\nabout its writer, Eugene Ionesco, to\ndo that, but I was left with a need to\ndo this, which I suppose is one of the\nmarks of a good play.\nAlex Snelling\nPenny for a song\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company will\nbe showing, until the 7th March, a production of \" A Penny for a Song,''\nby John Whiting at the Barbican\nTheatre. It is probably the most\npopular of Whiting's plays, and, in\nmy opinion, one of the best.\nThe production was visually\nsuperb, with a beautiful set, fully\nworthy of the high standard expected\nof the RSC.\nIt is the story of a group of\ncolourful eccentrics, all of whom have\ntheir own contrasting characters. An\nexample of this is, in his own eyes at\nleast, the hero of the play, \"Sir\nTimothy Bellboys.'' the owner of the\nhouse and garden where the play is\nset. The play revolves around his\nattempt to defeat Napoleon and his\nseventy-five thousand troops single\nhanded. His master plan will not be\nrevealed here, but includes his\ndisappearance down a well and his\nsubsequent spectacular reappearance\nin a large red hot air balloon, less than\ntriumphant.\n\" A Penny for a Song\" has all the\ningredients of a good comic farce, and\ntakes advantage of them with\nmaximum effect. By going to see this\nplay you will have the chance of\nseeing one of the world's finest\ndramatic groups putting on a performance of what is, to me, an\nexcellent comedy. In short, I would\nrecommend anyone to see this\nproduction if at all possible\u2014a very\nfunny play, well produced\u2014all in all\na highly enjoyable night out.\nMiles Henderson\nThe keep\nFour years after its release in\nAmerica, The Keep comes to London.\nIts reception in the US, which can\nonly be described as lukewarm to\ntepid, may well have been a contributing factor to its late release\nhere.\nScripted and directed by Michael\nMann, (Starsky and Hutch, Miami\nVice), The Keep is very loosely based\non the idea of a fable, set in World\nWar II. The film centers around an\nold 'Keep' in the Carpathian Alps,\nwhich the Germans take over as a stronghold. Ignoring the advice of the\nlocals to leave, they stay and sure\nenough release the monster, Radu\nMolasar, a seven foot 'being', and the\ncorpses follow with alarming\nregularity.\nThe bodies left scattered around\ncauses the Nazi head command to\nbring in the SS-man Kaempffer\n(Gabriel Byrne) to take over from\nCapt. Woermann. Woermann,\nwonderfully portrayed by Jurgen\nProchnow, is a kind, gentle character,\nCop's Honour, a french film starring\nAlain Delon, is the story of one man's revenge against the killings of his wife\nand daughter. It is also extremely\nfunny.\nThe worrying thing is, however,\nthat it is meant to be deadly serious\nwith a few obvious jokes here and\nthere; I found it hysterical,\ninterspersed with gory bits now and\nagain. Perhaps the overall impression\nof the film is aptly summed up by the\nfact that the hero goes by the name\nof Daniel Pratt. It seems as though the\nmakers of the film have taken all the\nstandard ingredients of police films,\nmashed them altogether and put the\nresult in the oven at too low a temperature.\nThe rugged hero; the simple, easy-to-follow plot; the token\npolicewoman\u2014pretty, but not quite as\ngood at her job as her male\ncounterparts\u2014they all lacked a certain\nje ne sais quoi (sorry!)\nEven the obligatory car chase was\nsadly lacking in credibility\u2014Renaults\nbelting round the back streets of Lyon\nsomehow can't compete with the\nAmerican version. Still, there is\nplenty of blood and guts to fill the\nvoid\u2014not a film for the squeamish.\nDelon manages to survive the film\nby amazing luck and some pretty\nunbelievable physical acrobatics, but\nat the end one is left with a feeling\nof having been somewhat cheated, as\nthe rest of the cast is either dead or\nmaimed.\nBy the time the story-line seems to\nbe improving and one thinks that\nmaybe the script writer did have an\nimagination, it's too late. The credits\nbegin to roll accompanied by the\ndreadful theme tune sung in heavy\n\"alio-'alio' accents.\nDefinitely not a film for the\nsqueamish!\nHelena Russell\nReviews FELIX, Friday February 6th198711 bc X k STROKE The Russian film Farewell, based on\nthe novel Farewell to Matyora by\nValentin Rasputin, is directed by Elim\nKlimov. The film deals with the\nevacuation of Matyora, a remote\nisland village in Siberia, which is to\nbe flooded for a new hydro-electric\ndam. The central character is an old\nwoman called Daria, who represents\nthe traditional peasant community and\ncannot accept that all she has known\nis to be destroyed. Her son, however,\nfeels that there is no choice and is\ngiven the job of relocating the\npeasants to the mainland. However,\nthe conflict between mother and son\nis not exploited in such a way as\nwould turn the film into an emotive\ndrama concerning only one family.\nThe film is very visual, the\natmosphere being created largely by\nthe evocation of the elemental bond\nor empathy that the community has\nwith nature. Whatever your reaction\nto the striking use of nature in the\nfilming, it remains that the basic\nconflict of humanity versus\nmodernisation and technological\nadvancement is the overriding\nconcern in Farewell. In the end\nNature shows its power to thwart\nactions and whether, in this case, this\nis ultimately advantageous or\ndetrimental, it points to the simple fact\nthat human beings are not as in\ncontrol as they like to think. Films\nwith sub-titles are unfortunately not\nas widely shown as they should be.\nLack of commercial appeal should not\nhowever deter you from viewing\nFarewell. Its appeal lies largely in the\nvery fact that it gives access to the\nperspective of a Soviet filmmaker.\nElim Klimov, recently elected\nSecretary of the Soviet Filmmakers'\nUnion in Moscow, will be in London\nto open Farewell at the Renoir\nCinema, Russell Square, WC1, on the\n1st May. During his stay he will also\nbe giving a Guardian Lecture at the\nNational Film Theatre on Tuesday\n28th April, when he will talk about\nrecent developments in Soviet\ncinema.\nCatherine Manolopoulos\nwho would have fought against the\nNazis in the Spanish Civil War, had\nhe been there. Prochnow forces us to\nrealise that not all the Germans were\nevil, by portraying a character that\neveryone can associate with. It's a pity though, that his wonderful\nperformance is slightly marred by a very c oars ly acted final drunk scene.\nHowever, his interaction with Mr\nByrne is a delight. Byrne's Kaempffer\nis as cold as Prochnow's Woermann\nis warm\u2014and these two provide most\ninterest in an otherwise fairly dull\nfilm.\nWhy Mr Mann claims that the star\nof the film is Scott Glenn, I will never\nknow. Apart from half a dozen lines\nhis performance is merely of an\nobserver, f''1 of Clint Eastwood\nbut without the power. His love affair\nwith Alberta Watson, playing the\ndaughter of a Jewish professor (Ian\nMcKellen\u2014perfectly at ease as\nnormal) brought in to help the\nGermans stop the deaths, is as\nconvincing as Glenn's original\nwaking scene. This scene is typical\nof the whole film, by moving from\na very simple idea, that of Claeken\nTrismegistus (Scott Glenn), waking\nand realising he must go and kill\nMolosar, to a point where the scene\nis played with strange lights and the\nsame music that had been battering\nour eardrums since the start, and thus\ncan only be remembered for the fact\nit is curiously out of place in a very\ndark and murky film.\nThe music by Tangerine Dream,\nwhile fitting the atmosphere perfectly,\nthen proceeds to completely negate\nthis effect by becoming overused and\nconsequently monotonous. The film\nhowever does have some very good\npoints, not ica bly the photography\nwhich ranges from a superb close up\nof a match bursting into light, to the\nfantastic death scene at the end.\nThe cameraman saves the film from\ndescending into the depths of\nforgotten flops, although there is also\nsome good humour. It is an\ninteresting experience.\nCustom car-painting has been in the\ndoldrums for a long time, but that is\nsoon to change with the development\nof a brand new type of paint. The\npaint is composed of liquid crystals\nthat produce different colours when\na charge is passed through it. The\ncurrent causes the particles to line up\nin various orientations according to\nthe current used, and to produce the\nvaio us hues. Under computer control\nvery complex designs can be\nproduced on car bodies in the time\nthat it takes to spray a normal car.\nOnce the paint has dried the crystals\nstay in place permanently.\nIt is now possible to produce cars\nwith instant 'go faster' stipes and paint\nfurry dice for little more than the cost\nof are pray.A further development\nto aid advertising on cars and vans is\nthe moving paintwork, where a television picture is produced using\na spare car battery to drive the image,\nwith the production of non-drying\ncrystals.\nKeeping your notepaper in pristine\ncondition always presents problems.\nNo matter where it is kept it gets dog-eared and dirty. However there is\nnow a solution in the form of bottled\npaper. Using differences in surface\ntension in the cellulose solution a complete piece of paper can be poured\nin one go. The paper comes in a variety of sizes and weights marked\nby a colour coded top. Scientists are\nstill working on a way of\nincorporating a watermark into each\nsheet, something which has so far\neluded them.\nComputer technology has once\nagain come to the aid of the music\nindustry. The introduction of the\nFairlight synthesizer opened up a whole new range of sound to the\ncomposer. However, this new found\nchoice has left them confused as to\nwhich sound to use next, leading to\nlong delays in recording. The\ninvention of the new random sound\ngenerator has freed composers from\nall this painful decision making by\nselecting all the required sounds that\nthe computer sees fit. The system can\nbe programmed to take care of\nvarious song types with the settings\nof 'Bucks Fizz', 'Peter Gabriel' and\n'Stockhausen'.\n\n"

Producing the IC Rag Mag for the start\nof the next academic year\nAnyone can help on it at the Editors discretion!\nThe Election will be at the Rag Meeting on\nFriday 13th February, 12.45pm, Upper Lounge\nIf you are interested in standing please see a member of the Rag Exec, or come to the meeting\nWhat does she do all day?\nOr, the first in a series of sabbatical job\ndescriptions, scheduled to coincide with the run up\nto the ICU elections later this term. Here Christine\nTaig outlines her job as Union President.\nIt was around this time last year that\nI started seeing blinding flashes of\nlightning and hearing voices from the\nclouds saying \"Go on Christine, why\nnot?\" Actually, that's not entirely\ntrue\u2014it was my flat mate who\npersuaded me to stand for ICU\nPresident (and we're still friends!)\nWell, the year's gone by at immense\nspeed and now Dave Jones is hassling\nme to write something about my job\n\"as we all become gripped by election\nfever.\" So for all of you with roaring\ntemperatures, here goes...\nThere's a job description for the\nPresident in the Union By-laws. It's very short. Don't be fooled...You\ncould, of course, do very little in this\njob as in any other, but if you take\nit at all seriously it involves long\nhours and hard work. Being an\nengineer was never like this; it is a job, not a \"year off.\" My only bit\nof advice is this\u2014if anyone is thinking\nof standing for President\u2014or ANY\nsabbatical post\u2014in order to gain\npower/a good CV/lots of\n\"freebies\"\u2014forget it now.\nBack to the job description. The\nPresident has overall responsibility\nfor everything the Union does. This\ndoesn't mean that the whole thing\nruns on one ego\u2014in a good year the\nsabbaticals work very much as a team\nand share decisions and duties. We\nalso get wonderful permanent staff\nwithout whom the Union would fall\napart; there's very little sense of\n'hierarchy' in the Union structure.\nHowever, it ultimately falls to the\nPresident to ensure that Union policy\nis carried out and coordinate the work\nof staff, sabbatical and other officers\nand the various Union committees.\nThe President also presents the\npublic face of the students of IC (just\nhope I don't look as bad as my photos,\nthen)\u2014representing your interests to\nCollege and the rest of the known\nUniverse, if anyone's interested.\nThis all means an awful lot of time\nin committees\u2014most of which do\nmake decisions affecting all students,\nhowever tedious they may appear;\nvast amounts of listening to people's ideas, criticisms and problems; lots\nof time hassling or cajoling people\ninto getting things done. As for the\n\"freebies\"\u2014these are usually not the\nwild parties everyone assumes they\nare but more of an exercise in talking\nshop and sounding people out.\nIt's impossible to predict what a week as President will be like (apart\nfrom Freshers week which is\nludicrous, sleepless, chaos) as you\nhave to respond to situations as they\narise. Your diary is usually pretty full\na week in advance and there are\nconstant streams of phone calls,\nletters and visits from people wanting\ninformation, advice or help. Finding\ntime to write monthly reports for\nCouncil or UGM's or weekly drivel\nfor FELIX is not always easy.\nSo, is the life of a sabbatical a happy one?? Yes\u2014as long as you\ndon't expect too much sleep, don't expect major changes to happen\novernight, don't mind doing the hard\nwork yourself when nobody else\nbothers, and above all get used to\npeople telling you the Union's a waste\nof time and that you don't do anything\nworthwhile. Apart from that you have\na fairly amazing time, encounter some\nbrilliant people and strange situations,\nand gain a lot of experience to boot.\nMaybe I should go into marketing\nafter this...\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday February 6th19875 SKIS Heliconic Hassles \u2014 solution\nOf the three solutions I recieved to\nthis, only one solved the problem\nusing the easiest and neatest method\nof modular arithmetic. In modular\narithmetic (also known as 'clock'\narithmetic) an integer number is only\nconsidered as it's remainder when\ndevi ded by another, for example the\nnumber 23 taken modulus 5 (this is\nnotated 23mod5) is equal to 3. Notice\nthat, modulus 5, all numbers become\neither 0,1,2,3,or 4 (0 if the number\nis divisible by 5). Modular arithmetic\nworks as ordinary arithmetic under\naddition and subtraction, e.g.(6+7) mod5=6 mod5+7 mod5i. e.13mo d5=3=1+2. Of course\nthese equations work equally well\nmodulus any number, but 5 is the\nnumber we are interested in. When\nsquaring numbers you have to be\nmore careful in modular arithmetic,\nthe correct expression is (X2\n)mod5=( Xmod5)2\nmod5( you can check\nthat). So the possible results, mod5, of squaring any integer can only be:\n02\nmod5=0, l2 mod5=1,22, nod5=4,32 mod5=1, and\n42\nmod5=1,i. e.0,1,4, are the only\npossible results.\nNow consider taking Pythagoras'\nequation, X2+Y2=Z2, modulus\n5. The equation can only now involve\nthe numbers 0,1,or 4, and is\nimpossible to complete using just 1\nand 4. Thus, taken mod5, one of\nX2,Y2, or Z2, must be zero and\nthus one of X,Y,Z must be divisible\nby 5. Well done if you followed all\nthat, I hope I explained it clearly.\nThe winner was Edward Phiri,\nMech Eng 1, who's solution was a lot\nless elegant than this, although\ncorrect. You can collect your \u00a35 after\n1.00pm Wednsday.\nHexagonal Unsymmetry\nSince I can't think of an unam using story to go with this problem I 'll just\ntell it to you. Imagine you have 19\npoints arranged in a hexagon as\nshown below.\nNow imagine picking 10 of them\nso that there are an even number of\npoints in every column, row, and\ndiagonal. One of the solutions to this\nis shown below, but notice that it has\na plane of symmetry (as shown).\nWhat I want is simply a solution that\nhas no plane of symmetry. There is\nonly one \u2014 good luck.\nSolutions, for the \u00a35 prize, to the\nFELIX office by 1.00pm Wednsday,\nplease.

For the benefit of his\nnew readers he has asked me to define\nhis aim in these columns: The job of\na satire, it has been rightly said, is to\nstrip off the veneer of cosy\nrespectability and half truth in which\nwe clothe ourselves, and Walter's post, as he sees it, is to put it back\nagain.\nThe main fur ore in past weeks has\nconcerned a certain fast-food outlet\nwhich has been much under fire by\nHurricane Christine. Walter has\nrefused to be drawn on this, except\nfor a rare misquote: Ninety percent\nimagination and ten percent\nindigestion...\nOf much more interest to such a sporting chap at this time of the year,\napproaching once more, when\nputative sabbaticals don the gloves\nand start swinging with all their\nmight. Doubly interesting this year to\nobserve the possible use of a hockey\nstick as a weapon! Walter does wish,\nhowever, that these people would stop\nswinging once they have been elected.\nThe final subject of Walters\nattention this week, is the move afoot\non the part of ULU to make (and he\nquotes): \"Hard-wearing condoms and\nwater-based lubricants available in\nevery bar in every college...\"\nWalter feels that most bars already\nprovide an acceptable range of water-based lubricants, and with the current\npopularity of tinned light beers,\nsomeone at Imperial is due for a nasty\nshock if they approach the barman\nand ask for a six-pack of Red Stripe.\nMore Anon\nPhoto\nCaption\nCompetition\nWin!

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday February 6th198716 Ash on\nChernobyl\nThe Rector, Professor Ash, spoke\nabout his views on the risks associated\nwith the nuclear industry at a packed\nlecture during Tuesday lunchtime.\nSpeaking in the Read Lecture Theatre\nhe gave a talk entitled \"The\nPerception of Risk\u2014A PostChernobyl View\" as part of the\nregular 'lunchtime programme\norganised by the Humanities\nDepartment.\nProfessor Ash started by discussing\nthe Chernobyl incident itself and the\nproblems of drawing meaningful\nconclusions from estimates of the\ndeath toll. He stressed the\nincompatibility of projected long term\nfatality figures with statistics such as\ndeaths from travel accidents. He also\ncommented on the difference between\ndeaths from health hazards such as\nsmoking and those from Chernobyl,\nin the case of smoking there was, he\nsaid, an element of personal choice.\nThe Rector gave credit to Professor\nApSimon of the Nuclear Technology\nsection for assistance in preparing his\ninformation.\nProfessor Ash then went on to\noutline scenarios in which future\nenergy crises could lead to large scale\ncatastrophe. In particular he\nexpressed a fear that the continued\ndependence of the West upon oil\ncould embroil it in a disastrous\nescalation of Middle Eastern conflict.\nHe then discussed media and\nemotional reaction to varying scales\nof disaster.\nDiscussing the potential for future\nenergy sources Professor Ash argued\nthat nuclear fission was an important\noption and said he believed it could\nbe made safe. Speaking about fusion\nresearch the Rector said he couldn't foresee any practical developments\nuntil late in the next century. In\nanswer to a question he lamented the\nlow level of spending on alternative\nenergy research and said he believed\nthere were several very promising\nideas at an early stage, citing\nphotosynthesis processes being\ndeveloped at Imperial as a possible\n'dark horse.'\nImperial College Women's Club\nTo ail WOMEN Staff, Academic\nVisitors, Research Assistants, Post-graduate\nStudents, and Wives of their male colleagues\nWould you like to see an improvement in the\nfacilities for women at Imperial College?\nThen we need your help and you can gain from\nthe friendship and social activities of the\nWomen's Club.\nContact Mrs Glenys Pashley on 788-4800, or\nsend to her for further information\nc/o Department of Materials.\nAlarm calls in\nSouthside\nStudents in Southside were awoken by\nthe faulty alarm system at 11.30pm on Sunday. The alarms rang\nintermittently for twenty minutes,\nuntil College Security turned the\nsystem off.\nWater leaks are believed to be the\noriginal cause of the malfunction. The\ntransistors in the display panel were\nalso found to be completely burnt out.\nThis would have made it impossible\nto locate a real fire. The panel was\nrepaired on Monday afternoon.\nRecurrent false alarms in Southside\nhave resulted in generalised\nindifference which may prove\ndangerous in the event of a real fire,\na Southside Sub-warden said.\nSouth African\ncancels at LSE\nDr Denis Worrel, ex-South African\nAmbassador, cancelled his proposed\nappearance at LSE on Monday 2nd February. The reason for his\ncancellation is connected with his\nresignation from the position of\nAmbassador\u2014he will be running as\nan 'Independent' in the forthcoming\nwhites-only elections and as such can\nhardly speak as a representative of the\nPretoria Government.\nThe debate, organised by LSE\nStudents Union \"Open Debate\nForum\" Society, was due to be\npickett ed by the Union, which also\nproposed to disassociate the Debating\nClub from the Union, and organise an\nalternative meeting at the same time.\nThe President of the \"Open Debate\nForum\" fully intends to invite Dr\nWorrel to speak on a future occasion.\nJCR plans\ndelayed\nThe future of the JCR may not be\nresolved for some time, following the\nmeeting of Union officers with\nCollege administration on Thursday\nof last week. After three and a half\ndays of a successful boycott of the QT\nBurger Bar, College have asked IC\nUnion to come up with specific\nproposals for the JCR. At today's meeting of Finance and Executive,\none of the most powerful College\nCommittees, ICU Exec will be\nproposing a long-term plan to build\na new JCR, together with a sports\nhall. The Union's response to the\nimmediate problem of the JCR will\nnot be decided until Tuesday's Union\nGeneral Meeting.\nCollege Deputy Secretary Brian\nLloyd Davies told FELIX that the\ncontractors would be continuing with\nconversion work on the JCR until\nMarch 15th. Over Easter they would\nbegin a general refurbishment of\nSouthside refectory.\nEvelyn War The College has put forward its bid\nfor the purchase of new\naccommodation in Evelyn Gardens.\nThe residences consist of a unit of ten\nhouses, providing accommodation for\nat least 200 students. If the bid is\naccepted, the College should be ready\nto meet the planned increase in\nstudent numbers in October.\nThe value of Imperial's bid is\nestimated at three to five million\npounds, but the College has refused\nto give further details as this may\nprejudice their chances against other\nbidders.\nNo l Mr Ripped of fid\" This iS Mr Very\nEasy -to-DraW,\nHe's oo;na, to\nCollie in Mr Land\nYou can tell Mr E \u00ab\n-fco-Dmu> iso St\nHe thinks he's ju\u00abt SO fr jock uj Isn'tV fc\" funn u that there are\nno Mr Women\nin Mr Land?

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday February 6th19874I beg to\ndiffer,\nMr Goosen\nDear Dave,\nToday I attended the talk given by\nMr Goosen from the South African\nEmbassy Cut of interest in what the\n'other side' had to say.\nI disagreed with Mr Goosen on\nmany points but the main source of\ndisagreement is South Africa's invasion of ne igbo u ring countries in\nthe name of countering ' ANC terrorism' as he put it. He justified\nthis by saying that the South African\nGovernment couldn't call across\nborders to ask the ANC 'terrorists' to\ncome over. He got applause and\nlaughter for this tasteless joke.\nEarlier in Mr Goosen's talk, he\ncompared the 'terrorist wing' of the\nANC with the IRA. However, unlike\nhis country's high handed strikes on\nANC bases in neighbouring\ncountries, suspected IRA terrorists\nmust be extradited according to the\nlaws of the country in which they are\nfound. He also said that he fully\ncondoned the killing of ANC 'terrorists' as part of the fight against\nterrorism.'\nIn my opinion this shows a flagrant\nlack of respect for the independence\nof the surrounding African states. The\nSouth African Government is\nviolating the constitutions of these\ncountries and is not being seen to act\nwithin the bounds of international\nlaw. This makes nonsense of their\nclaims to want peaceful reform and\nthey are not respecting independent\ngovernments run by black people.\nHow then can we believe that they\nwill respect the wishes of South\nAfrica's black majority whom, he\nclaims, the South African\nGovernment want to incorporate into\nthe ruling body of the country.\nYours sincerely,\nKemi Adenubi, Civ Eng II\nProtest\nimperfect\nDear Sir,\nI have just attended Peter Goosen's talk for ConSoc on South Africa, and\nleft disgusted. Not by the opinions\nexpressed by the speaker, but by the\nway his views were opposed from\noutside the lecture theatre.\n\"What about democracy?\" they\nshouted, all but drowning a question\nfrom the floor on votes for blacks.\n\"What about censorship?\" they\nyelled, preventing us hearing the\nreply. \"Tell them about Soweto!\" we\nheard them bawl. I would have liked\nto have heard a reply to that one.\nIndeed if they'd been inside the\nlecture theatre, putting the point to the\nspeaker, we all would have heard an\nanswer. But they weren't. After the talk I asked, for a future\ndebate, the names of the ConSoc\norganisers. They gave me them. I asked for the names of some of those\noutside, explaining why. \"Put up\nposters,\" they said \"we'll be there.\"\nThey wouldn't give their names, nor\nwould they be willing to speak for\ntheir cause, debate it, or answer\nquestions on their views. All things\nPeter Goosen would and did do. I abhor apartheid and mob rule. I admire Peter Goosen for his public\nstand against both.\nYours,\nDan Salmons, Chairman,\nDebating Society\nLast and\nleast\nDear Dave,\nI have just written a letter to you.\nOn reflection I realise it to be very\nboring, and have therefore thrown it\nin the bin.\nI hope this action meets with your\napproval.\nYours sincerely,\nNosmo King\nLetters should be submitted to the\nFELIX Office by 1.30pm on the\nTuesday before publication. For\nSports Reports, Club Articles and\nWhat's On entries the deadline is\n1.30pm Monday. No entry will be\naccepted after these times.\nSouth African Speaker\nMany people I have spoken to since\nPeter Goosen's visit on Tuesday have\ntaken the view that his ideas were\nfairly progressive, and that his wish\nfor a' 'one man one vote system'' was\ngenuine. It has also been noted that\nnearly all the coloured people who\nattended came to listen to Mr\nGoosen's speech and ask questions,\nrather than join the vociferous group\nof demonstrators outside the lecture\ntheatre. Though I sat and listened\nattentively to what he had to say, at\nseveral points during the meeting I wished I had joined the protestors. Mr\nGoosen came across as generally very\nreasonable, but his arguments about\nthe use of violence by the ANC were\ngrossly inconsistent. I do not accept\nhis contention that the onus is on the\ncoloured leaders to come forward and\nnegotiate. The South African\ngovernment have used brutal means\nto subdue the majority of the\npopulation; to adopt a' 'holier than\nthou\" attitude and refuse to negotiate\nwith groups who may have condoned\nviolent acts is hypocrisy of a disgraceful nature. Oppression by\nviolence will breed violence; if the\nSouth African government is\nthreatened by terrorism, then that\nterrorism is of its own making. Their\nregime is both inhuman and morally\nwrong, and they should not look for\nconcessions from the resistance before\npursuing meaningful reforms.\nElection Publicity\nCandidates wishing to have posters,\nhandouts or other publicity material\nprinted in FELIX should submit\nfinished artwork 5 College days in\nadvance of the required date. This will\nguarantee that publicity is delivered\non time. 2 days should be allowed for the completion of copy submitted for typesetting.

    "content": "Founded 1949\nStudents protest at platform\nfor South African\nAbout forty students staged a vociferous protest when Mr. Peter\nGoosen, Third Secretary at the SouthAfrican Embassy,\naddressed a meeting organised by the IC Conservative Society\non Tuesday. All those students who entered Mech Eng lecture\ntheatre 220 had their bags checked by College Security chief\nGeoffrey Reeves. The protest was entirely peaceful, but the\nstudents created enough noise to cause some disruption. Those\ninvolved shouted \"Free Mandela, and set South Africa free!\"\nand called upon Mr. Goosen to tell those inside the lecture\ntheatre about Soweto and censorship of the press in South\nAfrica\nQuestioned about the wisdom of\ninviting such a controversial person\nto College, Mr. Burbage said that Mr.\nGoosen had been invited because it\nwas felt that he would give an\ninteresting and informative talk, and\nthe meeting had not been held in\nMr. Reeves told FELIX that,\nthough the protestors were quite noisy\n, they made no attempt to enter the\nlecture theatre, and said that he was\n\"quite impressed with the way they\ncarried out their demonstration.\"\nTwo policemen were present to\nensure that there was no breach of the\nPublic Order Bill, and Mr. Reeves\ntold us that it is normal policy to lias e with the police if there is a chance that\nan \"anti situation\" may develop.\nChas Jackson, chair of IC AntiApartheid, said that in his view, a responsible society would not invite\nsuch a person to speak at College, and\ntold FELIX \"It was the most spirited\ndemo since the last Hon Porns night\nwas called off.\" It was, he said, both\ntasteless and offensive to have invited\na representative of a government that\nis actively suppressing free speech to\ntalk at Imperial College. He asserted\nthat protestors had refused to enter the\nlecture theatre because they felt that\ntheir presence would dignify Mr.\nGoosen's talk.\nSunny Bains, one of the protestors,\nsaid that they felt that they were the\nonly mouthpiece of the oppressed in\nSouth Africa and told FELIX\n\"Freedom is not his to give. Freedom\nis not a gift-its a right.\"\nDave Burbage, President of IC\nConservative Society, said that\nConSoc had not intended to cause any\ntrouble, and while he had expected\nthere to be some form of protest, he\ntold FELIX that he expected it to be\nrather more constructive. \"The\npeople outside the room would I think\nprefer civil war and revolution and\nultimately a tyranny of hatred within\nSouth Africa, rather than the reforms\nbeing proposed\",\" he said.\nGoosen reported in FELIX 760, with\nthe speaker stressing that South Africa\nfaces \" A choice between reform and\nrevolution, between a free democratic\nsociety and totalitarianism.\"\nQuestioned from the floor about\nhow many of the black people in\nSouth Africa have citizenship, he said\nthat following a review of regulations\nintroduced earlier, all are now citizens\nof South Africa, and negotiations are\nnow taking place to extend citizenship\nto the citizens of the independent\nstates.\nWhen asked about the violence\nperpetrated by the security forces\nagainst the African National\nCongress, Mr. Goosen said that he\ndid not deny that the ANC had\noriginally been a peaceful\nIt was right, he felt, that the South\nAfrican security services should be\ncriticised for such mistakes.\nContinuing on the subject of the\nANC and violence, Mr. Goosen said\nthat he felt that it was time for\nnegotiations about the mechanics of\nthe \"New South Africa\" to begin,\nand called on the ANC to stop their\nviolence; \"We have to leave the past\nbehind. We have to accept the\ninjustices of the past.\"\nThe European view of South\nAfrican blacks was, Mr. Goosen\nasserted, a racist one. It was not right\nto consider the black majority in\nSouth Africa as a unified mass, and\nhe said of those who held this view\n\"You're all white. Why have you\nfought two world wars?\" SeventyUnion rooms simply because there\nwere none suitable. He stressed to\nFELIX the IC ConSoc does not\nnecessarily agree with the views put\nforward by Mr. Goosen.\nThe content of the talk was broadly\nsimilar to the interview with Mr.\norganisation, and gave 1961 as the\nturning point in the tactics of the\ngroup. He also expressed the view\nthat the attacks on ANC headquarters\nin neighbouring states were justified,\nbut regretted that some innocent\npeople had been killed in these raids.\nfive per cent of white South Africans\nwere, claimed Mr. Goosen, in favour\nof fundamental reform, and he said\nthat he would be \"shocked\" if one\nof the other, less progressive parties,\nwon the general election.\nFriday February 6th1987 No. 762\n\n"

Bearing in\nmind that most students have about\n\u00a315 a week after paying rent, to brag\nabout an increase in line with inflation\nwas ridiculous, she told FELIX.\nLinstead con man A Linstead resident was robbed of\n\u00a3500 earlier this term by a con man who told the student he had lost all\nhis money. The student was\napproached by a man driving a car\nalong Prince Consort Road. The\ndriver, who was French, told the\nstudent that he needed the money to\nget back home, and managed to\npersuade him to give him \u00a3500 in\ncash. (The student was only carrying\nsuch a large amount because he had\nrecently returned from abroad\nhimself).\nThe incident occurred on\nWednesday 7th January, during the\nfirst week of the term.

    "content": "Feature. FELIX, Friday February 6th19878 Feature FELIX, Friday February 6th19879 FELIX takes a look at\nthe new Baha'i temple\nin Dehli, which Imperial College's Aeronautics\nDepartment helped to\ndesign\nA new Mother Temple for the Baha'i has recently been dedicated in Delhi.\nClaimed to rival the Taj Mahal in\nbeauty, it has been built to resemble\na lotus\u2014sacred flower of India\u2014in\nbloom, afloat among its leaves.\nThe complex, covering some eight\nhectares, consists of the main House\nof Worship, a reception centre, a library and an admin strat ive block.\nPeople of every faith will be\nwelcomed, with no religious\nceremonies or rituals taking place\nother than readings from the\nscriptures of the major religions. This\ntemple will be the centre piece of the\nother six Baha'i temples built so far\nas centres for assembly,\ncontemplation and prayer.\nIt is the construction of this temple\nwhich makes it unique. The plan is\nnon ago nal, symbolising the unity of\nthe teachings of nine great religious\nprophets. Thus the lotus-shape of the\ntemple is achieved with three sets of\nnine leaves around an inner trace ried dome. The first set face outwards and\nform entrances to the ring-shaped\nhall, the second set curve inwards and\nthe third set nearly close to form a bud, but the tops open gently out, and\na glass and steel roof allows light to\nfilter into the building. Nine pools,\nbridges and balustrades surround the\ncomplex.\nThe building of the temple\npresented considerable difficulties.\nNo straight lines were used, which\nmade the task so complex that two and\na half years were needed to\ncompletely work out the geometry\nand engineering drawings. The lack\nof well-developed concrete\ntechnology in India, and the\nun availability of a certain type of\nrolled steel for reinforcement\nhampered the construction. In all it\ntook the efforts of up to eight hundred\nLotus leaves\nfor the Baha V people over ten years to complete the\ntemple.\nA mixture of white cement, silica\nsand and dolomite aggregate was used\nto construct the leaves, which though\ntowering to 34 metres in the centre\nare in parts only 6 centimetres thick.\nEngineering played a part here,\ntesting models of the structure in a wind tunnel to check wind pressure\ndistributions and ventilation. The\ncomplex techniques necessary for\nconstruction and reinforcement had to\nbe checked at every step. Hot weather\ncaused problems as well; elaborate\nprecautions had to be taken to keep\nthe concrete cool while it was mixed\nand set. The final stage was to clad\nthe shells and arches with panels of\nwhite Greek marble, carefully shaped\nand fitted by means of stainless steel\nbrackets.\nThe end result, dramatic though\nsomewhat resembling the Sydney\nOpera House, was meant to embody\nthe 'purity and oneness of the Baha'i faith' by its architect, the Canadian\nBaha'i, Fariburz Sahba.\nThe expected longevity of the temple\nmeant it had to be designed to\nwithstand great stresses whether from\nearthquakes or from gales.

The\nairport was rather impressive but\nmen, women and children were\nsitting, permanently by the look of it,\non the cold stone floors at the exit.\nAnd the beggars, wearing tattered\nclothes; and those better dressed, but\nonly just, too ready to accept handouts\nfor services rendered, like the counter\nclerk who let me use his desk\ntelephone (how I missed British\nTelecom then!) and smilingly said\nafterwards \"Nothing in life is free,\nmadam.\" I stood bewildered and\nfascinated at the edge of the motorway\noutside the three star hotel and ox-drawn carts, bicycles, three-wheeled\ncovered scooters, taxis (looking the\npart in a60's movie), sports cars and\nmopeds with business men and\nbriefcases, all zoomed past. A very\nincident-free lawless melee.

It's caused by all those\ncurves. During the opening ceremony\nI felt thrilled. There were selected\nWritings from the Hindu, Moslem,\nChristian, Buddhist and Baha'i scriptures. It didn't matter then\nwhether the person next to me was\nfrom a different religious background\nor not, the Baha'i Houses of Worship\nwelcome all peoples to worship. The\nhighlight of my temple experience\nhappened during dawn prayers one\nday. A bird flew into the building,\nperched itself on one of the interior\npetals, and proceeded to sing\nthroughout the entire devotional\nrecitations. A delight for the 3000-odd\npeople there.\nSocially the Baha'i conference\naccompanying the dedication was the\nhigh point. Over 104 different\ncountries were represented by the\n8000 participants. I cherish my chats\nwith musicians from the Seychelles,\nla pane se,a family living in Nepal and\nan Australian working with the\naborigines; I rode an elephant; I scalded my heart and soul (and\ntongue) with authentic South Indian\ndosa; and learnt the art of slowing\ndown my thinking and doing\nprocesses\u2014an art the average Indian\nappeared to have mastered to\nperfection.\nOh! and I now appreciate a glass\nof water from our taps to a degree I never, ever thought possible.

With\nsuch a variety of cultures, the Baha'i Society organises activities which\nprovide for the interests of all its\nmembers, thus demonstrating one of\nthe essential principles of the Baha'i Faith\u2014the oneness of the human race.\nThe Baha'i Society also organises\noccasional events aimed at attracting\nthe interest of all students.

As students at Imperial College we\nare mostly training to become\nscientists or engineers or accountants.\nWe hope to acquire an ability to\nfunction and make decisions in a technologically advanced world. This\nability includes such mundane skills\nas knowledge acquisition and\norganisation, experimental technique,\nreport writing, etc.\nAre there any other skills we should\nwish to acquire in order to function\nas scientists, engineers or\naccountants?\nOur world is increasingly coming\nto accept that decisions should be\nmade after considering human and\nmoral questions, as well as issues of\neconomics and technological\npossibility. In this column, I want to\ntry to look a little at the moral and\nhuman issues which are relevant to\nus. I'm not a philosopher, so I can't write much about the detailed thought\nwhich has gone into such issues over\nthe past millen i a. Similarly, I'm not\na the o logi st, so I won't attempt to put\nforward any particular religious view\n(there are plenty of other people who\nare only too glad to do that). I am a writer, so I want to look at how\nwriting can be used to look at these\nissues.\nWriting can be used to raise\nquestions and, possibly to suggest\nanswers. The best writing does not act\n. i propaganda, spouting forth simple\ndogma as a solution to complex\nproblems; but rather, it causes the\nreader to think about new issues (or\nabout old issues in a new way) and\nallows him to find his own answers.\nGood writing lays down a solid\nfoundation, upon which f he reader\ncan build his own ideas. (Of course,\nskillful writing may also act to push\nthe reader in a particular direction, by\naddressing the emotions. The reader\nshould be aware of this. However,\nhuman beings are emotional animals,\nand questions about human issues can\nonly be answered fully by considering\nthe emotions as well as the \"facts\").\nThese ideas are best pursued by\nillustration, so I will present an\nattempt to look at the issues of\neconomics and mining, and their\nimpact on individuals and\ncommunities. These issues are of\nobvious interest to many people in this\ncollege.\nGeevor\nAs the cage drops you enter her\nand can no longer breathe\nexcept through her.\nSafety is your illusion:\nher ribs and back surround you,\nbut there is no pleasure\naway from her embrace\u2014\nWish only for the deception to\ncontinue.\nOn the final shift\nI wash off the smell of her\nand try to run away.\nThere are no words;\nonly an empty locker\nand a redundancy cheque\nto buy flowers for my father's grave\n(first published in Envoi 86)\nI won't belittle the poem by\nattempting a detailed analysis of it: its\nmessage is quite clear. My point is\nthat, as scientists, we should be aware\nof such issues. (You may also wish\nto consider how the poem achieves,\nor fails to achieve, its impact; whether\nthe sexual/sexist viewpoint is relevant\nto the issue in question; and any\nnumber of other questions arising\nfrom this single short poem).\nThis column will be an occasional\n(or regular, depending on my energy\nand your input) feature in FELIX for\nthe next couple of terms. I would\nwelcome input from other members\nof College, especially in the form of\npoetry or (very) short stories\naddressing the issues of the human\nimpact of science and technology.\nComments on the questions I raise are\nalso welcome.\nGraham\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion FELIX, Friday February 6th19877 Right Charlies\nbyR2D2 The recent disappearance of hundreds\nof walking sticks from the Health\nCentre in Princes Gardens has fueled\nspeculation that the College is on the\nverge of an outbreak of Chaplinism.\nDespite this alarming news the\nCollege authorities have made no\nattempts to alert students of the\ndangers. In this unique expo see FELIX reporters Phil Hoodwink and\nPrichard Stiles reveal the sinister truth\nbehind the movement.\nFrom its humble beginnings in\nHollywood in 1906 the Chaplin cult\nhas become one of the most influential\norganisations on the planet. Its\nmembership is currently estimated at\nover 1 billion, and the organisation\nis known to have penetrated the\nhier achy of the world's political\npowers.\nAt the head of the organisation is\none known enigmatically as 'The\nRight Charlie', operating from the\n'Chaplincy', his secret headquarters\nin Princes Gardens.\nThe Chaplin regime is strict, with\nmembers being expected to rise at\n4.30am for early morning cane\ntwirling and waddling practice.\nBraces, of course, must be worn at\nall times, even in bed. Becoming a Chaplinite is not easy, and members\nare selected only after months of\nobservation and careful vetting. Even\nthen becoming an \"apprentice\nChaplin\" entails a grueling ceremony\nwhich trainees are expected to balance\na cane on the end of their nose whilst\nriding a bicycle along a tight rope.\nBecoming an \"under Charlie\" is even\nmore tortuous and candidates are\nexpected to save a heroine from the\nrailway tracks in under three seconds,\nand to give her a kiss without the\nbowler hat falling off. The task has\nbecome more difficult in recent times\nwith the introduction of electrified\nrails.\nChaplinites meet on a weekly basis\nto perform a ceremony known as\n\"slinging the fish.\" Here, the \"major\nCharlies\" don the traditional zoo\nkeepers costume and throw fish to\napprentices and \"under Charlies\"\nwho catch them in their teeth. Then,\nat the end of the ceremony, the\nChaplinite anthem \"Hit Me With\nYour Rhythm Stick\" is sung and the\nritual cane dance performed.\nThe movement has, in modern\ntimes, begun to infiltrate the\ncontrolling echelons of society. The\nCivil Service and the Stock Exchange\nhave been penetrated to such an extent\nthat Chaplinites can be seen donning\ntheir attire in public\u2014the bowler hat\nand the walking stick craftily\ndisguised as an umbrella. In fact, the\nsecret Chaplinite hat tilt is almost a thing of the past, with a number of\nChaplinites publicly admitting their\nChaplinesque tend an cie s. The greatest question though still\nremains unanswered: Who is the\ncurrent Right Charlie? There has been\nmuch speculation that Edwina Currie\nis a likely candidate, but even she\nA confused and bewildered member of the cult.\nblond curly hair and a funny\nmoustache in the Geology\nDepartment. It is amazing what hair\ndye can do...\nwould admit that her moustache is the\nwrong shape. More probably the\nanswer lies much closer to home, with\nreported sightings of a man with\nA Ferret Writes\nJust when you thought it was safe to\ngo back to the Opinion Pages...\nWhat's all the fuss about this time?\nThe problem is constitutions; what are\nthey for, whether they should be\nbroken, with specific reference to the\nPresident of RCSU. It's comments\nlike \"I'm quite prepared to go against\nthe constitution if necessary,\" that are\nthe problem, and they make it quite\nclear that Simon Singh hasn't the\nfaintest notion what a constitution is\nfor.\nNow, like a good essayist, I reach\nfor my copy of the Oxford English\nDictionary and find out the definition\nof constitution. \"Body of fundamental\nprinciples according to which a state\nis governed\" is what the book says,\nand what are our fundamental\nprinciples? I think most people would\nagree that in this college, the\nfundamental principles are those of\ndemocracy. Now I 've made some\ncutting comments about democracy\nand its efficiency as a governing\nsystem, but it is the agreed basis of\nhow we do things here, and it is the\nonly way of keeping all of the people\nfairly happy most of the time.\nWhatever anyone says about how a democratic body is run, they only\nhave themselves to blame for voting\nfor it in the first place.\nNow, when a constitution is broken\nsomeone's democratic rights are\nbeing abused for the benefit of\nsomeone else. The end result of the\nprocess is dissatisfaction, loss of good\nwill, and, at the very least, a lot of\nbad feeling that hampers the running\nof an organist ion, and in the worst\ncase the offended body disintegrates\ncompletely.\nNow, Simon has some very\npersonal and distinct views of how\nRCS should be run, and feels that it\nis his duty to \"achieve something\"\nwith the Union. He also feels that he\nhas only a sh- 'me to do this and\nto expedite his changes he is \"quite\nprepared to go against the\nconstitution.\" He justifies this by\nsaying firstly that his proposed\nchanges are to the general good, and\neveryone will agree with them\nanyway. Okay, if they are so good\nwhy not propose them to a meeting\nand actually get a mandate to do what\nyou want? There were only two RCS\nUGM's last term, one of those the\nFresher's one, and both in the early\npart of the term. It took a petition of\n50 signatures to force Simon to hold\nan EGM at the end of the term. Simon\nexplained that no other UGM's had\nbeen held because of illness on the\npart of Guy Perry, RCS Hon Sec,\nwho constitutional job it was to\narrange meetings. But since Simon is\nprepared to go against the constitution\nwhen necessary he could easily have\narranged an U GM himself, if he\nthought it necessary. Clearly then he\ndid not think it was necessary to hold\naUG M to discuss some fairly\nsweeping changes that he had\nimposed, such as selecting a new\nBroadsheet Editor himself. In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that\nSimon felt it was necessary not to hold\na UGM because he knew he would\nnot get the support he wan f td. So he\npurposefully denied members of RCS\nof their democratic rights. That is\nwhat happens when constitutions get\nbroken.\nThere is good reason why the\nconstitution of any body makes it\ndifficult to change things. This is\nbecause changes that are not agreed\nupon by the whole concensus of\nopinion are dangerous and divisive.\nAnd it's no point saying, and he has,\nthat if a change imposed by Simon is\nwrong then \"a good bollo king and...\nresignation\" will solve matters. The\ndamage may already have been done\nand be irreparable. The whole point\nof constitutions being resistant to\nchange is to prevent one person doing\nthings that are wrong and potentially\ndestructive. Change can only be\nachieved with stability if it is a process\nof evolution rather than revolution.\nIn describing the RCS constitution\nas \"sacred scriptures\" Simon\ndemonstrates that he has no respect\nfor it at all. It's about time he knew\nwhat it was there for, rather than just\nregarding it as an obstacle to\nmoulding RCS into his own, not very\nlikable, image.\nI am very worried about what might\nhappen to RCS this year, since Simon\nseems to believe he has the right to\nforce anything through that he wants,\nwithout even discussing beforehand\nwhether he is right or not. It takes\nonly one slip in this situation to do\nsevere damage.\nI don't think Simon has done any\nreal damage to RCS yet, but there is\nstill a long time to the end of the year,\nand he has plenty of opportunity left.\nI shall be watching developments at\nUGM's and GenComms with interest.\nDave Clements\nNote: Quotations are taken from\nSimon Singh's editorial in the first\nBroadsheet of this term.\n\n"
