These in o lude being Hon.\nSecretary of the R.S. M. Union last year\nDuring this last session he has indicated\nthat he will be following the example\nset by Lea Allen of marrying into I. C.W. A. We congratulate him on his engagement\nto last years Wornens Association Hon.\nSecretary, Miss Ann-Margret Radford,\nIan does not find his spare time\nenjoyment on the sports field although\nhe has been known to turn out for the\nR.S. M. at rug ger or even in the as r mal Cross Country rao e between the constituent Colleges. His principal pass\ntime is photography and he was one of\nthe 1\n9\n5\n9 I.C. team whose entry won the\nEuropean Universities Photographic\nCompetition. As a reward for this he\nhas the somewhat dubious pr l vil ge organising the next competition at I.C. In conclusion it is perhaps fitting\nto point out that Ian was the first Business Manager of Felix to record a profit for many years. We hope that\nhe will succeed in doing the same for\nthe Union during the coming year.\nTHE BIG SQUIRT\nWe gents have got a bigger a quir t, We've always grovelled in the dirt\nTo drink the stupid little squirt\nBut now we've got a bigger squirt.\nI told old Dan some terms ago\nBut he just laughed at me and so\nMy nose grew like it didn't ought'a ow a use you see I like my water.\nSo may I praise the plumber who\nAdjusted some well hidden screw.\nMy reader - careful.' Don't be push ful Or alas you'll find you've got amu ah ful. Roger Jefferyea.\nP.G. Elect! ENGi.\nAROUND THE\nTOWN For those ardent heros, who are\nprepared to s it in the twenty sixth\nrow of the gallery, who are willing to\nbe kneed and k nudged by nonchalant\nnightingales and who have the will power\nto resist replying to such tempting\nutterances as, \"Cor! it'sab it slow\nain't it luv,* from Battersea back-room boys, and \"Eeh lass, I shouldn'ta\nbrought you i tIko ew' t sax was going\nto be mentioned\", all from the twenty\nseventh row of the gallery, then the\nbright and brassy lights of limbo,\nthe West End, offers a very fine selection of serious drama, light entertainments and films.\nThe really interested theatre-goer will find a host of recent\nproductions which are worth a good deal\nof consideration. \"The Hostage\",\n.a play by the now infamous Brendan\nBeaan and produced by the 'Theatre\nWorkshop', along with Michael Redgrave's adaptation of Henrv Jame's novel, now\nknown as \"The Aspem Papers\" produced\nat the Queen's Theatre are both plays '\nwhich should not be missed. In the\nsame category perhaps as Graham Greene's \"The Complaisant Lover\", although I doubt whether Greene the dramatist is, as yet, as mature as Greene the novelist.\nSean 0'Casey's \"Cook-A Doodl\u00ab\nDandy\" at the Royal Court Theatre is, without a doubt, I think, the top-line production of the day. Described\nby himself, as his favourite play, it is a performance which, anyone remotely\ninterested in the history of the\ntheatre, should not fail to see.\nIf your personal choice is mare i a the realm of light-comedy, then, I aa\nadvised, the revue \"Pieces of Eight\"\nat the Appollo Theatre is far you. It\nis a return to a rather more sophisticated style of production, something\nwhich I'm afraid has been sadly lacking\nfar some time. Pater Cook's sketches,\nthe music of Lanrioe Johnson and Faddy\nStares slick production all help to make\na very fine show.\nGoing to the cinema? Well here\nagain there are fine things to be seen,\nbesides that couple who always we en ardent upon demonstrating their lawa\nimmediately i a front of you.\nI have no personal knowledge, but\nI have been told that amusement of a nature to satisfy everyone from sentimentalist to sadist, is offered by such\nfilms as, \"The Lavender Hill Mob* at\nthe Classic, \"I'm alright Jack\" starring\nPeter Sellers, Isa Carwdahael and Terry\nThomas at Studio One, and \"The Mam my\" X at the London Pavillicn, although I' a sane that by now you will all have seen\n\"pretty little posters* announcing the\nWalt Disney's, \"Sleeping Beauty\"\nat the Astoria, said to be Disney at\nhis peak is a film which people interested in the art of film cartoon must see.\nIt is full of charm, end in its way,\nrather beautiful.\nBesides these few, there are of\ncourse many more plays and films wh i oh one ought to see, perhaps time and\nmoney are the deciding factors.\nRipoi.\nGENERAL ELECTION\nThis must surely have been one\nof the quietest General Election at I.C, in the history of the College. Apart\nfor an informal discussion of the party\nmanifestoes by the politically minded\nmembers, and that ill attended \"Hustings\nin the concert hall, there was little01 no activity at College to indicate that\nanything out of the ordinary was\nhappening (the reason was of course the\nproximity of polling day to the\nbeginning of term]; no news meeting\nand no raga except for a small group of\nGuildsmeh who alternated between\nTrafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus.\nThe only spark of real interest waa\nshown on Friday, when the lounge was\ncrowded to watch the one-eyed monster\nshowing the results.\n'\nA' a e this due to a party, or\nto a feeling that an Election waa too\nserious a matter for old-fashioned\nstudent pranks!\nProbably the latter,* but it seems a pity that the time ia apparently\npast when a man might look back with\nnostalgia on his student days as the\ndays of his gay and wild youth. There\nia much to be said for the old idea of\nsowing ones wild oats when still young.\nFRESHERS HOP\nThe combined I.C. Bedford\nHop held in the Union on October 9th provided no startling innovations, but\ntraversed the well trodden paths with a fair amount of gusto. It seemed that\nthis year there was a rather large\nproportion of actual I. C.f re a her a present which probably accounted for the\ndiversity of male dress, ranging from\nsuits to open necked e hirta( via the\nnational costume of Southern Mongoliapostgrad I presume.') The large body\nof men which invariably at and a at one\nend of the Hall, preferring to watch\nrather than dance, waa once again present\nthis was no doubt disappointing for the\nmany young ladies sitting round the floor\n(on chairs).\nAfter the interval the band,\nfortified by ao a \u00bb beer, and having found\na missing red-ht i. red trumpeter, gave vent\nto a lively series of quicksteps, sambas,\nCha-cha-cha e and other international\n\"gyrations. The President of Guilds ,\nobviously of the opinion that things were\nnot moving fast enough organised a a piri ted Paul Jones punctuated by\nvigorous cries of \"Ladies to the right\"\netc:. The evening closed on the customary somnolent note, couples dancing\nto a dreamy waltz tune in a* a iai ly lit\nHall.\nCEREAL\nBreakfast is exhausting these days,\nby the time you've found the toy in the\ncereal packet, unwrapped it, put it together and played with it, its tine\nfor dinner. - L.A.

To bed that\nnight with Ill-suppressed excitement to\nsee London in its true colours next day.\nm the morning after tucking into\na substantial breakfast, I sallied ee\nforth to see London with several other\nJ. J.o's( Johnny Just come) under the\nguidance, or rather the leadership of\na British Council representative.\nAt first there,was a tendency to lag\nbehind our guide owing to long stops\nto gas e at unfamiliar buildings and our\nmore leisurely pace. Eventually\nhowever, we were caught up in the\nfeverish activity of London - the\nfrenzied hurry in all directions.\nThe first real excitement came\nwhen we entered an underground station.\nThe noise of trains was shattering and\nthe cold draughts from the subways\nwithering. In the train itself there\nwas little cons versa tic n practically\neveryone was either safely sheltered\nbehind a newspaper or staring meditatively into space. Even ao on ti gent of\nAfricans about fifteen strong evoked\nonly the merest lifting of an eyebrow\nand occasionally, a cautious peep from\nbehind the pen umbra of a newspaper.\nThe journey continued. Out of\nthe tube, into a bus then from the bus\na walk - across some most dangerous\npedestrian crossings. We saw a great\nmany buildings, but their names did not\nstick 30 quickly were they passed. A few landmarks were too obvious to be\nforgotten. Few places apart fr cm an\nOlympic Games stadium could have so\nmany pigeons as Trafalgar Square and\nwho else but Nelson would be so high\nup in the world?\nAfter the first day a few of the\nmore courageous spirits amongst us set\noff alone or in small groups. The\nexperiences of these groups were\nvaried in detail but generally similar\nin basic pattern. Many times we lost\nourselves and address books were hurried-ly consulted, however due to the\nbobbies the way was usually refound\n(after some hard walking). .\nHaving (very wisely I thought)\nprovided myself with a tube map and\nof course the infallible' A to Z,I decided to strike out on my own to discover the lesser known quarters of London.\nThe first time I asked for a certain\nstreet from a passer by he pointed down\none road saying \"Fourth left, second\nright, third right and sixty yards on,\nyou can't miss it\". Fair enough, but\nafter walking about two miles by my\nreckoning and taking a score of turnings without finding the street, I had\nto give it up.\nI qui ok ly di so over ed that next to\npoliceman, newspaper vendors were most\nefficient for providing information\nabout their own localities. One 1\nshall never forget. He was at a cross-roads, it was just after five o 'clock.\nWhen I asked him for a street, without\nlooking up or even apparently taking his\nmind off his papers he said \"Second Left\".\nI am in love with London, with its great crowds and rush hours, its many\nneon lights, its cosmopolitan nature,\nthe immense buildings, the variety of\nmotor vehicles in all stages of\ndisrepair s, but above all the pubs.\nFinally I a a grateful to London\nfor giving me such a sunny welcome\nand hope the winter will be similarly\nTHE LOCK'S LAMENT\nAs c rummage i a a lovely sight.\nWhen a een from the outside,\nWith massive Forwards binding tight.

I GOT SUNK IN THE SINK\nI had twelve bottles of whisky\nin my cellar, and my wife told me to\nempty the o on tents of each and every\nbottle down the sink or else!\nSo I said-1'would, and proceeded\nwith the unpleasant task, I withdrew\nthe cork from the first bottle and\npoured the contents down the sink, with\nthe exception of one glass, w hio hI drank . I extracted the cork from\nthe second bottle and did_ likewise, with the exo ep te On of one glass, which\n\u00a3 drank. I withdrew aha cork from\nthe third bottle and emptied the ,\ngood old Booze down the sink, except\na glass, which I drank. I pulled the\ncork from the fourth sink and poured the\nbottle down the glass, which I drank.\nI pulled the cork from the bottle of the next, and drank one sink of it, and pure d the rest down the glass.\nI pulled the sink out of the next glass\nand poured the cork down the bottle.\nI pulled the next cork out of my throat\nand pure d the sink down the bottle, and\ndrank the glass. Then I corked the\nsink with the glass, bottled the drink\nand drank the pour.\nWhen I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, and\ncounted the bottles and corks and glasses\nwith the other, which were twenty nine.\nTo be sure, I counted them again when\nthey came by and I had seventy four.\nAs the house came by, I counted them\nagain, and I finally had all the bottles\nand corks and glasses and houses counted\nexcept one house and a bottle, w hio hI drank.\nAuthor UNKNOWN The Mathematician's Courtship\nLet x denote Beauty; y, Manners well-bred;\nI, Fortune - (This last is essential).\nLet L stand for Love, our Philosopher\nsaid,\nThen Lisa function of x,y, and s, Of the kind that is known as potential.\nNow integrate L with respect to dt,\n(t standing far time and persuasion)\nThen, within proper limits, ' tis easy\nto see,\nThe definite integral Marriage mast be.\n(A very concise demonstration).\n\n"

Lord\nFalmouth, Chairman of the Governing\nBody, then replied on behalf of the\nCollege and unveiled a portrait of\nLord Weeks commissioned by the College\nfrom Mr. Herbert Holt. The ceremony\nended with'a speech by Lord Weeks after\nwh i oh the guests were invited to make a tour of the building.\nare no angular projections. Study bedrooms to the north and south, with windows the whole width of the room, present\ncellular elevations, riding above a ground\nfloor of steel and glass. m con-tra st, the 3tai roa se has its front wall entirely in glas3, with the lift in a glass cage, and all the steel work shipshape and visible.\nCj**'**\nf\">'\"1S''>...'i1 fc lil Although the ground floor -.\nroom was unfinished, the strategical\npositioning of a few potted plants and\nfurnishings did manage to hide the wet\nplaster and drying mortar.\nThe Rector, Sir Patrick Linatead\nspeaking first, welcomed the assembled\nguests who included Directors and\nrepresentatives of Viokera Limited and\nAssociated Group companies, members of\nthe College staff and a few strangely\ndressed students. (The President\nlater disclosed to the editor that he\nhad hired the suit from a reputable firm\ndown the Portobello Road.1\n) His\nexpression that\"rush-hour travel was no\nsubstitute for dreaming spires\" was\nheartily reiterated by the assembly.\nHe went on to say that even \"Brick and\nMortar\" were not enough, the spirit of\ncomradeship waa essential. He ended\nby extending bouquets to the people who\nhad helped in making Weeks Hall a realisation. Our condolences to\nMr. Liddeil, the site manager, who\naccording to the Rector lost a stone in weight and had several sleepless nights\nprior to the opening.\nLord Khollys, a commanding figure of a man, then formally opened the hall.\nDuring his speech he emphasised the\nfact that industry had stepped in and\nA plaque commemorating the occasion\nhas been erected at the entrance to the\nHall.\nWeeks Hall is eleven storeys, with\ncommon rooms only at ground-floor level\nand the warden's flat at the top. As\nis tradition in universities, the warden\nand deputy warden arc full-time members\nof the academic staff.\nThe opening of Weeks Hall marks the\ncompletion of the first stage of the\nCollege's scheme for the development of\nPrince's Gardens as a residential and\nsocial precinct. For this purpose,\nproperties on the north, east and south\nsides of the Gardens were acquired by\nthe College in1956. Early in1957, Viokera - as part of\ntheir long-term programme of support for\neducation in engineering subjects -offered to provide a number of scholarships for undergraduate apprentices and\na benefaction of \u00a3150,000 for a new Hall\nof Residence, in wh i oh holders of suo h awards oo ul d live in term-time with\nother students of the College.\nThis generous offer was .gratefully\naccepted by the College and the Hall was\nbuilt in the north-east corner of the\nGardens. Weeks Hall, as it has been\nnamed, was designed by Richard Sheppard,\nRobson and Partners (the architects for\nthe Prince's Gardens Scheme) and,\nalthough conforming to the general plans\nfor the remainder to the area, will\npossess an identity of its own within,\nthe oom ple te development. This identity\nsprings from the fao t that it has been\nplanned to meet a dual purpose. As well\nas being a normal College Hall of Residence during the ao a dera io year, it will also provide the venue in the Easter and\nSummer vacations for educational and\nstaff conferences of the Vickers organ-is at ions. The building is designed of re in forced concrete cross walls supporting\npre-stressed concrete floors, so there\nOn each floor a se-s of eight study-bedrooms has its own bathroom, shower,\nand galley, with a minute kitchen cabinet for each student. The un institutional air of comfort is partly due to\nthe quiet cork floors, but chiefly to\nthe determination and skill of the\narchitect.\nMost of the study bedrooms have\na coloured wall, and these are intended\nto be seen as a bright motley from the\nstreet. Unfortunately none but the\ndark brown is rich enough to be success-ful, and it is possible to miss this\nfeature altogether.\nThe colour of this building does\nnot quite match up to the architectural\nfarm, once one acknowledges the superb\ngrey of the steel work. To preserve\nthe cellular character of the elevations\nthe concrete panel below the windows has\nbeen faced with a lighter aggregate\nthan the structure. The difference in tone is far too slight and robs the\nfacade of definition.\n\n"

Sinoe other colleges\n\u2022ou ld not rival the supremacy of the\nCOLLEGE, to find suitable opposition we\nlave Joined the First Division of the\nLondon Basketball League and will be\nplaying some of the finest loam s in the\ncountry, as a result.\nWith this greatly extended list of fixtures the need for rejuvenation\nby Freshmem is painfully apparent. A Freshers trial will be held in the Gymnasium on Thursday 22nd. Although\nprevious experience is a needed essential\nfor freshmen hoping to make the first team, men with little or no exp erie no evil l have the opportunity of learning X the game and receiving expert tuition\nfrom the College coach.\nSOCCER\nOn Freshers Day, with 50 freshmen indicating an intention to play\nsoccer, the soccer club, with an anticipated 40 \"Old lags* returning were\nreasonably confident of a. successful\nseason and of maintaining the high\nat and ard8 attained last year. This\nhope was further strengthened by the\nfact that all last year's University\nplayers have returned, and by the\nencouraging standard of' the fresher s at\nthe trial on Wednesday.\nWith the first round of the\nJniversity Cup only one week after the\ntrials only a minimum amount of time is available for picking al st XI and\ngetting them match fit. This made the\nf re a her a trials on Wednesday, and the\ncombined fresher s old lags trial on\n3a tur day all the more important. The\nformer of these waa played on a very\ndry hard ground which made the ball\nvery lively and difficult to control.\nHowever the fresher s gave a good account\nof themselves, although in most cases by\nno moans fit. The trials on Saturday'\nwere played in quite different\nconditions with the ball tending to skid\non the wet ground, which never the less\nremained hard. These trials\" were\ncorrespondingly disappointing with\nonly sufficient support to make 2 game a possible, whilst 4 games had been\nanticipated. This lack of support was\npresumably due to the rain, although\nth ie could by no means be described as\nheavy. Better support ia required if7 XI'a are to be run satisfactorily,\nin WET.'.' weather aa well aa fine.\nThe first game a will be play ea on Wednesday, (before this report is published) some friendly and some\nleague, and it is hoped that- all participating will have had an enjoyable\ngame even if not successful.\nP.S. Training sessions every\nTuesday and Thursday lunchtimes in the\npark. Meet in the'gym at 12. JO p.m. These are moat enjoy a ole except when\norganised by the captain!'\nSPORT Las^ year the club had a moderately successful season\nregistering victories over Oxford (once)\nand Sandhurst (three times), and\nBuffering only one defeat at the hands\nof an exceptionally strong Cambridge\nteam. The college was well represented\nin the university fixtures, three of our\nmembers being chosen for the London\nuniversity teams and also for the South\nEast regional team. Even if the trio\ndid not perform too brilliantly for the\nLondon team, they did however acquit '\nthemselves well in the drinking which\nfollowed.\nThis year our secretary John\nShepherd l st Kyu, has arranged an\nextensive programme of matches including contests with Sandhurst and Soldsmiths, and a rather more exacting' fight\nwith the Metropolitan Police Force. I would like to take this opportunity of\nappeal i hg to the college to please allow\nthe police team to reach the gymnasium\nun molested as we wish to have a go at\nthem first. For people interested in starting judo we are holding meetings\non Wednesday evenings at 6 o 'clock when\nwe hope to demonstrate a ome of the\nfundamental principles, such aa the art\nof break falling and some of the basic\nthrows. If you are interested why not\ncome along on Wednesday evenings and be\nsecure in the knowledge that you will\nbe able to defend yourself at all times,\nwhenever you are fit enough to go out.\nTABLE TENNIS\nTable tennis enthusiasts will\nhave noticed that no representative of\nthe club was present at the Fresher's Reception. This lamentable absence\nwas caused by the academic demise\nof the captain sleet At the moment\nthe club is a democracy but trials s re shortly to be held and new officers\nwill be elected by the people when the\ntime is ripe.\nSee the club notice board in the Table Tennis room on the top floor\nof the Union for details of membership\netc i, and help to give the club its best season yet.\nI CROSS COTJKxSX CLUB\nAt the Freshers' Reception this\nyear about 20 Freshmen indicated their\ninterest in the Club. Of these 9 -took\npart in atrial on Wednesday 7th over\nthe Read Relay CfJorse in Hyde Park\naccompanied by 18 old lags. For these\nstalwarts who survived the rig ours of\nthe afternoon, as well as the climb\nto the seventh floor of Weeks Hall,\nthere was the reward of coffee and\nbiscuits kindly provided by our cap-tain, Alan Brown.\nOn Saturday 10th three intrepid\nfresher s and nine old lags ran 6 miles\non Hampstead Heath in the University\nTrials. Good performances were put\nup by veterans, J. H. Collins and M.S. Barber who came 3rd and 5th respectively\nclosely followed by J. D.T. Bernard (7th) Last, but by no means least, of the\nI.C. contingent was fresher Dave Rymer\nwho, being an ex-naval bod, was a bit weak on his navigation and went off\ncourse.\nOn a regular 2 year cycle between\nI.C. and N.E.C. the Club welcomes back\nJohn Conway whom we all hope to see\nregularly at our future fixtures.\nAnother old timer with whom many of the\npresent members are unfamiliar is Eddie\nBennett who returns to run for the Club\nand study for a postgraduate degree in his spare time.\nFinally, to those fresher s who have\nyet to discover the Club's not loe board,\nthey should enter, the Union building from\nthe qu aevi at ne door in the right\nhand corner and then pass through the\ndouble doors cn the right when they\nwill find the board on the right hand\nwall.\nRUGBX\nNearly 100 fresher s were welcomed\nthis year by the Rugby Club and a very\nsuccessful season is anticipated if the\nenthusiasm now apparent remains through\nout the winter. We are hoping to run\nseven regular teams as the fixture card\nis devised to give exceptionally, varied\ngames to seven Saturday XVs.\nThe Club owing to this seasons early\nfixtures were only able to devote one\nWednesday to trials instead of the customary two day trials. It will be there\nfore understood that last Saturday's games\nwere very experimental. I.C. teams figured in6 matches, 4 of them including\nthe 1st and 2nd were hosts at Harlington.\nAlthough seven I.C. players were holding\ntogether the University side, the 1st XV\n.lead by M. Bregazsi still enjoyed a promising start to the season in winning\nout over a much improved Charing Cross\nHospital side by 17 points to 0. The\n2nd XII fought and even tougher battle\nagainst N. P.L. and was narrowly defeated\nby 3 points to 0. The other teams had\nmixed suo ces s but did well considering\nthe difficulties of selection at this\nstage of the season.\nLast Tuesday the Club gave new a members an informal welcome when it was addressed by Professor Sparkes\nits President and other eminent members of the Rugby world. members\nwho weren't preset missed an enjoyable evening.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, S.W.7 Printed by WEST LONDON OFFSET C0.^307i Telephone Place, W.

    "content": "FELIX y CIRCUIT TRAINING\nFor the past fa* years, Circuit\nTraining - a new farm of progressive\ntraining for physical fitness - has Veen\narousing interest in this country and over-seas. The possession of a healthy body\nis a prime necessity in this modern age\nif we are not to break down under the\nstrain of living, and this is especially\ntrue in the case of the hard-working\nstudent. The ideal: 'Mens sana in corpora sano' is too often forgotten.\nCircuit Training (C,T.) meets this need\nin the physical education of students,\nand was in fact evolved in the gym of\nthe University of Leeds.\nIt is a medical fao t that the best\nway of developing a healthy muscle is to\nexercise against an ever-increasing re-sistance, and there is not better way of\ndoing this than weight training, increasing the number of repetitions performed,\nor steadily increasing the pound age used.\nThe bar bell system is ideal, since the\nweight o an be easily adjusted by as\nlittle as i lb. at a time.\nWeight training is now used as a basic training for all sports. Example's of sportsmen who claim that their\nsuo o ess is largely due to regular doses\nof \"iron pill s\"o an be found everywhere.\nFamous athletes include Chris Brasher,\nCordon Pirie, Brian Shenton, John Savage,\nPharoah, Ian Anthony, Emil Zatopeck, etc.\nThe athlete who does not use weights is the unusual type. Swimmers like Mike\nBreoknell train regularly with weights,\nas do cyclists Reg. Harris, Dave Bedwell,\nCyril Peacook. Many first division\nSoccer teams include weights in their\ntraining schedules ... Rugger ..\nRowing .. Need we' continue? For the\nbenefit of the I.C. Musical Soo. Guy\nMitchell is a regular weight trainer as\nwell.\nWeight training is used as a means\nof physical culture (body-building techniques used to build the physique to the\nbest size and strength) as a sport in its own right (weight lifting) and is also extensively used aa a remedial\ntreatment (rehabilitation). The improvements possible are very rapid and\nhave to be seen to be believed. (Not\n(continued in next oe lu an) BADMINTON CLUB\nInconsistency and lack of coordination was the key note of last\nseasons activities and consequently\nour record mas not at all good. The\nseo on d team had the best record and\nif n mare than half their matches,\nthe first VI had a poor season and should\nhave been relegated into the 2nd division of the league. However, this\nwould have made the 2nd division very\novercrowded and were allowed to retain\none team in the premier division.\nThe mixed team also met with little suo o ess in their endeavours though we\ngather they managed to thoroughly\nenjoy their games. We have an exceptional number of Freshers this year,\nabout 70 people having shown an interest in the Club. At the moment we\ndo not quite know how to accommodate\nall these people on our court in the\ngym, but we hope to obtain more court\nspace in the near future.\nThe amount of talent in the Club\npromises a good season provided everyone pulls his weight and keeps an eye\nan the Club Notioe Board so that he\ncan keep a hr eat of the Club affairs.\nusually quite as quickly as Ch-rl-s Atl-o promises, though!) The fourth\nuse of barbells is the comparatively\nrecent one of C.T. At present the circuit is open in the Snack Bar every evening at 5.0 p.m. or 5.3\u00b0 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you are interested, please come down one\nevening and have a look at the circuit.\nEnquiries to K.W.. Ludlam from beginners\nand unfit men (and women) exp eo i ally welcome. It wail d be appreciated if non-sportsmen would use the Wednesday\ntraining period so that overcrowding is avoided.\nThe main purpose of this art i ol s was however to draw the attention of non-sportsmen to the value of circuit training for reaching and maintaining a> reasonable standard of physical strength\nand endurance. No skill is. required\nand the exercises are graded to suit all types. Another advantage is that the\ncircuit can be completed in less than\nhalf-an-hour.\nThe I.C. circuit consists of nine\nsimple exercises which are laid out\nround tie room. The training rate,\ni.e. the number of repetitions carried\nout on each exercise, is taken as one\nthird of the maximum rate for each exercise, w hio his the number of repetitions\nwhich o an be performed in one minute.\nWhen training one passes from one exercise\nquickly to the next in an anti-clockwise\ndirection until three laps of the circuit\nhave been completed.\nSWIMMING\nThe swimming o lub has an encouraging turnout for its first meet of the\nseason on Friday night. The club will be meeting every Friday at Buckingham\nPalace Road Baths from 7.30 until 9.30,\nThis is an increase on last season of\none hours bath time, and will allow\nregular matches for all teams and In\naddition there will be time available\nfor training and the not so expert\nswimmer to take part. All \u2022embers of\nthe oo lle ge are welcome.\nThe dub programme starts this\nFriday with a first team match against\nMedway Technical College while, there\nwill be a further trial far the combined second and third teams. The\nfollowing week the first play Old\nStartfordians and the seo on d the L.S.E. CONSimATION FOR OTHERS\nSB\nUSE OF THE GYMNASIUM\nA specific time-table has been\nset out. If you wish to use the gymnasium (and I hope you do!) please try\nnot to clash with any other club's activities.\nAfter a training session or match\nplease remember to clear away all appa ra tos, so as not to inconvenience others.\nDuring weight training or circuit\ntraining keep all weights on the mats\nprovided. Splinters in the floor oo ul d cause a person to suffer pain. On the\nsubject of splinters it is essential not\nto walk across the gymnasium floor in leather soled shoes.\nAny information regarding look er keys or tines when the gymnasium is vacant o an be found on the gymnasium\nnot ioe board, (outside the door at the\neast end).\nHOCKEY 1\nThe o lub is going from strength\nto strength and certainly the coming\nseason premises to be as successful\nss last.\nThe standard of play among the\nFreshers is extremely high, as was\nshown when a Fresher XI beat Reading\nUniversity 4 - 3 in the first match of\nthe season.\nAdditions to the Club Calendar\ninclude a coaching o our se under the\nsupervision of David Archer, the England Goalkeeper, also a 'Beer Evening'\nintended to introduce fresher s to the\nthird half.\nFour teams will be playing regularly this season and with sufficient\nsupport it is intended to field a5 th XI - yet another milestone in the\nClub's history. Therefore, if you\nwould like to find an up and caning\nclub and be assured ef a regular game,\nACT NOW! contact Mick Miller in the\nGarden Hall.\nThe most successful I.C. 'Sport'\nteam is the Mixed Hookey (Marriage\nBureau) XI. Last year was a record\nyear, nevertheless it is hoped to\nimprove on last years best performance\n- 8 crates of Guineas.\nI.C. GOLFING ASSOCIATION ;\nConsiderable interest was shown by\nthe fresher s on the 'Freshers Day'\nreception and a large number of names\nwere taken. There are several good\nplayers among them and our team will be\nconsiderably improved.\nIt is hoped to start group lessons\nfar beginners in a fortnight's time.\nThree of our team will be representing the university in the Blasters\nteam - the 'A' golf side of the University.\n\n"
