    "content": "17 December 1997 SPORT\nFast Cars,\nWomen and\nFighting Mud\nHalloween Rally Report\nIn the early hours of the 6th December, the country lanes\naround Hatfield and Stevenage echoed to the sounds raw exhaust\nnotes as the C&G Motorclub\n'Halloween Rally' took place. The\nbest attended rally in over a year\nand a half was also the most disastrous. Of the six entrants, two had\naccidents. Myself and Brian Aldred\nleft the flew off the road and\ndropped 4 foot into a ploughed\nfield. We escaped with minimal\ndamage to the car. Nick Collett and\nJustin Folet fared less well, taking\nout paving, contre te posts, a fence\nand damaging a tree before parking\ntheir MR2 across a ditch. A lifting\ntruck was called in to extricate\nthem.\nThe rally was stopped at half\nway, and Hilary and Austin Jones\nwere declared winners. Once again\nthe winning formula was a slow\ncar, a female driver and competent\nnavigation. Big cars and big boys it\nseems, make for big trouble. In an\nevent in which the principal challenge is navigation, treating the\nnight as an all out rally does not\npay. Still, we all need to learn,\ndon't we? And all who had accidents are treating it as a growing\nexperience.\nThe next twelve-car rally seems\nlikely to be set on 6 February 1998,\naround the same area. This rally\nwill be notable as it signals a new\nera in the C&G Motorclub, as we\njoin forces with other clubs around\nthe south east to make for a fuller\nentry list. Anyone interested in\ndoing 12 Car Rallies should mail\nmotor-club@ic.ac.uk or pop into\nthe C&G Union Office in Rm 340.\nRugby\nC&G v RCSRFC\nSparkes Cup\nAs predicted, we stuffed them. Yet\nagain the charging rhino of C&C bulldozed their way to victory. But,\nto be fair to the scientists, they put\nup a great fight and the game was\nplayed in an admirable spirit. Dave\n'Jabba the Hut' Partridge showed\nthat despite his bulk he can in fact\nbe mobile and handling the ball\nisn't that difficult after all. Tries\nwere scored by Nipples, Lionel,\njimbo b and Chris 'who?' Dickinson\nconverted one of them. A fine\nresult. RCS may improve further\nnext year but I'm sure we can handle them. Thanks to all who turned\nup and please turn out next\nWednesday for a game. Sparkes\nCup here we come.\nC&G170 RCS\nHockey\nICHC III v UCH I Picture the scene. Early afternoon\non the plains of the Serengeti. The\nsun beats down as naive, carefree\n\"UCH\" gazelles graze, unaware of\ntheir grizzly fate a wi a ting them.\nBut what's this? Across the horizon\ncome the pride of the 1CU Hockey\nClub 3rd team. Initially the wary\ngazelles got a whiff of our scent\n(especially Skank's socks) and\nscored the first point in the\nencounter by running for the nearest watering hole.\nThe brave lions switched tactics and attacked downwind as a whole we pounced.\nOur first goal went straight for\nthe jugular. Our second stripped\nthem of any skin and the 3rd one\nripped their hearts out.\nICHC III 4 - 2 UCH I Wing Chun\nWay of the Charitable Fist\nOn 30 of November, in the Great\nHall, the Wing Chun Academy put\non a charity show entitled\n\"Hazardous Encounters\".\nThe performance began\nwith our\nteacher, Sifli\nAndrew, going against\n5 of the\nsenior in st ruc tors. After\nbeing sent\nhurtling in various directions across\nthe stage,\neach in turn\nattacked Andrew with a real knife, a broken bottle,\nand, more\ndangerously,\na baseball bat.\nThe assailants\nwere all of\ncourse \"dis-armed\" and\n\"neutralized\",\ncompliments\nof Andrew.\nThen, the\n\"Wing Chun\nSpice Girls\", jay and Judith entered.\nBoth had to cope with the knife\nattacks of Stephen. If anyone was\nwondering why he was wearing all\nthe padding, our Spice Women\nmade it abundantly clear. One can\nonly hope that no mugger is unfortunate enough to fall upon either of\nthese two lethal ladies... After\nbreaking tiles and free fighting on\nthe Wing Chun round table,\nAndrew starred in the Grand Finale.\nCurrently the holder of the world\nrecord for the number of times the\nwooden man has been struck in\nTiles don't hit back\" said Mr Lee. But\nthey're still bloody hard.\ntwo minutes, Andrew performed\non the wooden man to the music\nof Riverdance. Andrew has been\nteaching at IC for 11 years, during\nwhich he has put together many\nshows and\ncharity events.\nThis show was\nprobably one\nof the most\nspontaneous,\nwith only 8\ndays of training before-hand. It\nattracted over\n160 people,\nmost of whom\nwere friends\nand family of\nstudents in the\nacademy, and\n\u00a3830 was\nraised on the\nnight. Ml proceeds went\ndirectly to\nWhizz-Kidz, a charity for\nnon mobile children. On\nthe 13th of\nFebruary, Andrew will\n.take part in the\nWhizz Kid z Himalayan Challenge, raising\nmoney for disabled children by\ntrekking through the Himalayas. He\nhas already pledged to raise\n\u00a33,000, which is the cost of an\nelectric wheelchair. If you are interested in helping out with the chari-ty, or in joining the Wing Chun\nAcademy, please feel welcome to\ncome join us at training on\nWednesdays at 1:30, and Fridays\nat 5:00 in the Union Gym.\nJiu Jitsu Japes\nThe recently formed Imperial\nCollege Jiu Jitsu Club entered its\nfirst competition last weekend\nwith some success. Sensei Nicola\nBrown took a team of three competitors of varying grade to the\ntwo day national event held at the\nNational Indoor Arena in\nBirmingham, where they won a bronze and a silver medal.\nThese were the first awards\ngained by the club which was\nformed only at the beginning of\nthis term and accordingly are considered quite an achievement.\nThe club training times are\nThursday 7.30 to 9.30pm and\nSunday 4 to 6.30pm in the Union\ngym.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS 17 December 1997\nI know that you all love\nmy in-depth dissections\nof the burning issues\nthat face mankind, but this week\nis so packed, I am forced to be\nbrief, which will make a nice\nchange. Normal service will be\nresumed next year. My partner in\ncrime, Mr Common, penned a few\nwords on electoral reform, a subject which, as he said, is in the\nnews at the moment. Young Mr\nBlair has charged Lord Jenkins, the\n'veteran liberal' (obviously not the\nLord Jenkins who was Labour\nChancellor from 1967 - 70 and\nsplit to form the SDP, Hamish),\nwith investigating alternatives.\nFrankly, when it comes to voting\nsystems, 1 am of the opinion that\n'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' No\nsystem is perfect, but the great\nmerit of first-past-the-post is its\ntransparency. Proportional representation inevitably lapses into\nback room deal-brokering, resulting\nin the wholesale distortion of party\nmanifestoes with scant regard to\nwhat people supported. Our system is very old, un trendy and un-'New Labour, New Britain', but it\nhas served us well. Most opposition to it seems to stem more from\ndisdain of those it elects rather\nthan the means of their victory.\nConstitutional meddling is the last\nrefuge of the ideologically bankrupt and should be avoided without good reason.\nRoger Geffen enlightened and\nentertained the masses with his\npiece on the oil industry last week,\nand 1 feel I should say something\nby way of balance. Sir Ron is a director of Shell,\nserving on the\nRemuneration and Succession\ncommittee, for -which he received\n\u00a321,391 last QQ\nyear. And why\nnot? It is beneficial to have our \u00a3J lords and masters ~ _\nexposed to\norganisations that Li are run properly,\nin the hope that a little rubs off on the administrative\nbasket-case that is Sherfield. The\nquestion about the behaviour of oil\ncompanies in the Third World is a little more complicated. Nigeria is\n'governed' by an extremely distasteful military junta, which has\ndone nothing but damage the\ninterests of the country. This is\nwhere the real problems lies. Shell\noperate in a virtually lawless environment, and this absence of regulation may lead them to overstep\nthe mark, encouraged by the\nregime eager for the dollars that\nstem form their activities. If Shell\nprotest too much, they run the risk\nof having their assets nationalised,\nas happened to BP in the Middle\nEast. The best way to improve the\nsituation is for the Nigerian people\nto overthrow\niT p \u20141 their leaders,\nv.,J something' which we should\nencourage as far\nOo as is possible.\n\u2022 * \u2022 As you all\n*5* know, I have\n' V always been ful\u2022 some in my\nS l^J praise of College\n\u2022\u2022 Security. This\nj l marvellous band\nof men and\nwomen gallantly protect us from\nthe preying hoards of SW7, and\nalso issue swipe cards, which\nbrings me to my point. Don't lose\nthem kids. It takes 10 days to get\na replacement and, were it not for\ngenerosity of the boys and girls in\ngrey, I would have been in the\nbrown smelly stuff. Keep up the\ngood work. You can call the dogs\noff now, thanks.\nThe integration of the medical\nschools marches on relentlessly,\nproducing the odd casualty along\nthe way. This week saw the disappearance of the Secretary to the\nImperial College School of\nMedicine, Dr Julian Axe. The unfortunately named medic has been\ndeemed unnecessary by our\nchums in Sherfield. This College\nain't big enough for two\nSecretaries, it would seem.\nCommiserations to Dr Axe, as he\njoins the very select group of people rational is ed in a merger that\nshould have seen hundreds seeking alternative positions. While on\nthe subject of the merger, it is nice\nto see that this year the BMS is\ngraced by some Christmas trees...\nFinally, word reaches me of a jamboree at Alexandra Palace\nplanned for this summer by the\nUnion. They want to know if you\nthink it's a goer. As you are all very\nbusy, let me speak for all College\nmembers. Marvellous idea. Ally\nPally is a great venue, and it's about time that we showed those\nULU chap pies that little old\nImperial can organise a good bash.\nWell, folks, that's yer lot. Have a great Christmas, have a mince pie\non me as you watch Her Majesty,\nand see you next year.\nCHftllTMASIS MORI THAiV A LOAD0 SHOW SOMEONE YOU CARE\nCHRISTMAS CAMS\nFROM\nA WIDE RANGE OF CARDS INCLUDING OX FAAt CHARITY CARDS,\nW00DMANSTERNE CARDS AND THE NEW \"INK GROUP\" RANGE.\nPLUS A WIDE SELECTION OF CALENDARS.\nYour Union - for life, not just for Christmas\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 17 December 1997\nSporting Decision\ncontinued from page one\nthat as many chances as possible\nfor competitive sport should be\npresented to the students through\nBUSA activities. She accepted that\nsingle-entry is inevitable, but dual\nentry was preferable until the\nmerger was fully established. The\nmedics felt BUSA recognises \"the\nsporting history of the Medical\nSchools\" and accept dual-entry\nregardless of St. Mary's combined\nstatus.\nEric Allsop presented the sin-g le entry proposal by suggesting\nthat IC needs to enter the best\npossible teams in a nationwide\ng le entry would 'disenfranchise'\nthe medics, and could result in less\nmedical participation in IC sport,\ndual-entry being appropriate. It\nwas announced that, by a twenty\nto eighteen majority (two abstentions), the council had voted for\nsingle-entry. The meeting closed\nafter the motion's formal acceptance, sparking an indignant exodus of medics from the Union\nDining Hall.\nEric Allsop hoped that the decision would \"build bridges\". ICU's worry is that the failure of ICSM to\nmerge with IC entirely on their own\nterms will cause great division at a The Rugby 4th team soon found new fixtures. Cartoon: Stavros\nsporting forum, and cited the\nexample of the joint IC-ICSM fencing team who became national\nchampions. He pointed out how\nmedical schools outside London\nenter under their parent institutions\nand claimed it was unlikely that\nBUSA would allow a double entry.\nThe former president suggested\nthat the St. Mary's teams need not\nbe disbanded instead playing in\nnumerous other London and medical competitions. This scheme\nwas ridiculed by medics for the\nimpossibility of its logistics. This\nyear the medics separated from\nthe team and consequently the\nteam was severely weakened, and\nis now only ranked mid-league. It\nwas claimed that dual-entry could\nonly result in the suffering or even\nloss of sporting teams at both institutions. The debate raged for an hour\nand numerous facets of the situation were explored. Andy Heeps\nsummed up by conceding that\ncurrent ICSM students would never\nreally be IC students and that sin-time when each institute is carefully identifying its role within the\nnewly combined college.\nIt was hoped that this meeting\nwould end a decade-old issue but\nMs Armstrong commented afterwards \"there should be a decision\nmade by college referendum\".\nFelix have heard she intends to\nopen the issue to a general vote by\nIC students: This must first be supported by a450 signature petition.\nThe IC Rugby Club held a meeting for the IC players so they can\nassess the club's view and then\nconfer with their St. Mary's counterparts. If there is general dis-agreement, it has been suggested\nthat a council Emergency General\nMeeting will be called. This will\nallow union members to vote for a resolution that could usurp the\ncouncil's original decision.\nAndy Heeps commented that\nthere were other mechanisms for\nstudents to make their voices\nheard.\nLights bring Christmas cheer to capital. Photo: Froggy\nTop Scoring Chemistry\nStudent Dies\nANDY SINHARAY\nStaff and students alike have reacted with shock to the death of a student in the department of\nChemistry, who is thought to have\ncommitted suicide.\nDr. David Widdowson, Director\nof Undergraduate Studies in the\nDepartment of Chemistry, told\nFelix that a report had been submitted to the Coroner. \"He was\nkilled in a accident on the tube at\nPutney...it's not officially suicide\nuntil the coroner says so.\"\nDescribing the student as \"a ninety\nper center\", said he had been \"very\nquiet and reserved, rather intense,\nvery studious... I think he was a bit\nof a loner.\" He had just returned\nfrom a year in industry, and\nalthough his year, in the United\nStates, had not gone as intended.\nDr. Widdowson believes that this\n\"was a sym pt on, not a cause\" of\nthe student's problems. \"I think\nhe'd started to have a problem earlier on., we'd thought he'd been\nokay, [being] near the top of the\nclass...he was a very bright chap, it\nwas a shock for everyone.\" The\nstudent, who is from abroad, died\nwhen his parents were visiting him\nin London.\nHelen-Louise Windsor, a chemistry postgraduate and RCSU\nPresident remembers the\ndeceased. \"He was very very quiet.\nI can't say I was a close friend of\nhis, I'm not sure if he had any close\nfriends - he kept himself to himself.\nI remember speaking to him just\nbefore the elections [and]...hearing\nthat he'd been having problems\nwith his year away. It affected me\nquite a lot when he died.\" Dr.\nDavid Hayward, Senior Tutor in the\nDepartment of Chemistry, told\nFelix, \"I was shocked, and very sad\nthat it happened. He was one of\nthe brightest students in his year.\"\nAs Felix was going to press an\nofficial inquest was believed to be\nunderway at Fulham Coroner's Court.\n\n"

La) CHRISTMAS SPECTACLE\nSo, folks, it's time for the big one.\nIt's Christmas, you've just had\nexams, your folks are on at you,\nno money, basically it's time to\nchill out. And what better way than\nby cooking the Big Pig Out as per\nmy stress-free directions. Ma and\nPa will be gob-smacked. I 've\ndecided to do away with the\nturkey business. Frankly, even if\nprepared really well, turkey is dull.\nIt gums your mouth up and you\nhave to waste good booze washing it down. So I 've gone for the\nvenison option. Sorry if I 've\noffended any turkey-phil es out\nthere. Sorry. Not. However, most\nof the tr ad trimmings are there as\nwell as k edge ree, a fishy bre k ky dish. Here's the menu:\nKedgeree\nBisque aux Huitres\nQuarter de Chevreuil Rod\nLegumes Varies\nPouding de Noel\nYou will need these ingredients:\n1 fully equipped kitchen\n(i.e. an average real home\nkitchen+mini bar) Kedgeree:\n1 lb smoked haddock\n\u00ab\u2022 l/4l b rice\n2 hard-boiled eggs\nOyster soup:\n<*\" 1 dozen oysters, preferably\nfresh\n\u00ab' 2 pt fish stock\n\u00ab\u2022 1/4 pt cream\n* 1/2 glass white wine\n(shouldn't be too difficult to\nfind at this time of year)\nBrandy butter:\n\u00ab\" 3oz butter\n6oz icing sugar\n1 t bl brandy\nMain meal:\n\u00ab\" 1 haunch (leg and loin) of\nvenison\n*\u2022 2 lb potatoes\n\u00ab\" 2 lb Jerusalem artichokes\n*\" couple of onions\nf2 lb brussels sprouts\nfa dozen mini-sausages\n\u00ab\" a dozen rashers of streaky\nbacon\nT the Christmas pudding you\nmade in September (you did-n't? Better go and buy one, then)\nAnd here is madness without\nmethod:\nThe night before- Open the oysters and add the liquid to the fish\nstock. Bring the stock to a simmer,\ncut the oysters in half and cover\nwith the cream. Melt loz butter in\na large pan, stir in 3 t bl of flour and\nthen slowly add the fish stock and\nthe glass of wine. Simmer for 1/2\nhour, season and add a little\nlemon juice and nutmeg. Remove\nfrom the heat and stir in the\ncream, oysters and an egg yolk.\nChill as quickly as possible.\nBoil the haddock in just\nenough milk to cover it. First bring\nthe milk to the boil, put the fish in\nand then keep the milk just boiling\nfor 6-7 minutes. Drain and cool.\nCook the rice in the usual way.\nCool and place in fridge.\nFor the brandy butter, cream\nthe butter and sugar together\n(basically mix them up and then\nwhisk with a fork until the mixture\ngoes pale). Work the brandy into\nthe mixture and store in the fridge.\nHave a night-cap, go to bed\nand dream of Santa.\nOn the Day 7am Get up, have a peek at the presents on the way to\nthe kitchen. Put the kettle on. For\nthe k edge ree, cut the whites of the\neggs into strips, crush the yolks\ninto a dry paste and flake the haddock into small pieces. Make\nsome tea and take a cup up to\neverybody.\nMelt 2oz butter in a large pan,\nadd the fish, rice, egg whites,\nsome salt, pepper and cayenne\npepper and til until hot. Get everybody out of bed. Delicious odour s should help.\nPut the k edge ree onto a warm\nplate, pat it into a pyramid (well,\nwhy not) and sprinkle the egg\nyolks on top. Serve as hot as possible with lots of tea.\nT4 hours -Heat the oven up to\n350\u00b0F,160 \u00b0C, Gas Mark 4. Make a stiff dough with about a mug full of\nflour and some water. Brush the\njoint with lots of butter or drip-ping, spread the dough over it and\nwrap with a large piece of grease-proof paper.\nHave a fag and a glass of sherry.\nT90 minutes - Warm up a large pan of water (that has a large\nlid to go with it), peel the spuds\nand place them in the boiling\nwater for 10 minutes. Drain well,\nseason with plenty of salt, pepper\nand herbs, sprinkle with oil, put\nthe lid on and give the pan a vigorous shake to \"roughen\" the\nspuds.\nTake the roast out of the oven,\nremove the paper and dough,\nsprinkle with a couple of tablespoonfuls of flour, baste copiously with hot butter, add the potatoes and onions to the baking tin\nand put back in the oven.\nT60 minutes - Time to start on\nthe sprouts. Remove any 'or rib le outer leaves and cut a cross on the\nbottom of each stalk. Place in\nsome cold water containing 1/2\ntsp of salt for every pint of water.\nLeave them to soak for 10 min-ute s, no more.\nT40 mins - Roll the sausages up\nin the streaky bacon, skewering\neach with one of those lovely\ncocktail sticks to stop the bacon\nunrolling. Pop them into the oven\nin a separate dish.\nT30 mins - Melt a large knob of\nbutter in a pan, put the sprouts in\nand gently fry them over a low\nheat. When the outer leaves are\nbrowned, pour in about 1/2 inch of\nwater and 1/2 tsp of salt, bring to\nthe boil and simmer for around 10\nminutes.\nAt the same time, heat up a pan of salted water with at bl of\nvinegar. When this boils, put the\nJerusalem artichokes in and simmer for 20 minutes\nT10 mins - Heat up the oyster\nsoup as rapidly as possible without bringing to the boil.\nBlast off - Turn the oven off, drain\nthe brussels and artichokes. The\nrest is waiter service which 1 know\nnothing about so I won't bother.\nBy now you should have realised\nthat you have forgotten to steam\nthe pudding. Ah well eh? Better\nstick it in the microwave.\nGood Luck!\nAntoine.\n\n"

    "content": "17 December 1997 TV 15\nm. Simon Baker sums up the span gly, expensive and sick making world of Christmas Television As many of you old lags know, my opinions\nare not confined to politics and Sherfield. At\nthis time of year, I like to save you the price\nof a paper by telling you what you should be\nwatching this Christmas. You know you can\ntrust me. It comes as no surprise that yet\nagain the BBC have wiped the floor with the\nopposition. The big films in Radio Times are\nall on BBC 1, namely Clear and Present\nDanger (9.30pm,23 December), The Naked\nGun 33'/i: The Final Insult (9pm, Christmas\nEve), The Flintstones (4.10pm, Christmas\nDay), The Mask (6.50pm, Christmas Eve),\nTrue Lies (10.15pm, Boxing Day) and Forrest\nGump (9.00pm, New Year's Day). All fairly\ngood films and well worth watching, even if\nyou have probably seen them all before.\nElsewhere, there are some absolute\ngems. The Beeb are having a series of\nCarry On films, though some would\nargue they do every Christmas. Don't Lose Your Head (11.40pm,22 December), Loving (1.10am, Christmas\nDay), Girls (1.20am, Boxing Day),\nAgain Doctor (11.40pm,27 December), the superb Up the Khyber\n(11.45pm,30 December), at Your\nConvenience (1.00am, New Year's Eve), Abroad (12.55am, New Year's Day) and Behind (1 1,50pm.2 January).\nNot the optimum selection, but a few\ncork ers all the same.\nFor as many years as I can re mem ber, The Italian Job has been shown on\nChristmas Eve. Disastrously, it does not\nfeature anywhere in the terrestrial\nschedules. Some comfort can be\nderived from Zulu (BBC2, 5.45pm,29 December), which gave birth to the\nimmortal words, 'Don't chuck those\nbloody spears at me.' Continuing the\nmilitary theme, The Bridge On The\nRiver Kwai (BBC2, 9.10pm,20 December) is\nquite superb. The number of all-time greats is\nfairly high this year, and provides a good\nopportunity to fill in the odd gap in one's knowledge. The epic Gone With The Wind\n(C5, 7.10pm, Boxing Day) may have been on\na hundred times before, but remains timeless,\nas does the Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and\nCoronets (C4, 5.30pm, Christmas Day). Also\nYOUR on Christmas Day is Willy Wonka and The\nChocolate Factory (BBC1, 11.05am), which\nhasn't been on for years. Compulsory viewing\napplies to The Return of The Pink Panther\n(1TV,3.05 pm,29 December), a veritable tour\nde farce due solely to the incomparable Peter\nSellers. James Stewart is, un surprisingly, the\nsubject of many tributes, but the best must be\na screening of Mr Smith Goes to Washington\n(BBC2, 10.05am,29 th December). As part of\nthe Growing Up with 4 season, which lasts for\ntwo weeks, Channel 4 are showing Last\nTango in Paris (1 1.00pm, New Year's Day),\nfamous for its creative use of dairy products.\nFinally, if, like me, you have not seen Shallow\nGrave (C4, I1.05 pm,27 th December), now is\nyour chance.\n1 quite expected Channel 5 to go for broke\nwith their Christmas scheduling given their\nlacklustre performance to date, but sadly they\nhave not. The only possible success could be\nNight Fever: Abba Special (7.00pm, Christmas Day), but elsewhere it is just a tale\nof woe. Whoever gave one hour to The Tim\nVine Christmas Present (7.00pm, Christmas\nEve) has clearly never seen this man's work.\nTELLY 'Tim Vine offers his comic views on the sea-son.' OK, that's filled 30 seconds, what about\nthe rest? Far, far worse must be Vannessa\nFeltz's Day with Neil and Christine\nHamilton (8.00pm,30 December). Has this\nman not suffered enough? (No, Ed).\nElsewhere, things are looking much better.\nThe BBC has a full range of Christmas\nSpecials, featuring among others\nShooting Stars (BBC2, 9.00pm,22 September), Harry Enfield & Christmas\nChums (BBC1, 10.15pm, Christmas\nEve), The Two Ronnies (BBC1, 2.15pm, Christmas Day), One Foot in the Grave\n(BBCI, 8.00pm, Christmas Day), Men\nH Behaving Badly (BBC1, 10.20pm, Christmas Day), They Think It's All Over\n(BBC1, 11.05pm, Christmas Day),\nSteptoe and Son (BBC2, 10.10pm, Boxing Day) and The Armistice Party\nBucket (BBC2, 10.25pm,2 January).\nSome of you may have missed last\nyear's stunningly good Only Fools and\nHorses, but fear not, since it is going to\nbe repeated on Fridays, the fri st episode\nbeing on 2 January at 7.55pm. ITV have\nDame Edna Kisses It Better (9.00pm, Boxing Day), An Evening with Spike\n** Milligan (10.00pm, New Year's Day) and\nFrankie Howerd at His Tittermost\n(12.45am, New Year's Day), which is\nbrilliant. Channel 4 has, of course, a Rory Bremner Special (10.30pm,30 December), preceded by a one-off comedy,\nMr White Goes to Westminster (9.00pm,30 December) about an anti-sleaze MP. The cast\nlooks pretty good, so it's worth a look. Away\nfrom comedy, there a host of good pro-gram mes. Not surprisingly, there are a few\nBond-related bits, including Nobody Does It\nBetter: The Music of James Bond (C4,\n10.1 5pm,28 December) and Shirley Bassey:\nThis is My Life (BBC1, 10.05pm,2 January).\nThere is also a look at The Making of\nTomorrow Never Dies (ITV, 12.30pm, Boxing\nDay), though past experience shows that such\nprogrammes rarely do the film concerned jus-tice.\nWell, that's yer lot, boys and girls. All in all,\nnot a bad season's television, which should fill\nin the gaps between sleeping and eating.\nHave a good Christmas and, if you have\nexams early in January, you have my sym pa thy. Happy New Year.\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nICAFC brings about world peace\nI CAF CV vR FH II ICAFC II v St Bart'sI ICAFC IV v UCH II\nIC Fifths are a match for any team\nwhen they are playing at their best,\nand today we were superb. IC had\n5 corners in the first few minutes\nbut miserably failed to do anything\nwith them. Then, halfway through\nthe first half, IC won a free kick,\nand pushed forward. The free kick\nwas taken and went straight to\nRFH, who put it forward to their\nattacker. With most of IC's defence up for the free kick, the\nattacker swept up the pitch, shimmied round our keeper and put the\nball in the back of the net. The second half began with IC pushing for-ward, and Simon ran himself\nragged and proved to be an inspiration to the rest of the team.\nRapidly, IC's hard work culminated\nin a goal mouth scramble where\nAndy Mackey scored his first goal.\nWith the teams level, the pace was\nstepped up again. Credit must go\nto the defence for stopping the\nRFH attackers in their tracks. When\nSimon picked up a cross and powered it into RFH's net, IC knew\nthey could win this match. RFH's lack of discipline showed through\nwith their frustration at the solid\ndefence and midfield and they\nwere gutted when the Referee\nblew the final whistle.\nICAFC V21 RFH II\nThe last game of 1997, and\ndefender Jesse's last game ever for\nIC as he turns his back on the grey\nof South Kensington for the grey of\nSeattle. It was obvious from the\nstart that Bart's were compact and\nhad the commit t ment to go in hard\nfor every challenge - this was not\ngoing to be easy. With honours\neven from the early exchanges, the\nbalance of the match was tipped in\nour favour as a superb corner was\nnearly headed through the net by\ntop scorer Pistol Pete. The game\nwas hard but dominated by an IC\nteam that looked, to the amazement of everyone, organized and\nin control. There was little of the\nusual panic under pressure that\nhas been our downfall thus far. Jag\nfitted in seamless ly and tackled\nwith bite. The central defensive\npartnership of Rob and Loz was\nstrong, at left-back \"Big\" Jesse\nmagnificent in his swan song game.\nIn the second half Pistol Pete and\nMartin continued to cause problems and Patrick looked at home in\nthe centre of the park. Si D was\nbooked for the first time in his\ncareer. There were a few scares\ntoward the end but yet again we\nwere rescued by the lightning reactions of keeper Chris Barlow. The\nmatch was sealed three minutes\nfrom the end by debut ant Simon.\nGood luck Jesse!\nIt was a superb performance which\ngave the Fourths another victory.\nWe are playing like the Accrington\nStanley team of 1891, adopting\nthe revolutionary 4-4-2 system.\nFrom the offset we used our Alpine\ndownhill skills to bombard their\ndefence and it wasn't long before\nDazzler netted his first. Nice ball\nfrom Perez. Another one of boring\nDarren's one on ones put us two\nup. Then Perez scored a tap in\nfrom 25 yards. Special mention\nshould go to the defence- Andy\nSwift, strong but delicate with his\nballs spreading 'em wide, and Elliot\nwho played despite a bad case of\nVD. Everyone was a lot stronger\nthan their opponents and we out-battled them all, despite their\nspoiling tactics. They scored a good goal before half-time, but\nthat only improved our resolve.\nDave was nearly sent off, but managed to escape with a booking.\nWe scored one last goal to make\nthe last ten minutes a formality,\nPaul to Darren to Ryan and back to\nDarren... GOAL and a hat-trick to\nDaz. Splendid.\n4 IC IV vI UCH II\nICAFC II 2 - 0 St Bart's Gun Fun\nSaturday saw the Rifle and Pistol\nClub take its first visit to the great\noutdoors for rifle shooting on the\nSiberia Ranges at Bisley. Our mis-sion: target rifle shooting at\n200yd s and \"classic\" service rifles\nat 100 yd s. Everyone had the opportunity\nto try out different rifles of various\nvintages ranging from a.577\"1858 Naval pattern Enfield muzzle loading percussion rifle to a modern\n7.62mm aperture sighted target\nrifle. The afternoon saw the competitive element of the day take on\na festive flavour with some Snap\nShooting and a Turkey Shoot. The\nSnap Shooting is done with the\nclassic service rifles and consisted\nof 5 exposures. Top scorers were\nJacob Thome and Dan Carr. The\nTurkey Shoot consisted of 3 shots\nat a paper turkey. Best score was\nposted by John McCartney and\nSimon Parton. The aggregate best\nscore was by Dan Carr. Thanks\nmust go to Andrew Eldridge for his\nunselfish efforts in coaching, and to\nNick for those boiled sweets but\nunconvincing chat up line.\nThe last Wednesday of term will\nsee a novelty shoot for both rifle\nand bow in the range, so drop in\nand give it a go.\n17 December 1997\nEditorial\nSo, cats and kittens, another term\nof gorgeous ness from the demigods that are the IC sportsmen\nand women. It is not without\nregret that I have to inform you\nthat as of next term there will be\nan as-yet unknown new sport-edi-tor. I have finally bowed to the\npressures of work and the desire\nto spend my Wednesday evenings\nin Southside mesmerized by alcohol and pretty Welsh girls. Jake\nhas finally renounced the use of\nhis legs and has expressed a desire to spend the rest of eternity in a fantasy world centred\naround the cosy womb-substitute\nof his bed.\nThe good news is that the\nopportunity is there for a youthful\nand ambitious newcomer to Felix\nto take up the sport-editor's baton\nand put in their leg in the great\njournalistic realy. In the words of\nCamelot \"How big can our bonuses possibly be?\" [Shurely \"It could\nbe you?\" - Jake]. No special talents\nare needed (although a love of\npoor quality puns is an advantage)\nand full training will be given on\nthe DTP package used and you\nmay even be made the odd cup of\ncoffee/tea by the esteemed editor.\nThis is a chance to give something\nback to the college and to shamelessly plug your favourite sport to\nthe detriment of all others.

To\nthe credit of the halls and the\nCollege, a big deal is rarely made of\nsuch incidents. But what business\nis it of theirs at all?

    "content": "6 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix,\nCRUDE RESPONSE\nDear Felix,\nAfter reading the disturbing\narticle, \"Crude on Campus\", in last\nweek's edition, I feel compelled to\nwrite and express my support for\nRoger Geffen in speaking out about\nsomething which concerns and\nfrightens me, especially as a potential employee of an oil company. I am constantly worried that\nImperial structures its courses, particularly in engineering subjects, on\nthe specific needs of individual\ncompanies. I speak as a student of\nchemical engineering where most\nweeks we receive visits and presentations from companies seeking\nrecruits for vacation work and full\ntime postgraduate employment.\nHow many of us, though, actually\nstop to think what we potentially\nsacrifice ethically when we apply\nfor, and accept, positions within\nthese companies? Certainly the\nprospect of a high salary is a powerful incentive, but surely we\nshould be probing to discover any\nundisclosed policies that there may\nbe?\n1 strongly urge anyone who\nfeels the same way to find out as\nmuch information as possible\nabout sources of funding within\ntheir department and employer's backgrounds. If these allegations\nare true, can Imperial really afford\nto be associated with these com-pani es?3 rd year student,\nDept. of Chemical Engineering\nRAVING MAD To the sex-mad raving loony\n(your words' not mine)\nThere is only one place that fits\nthe description you made:\nHombres,\nWale Street,\noff Oxford Street\nAll the London cabbies' know it and\nmedics (and their guests') get in\nfree.\nyours faithfully.\nAnon\nINCREDIBLE - A COMPLIMENT Dear Jeremy\nIndeed the quality of Felix\nseems to be improving by the\nweek! I particularly appreciate the\nweekly feature and many of the\narts reviews are well written. The\nlatter are so good that I often want\nto go and see a play; as for taking\nthe mickey out of the Turner Prize\nExhibition, encourage Clare to write\nmore of such stuff.\nFinally, I'd like to comment on\nthe news item on page 2 (Imperial\nstudents fall victim to con men). This story sounds all too familar to\nme: about 18 months ago I was\napproached by a young woman,\nclaiming to be a tourist who had\nalso lost all her belongings and\nwould I give her some money for\nher fare. I was not convinced that\nher story was true and instinctively\nsaid 'no'. I think the moral is that all\nof us should be cautious: it is not\njust men in smart suits who con\nothers into departing with their\nmoney.\nPlease keep up the good work.\nTrijntje Ytsma\n(Humanities and UROP\nSecretary, although the above are\nmy private views)\nTAKE A DEEP\nBREATH, HERE WE GO...\nDear Felix\nMy word, a controversial feature (issue 1100) Well done! If it\nmakes pe opie think about what\nthey believe and why they believe it\nthen it is no bad thing. Having said\nthat it does seem that Matteo\nFloris is confused about what he\nbelieves. Does he believe (as so\nmany do) that the Bible is old hat,\nsuitable only for the credulous and\nthose born before the enlighten-ment, or does be think that the\nBible can provide some of the\nanswers along with the scriptures\nof all the other world religions? It is\nnot clear which view is being pro-mote d. He also vociferously rejects\nthe Catholic church of the Middle\nages, whilst implying that the\nchurch of today is exactly the\nsame. It is most defiantly not!\nMuch is made of the renaissance (aka the enlightenment and\nthe age of reason). However people carefully forget that the theological reformation preceded and\noverlapped with it. The reformation put very simply was a time\nduring which the philosophers and\ntheologians of the day discovered\nwhat the scriptures (i.e. the Bible)\nhave to say about the Creator God,\nand the relationship that he has\nwith his creation, namely humanity.\nBefore, during and after this time\nthe Catholic Church remained\nfocused on the supposedly higher\nspiritual issues, and had accepted\nthe idea that what is natural is\nsomehow evil. With the reformation came the Christian understanding that in the beginning God\nhad created all things, and that all\nthings had been \"good\", though\nthis goodness had been spoiled by\nhumanities rebellion against God.\nThis belief is in a God who has created a universe that is not part of\nhis essence, but is permeated with\nhis presence. It means that\nChristianity gives a certainty of\nobjective reality, and of cause and\neffect, a certainty that is strong\nenough to build on. Indeed Galileo\nwas not trying to disprove the existence of God. He with other early\nscientists (Copernicus, Faraday and\nFrancis Bacon to name but a few)\nshared the same outlook of\nChristianity in believing there is a reasonable God who had created a reasonable universe; and thus man,\nby use of his reason could find out\nthe universe's form.\nTherefore when Galileo\nobserved the planets and the\nmoons of Jupiter, he was doing it\nwithin the bounds of his Christian\nfaith, as a reasoning, reasonable\ncreation of a reasonable Creator\nGod. The reaction of the \"Holy\nInquisition\" was as much against\nthe \"heretical\" theology of the\nreformed church as it was against\nthose scientists who dared to\nobserve Gods creation as it really\nwas. It must also be borne in mind\nthat the Catholic Church had control over vast areas of land and\nhuge numbers of people, they were\na thoroughly corrupt bunch who\nhad an intellectual, and superstitious hold over even the educated\npopulation.

    "content": "COLUMNS 17 December 1997\nThought for the Holiday\nPART 1: CHRISTMAS\nI used to love Christmas when I was a child. As the weather turned\ncold, myself and my sister would\nstare, un blinking, out of the back of\nthe car on the way to school,\nscouring the front rooms of\nLiverpool in the hope of being the\nfirst to spot the twinkle of a Christmas tree. School would fin-ish; carols were sung unanimously;\nthe blissful excitement would\nmount, as the great day drew clos-er. Christmas Eve was a nightmare,\nand on occasion we had to be\ndrugged with whisky-spiked coffee,\njust to get us to sleep. We would\nwake up at six in the morning, tear\nthe wrapping from our presents,\nand then proceed through gloating,\nthe my-presents-are-better-than-yours phase, shouted arguments,\nfighting and usually tears. Without\na doubt, the zenith of the tiny tot's calendar. For our unfortunate and\nharassed parents, however, the\nday had not yet begun.\nPeople say that the spirit of\nChristmas deteriorates as one gets\nolder, but it is only recently that 1\nhave really begun to appreciate the\nscale of the problem. Any parent\nwho claims that Christmas is worth\nthe gargantuan effort of proper celebration is one of two things: an\noptimist, or a Prozac fancier.\nWith a bit of luck, it should be\nthe best part of a decade before I am called upon to increase the\npopulation of this Orb, and already\nthe costs of old Chrimbo are\nthreatening to outweigh the bene-fits. (Such cynicism in one so\nyoung...) People seem not to\nunderstand that I don't have any\nmoney any more. I got some dirty\nlooks last year when some people\nopened their presents, even\nthough my bank balance was looking quite anorexic. (An argument is\nraging in Oxford, because there is a faction who believe that the official\nDictionary definition of a student\nshould be \"student (n.)a penniless\nwretch.\" Personally, I'd agree.)\nMerely getting out of bed earlier\nthan lunch time was also a serious\nstumbling block. I managed to\nwend my way over the road to the\nchampagne breakfast that some\nfriends were bravely staging, and\nfound my bacon charred beyond all\nrecognition, my eggs looking particularly sorry for themselves, and\nthe champagne... well, the buggers\ndrank it all before I got there.\nChristmas trees always provide\nendless hours of fun. They are evil;\njust another of Mother Nature's amusing anecdotes. I have been\nknown, in my role as a budding\ndesigner, to waste hours decorating the tree; sticking myself with its\nporcupine-sharp spines; falling\nface-first into the branches whilst\ntrying to install the traditional fairy\nand testing the lights above and\nbeyond British Standard\nBS546546654654356765, to find\nthat they extinguish themselves\nwithin five minutes of being draped\nover the sm egging shrub.\nI would then come downstairs\nin the morning to find that some\ntalent less taste starved / Happy Christmas\nmonkey \\ little children\nhad completely\nbutchered it. \"1\nthought we'd try a more minimalist\ntree this year. It's very fashionable,\nyou know.\nSomeone at IKEA\ntold me. You don't mind, do you?\"\nThe twenty-fifth of December\ndoes have a few\nthings to be said\nin its favour. This\nonly applies to\nthe Christmas\ndinner if you have\nnot endured\ntwelve hours of\nculinary contortion making it.\nPreparing a turkey\nrequires surgical accuracy far in\nadvance of ICSM's very best, and\ncooking it all is a piece of chemical\nco-ordination never seen in the\nPerkin organic lab. After these exertions, I am tired, incapable of conversation (some might say an\nimprovement), and really not hungry at all, preferring to sleep face\ndown in the gravy while everyone\nelse thoroughly enjoys themselves.\nSo the only redeeming feature\nof Christmas, it seems, is the reason for celebrating it in the first\nplace. A lot of Christians are likely\nto be reaching for the Basildon\nBond at this point, so let me say\nthis; anyone who believes that the\nreal message of Christmas has\nbeen lost in the modern age is\nthoroughly deluded. No. It seems\nto me that worship is the only part\nof Christmas still worth having.\nPART 2: NEW YEAR\nIf Christmas is the province of\nchildren, then New Year is an\nadult pursuit. If you can remember your first genuine New Year\nparty then you didn't celebrate it\nproperly. It is a very good job that\npeople don't start the New Year as\nthey mean to go on, for the simple\nreason that they would then spend\nthe rest of the year in the gutter,\npondering the mysteries of life with\ntheir own bodily fluids.\nThe perennial process is the\nsame. 'Where are we going this\nyear?\" There then\nfollows a waterfall\nof ideas; at first\ncredible, then\nincredible, finally\nfantastic, usually\nculminating in\nsomebody wanting to sit in a field\nof dung and break\nthe world record\nfor smoking hash.\nDespite this forward planning,\nwe usually end up\nbuying a ticket on\nChristmas Eve for\nthe only club that\nstill has vacancies. There's usually a shopping trip\ninvolved, too.\nLast year, full of\nenthusiasm, I spent four hours\nsauntering round\nthe city looking\nfor the greatest and most chic shirt\nmankind has ever seen, rendering\nme absolutely irresistible to whoever I chose. In the end I went back\nhome and wore the shirt 1 bought\nthe year before. Yes, the one that is\nbanned in sixteen countries for\nbeing a taste catastrophe.\nPlans are currently afoot to\nupdate car registrations twice\nannually, rather than just in August,\nto spread showrooms' business\nmore evenly throughout the year. It\nrequires only a small extension of\nthought to realise that if nobody\ndrank on New Year, all the breweries would call in the receiver.\nNew Year owes everything to a measly two atoms of carbon, a pathetic one of oxygen, and a remarkably minimalist ic six atoms\nof hydrogen.\nSo the fun starts, usually in the\npub, and always far more early\nText by Our Kid, illustration by Ian\nthan can really be considered sen-sib le. From here on in, things start\nto go wrong. Step one is usually\nsomeone forgetting their ticket for\nthe club. For the last two years it\nhas been me, and 1 have felt like a right monkey, 1 can tell you. In a cruel reworking of alphabetical\norder, Club follows Pub, and everyone realises that their \"just one\nmore\" strategy has led to their\nblood streams being credited with\nthree pints, a rum and coke, and\nsix double vodka s, at some sadist's insistence. Somebody is also usually asleep on the table, and by the\nend of the evening, they are probably very glad. At least they will find\nit quite easy to get home again.\nAlready a long way over the\nlegal limit, a taxi gets everyone into\ntown. Here, again, somebody\nmakes a serious error. Bar Ca Va?\nTequila for 80pa shot? Everybody\nhas heard of the European butter\nmountains. Fewer people are\naware of the salt and lemon mountains, which are dealt cheaply to\nnight clubs on the black market for\nthe New Year. This is why, after\nfour tequilas, my mouth now has\nno lining, and the concept of taste\nno longer has any meaning.\nSo we reach the club, tired and\nalready in a state where the bouncers are unsure whether to let me in\nor not; they think I am some sort of\nlunatic as I search all my pockets\ntwice before I locate the more-important-than-life-itself ticket. One\nof us gets chucked out before we're\neven inside. Everyone piles immediately into the toilet. We drink, we\ndance, we make complete fools of\nourselves. A friend of mine tries to\nchat up a table. The bar is a scrum,\nbut we drive with the strength of\nprop forwards, even though we\nhave had quite enough already.\nThen the moment arrives, and\nsuddenly everyone is my friend. I chat to complete strangers like I have known them all my life.\nPeople like myself, who have come\nto laugh, to celebrate; to have a good time. All the misfortune of\nthe old year, all the bad times,\ngone in an instant, as something\ncriminally cheesy shoots out of the\ngargantuan loudspeakers.\nAnd then... well, I can't really\nremember very well. I have a vague\nmemory of...long blonde hair? A girl called Emma?\nWithout a doubt, the greatest\nnight of the calendar. Merry\nChristmas, kids, and I 'll see you all\nin the New Year. I 'll have to get\nhome first, though...\n\n"

The\nincident occurred on Wednesday\n27 November in a room in Beit\nHall, where the students were\nfound to be in possession of a small amount of the drug. Only\nfive of the students were actually\nBeit Hall residents; the other two\nstudents were apparently guests\nfrom other halls.\nAll seven students have since\nbeen individually interviewed by\nKen Weir, the head of College\nSecurity, and are to go before a Hall Tribunal today. Andy Heeps,\nICU President, will be present at\nthe hearing. The tribunal has the\npower either to fine the students or\nto expel them from their Halls. The\nmatter can also be referred to a College Disciplinary, which has the\npower to expel students from\nCollege. This, however, seems\nunlikely to happen in this case.\nAccording to the statement\ngiven to security by the students\nsaid, there had been an impromptu\ndecision to buy the drugs, which\nwere worth about \u00a310, and that\nthey had purchased them from the\nCovent Garden area of the West\nEnd. This has been the first college\noffence any of the students\ninvolved have committed.\nThe incident was apparently\nreported to the police, who preferred to let College deal with the\nmatter internally.\nIn an unrelated incident, two\nstudents were caught in similar circumstances in Linstead Hall last\nweek. It is not yet known what\naction will be taken against them.\nMANAGER COMES OUT OF HIS SHELL\nOn Tuesday 9 December, Tim\nLuca came to IC to talk to students\nabout career opportunities in\nShell. Mr Luca, who graduated\nfrom Imperial College in 1979 with\nMasters in Petroleum Engineering,\ndescribed Shell as the second\nbest-known brand name in the\nworld, with around 60 oil refiner-ies. He admitted that pressure\nfrom environmental groups has\nbeen put on Shell, mentioning the\nTowing Troll, which is the biggest\nman-made structure ever to be\nmoved across the face of the\nearth, and the Brent Spar. He also\ntalked about tensions between\nShell UK and Shell Germany. He\nsaid that as a consequence of\nEuropean and American distrust of\nShell, they now talk to people and\nask for help in improving the brand\nimage. When questioned about\ntheir activities in Nigeria, he called\nthe deaths \"sad\" and described\nNigeria as a \"difficult working environment\". He blamed the Nigerian\nGovernment for lines bursting and\noil spills, as they had cancelled\nmaintenance programmes for\nbeing too expensive. The ultimate\nresolution for the problems would\nbe for Shell to pull out, but he felt\nthat another company with lower\nstandards would take over, he\nclaimed\nFIRE LEAVES STUDENTS COLD The residents of Beit Hall were\nevacuated last week, after a note\nstuck on a door was set alight.\nSecurity evacuated the building\nafter the alarm went off in the\nnight, forcing students to huddle\nin Beit Quad in their dressing\ngowns. To further exacerbate the\nsituation, security guards then\nrefused to let anyone back into the\nbuilding until the culprit owned up.\nAfter ten minutes of waiting outdoors Rob Clarke, DP (FS^), used\nhis keys to allow the residents into\nthe Union Building. At this point\nSecurity relented and the irate students returned to the hall.\nKING'S BEHEADED The Union General Manager of\nKings College London (part of\nLondon University) has been suspended on full pay pending investigations into 'financial irregular i ties'. Tom Belton, Vice President\nand editor of the KCLSU student\nnewspaper, Roar, apologised for\nbeing \"cagey\" about the incident,\nbut told Felix that no other details\ncould be divulged until the en qi ry concludes.\nSOAS SUCCESS\nThe occupation of the School of\nOriental and African Studies'\nlibrary by students (Felix 1101) has\nended. Protesters voted last\nTuesday to accept a deal which\npromised over 500 more student\npasses to the main Senate House\ncollection, giving a total of 1000\npasses between 2500 students.\nThe vote was held in an emergency general meeting of the student union, and the deal was arbitrated by a representative from the\nAUT, The a gg ree ment also provided an amnesty for the protesters\nand extended opening hours. The\ncommittee also pledged to investigate further into the current system of library passes.\nCurrently, each London\nUniversity college has to pay \u00a370\nto Senate House for every student\nwishing to use the collection,\nwhich although extensive, does\nnot contain many scientific texts.\nImperial College students wishing\nto obtain a ticket should enquire in\nthe library.\nMORE BEER FOR\nYOUR MONEY Pub landlords could soon be\nforced to serve a full pint of beer\nand cider if a bill currently in\nParliament is successful. Under\nthe measure, oversize glasses with\na line marking a pint would\nbecome standard. At present, bars\nare only required to serve n in teen fluid ounces of liquid (a pint is\ntwenty fluid ounces), after pressure from brewers scuppered a similar bill two years ago.

The student unions of IC,\nthe London School of Economics,\nKing's and Queen Mary &\nWestfield Colleges all believe that\ntheir membership fee is not justified by their usage of ULU fac ili ties.\n\"Screw you\" were the words\nused by the King's College student\npaper Roar in reply to the 1% discount off their ULU subscription\noffered by the committee. Rob\nClark, ICU's Deputy President\n(Finance &. Services) questions\nwhether ULU provide \"value for\nmoney\" and believes that \"the current situation can be improved\".\nULU is situated in Malet Street\nwhere they provide a range of services and facilities ranging from\nstudent representation to bars and\nsports halls. This year the ICU bill\nfor ULU was in excess of \u00a390,000,\na sum chosen after a survey conducted three years ago. It is\nthought that the figures obtained in\nthis survey are no longer applicable\nand a new one should be conducted by an independent body; however nothing has changed as yet.\nAn indication of the inaccuracy of\nthe survey is the underestimate of\n46% ULU usage attributed to the\nclosest college, University College\nLondon.\nThe tone of Roar over the last\nmonth suggests that King's College\nLondon (KCL) is incensed by ULU's unwillingness to reduce their\n\u00a3108,000 bill.

    "content": "17 December 1997 COLUMNS 13\nPolitics was a different business in the sixteenth century.\nThen power lied in the hands\nof the very much unelected\naristocracy and church\nauthorities, with king in con-tro l. Political opponents of\nthe king could well find their\nheads on the block. One such\nexample was Cardinal Wolsey,\nwhose court was reputed to\nbe grander than Henry VIII's itself. Wolsey was one of the\nmost influential men of the\ntime, until he fell out of\nfavour with the king, his timely death probably saving him\nfrom a more public and\nhumiliating one.\nHow interesting\nthen that our Lord\nChancellor, Lord\nIrvine of Lairg,\ndecided to compare\nhimself with\nWolsey, as the\nbenevolent and\npowerful lord, overseeing his fellow\ncolleagues' work.\nThis was an after-dinner joke, but has\nbeen taken aboard\nby his 'fellow col-leagues' as accurately summing up\nhis behaviour. One Cabinet\nMinister said \"since May he\nhas been lording it, acting like\na medieval lord chancellor\nwho only has to report to King\nTony above everyone else\". He\nwas taken in for a little chat\nat Number 10, and was apparently given a friendly ticking-off. He has known the Prime\nMinister for over twenty\nyears, so it was likely that it\nwould have been more 'tick-ing-off and not a' bol locking'. One minister said \"his wings\nhave been clipped a little.\nThere have been some informal complaints and I understand Tony has had a friendly\nword in his ear. Because of\ntheir relationship, it won't be\na telling-off.\"\nSome may now be wondering\nwhat is the Lord Chancellor,\nand what is he doing in the\nCabinet. The Lord Chancellor\nis one of the oldest positions\nin government, and he is\neffectively the Speaker of the\nHouse of Lords. A lawyer or\njudge would usually hold the\npost, which is on appointment\nby the Prime Minister. As it is\nalways a peer, the position is\neffectively unelected. He is\nalso the direct boss of the\nLord Chief justice (the senior\ncriminal judge) and the\nMaster of the Rolls (the\nsenior civil judge). Essentially\nhe runs the country's legal\nsystem. Such an appointment\nis abomination to those who\nbelieve in the separation\nbetween government and judi-ciar y. Practically all new constitutions for countries enact\nthis separation, yet our system keeps it. It has worked\nfor the meantime because\neach holder of the post has\nseen it as his duty to keep out\nof the political limelight and\nrun his own department effectively. It has meant that the\npost is the linchpin between\nthe government and judiciary,\nwithout one affecting the\nother. Occasionally problems\narise, such as when a Conservative Lord Chancellor\nrebuked judges for ruling\nagainst the Government,\nsomething which they are perfectly entitled to do (it is incidentally, almost impossible\nto remove a judge - it requires\nan Act of Parliament - this is\nso that they can speak their\nmind without fear of reprisal,\nas is done in the US Supreme\nCourt, where judges can also\nnot be sacked).\nThe problem with Lord Irvine,\nthe present incumbent, is\npartly due to his inexperience\nin politics. Lord Simon, the\nbusinessman parachuted into\na government position by the\nPrime Minister, had similar\nproblems with not appreciating the subtler points of poli-tics. One of Lairg's allies recommended to him that he\ncurb his \"intimidating intel-lect\" and show \"a little more\ntact\". \"He is new to politics,\nand is finding out that you\ncan sometimes achieve more\nby taking people with you\nthan by being rude to them.\"\nOne might wonder if this was-n't a fairly basic principle of\nmanagement, which one may\nhave picked up before reaching one of the highest\nappointments in the Land, but\nnever mind. Other examples\nof either his ignorance or contempt of the political reality\nwas his \u00a3650,000 refurbishment of his own residence in\nthe Lords, the money coming\nout of the generous pocket of\nthe taxpayer. Irvine's response to public knowledge\nof his \u00a359,000 wallpapering\nbill (part of the refurbish-ment) was that \"my successors and public will thank me\nfor this\". This prompted a Guardian columnist to print\nhis personal office phone\nnumber, inviting readers to\ncongratulate him on his kindness to us all. One of the sadder tales concerning Lairg,\nwhere his past has very much\ncaught up with him, was his\npresent wife Alison, who left\nher previous husband Donald\nDewar, the present Secretary\nof State for Scotland, for him\nin 1970. Mr Dewar never married again, and the two men\nhave not spoken since.\nI would not want to go into\ntoo great a character assassination of someone I never\nmet, especially in my last column before Christmas, but\nIrvine's behaviour is at best\ngood news for column inches.\nWith all the reform of\nGovernment and Parliament\nthat Labour are intending to\nintroduce, a position such as\nthat of Lord\nChancellor is\nincreasingly hard\nto justify, even\nthough it has\nserved its purpose well enough\nso far (in the\nsame way as the\nHouse of Lords).\nWe may treat\nIrvine as an\nintelligent but\npolitically naive\nman,- whose\npower is at least\nconstricted - he\nknows he can never be given\nany other Government portfolio - and to give him credit his\nperformance in his job is\nwidely respected, but it also\nknown that he has received\nhis job because he was\nalready in the Lords and was\nthe Prime Minister's old\nfriend. He needs now to\ndemonstrate that he can be\nmore sensitive to his own col-leagues' and the public's con-cern s, for at the end of the\nday we all employ him as Lord\nChancellor, not his old friend\nTony.\nHamish Common\ni \u00ab 'mm\nWestminster\nEye\n\n"

Now, this is art e^? lo- j sive-reaction mixture\nmixed these two chel jg| als,\nYou see, he didn't need the\ninhibitor until he mixed up the\nchemicals.

So\nthere's no way to puss down this\ninformation But let's. Assume he\ninvents t jtf! inhibitor\nNow. is this a tremendous evolutionary success?

It explodes in the face\nof his enemy.\nHow did the beetle work this\nout by evolution. Let's assume that\nmillions of years ago, there was this\nlittle beetle. Let's call him Beetle\nBailey. And one day his mum and\ndad gave him a chemistry set for\nhis birthday, and so, down in the\nbasement laboratory, he was\nexperimenting. He mixed the solution of hydro quin one and hydrogen\nperoxide - and Boom! He blew\nhimself up and was splattered all\naround the walls of the laboratory\nand that was the end of Beetle\nBailey.\nWell, for hundreds of thousands of generations, millions of\nyears, these beetles were mixing\nup hydrogen peroxide and hydro-quin one and blowing themselves\nup. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\nFor thousands of generations.\nThen, for some strange reason,\none of them invents the inhibitor.\nsay. Now, here we are. We have\nthe two chemicals, the storage\nchambers, the inhibitor, the anti-inhibitor, and the combustion\nchambers. We're all set.\nNo, not quite.

    "content": "FEATURE 17th December 1997\nm It is a fact that the law courts,\nthe fine temples of justice, are\nadjacent to the food distribution\npoint for the homeless.\nWhilst barristers clad in wig and gown and\ndebate through the evening, a collection of\nshabby vans gather outside to hand out food. A small group congregates under the street lamps,\nsome sipping hot chocolate, while others making\njokes about students. Somewhere in the distance\nthe siren of a police car can be heard, suddenly\na taxi pulls round the corner, then flashes past\ninto the night. This is another evening and\nanother soup run.\nThe IC soup run is poorly named, as it\ninvolves neither soup nor physical exertion.\nRather volunteers gather each Tuesday and\nThursday evening, in the laundry of Weeks Hall\nto prepare tea, hot chocolate and sandwiches.\nMost weeks a mini-bus transports the volunteers, urns and sandwiches into central London;\nalthough on occasions no drivers can be found,\nso the pilgrimage is made on the tube.\nThe first stop is Lincolns Inn Fields, which is\nknown for the law courts and the headquarters\nof the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. However\nit is known amongst the homeless community\nas a food distribution point, where various charitable ventures hand out their cargo. The people\nwho assemble there are from many walks of life.\nSome are on shore leave from their ship, others\nlooking for work in London, most will be sleeping on the street. Generally it is easy to strike up\nconversation, lamenting the weather or mocking the excuse of a van we travel in. Some folk\nprefer to remain silent, others are vocal. Whilst\nthe barristers attempt to sway the jury, the gathering outside\nmumbles on.\nSubsequently\nthe party moves\non to the Strand,\nwhere people are\npreparing their\nblankets and\nsome already\ncurled up for\nwarmth. The urn\nof hot chocolate\nis carried up and down the length of the street,\ntogether with the remaining food. The 1C group\nis known by a number of the people on the\nStrand and greetings exchanged. An encounter\nwith an old acquaintance brings good news; he\nis now housed in Camberwell, as opposed to a theatre doorway. He still sells the Big Issue, but\nhis clean-shaven appearance and new shoes say\nit all. Then there is the old boy from Imperial\nCollege, sitting on a pile of empty bread crates.\nEach week he politely enquires which college\nwe are from; Royal College of Science, City &\nGuilds or Royal School of Mines. Each week we\ntell him and then he proceeds to tell us of his\ntime as an engineering lecturer. He is deaf on\naccount of an aircraft accident in the Second\nWorld War and at some point his house was\nconfiscated through some incident with the\ncommunists. Nobody is sure why.\nThe Strand is witness to every aspect of life.\nThe diners from Simpsons mingle with the audience for 'Chicago', the Savoy welcomes new\nguests in limousines, via their rear entrance. The\nneighboring Shell-Mex building accommodates\na few dozen people under the supporting arches.\nVery occasionally a cynic questions our presence, claiming that we know nothing about the\nstreets and are engaging in self-gratification.\nWhilst it is true that few of us have any comprehension of the hardships on the street, our\nmodest offerings are appreciated by the majority and hence the activity is worthwhile. Whether\nthe activity is self-gratifying or not, is a personal\nissue for each volunteer.\nAround 11 pm the bus returns to Weeks hall\nand the volunteers disperse.\nThe soup run begins at 8.15pm in the Weeks\nhall basement, every Tuesday and Thursday\nduring term time. There are other projects run\nby ICU Community Action Group. For information on these and the next soup run, view our\nhome page at www.su.ic.ac.uk/club socs/. The soup run needs blankets\nduring the winter. If you have\nspare ones please email us,\ncommunity. action@ ic.a c.uk "

    "content": "17 December 1997 INSOMNIA 19\niiI can't get no sleep.\nMethought I heard a voice cry,\n\"Sleep no more.\"\n(William Shakespeare.)\nRecently I 've had a bit of trouble getting to\nsleep. This isn't to be taken too lightly. Sleep is\nprobably the most important operation that we\nas humans have to perform, it is essential to our\nbeing. Some even say that it is actually our raison d'e tre When 1 was younger, I lived in\nGlasgow and had what can only\ndescribed as an utter n utter for a j doctor. He said that sleep was |\neveryone's natural state and when\nwe woke up, all we do is prepare\nfor sleep: Food helps us sustain\nour sleep. Ablutions are carried out\nso as not to disrupt sleep. Even\nthe acquisition of knowledge is\njust the collection of materials for\ndreams to be made out of. This is\nobviously rubbish (or is it?) but it\nwould be unwise to underestimate\nthe tremendous power of sleep. In\na way you could say it's like sex;\nit's taken for granted until it is\nabsent!\nI used to think an insomniac\nwas someone who never slept at\nall! It was someone who'd been\nmagically blessed, or even cursed,\nwith a lifetime of consciousness.\nIn fact, insomnia is a very broad\nterm and is simply defined as \"to experience\ndifficulties with the process of sleep.\" There are\nthree different types. Type A: Difficulty in going\nto sleep. Type B: Disturbed sleep. Type C: Early\nmorning arousal. This last type may sound like\n\"In a way you could say it's like\nsex; it's taken for granted until\nit is absent.\"\nfun but believe me, it's not what you think! I'm a Type A myself. Sometimes when it comes to\nthe time when I should really think about going\nto sleep, I'm wide-awake. I end up just wasting\ntime till the early hours of the morning: writing\nsongs, reading books, watching\namusing late night TV, sometimes\nI might even do a bit of work. 3am starts approaching and I start to\nfeel tired and eventually 1 nod off.\nBe-Beep! Be-Beep! Be-Beep!\nThe alarm goes off at half-seven. I feel heavy-limbed and very tired. 1\nstruggle to keep my eyes open\nbefore lunchtime (although lectures may play a part in this fac-tor) but by the afternoon I'm fine.\nAnd when it comes to around\nmidnight I'm feeling quite\nrefreshed and awake when I know that I should\nbe tired. The problem here is my biological clock\nand I have been told that all I have to do is force\nmyself to go to sleep at the appropriate time.\nThis appropriate time varies from individual to\nindividual. On average we get about seven hours\nsleep when we would probably like eight or\nmore. However, usually we only actually need\nabout six and a half. This being the case, 1\nshould be forcing myself to sleep by one in the\nmorning. That's all very well but how do 1 do\nthat? An uncle of mine always has a small glass\nof hot milk and whisky before he goes to bed\nand it seems to do the trick for him. Another\nsolution comes from a nineteenth century doc-tor: \" A very efficacious method of procuring\nsleep after lying awake for some time is to take\nin a small quantity of food, for example, a bis-cu it. This stimulates the digestive organs, draws\nthe excessive blood from the brain into the\nabdomen and speedy sleep is the result.\" Also\nin the nineteenth century, it was believed that\nstrong magnetic currents streamed between the\ntwo poles and by positioning the bed due north\nand south, you would receive the benefits of\nthese charges through sleep. Charles Dickens\nwas apparently a devotee of this theory.\nIn the end, though, the answer is whatever\nworks for you. However, if you do have problems sleeping, there are plenty of general suggestions for a better night's sleep. You can control both your external and internal environment.\nFor example, do you get to sleep quicker with a small light on or do you have to have total dark-ness? Does coffee make you drowsy or does it\nwake you up? You can control your mental state.\nSometimes the source of sleepless nights is\nemotional stress (Or is it the other way round?)\nso off loading worries by writing them down\nbefore you go to bed is a very\ngood idea. This is actually what I do now and I find that I can get to\nsleep much quicker when I haven't got anything on my mind.\nTry and get into a regular sleep\npattern. I appreciate that this is\nimpossible once the weekend\narrives but good sleepers are regular sleepers who have their biological clocks running efficiently.\nUse your imagination. This is possibly the most powerful method of\nall. If you find yourself worrying\nabout future difficulties and\ncaught in a \"vicious circle of\nthoughts\" then try to remember a time when you were happy or the\nlast time you found something\nhilariously funny. You will now be\nin a better state to relax and therefore sleep. Finally, if all else fails,\nbore yourself to sleep. We've all\nheard of counting sheep but try recalling those\nmind-numbing integration rules. When your\nbrain is given the choice of this or sleep, you'll\nfind that it soon surrenders to the daily lapse of\n\"An uncle of mine always has a small glass of hot milk and\nwhisky before he goes to bed\nand it seems to do the trick for\nhim.\nconsciousness.\nSo. Sleep. It takes up about a third of our\nlives. It accompanies both the beginning and the\nend of our day. A relaxing night in the sack can\nsometimes mean the difference\nbetween a good and a bad day.\nSleep is the drug that we are all\ndependent upon. Occasionally\nbetter than sex and definitely less\ntiring. Choose life? Choose sleep!\nGood night.\nWords by Dennis.\nIllustrations by Matt Wright.\n\n"

    "content": "17 December 1997 OBITUARY\nIC \"Heretic\" Dies on NASA Project\nANDY SINHARAY\nProfessor Eric Laithwaite, Emeritus Professor\nof Electrical Engineering, died last month. He\nwas 76.\nBorn in Lancashire, Prof Laithwaite was best\nknown as one of Britain's first 'media engineers'\nfor his work in heavy electrical engineering,\nprincipally on the linear motor. As one of IC's most prolific academics - he had made around\n300 publications - Prof. Laithwaite was known\nto television viewers in the 1950's and later\ndesigned the world's first magnetic levitation\ntrains. He left Imperial after 22 years in 1986\nand continued his work at Sussex University,\nthough not without first causing controversy;\nthe scientific establishment was stunned when\nhe demonstrated gyroscopic devices that\nappeared to defy gravity at a lecture at the\nRoyal Institution.\nProf. Bob Spence of the Electrical\nEngineering Department, told Felix that \"I knew\nhim very well... I knew he was a brilliant in nova tor.\" However, Prof. Spence felt that Prof.\nLaithwaite's departure from IC had been sensational is ed by the media, The Times in particular\nsaying that Laithwaite had left five years than he\nactually did, \"pretty much in disgrace.\" Prof.\nSpence points out that Laithwaite was made a Fellow of Imperial College (FIC) some years\nafter his departure \"so the college valued him...\nProfessor Eric Laithwaite FIC, 1921 - 1997.\nPhoto: Neville Miles\nI think he may have found Sussex University\nmore convenient being closer to home.\"\nAs regards his work on gyroscopes, he told\nFelix, \"It was a significant part of what he did...\nhe was an extrovert, and said things [to school-children] like You shouldn't believe everything\nyour physics teacher tells you'... We need people like that.\" In 1994 the BBC screened a documentary on his gyroscope work; the series was\ncalled Heretics. \"We need people like that,\" Prof\nSpence added, going onto say that Prof\nLaithwaite would always be remembered as one\nof the three who made their mark on the\nElectrical Engineering Department, the other\ntwo being Dennis Cabor, Nobel laureate, and\nColin Cherry, professor of telecommunications.\nDespite extensive work in the field of electric linear motors, many believe that his career\nwas harmed by the gyroscope work which flew\nin the face of accepted wisdom; some believe\nthat he would have become a Fellow of the\nRoyal Academy of Engineering and the Royal\nSociety had he not upset the establishment.\nFelix has learned that as recently as 1994, a stu-dent, working on gyroscopes as part of his\nAeronautics course, was pointedly told by one\nof his lecturers not to per sue further inquiries\ninto Laithwaite's work.\nAlthough a controversial character, the force\nof Laithwaite's other work and his personality\nwill remain un dimmed.\" I was terribly sad,\" one\nof Laithwaite's associates said, \"I met him in\nSeptember; he was a wonderful storyteller.\"\nProf. Spence described him as \"outstanding\".\nHe was working on a linear motor-based launch\nproject for NASA when he died.\nInterviews will\nbe held here\non Wednesday\n13th January\n1998.\nThe 12-month programme kicks off with intensive classroom-based training comprising product, market and\nsystems training designed to prepare Associates for a series of trading and sales rotations in the London\ntrading room.

OK, so a lot of\nstudents don't get the\nopportunity to drive, so it\ndoesn't matter if they're\ngetting more drunk, (and\nmore often) than usual.\nOr does it? Christmas-time\nis a great excuse to go out\nand get be ered up, but how\noften does anyone think\nabout the consequences?\nOK, I know most of you\nthink you've heard it all\nbefore, but in the hope of\nmaking some of you think,\nhere goes again...\nDrinking alcohol is a fun\nthing to do and if you\nchoose not to drink too\nmuch you should be safe,\nand have a good time\n(unless you get hurt by\nsomeone else who has\nbeen drinking too much).\nBut what happens if you do\ndrink too much? It isn't really much of a surprise\nthat young people often\nhave their early (and\nlater!!) sexual experiences\nwhen under the influence\nof alcohol, nor that a lot of\npregnancies in young people occur as a result of\nhaving unprotected sex\nwhilst drunk. How many\nyoung people wake up in\ntheir first police cell with a hangover? It's also really\nimportant not to mix drinking with other legal or illegal drugs.\nIf you mix alcohol with\nother depressant drugs you\nrisk falling into a coma.\nFun. If you are then sick in\nyour sleep you can choke\non your own vomit and die\nof asphyxiation. Even\nmore fun. No, really.\nSome other fun facts about\nalcohol that you may or\nmay not know, but probably don't really think about\n-Alcohol reaches the\nBRAIN within 5 minutes\nof being swallowed.\n-Alcohol is a DEPRESSANT drug that slows\ndown the activity of the\nbrain - you only THINK\nthat you can study better\nafter a drink - it's an ill u sion.\n- Eating before drinking\nslows down the rate at\nwhich alcohol has its\neffects.\n- Fizzy drinks increase the\nspeed at which alcohol is\nabsorbed into the body.\n-Alcohol affects women\nmore quickly than it does\nmen, and the effects last\nlonger, so don't go trying\nto compete with the lads,\ngirls. It's not sensible, and\nyou'll probably regret it -especially if you wake up\nto find a particularly dod gy specimen in your bed!\n- The lighter your body\nweight the greater the\neffects of alcohol (part of\nthe reason why it affects\nwomen more - the rest is\ndue to percentage of water\nin the body - men have a greater percentage which\ndilutes the alcohol more).\n- There is no safe limit for\ndrinking and driving.\nEven at the legal limit,\nyoung drivers are five\ntimes more likely to have\nan accident than non-drinkers.\n- Alcohol affects our sense\nof right or wrong BEFORE\nit affects our co-ordination\n- think about that police\ncell, or that moose you\npulled when you were off\nyour face last weekend.\n- 18-24 year olds are the\nheaviest drinkers in the\npopulation.\n- men who drink regularly at unsafe levels risk\nimpotence and infertility.\n(Although that might be a good thing in some cases!)\n- People often say that\nalcohol makes them feel\nsexy - members of the\nopposite sex may disagree.\n- Alcohol is loaded with\ncalories so it can make\nyou FAT. How sexy do\nyou feel with that huge\nbeer-belly?\n- People who drink too\nmuch in an evening may\nsill be over the legal limit\nfor driving the next morn-ing.\n- It takes the liver one\nhour to break down one\nunit of alcohol.\n- There are 2 'cures' for\nhangovers:\n1. TIME\n2. Don't drink enough to\nhave one in the first place\nA short quiz to help you\ndecide if your drinking is\nbecoming a problem\n1. Do you drink because\nyou have problems? or to\nface up to a stressful\nsituation?\n2. Do you drink when you\nget mad at other people,\nyour friends or parents?\n3. Do you often prefer to\ndrink alone, rather than\nwith others?\n4. Are you starting to get\nlow marks? Are you\nski ving off college?\n5. Do you ever try to stop\ndrinking, or drink less and\nfail?\n6. Have you begun to drink\nin the morning before\ncollege?\n7. Do you gulp down your\ndrinks as if to satisfy a great thirst?\n8. Do you ever have black-outs, or periods of time you\ncannot account for when\ndrinking?\n9. Do you avoid being honest with others about your\ndrinking?\n10. Do you ever get into\ntrouble when you are\ndrinking?\n11. Do you often get drunk\nwhen you drink, even if\nyou don't mean to?\n12. Do you think it\nadmirable to be able to\nhold your drink?\nYour answers to these\nquestions are your own\nbusiness, but if you can\nanswer \"yes\" to any of\nthese questions, maybe it's time you took a serious\nlook at what drink might\nbe doing to you.\nThink about it - it's easy to\ndismiss the effects of\nalcohol by putting it in the\n\"it'll never happen to me\"\ncategory. But think about\nthat accident in the lab\nafter lunchtime drinking\n(or the test you didn't do so\nwell in), the lectures\nmissed, exams failed, relationships broken and arguments caused by the socalled \"sociability\" of\nalcohol.\nOK, lecture over now -Have a Merry Christmas\neveryone, enjoy\nyourselves, but try and be\nsensible.\n\n"

By persecuting the\n\"heretical\" theologians and scientists they were trying to maintain\nthe status quo to protect their own\ninterests (i.e. power and wealth),\nGod hardly had a look-in in their\nconsiderations. The reformation\nprovided the impetus for many\nchanges, without which we would\nnot be able to study in the way that\nwe can now.\nBy ignoring the reformation,\nMatteo Floris has failed to understand the motivation of people like\nGalileo. He believed in a Relational,\nCreator God, a God of the \"First\nCause\", the proof he needed was\nall around him in nature (it still is),\nand in the Bible. Galileo therefore\ndidn't have to waste time asking\nun-answerable questions, such as\n\"Why?\", but could get on with\nmuch more relevant questions such\nas \"How?\". Today, as a Christian in\nscience I( and plenty of others)\nbelieve that the answer to \"why?\" is\nthe same as it was 400 million\nyears ago, never mind just 400.\nThis means that I can study and ask\nthe \"how?\" questions based on the\ncertainty that God was there in the\nbeginning, that he is here now, and\nthat he will cot it in ue to be there in\nthe future.\nRichard Stunt\nMSc Immunology, RPMS\nCHARLIE BAITING\nDear Felix\nFollowing the ICU Council\nmeeting on Tuesday night it is obvious that DP for Clubs and Societies\nCharlie Joynt has gone against his\nelection manifesto, no longer\nexpressing support for dual entry to\nBUSA. He has shown that he is not\na man of his word and I hereby,\nand I stress that this is my personal opinion, call for him to resign.\nChris Solberg,\nICUAFC First Team Captain\nDear Felix\nI was disappointed yesterday at\nIC Council (9 Dec), when the issue\nof BUSA entry was discussed, to\ndiscover the U turn in Charlie\nJoynt's( DP C&S) opinion of the\nwhole matter. Having sat through\nthe three ICU Hustings at St\nMary's, Charing Cross and South\nKensington to listen to Charlie\nagreeing to back dual entry in to\nBUSA I find it unbelievable that he\nopenly advocated single entry at\nthis council meeting. Had I, and I imagine ICSM realised that he was,\nin fact lying to us ( a common ploy\nhe must have picked up from past\nICU sabbatical presidents) I don't believe he would have received any\nof our votes.\nHe is a fortunate man that to be\nremoved from his position there\nneeds to be a two-thirds majority\nvote at IC Council. If there was any\nother way to remove Mr Joynt from\nhis position without going through\nthis farcical committee, 1 believe he\nwould soon be without a job. He\nmay at this point wish to reconsider his position on the 1CU Exec.\nYours sincerely\nLouise Moran, St Mary's Dear Sir,\nThe result that decided the 'sin-g le entry' policy in to BUSA was an\nextremely tight one - by 20 to 18\nwith 2 abstentions ( basically exactly 50% wanted to follow this\ncourse) and now due to the decisions of 20 people there will no\nlonger be medical teams playing at\nImperial from the start of the next\nacademic year.\nThe council is there to represent the views of all the students\nat Imperial and yet midway through\nthe discussions one member of the\ncouncil was heard to comment\nthat, 'this is just another case of\nmedics wanting there own way'.\nThis was not about medics versus\nnon-medics, this was about making\nsure that everyone at Imperial who\nwants to play competitive sport,\nagainst other universities, was able\nto do so on a Wednesday after-noon. Now whatever the great\nemperor Eric Allsop (1 thought he\nwas no longer President) says\nabout this matter of numbers the\nfact remains that there are now\ntwelve to fifteen teams of foot-ball ers, seven to eight teams of\nrugby players, and about fourteen\nteams of hockey players (men and\nwomen) and yet Eric, in his ultimate\nwisdom, is sure that all those who\ndon't get to play in the THREE\nteams entering BUSA on a Wednesday will get games else-where. 1 for one will not be applying for the position of fixture secretary in any of these clubs next year.\nSport at university is for every-one, it is not just for the elite who\nwill bring so called good publicity to\nthe college and so push us further\nup the league tables. 1 don't care if\nwe are not good enough to beat\nLoughborough and Nottingham as\nseparate teams, but I do care that\neveryone who wants to, from a fourth team footballer at IC to a third team netball er at St. Mary's, gets the chance to play competitive, inter-university sport at\nImperial. I find the fact that this\nelitist proposal was put forward by\nhardly the greatest sportsman ever\nparticularly galling.\nAs to the argument that it will\nraise the standards, in most sports\nthis is just absolute crap, because\nin most sports Imperial or Imperial\nMedics are considerably better\nthan the other. For example the\nstandard of the first XV will not be\nraised at all because not one single\nnon-medic will get in the team. On\nthe other hand, no squash player\nfrom St Mary's, and possibly from\nCharing Cross, will get in the\nsquash team at Imperial which is of\nan extremely high standard. In\nmost cases it is like merging\nManchester United and Scunthorpe\nand hoping for an increase in the\nstandard of play from the best\neleven players. It just isn't going to\nhappen.\nTo finish, I find it mildly ironic\nthat the lasting legacy of Eric\nAllsop, who seemed to always push\nfor unity and co-operation between\nthe non-medics and medics at\nImperial, will be to create a divide\nand level of animosity that hasn't been seen since I arrived two and a half years ago, and probably a long\ntime before that. And to all those\non council who believe\nthat this is 'one up' for\nthe non-medics, believe\nme, we haven't even\nstarted yet.\nYours\nOliver Warren, ICSM\nREFERENDUM?\nDear Felix,\nI writing to thank all the people\nwho attended ICU Council on Tues\n9th December. It is refreshing to\nsee people taking an interest in 1CU affairs.\nThe debate was a good one\nwith valid arguments on both sides,\nwhich was reflected in the voting.\nHowever, I feel as this is such\nimportant issue for all Imperial\nCollege students they should all\ndirectly have a say in the decision.\nThis would be most appropriately\napproached in the form of a college wide refer and um. Most importantly this would give the sports players a chance to help decide their own\nfate rather the a commit te were\nonly approx. 30% had ever played a BUSA match. Do you have any\ncomments?\nYours sincerely\nKatie Armstrong\nPresident, ICSM Students'\nUnion\nr HAIRSALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS\n\u00a315 LADIES\n\u00a313 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "
