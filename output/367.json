Everyone\nwas unanimous that the Swan\nArcade concert was an unqualified success.\nWe were happy \u2014 No, this\nis not the Queen writing \u2014 to\nwelcome back Tim Brookes \u2014\na previous Folk Club Secretary \u2014 and Mike Peale \u2014\nan erstwhile Publicity Officer\nof the aforementioned wonderful\nsociety. Both of these did\nregular floor spots last year.\nTim sang several of his own\ncompositions. Mike sang songs\nfrom his native Geordieland,\nso I couldn't understand a word \u2014 which on some occasions was a good thing \u2014\nI'm too young to hear such\nlurid lyrics. However, the\ntunes were good but they\ndidn't help us breathe more\neasily \u2014 it was stifling in\nthere. (Sorry about that pun\nbut what can you expect after\nN Guinnesses? Guinni??).\nBack to the subject, Mikes's ghost song 'If only my mummy\nhad told me, but she was too\nwrapped up to care \u2014 think\nabout it', was a very amusing\nspectre cle. Sorry \u2014 I'm good\nat bad puns.\nSwan Arcade - a Yorkshire\nband \u2014 described themselves:\n'We used to be a folk group,\nbut now we're a bit different\nfrom what we were'. They\nplay electric traditional folk-if such a thing exists. On the\nwhole, they were very popular-even if a certain lady did\nplunge them into darkness for\nthe duration of one song.\nOh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to\ndig \u2014 but it was a stupid thing\nto do. The group did one\nencore and despite cries of\n'encore de encore' - cringe -finished at 11.00 prompt.\nHurray! Folk club finished on\ntime for once. On a more\nserious note (B flat for\nexample) would our members\nplease note that NO glasses\nare allowed in the refectory.\nThank You.\nI think it's about time I finished burbling on aimlessly and went to the bar -No, I didn't say that, I really\nmeant go and do some work \u2014\n(that's my story and I'm sticking to it, until I can\nthink up a better one).\nJAZZ CLUB\nN.V. Morrison\nSUNDAY nights can be the\nmost boring and depressing\ntime of the week, with nothing\nto look forward to and precious\nlittle on television. That's why, under the a usp ics of IC\nJazz Club, Sunday sessions\nwere introduced to provide a wide range of music at a price\nwe can all afford, i.e. it's free!\nThese not to be missed\nevents, are held in the Union\nlower lounge and usually start\nabout 8.30p.m. The music\nranges from rock through blues\nto ragtime and even Jazz and\nis mostly provided by amateur\nor semi-pro' bands with the\nodd big name amongst them.\nNext Sunday we will feature\nan entertaining little Trad,\ngroup called 'Tyger' band, so\npull up a pint and pop in.\nLast Sunday (20th October),\n'Inspector Lloyd', a highly\nproficient Blues-rock band,\nwho featured Paul Goose on\ndrums, were our guests. They\nplayed a mixture of blues\nclassics, such as John Mayall's 'The Bear' and their own\nmaterial. The musicianship,\nparticularly of the bassist and\ntenor sax player, was of a very\nhigh order and was well\nappreciated by an almost\ncapacity audience.\nThis space\nis empty.\nDiscuss.\nEXORCISM, MYSTICISM\nand JUDAISM\nTuesday 5th November. 1.10p.m. Mech.

    "content": "12ben LAST YEAR postgraduates all over the country campaigned\nfor \u00a32 per hour for demonstrating in practicals because that was\nconsidered to be a fair rate for the job. At IC the campaign was\nstrong and a satisfactory agreement with the College was reached.\nBasically that agreement was that we be paid \u00a32 per hour for\nsession 74/75, with that rate tied to the lower end of the lecturers\npay scale, subject to any national agreement. (If we had had this\nagreement in 73/74, the rate for 74/75 would have been \u00a32.27\nby the way). However there was one unsatisfactory aspect,being\nthat of tutorials which too are to be paid at \u00a32.00 per hour \u2014\nwhich we considered to be ridiculous.\nHowever, now all that\nnow all that is\npassed. There has not been a national agreement, but a national dictate from the\nCVC P.AC V CP committee\nconsisting of our own Sir\nBrian, the Secretary of\nEdinburgh University (where\nthey have had demonstrating\nrate campaigns culminating\nin a strike) and two other\nvice-chancellors have made\na report. In fact, it is a very\ngood report, it recommends the\nrate be tied to the lecturers\npay scale and several other\nthings we've been asking for.\n?lu t it does recommend an\nour ly rate including preparation time for demonstrating\nat a minimum of \u00a31.50 and for\ntutorial a minimum of \u00a32.70.\nIn itself this is fine, it is a question ' of interpretation.\nThe report has been\ninterpreted by the,University\nof London Collegiate Council\nwhich has made the following\nrecommendations:\n1) Demonstrating rate including\npreparation time shall be\n\u00a31.50 per hour;\n2) Tutorial rate including\npreparation time shall be\n\u00a32.70 per hour.\n3) These rates shall be\nreviewed annually.\nThe Collegiate Council's report has in turn been\ninterpreted by the College.\nSir Brian Flowers verbally\ntold us of the College's position when asked at Union\nCouncil about the tutorial rate.\n1) No postgraduates may give\ntutorials at IC, therefore\n\u00a3 5 0 , 0 0 0\nTHE RENT STRIKE FUND at Birmingham University now\nstands at a total of jn st over \u00a350,000.\nSources there say the size of this sum is obviously worrying\nthe University, who are reported to be trying all the tricks in the\nbook to entice people to pay their rent to them and not into the\nRent Fund.\nOne reaction has been for a hall manager to instruct the\ncleaning staff to tighten\nenforcement of the hall rules.\nThis means people with 'illegal\nguests' 'will be reported,\nstudents must ' be out by\n9.30p.m., and no extra items of\nfurniture will be allowed. This\nis rumoured to include stereo\nsystems.\nAs yet the only real concession from the University\nhas been that the late payment\nfee of \u00a32 will not be levied\nuntil the November review has\ntaken place. This is no\nconcession to the demands of\nthe Birmingham Students\nUnion.\nIt is hoped that the Rent\nStrike Fund total will soon\nreach the target of \u00a370,000.\nMARGATE CONFERENCE:\nPapers for NUS delegation\nwill come down on Tuesday.\nNominations Wanted.\nno-one need be paid for them.\n2) Qur \u00a32 per hour for demonstrating will not be cut\n(big deal!) but it will not go up\neither, until the \u00a31.50 we\nwould have had, increasing\nannually, reaches \u00a32. In other\nwords, over the next few years\nthe value of our demonstrating\nearnings will be cut by 25%\ndue to inflation.\nIt will be remembered that\nmost postgraduates were\nearning \u00a31.50 in session\n72/73. We have had at least\n30% inflation since then.\nYou may be thinking that\nwell, at least the College has\nkept the Postgraduate Group\nin the picture. But that is not\ntrue. We have only heard about\nthe report of the CVCP and\nthe Collegiate Council through\nthe Students' Union of another\nLondon College. That is not\ngood enough. It makes student\nrepresentation a farce when\nthey are not told of the final\ndecisions. I have no doubt we\nwould not have heard to this\nday if we had not had the\ninformation from elsewhere.\nNow it is quite true that the\nactual number of hours\ndemonstrating is likely to be\ncut quite drastically in the\nnear future due to economies\nin the College. Although that\nis to be opposed, the actual\nrate should not be allowed to\nfall as a consequence. If that\nwere to happen when the money\nsupply improved, the whole\ncampaign would have to start\nagain.\nI will end with some\nquestions which must be\nanswered:-1) Why have the 'minima' of the\nCVCP report become the\n'maxima' of the Collegiate\nCouncil report and the targets\nfor this College?\n2) Why is there not at least a London Weightingonthe minima?\n3) Is not the \u00a31.50 as arbitrary\na figure, if not more so, than\nthe \u00a32.00 the students and the\nAUT consider to be fair?\n4) Perhaps this is the most\nimportant question. If the\nCollege believes in student\nrepresentation, in return is it\nnot fair that we be kept\ninformed of decisions made at\nCollege level which affect us?\nIs not the present system of\nrepresentation a farce?\nMix\n25th gn n to er js arp WILL BE ON FRIDAY, 6TH DECEMBER, 1974.

From the\nstart IC were on the attack but\nunfortunately did not have the\nability (or luck) to add that\nfinal touch to many well worked\nmoves. The inevitable goal\ncame from a Bob Middleton\nshort corner shot. UC, although\nsomewhat subdued and muddled\nin defence, looked dangerous\non the break and it was from\none of these that their equalise r came.\nIn the second half more\npressure was mounted by IC\nand what proved to be the\nwinning goal came from a cunning short corner deflection\nby Trevor 'Superstar' Tutu.\nSoon after Mr. Clarke missed a penalty kick leaving the final\nscore 2-1, although a certain\nleft winger who shall remain\nnameless, although his real\nname is Jay Bashar, thought\nwe had drawn 1-1 (zzz zz!).

Bashar.\nShirley Fairweather\nOn Wednesday 23rd October,\nthe IC Ladies Hockey Team\nsallied forth for their first\nleague match, vs King's College. The nine members\nfj jt a ying tried hard against the\nfierce opposition. We seemed\nevenly matched until half-way\nthrough the first half, when a hard ball, destined to miss the\ngoal, was unfortunately\ndeflected by an IC stick into\nher home goal. The question\nof her resignation is not under\nreview.\nHavin g chomped our oranges,\nwe began the second half bent\non revenge. Consequently,\nKing's scored on their own\nwithin a few minutes. Webegan\nto redress the balance with a goal scored by Janet, but\nafter a series of corners, an\naccurate shot from King's sped\nthrough our defence. (Fluke).\nIC broke free several times,\nbut never succeeded in scoring\nagain.\nThe result, 3-1 to King's was disappointing, but hopefully they are our strongest opposition in the ULU League.\nWe are desperately short of\nplayers \u2014 especially a goalkeeper (who could have saved\nall those goals).

After this encouraging\nstart we commenced battle with the opposition, nine men against\neight, with one of their men as referee. Surbiton were working\nwell, and were soon '1-0' up -gloom! But this was not to\nlast long as the 'intrepid\nfootballer*', one of our five\nnovices, scored a beautiful\ngoal to equalise. This was\nfollowed by another good goal\nby Andy Hall, from a short\ncorner. '2-1* up \u2014 hooray!\nThe second half saw a bit\nof team rearrangement, due\nto the appearance of three\nmembers of the IC 2nd XI.\nMost of the second half was\nhence played with ten\n'Surbitons' to our nine, and\ntwo umpires courtesy of IC.\nAfter a bad patch, we found\nourselves '3-2' down \u2014 gloom\nagain!

ENG. 220 AT 6-30pm Ijinduraj Expedition\nColin Brown AN Imperial College expedition \u2014\nColin Brown, Bruce Hooker, Harry\nHooker, Neville Jordison, Bruce Littlewood and Rob Wild \u2014 climbed for five\nweeks in the Koyo Zom group at the\nhead of the Chitral Valley, NE! Pakistan\nin July/August, 1974. Permission from\nthe authorities to climb Thur II (21,401 ft)\nwas refused at the eleventh hour hence\nour knowledge of the Koyo Zom group\nand its main peak Koyo Zom (22,545 ft)\nwas sparse.\nWe left London on June 17th with all\nfood and equipment in an Austin K9\nex-army wagon, and drove almost nonstop to Islamabad in Pakistan. The\njourney across Europe and Middle-East\nAsia has sections of remarkable contrast -the lush Alpine scenery and the arid\ndeserts of Afghanistan, the monotonous\nroute through Iran and the impressive\nroads over the Jalalabad and Khyber\nPasses, etc. Nevertheless, we were\npleased to arrive at Chitral town, the\nlast large administrative town up the\nvalley.\nFrom Chitral, we hired jeeps to\ntransport us and our gear to the road-head, seventy miles further on. The\n'road', a tortuous dirt-track winding its\nway along the side of the River Yarkhun,\nquickly degenerated into a mere footpath.\nAt this point we hired porters and\ndonkeys for the 112 mile walk to our\nproposed base-camp at the tiny village\nof Pechus. Eight gruelling. days later\nwe arrived. We had left the realities of\nthe 'civilised' world. After two weeks\nreconnaissance on the Ghatlboi, Pechus\nand Koyo Glaciers, it was agreed that a high camp at 16,650 ft on the Pechus\nGlacier should be established for an\nattempt on the east ridge of Koyo Zom\nand several adjacent peaks of over\n20,000 ft.\nOn August 6th, Bruce L and Rob\nmade the first ascent of a snow peak\n(19,800 ft) to the east of Koyo Zom.\nThe weather was fairly predictable,\ntwo or three days of low cloud and snow\nevery five days, and so the attempt on\nKoyO Zom was planned with this in mind.\nOn August 16th, Bruce H. and Harry\nretreated from the east ridge after a lightweight attempt from the second\nhigh camp (19,500 ft) on the upper\nplateau of the glacier. The next day,\nRob and Bruce L. bivouacked at 21,000 ft\nand reached the summit at 15.00 hours\non August 18th after'two days of mixed\nsnow and rock climbing. Their descent\nwas made more interesting by a200 ft\nfall at 22,000 ft when Bruce slipped\nand plucked Rob's belay from the rock.\nFortunately the rope jammed and they\nmanaged to descend without serious\ninjury. At the upper plateau, they met\nthe Hooker twins who had just climbed\ntwo neighbouring 20,000 ft peaks. All\nfour descended to the first high camp\nwhere Colin and Nev. were waiting\nafter an unsuccessful attempt on a nearby rock peak.\nWe struck base-camp on August 23rd and walked the 100 miles to the road-head in glorious sunshine, sampling\nthe abundant variety of fruit which\ngrows freely, at the roadside. The rest\nof the journey to London followed the\nsame pattern as the journey outwards\nwith however, a few more stops at\nKabul, Istanbul and other interesting\nparts of the world. We eventually arrived\nat Ramsgate to be greeted by our first\nserious rain for fourteen weeks.\n\n"

    "content": "J FiLIJ\nPRE C3P3C E THE WEEKEND before last was\ntaken up by the now-notorious Executive\nweekend. We spent two days discussing\nthe major areas of the Union's work in\nbroad terms and trying to work out the\nbest courses for the Union to take,\nwhich areas needed special attention\nand so on. It is, perhaps, worthwhile\nto make the point that the four non-sabbatical members of the Executive\nwere prepared to spend these two days\nin this way, and to take a full part in\nthe discussion and to contribute as\nmuch as the full-timers. I am particularly\npleased that the CCU Presidents are\ndetermined to play a positive role\nwithin the Executive, rather than leaving\neverything to the two sabbatical officers,\nand without neglecting their CCU duties.\nOne of the major areas that we hope\nto pay special attention to is that of\nAcademic Affairs; it is surprising that\nsuch a central issue to students, that\nis, the actual mechanics of education\nand training, the kind of courses\nprovided, and the kind and standard of\nteaching, has been so totally neglected\nby the central bodies and figures in the\nUnion, over the past few years. The\ndrive to diversify courses, and to give\nthe opportunity for more non-technical\nstudies has stopped, at least from\nwithin the Union.\nIt is now time to change that state\nof affairs, as I indicated in my PreciPice\nin the Freshers' issue of FELIX.\nClearly, given the Rector's comments\nin respect of University finance, the\nCollege will be constrained by the\nlack of money. However, the Planning\nCommittee is now trying to work out\nthe College's submission to the\nUniversity Grants Committee, for the\nnext 'five-year plan'. I think that it is\nright for us to start now, generating\ndiscussion and deciding the way that\nstudents wish to see the College going.\nIn terms of academic development, I believe that many students would like\nto see major emphasis placed on\nexpanding Associated and Interdisciplinary Studies (AIDS). The last\nmeeting of the AIDS Committee did\nreview the history and discuss the\nfuture of AIDS. It seems that Associated\nStudies, that is, courses involving\ndisciplines not taught in the College,\n(Economics, for example) are being\ntaken up by more and more students.\nI am glad to see that an expansion in\nthe field of languages is envisaged.\nI hope that this will encompass the\ncustoms and culture of other countries;\nwhat use is a mere mechanical knowledge of a language for true con:\nmuni cation? In the interdisciplinary field, however,\nwhen one disregards the 'service'\ncourses, for example Maths tor Biologists,\none is left with almost no courses that\n'illustrate the unity and inter-relation\nof knowledge'. The one example that\nimmediately springs to mind is 'En-vi rome nt and Man', and perhaps, the\nprojected 'Energy Studies'. What I hope\nto see developing is more courses, like\nthese, which tackle a specific scientific\nand/or technological topic, in an\nintellectually stimulating way, drawing\nupon two or more disciplines for their\ncourse material. Perhaps in this way,\nwe can provide alternatives to a few of\nthe narrow, uninspiring courses which\nexist in all departments.\nAs important to every student as\nwhat he learns, is how he learns. I understand that there are now efforts\nafoot to do something about the standards of teaching by making a requirement for a lecturer's appointment that\nhe undergo an approved course in\nteaching methods. About time, I reckon.\nHowever, the length and standards\nsuggested seem woefully inadequate to\nme. In the week or two, which appears\nto be the norm, only the most superficial\naspects of delivery and technique can\nbe covered. What is really needed is a course extending over a term or a year,\ncovering the theory of education,\nteaching methods, use of audio-visual\naids, and university administration.\nThe dual function of the College as\nboth an institution of instruction and\ndiscovery, of teaching and research\nmust always be kept in mind; whilst I do not subscribe to the view that all\nmembers of staff must necessarily teach\nTrevor Phillips as well as do research, I believe that\nwe must work to make Imperial College\nfulfil both its educational roles to the\nfull.\nThe Rector, on Commemoration Day,\nmade several comments in respect of\nstudent grants, which I welcome. I am\npleased, not so much by what he said,\nas by the fact that, unlike many ViceChancellors, he has not been afraid to\nspeak out in favour of students'\ninterests.\nIn his speech the Rector recognised\none of the crucial problems that we\ncontinue to fight through the Grants\nCampaign \u2014 that the new levels of\ngrants have 'been considerably eroded\nalready by inflation', and that one effect\nof this erosion has been that 'universities\nthemselves have been forced to raise\nsubstantially those rents and refectory\ncharges on which Government funded\nsubsidies are not permitted'.\nThese words, I think, contradict the\nRector's hope, expressed earlier, that\nthe question of grants would not prove\nto be a 'significant factor' this year.\nThey rather point to ah intensified and\nstronger campaign, which will concentrate on the effects of the cuts in\nthe education budget, and the aspects\nof the grants system about which we,\nlike the Rector 'are not satisfied'.\nAnd I think immediately of the triple\ninjustices of the means test (both\nparental and spouses'), the discrimination against married women, and\ndiscretionary awards.\nThe Rector identified a target of\n\u00a3100 rise in the next grants award; this\nis too low to keep pace with 20%\ninflation. However, we applaud the\nfact, that he has put a real figure on\nhis words of support for the second\nyear running.\nThe Grants Campaign Week of Action\nis-November 1l th15 th, with a Day of\nCross-Binary Action of the 13th, and a National Day of Action, in clu d in qa demo on Friday the 15th.

    "content": "14\nFitlX\nCONCERTS Richard War ing Wishbone Ash 4- Upp, at the Rainbow.\nWHEN Ted Turner left Wishbone Ash\na couple of months ago, he said it was\nbecause 'we had gone about as far as we\ncould go'. I agree with him.\nThe support band at the Rainbow\nwas Upp: a bass player, a drummer and\na vocalist/keyboards player. They were\nquite 'different' but the first two were\nunexciting, and as for the third! The\nvocals grated horribly and some very\nodd noises came out of the organ and\nsynthesisers (I'm not sure how many\nwere deliberate). To cap it all the guy\nseemed to think he was a sweet singing\nKeith Emerson.\nThere was a long delay between acts,\nnothing seemed to happen after the\nstage had been rearranged. Eventually\nWishbone Ash came on stage to a rousing\nwelcome (part sarcastic?) and launched\nstraight into the first number: a track\nfrom their forthcoming album 'There's the Rub'. Andy Powell then introduced\nthe new member of the group: Laurie\nWisefield ex of Home. Two more new\nnumbers followed.\nThe next announcement of '/ think its\ntime to play some old songs' was greeted\nby wild enthusiasm. The band then\nlaunched into 'The King Will Come',\n'Warrior', and 'Throw Down the Sword':\nall from their award winning third album\n'Argus'. These came off quite well\ndespite the fact that the group has lost\na lot of its coherency of playing (a certain lack of clarity in the instrumental\nsections was evident). After another new\nnumber, Steve Upton (the band's drummer)\nwandered around on the front of the\nstage and introduced the long instrumental\nfrom the new album which was called,\nbelieve it or not, 'FUBB'. This, he\ninformed us, stood for 'F*\"*d Up\nBeyonjd Belief \u2014 I can quite believe it.\n'Blowin' Free' and 'Time Was' from\nArgus closed the show. For the first\nencore the band played 'Home Town' and\n'No Easy Road'. The last number of the\nnight was 'Where Were You Tommorrow?'\nfrom their second album 'Pilgrimage'.\nTo sum up, time and changes have\nmade it impossible for Wishbone Ash to\nmaintain the standards of tightness of\nplaying and excellence of tunes they\nonce had. They now, while s tiM above\naverage, are a much more ordinary band\nthan of old. I personally dislike the\nchange of direction towards rock 'n roll,\nand miss what I see as a continuity\nof theme in parts of their first three\nalbums.\nwith thanks to M. Jackson\nBob Mills First let's mention the\nsupport. A group called\nORANGE not yet peeled it\nwould seem. A fair amount of\ntalent and did the job that they\nwere there for and that was to\nwarm the audience to music.\nBut who needs warming to\nOSIBISA!\nJust as their name suggests\nthey come especially to make\nmusic. Coming on stage in\nwhat is now a traditional\nparade, drums beating in\nrhythmic eloquence, they went\nstraight into a warm up from\nwhich developed a musical\ninterpretation of the African\nJungle called 'Deep in Africa'.\nThis included much intricate\nkeyboard work from KIKI GYAN.\nNext the group decided to hit\nthe audience and launched\ninto what is probably the best\nOsibisa single ever; 'Music\nfrom a Gong Gong' (1st Album).\nThis track highlights the\nversatility of each individual\nwith the group each contributing to the whole sound.\nThe congas of Kofi AYIVOR\nbeing prominent and filling the\naudience with basic primitive\nrhythm n. Featuring prominently\nthroughout the proceedings\nare the leader TEDDY OSEI\non sax and his brother MAC\nTONTOM on trumpet. A medley\nof tracks starting with their\nnew single 'Whose got the\nPaper, I 've got the Mouse?'\nfollowed. This particular track\nwas probably the worst music\nplayed all night but presumably\nthey have to plug sales.\nFollowing that were two\ntracks from Superfly. The\nfirst being 'Superfly Man'\nfeaturing some excellent\nrhythms with up to six of the\ngroup playing percussion.\nA sad lament called 'Why'\nwith some brilliant guitar from\nPAUL GOLLY broke suddenly\ninto a climax causing many\npeople to leave their seats\nwith fits of movement. By now\nthe audience were well into\nthe music and great cries of\naccompaniment could be\nheard from every point.\nFrom a very unusual lead-in on bass by JEAN MANDEGUE\nthe next track kept many\npeople on their feet. Called\n'Osibirock' from their new\nalbum, it included the whole\ngroup producing an incredible\nbeat from four sets of per-cus sion, keyboards, and\nguitar. The percussion being\nblended around SOL AMORFIO\nwho skips between the drum-kit and his beloved congas.\nAs always Osibisa enjoy\naudience participation and thus\nincluded 'Kileli' receiving the\nappropriate yells in reply from\nthe crowded hall. Not wasting\ntime TEDDY took the group\nstraight into a number called\n'Fire' which has an exceptionally beat y sound containing\na groovy bass guitar solo. With\nthe usual yelps and shouts\nTEDDY did the Osibisa chant\nand they were into 'Aiko Bee\nAi Ay' (1st Album).\nTo tumultuous applause and\nthe chanting of OSI - BISA\nthe group reappeared to give\nyet another 30 minutes of\ncontinuous encore. The spectacle of seeing thr s group\nperform was not to be missed\nand if further performances are\nas good as this one, you'll\nhave had your money's worth.\nHighly entertaining to the\npoint of brilliance.\nBOOKS Neil Pitcher David Watson: My God is Real\n(Falcon).\nTHE TITLE of this book sums up\nfairly well what it is all about; in it\nDavid Watson expands on the theme that\nhis God is real. In the first half of the\nbook he presents the truth of Christianity\nmainly in an apologetic manner, first\nexamining the historical Jesus and\narguing in a compelling way for the\nChristian exploration of this unique\nperson. He 'then spends three chapters\ntalking about traditional Christian ideas\nlike sin, hell and the cross in a way\nthat is easy to understand \u2014 you won't need to be referring constantly to a dictionary of theological j argan as you\nread it.\nThe hinge of the whole book is the\nchapter on the resurrection in which the\nauthor argues forcefully for the Christian\nexplanation of what happened, i.e. that\nChrist did rise physically from the dead.\nThis leads on naturally to the second\nhalf of the book in which he does an\nextraordinary thing: he starts being\npractical about Christianity (What next\nI ask?) He talks about what it really\ncosts and means to commit yourself to\nliving a real christian life, following a real Christ.\nThis book, besides being very\nreadable, presents Jesus Christ and his\ntruth in a clear and no nonsense manner,\nand I would recommend it to anyone who\nwants to examine the Christian point of\nview.\n'My God is Real' will be on sale on Christian Union book stalls around\ncollege from 28th October until 1st November.\n\n"

    "content": "FEUX\nc AUDIO TAIR\nTHIS year's Audio Fair opened\nat Olympia on Monday. The current\ntrend in the Hi-Fi trade is towards\nthe top end of the market with\nindividual units costing many\nhundreds of pounds. This trend\nwas certainly reflected at the\nfair. The advent of Quadraphonics\nhas brought in a glut of new\nJapanese electronics from Sony,\nSanyo etc. The Marantz 4240 four\nchannel tuner-amp is fairly\ntypical, priced at \u00a3335.70.\nDespite the increase in\naverage prices due to the introduction of new and exotic\nequipment, prices have been\nremarkably stable in the Audio\nindustry. This price stability\ncoupled with the increased choice\nof cheap and good Hi-fi equipment\nhas led to the under appeal of the\nFair. Not only are hi-fi units\nbeing demonstrated and shown,\nthere are competitions, models,\nlectures, and now inevitable\nappearances by disc jockeys from\nCapitol and t ne BBC.\na jfk jgf e, jg k JKJMB\nAbove: Grand Hall, Olympia\nBelow: Justifiably famous and still\ngoing strong\u2014the SME arm.\nInterest in audio/visual\ndisplays seems to be on the\nincrease with several films\nshowing light display units which\nsupposedly react to the sounds\nbeing played. Their efforts were\nboth disappointing and expensive\nbut the idea is an interesting one.\nUndoubtedly, the emphasis of\nthe Fair is on Quadraphonics and\ncassette units. Caution has been\nabandoned on both fronts. All the\nforeign manufacturers are backing\nat least one of the three most\npopular Quadraphonic systems\nwithout waiting for any one to\nbecome accepted as 'standard'.\nJudging from the demonstrations\nwhich I heard on Monday none of\nthe systems is a significant\nimprovement over a good stereo.\nPerhaps, it is profits and not\nsound quality which has brought\nin quadraphonic s so rapidly.\nCassettes have obviously come\nto stay although certainly not\ntaking over from records yet.\nThe quality obtainable from\ncassettes can now be as good as\nthat from expensive open-reel\ntape machines. A top quality\ncassette machine such as the .\nNikamichi costs over \u00a3400 but\nmany models from the Akai range\nwere more realistically priced at\nunder \u00a3100. Of the many new\ncassette units on display at the\nFair, perhaps the most interesting\nwas the Uher CFS210, a pocket\nsize portable stereo cassette\nrecorder, a unique machine at the\nunique price of \u00a3280 (plus VAT)!\nAbove: Cherry Ede, Miss Oecca\nRight: A typical budget pi iced receiver\u2014the Pioneer\nSX 434, about \u00a390\ni FELIX74 Richard Sz c zep an sk: Photographs by Peter Crawford Cherry Gilham and Mia with j the Gale GT 2101\nce IT is not often that something completely new appears\non the Hi-Fi scene but Gale Electronics have achieved this\nwith their GT 2101 turntable.\nThe designer of the turntable, Dennis Arnall, is a former\ngyroscope designer and has incorporated a great deal of\nadvanced technology to\nmake this turntable unique.\nThe turntable platter is\ndirectly coupled to the\nDC servo motor.and the\nspeed is measured by a pulse counter coupled to\nthe motor shaft. To\nprovide a reference time\nbase for speed measurement and control a crystal\noscillator operating at\n5.0 Megahertz is used,\nthus ensuring that the\nspeed selected is entirely\nindependent of mains\nvoltage or frequency. The\nspeed is conti hou sly adjustable from 10 rpm to\n99 rpm and is indicated\nby a digital readout.\nThe other feature of\nthe turntable which was\nemphasised by the designer\nis the suspension and\nbearing system, the main\nbody of the tg rn table is\nsupported on three miniature shock absorbers\nwhile the-main bearing Of\nthe GT 210T uses a new\nmagnetic material and\nall ocs the platter to\n'float' in a magnetic field.\nThis system essentially\nisolates the turntable\nfrom external shocks and\neliminates low frequency\nbearing noise.\nThe price of this\nbeautiful toy is expected\nto be around \u00a3450, so\nstart saving now! The\nprototype model seen\nat the Audio Fair is made\nout of perspex but Mr.\nArnali informs me that\nproduction models will be\nmade of glass.\nIt is unfortunate that\nthis superbly designed\nturntable should be priced\nbeyond nearly everyone's reach. Why should anyone\npay \u00a3450 when the only\nway of distinguishing\nbetween the Gale and a turntable costing around\n\u00a3100 is by using sophisticated test equipment?\nOn the other hand if you\ndemand perfection\nft\n\n"

No. 367 FRIDAY, 1st NOVEMBER, 1974.\nWRANGLE!\nLAST MONDAY night at the ICU Council, a technical wrangle\nwas initiated by a member of the ICU Executive in an attempt\nto delay the sending of a letter by the President to the Rector\non behalf of Council.\nThe original motion which\nstarted it all was proposed by\nthe President to the effect\nthat he should DRAFT a letter\nto the Rector expressing\nconcern and protest about the\nfact that Imperial College\nappear to be about to buy a computer from ICL, a company\nwho apparently have business\nconnections with the South\nAfrican Government. The\nspirit of the council was that\nthe letter should be sent, but\nthe motion had said merely\n'draft'. John Mortimer, President of RSMU, later asked for\nan assurance that the letter\nwould simply be drafted and\nnot sent. This caused uproar\nand no such assurance was\ngiven after the President had\nrealised he had incorrectly\ndrafted his motion.\nFootnote: The letter was\ndrafted and sent to the Rector.\nThe recommendations went\nthrough the College Board of\nStudies and it appears that the\nRector has, indeed, taken\nnotice of the Union's protest.\nACCUSATION AT\nLEEDS POLY.\nTHE FORMER Union Treasurer of Leeds Polytechnic, Robert\n'Buzz' Windley, has been charged with stealing \u00a328, \u00a327 and\n\u00a348 belonging to the Poly Union on July 16th and 30th, dishonestly obtaining a pecuniary advantage in relation to a debt for\nwhich he was liable by tendering two worthless cheques, one for\n\u00a33,346 and the other for \u00a394, and taking a minibus without the\nowner's consent.\nWindley was arrested at\nRamsgate on October 10th on\nhis return from the Continent,\nwhere he had been touring in\nthe minibus in the case. An\nexamination of the Union's accounts on July 11th revealed\na large number of cheques\nmarked 'Return to Drawer'\nwere outstanding in his name.\nHe was told no more would be\ncashed but between then and\nSTUDENTS AT SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY are holding\nrefectory boycotts and a partial rent strike after increases of\nbetween 20% and 37% in refectory prices together with increases\nin hall fees.\nA well attended Union\nmeeting on Thursday 17th, October, voted almost unanimously for a campaign of\nRefectory boycotts and a Rent\nStrike. This follows the\na for mentioned refectory price\nincreases and increases in\nfees of certain halls. These\nare the halls which supply\nmeals 'all in'. However, it is\nexpected that the fees of other\nhalls will be raised at the\nstart of next term.\nThe original motion before\nthe meeting, proposed by the\nInternational Socialists, called\nfor a Rent Strike, selective\nrefectory boycotts, an occupation of University premises\n(being progressively stepped\nup until demands were met by\nthe University), and a withdrawal from all negotiations\nand all University committees\non which the Union is\nrepresented. The meeting,\nhowever, passed a much less\nstrongly worded amendment\nwhich called for refectory\nboycotts and a Rent Strike.\nThe Rent Strike Fund's constitution was amended to\nprovide for students to pay to\nthe Union the total of the hall\nfees bill received from the\nUniversity and for the Union\nto then transfer to the\nUniversity the proportion\nequivalent to hall fees for the\n1973/74 session, retaining the\ndifference in the Strike Fund.\nA refusal to allow any decline\nin hall standards, support for\nhall JCRs in attempts to\nimprove standards and a guarantee that no college\nstaff would be made redundant\nwere also called for.\nA successful refectory\nboycott was carried out on\nTuesday \u2014 alternative meals\nbeing provided by the Union.\nThe Hon. Sec. of Southampton\nUnion said: 'Although th je Rent\nStrike has not started yet,\npreliminary reactions are\nfavourable, in one of our most\nconservative halls over 25%\nof residents have stated they\nwill definately support the\nRent Strike'.\nJuly 31st, cashed cheques\nfor the amounts in the charges.\nHe then left for France and\ndid not return to his post of\nVice-President for Administration when the Poly term\nstarted on October 2nd. He\nwas then reported to the police.\nWindley was released on\n\u00a31,500 bail on October 11th. He later said that he would\nreturn to his post of VicePresident for Administration,\nbut was immediately banned\nfrom the Poly Union. The\nPresident of the Union also\nthreatened to resign if Windley\ncame back. Several people\nwere alarmed by the sympathy\nwhich had been shown towards\nWindley since his return to\nLeeds. Deputy President of\nthe Union Ted Boyce said:\n'It would be a disaster if he\ndid not resign even if he was\ninnocent.' Besides the criminal\ncharges against him he has not\nacted as a union official\nshould do. I think he should\nresign because of his actions\nlast year'.\nWindley claims he left for\nthe Continent believing his\ndebts had been cleared\n(the \u00a33,346 cheque bounced).\n7 would have returned to\nBritain sooner and sorted\nthings out had I known what\nwas going on', he added.\nAt an SGM on Thursday\nOctober 24th, Windley was\ngiven a fair hearing to try and\nclear his name. However, the\nmeeting went against him and\nvoted for his resignation \u2014\nwhich he is now bound by the\nconstitution to give.\nNo further comment was\navailable from Leeds today,\nwhere the matter is considered\nsub jud ice.

This double\nalbum is solid proof of his reputation.\nMan is he strong. From the exciting\nhard rutting funky-soul to the cool\nrhythmic groovy soul the whole show is\nmagnificently executed in the true James\n3r own style.\nWith an album of this calibre one has\nto search very hard for loopholes in\naccomplishment. The title track 'He//'\nexpresses a comment on society and the\nlyrics are good, two lines of which are\n'It's hell try in' to do it by yourself\nand 'In the White House it's hell'.\nMusically it is not one of the best tracks\non the album.\nThere are some old tunes included\nsuch as 'Please, Please, Please', 'A Man Has To Go Back To The Cross\nRoads', and 'My Thang'. The latter was\nreleased as a single quite a while ago\nand sounds very much like 'Doing the\nFunky Chicken'. The former are excellent\npieces of musical accomplishment as\nregards soul music.\nThe last track on record two is the\nonly track and is called 'Papa Don't Take No Mess'. A trifle too long for my\nliking but it is good all the same. Well\nafter rambling on for a bit I suggest that\nyou should get this album if you are\nreally into this type of music.\nAndrew Osborne ZZEBRA by Zzebra (Polydor)\nNOT TO BE confused with the animal\nof the same name this band has a double\nz'. This means that those of us civilised\nenough to stack our records in alphabetical order find it right on the end and,\nwhen in some variety of stupor, we\nblindly select an album to groan along\nwith it is likely to be the fore mentioned Zzebra. This name was a devious ploy\nbecause there are few other reasons for\nplaying the album.\nThe six-man band has a fairly uninspiring history. Guitarist Terry Smith\nand saxophonist Dave Quincy were with\nthe tolerable '//', singer Gus Yeadon\nwas in the appalling 'Love Affair',\nmulti-instrumentalist Loughty Amao came\nfrom 'Osibisa', finally John McCoy\n(bass guitar) and Liam Genockey (drums)\njoined from 'Curtis Muldoon'. Their only\nclaim to fame thus far is a single/theme\ntune 'Zardoz' based on Beethoven's7 th symphony (such sacrilegious behaviour\ncan never be forgiven).\nThe album kicks off in very low key\nwith 'Cobra Women', so that you hardly\nnotice it's started. The tempo increases\nfor the tedious 'Mr. J' which is followed\nby 'Mah Jong', an instrumental which\nsounds like the theme tune to some I TV\ncurrent affairs programme, but does\ncontain some tasty wah-wah sax. The\nside glides out in much the same way\nas it started with 'Ife'.\nZzebra's music has been described\nas 'laid back' but it seems that that's just a polite way of saying un exiting. Their criss-cross rhythms explode with\nmonotony.\nSide two contains the two best tracks\n'Amuso Fi' and 'Rainbow Trains although\nboth are extended so long that they\noutlive their merit.\nThe band claims that they cannot be\ncategorised and anyone who tries it is a bore leading a completely regimented\nlife. Maybe, but one of my favorite\npastimes is putting things in nice label led\npigeon-holes; only when a band defies\nmy classification crusade do I become\none of their fans. Zzebra are indubitably\njazzy afro-rock, vaguely reminiscent of\nOsibisa. If that's what you like, you\nmight like this.\nFinally, 1 feel I should say if Zzebra\nare at the crossing they are in grave\ndanger of being mown down. Zzzzzzzzz!\nFILMS Richard War ing JUGGERNAUT.\nJ HAVE read the reviews for this film\nin the papers and the critics say that it's a very entertaining film. You can take it\nfrom me that they are right for once. The\nfilm gripped me and just about had me\noff the front of my seat in the closing\nminutes.\nThe basis of the plot is that someone\ncalling himself 'Juggernaut' (hence the\ntitle) has planted seven large bombs\naboard the ocean liner 'Britanic' (cap-tai ned by Omar Sharif). Juggernaut\ndemands half a million pounds to say how\nto dismantle the bombs before they\nexplode at dawn the next day. A bomb\nsquad under Commander Fallon (Richard\nHarris) is flown out and parachuted into\na gale to join the liner. The remainder\nof the film is taken up with the race\nagainst time. Will the police catch\nJuggernaut to make him 'spill the beans',\nwill the bomb disposal squad manage to\ndefuse the bombs or BANG. Also the\nfilm quickly surveys the effect all this\nhas on the one thousand, two hundred\npassengers and crew aboard the 'Britanic'.\nThere are a number of interesting\nlittle side complications which add to\nthe tension of the situation in one way\nor another, for instance: the family of\nthe policeman in charge of the investigation is aboard the liner. Good one\nthis, it has the policeman biting his\nnails every time someone holds up his\ninvestigation. It's also one of those\nfilms where you have actors who keep\nturning up time and time again in the\nsupporting roles;\u2014 'Er... wasn't he in ..\u2022.'\nI can never remember the names of these\npeople who add so much to the film\n(this time is no exception I 've lost the\nbump h sheet on the film). However I do\nremember a particularly good performance\nin this category: Roy Kinnear as the\nship's entertainment officer who is given\nthe unenviable task of carrying on as if\nnothing has happened and keep all the\npassengers happy too.\nPossibly the idea for the plot was\ntaken from the incident last year when\nbomb experts were dropped onto the\nQEII after bomb threats, though there\nproved to be no bombs aboard then.\nI will not spoil your enjoyment by giving\naway any of the twists in the plot (and\nthey keep on coming right to the end),\nbut I will advise you to see it, for your\nown nail-biting session. With bombs in\nthe plot how could they fail?\n\n"

The match eventually got underway\nand the first encounters suggested that IC were in for a hard time.\nThe Rosslyn Park back row dominated the loose ball and\nalthough at this stage fair\nball was being supplied by\nthe IC front five this proved\ninsufficient to hold the rampart\nPark team. Within twenty\nminutes IC were 10 points\nbehind from a goal and a try.\nThis deficit was cut by a, Finney penalty after a late|\ntackle on Cresswell and from\nthis stage until half time IC\ndominated the match. After\ninitial work by Robbins, Fearn\npushed his way over for a good try giving a half time\nscore of 14-7.\nAt this stage things were\nin ICs favour as they turned\naround with the slight slope\nand wind in their favour. The\nIC front five had begun to get\non top and had executed one\ntremendous scrum shove\nsending the Park pack back\nten yards. Lineout ball was\nalso going their way.\nIt was not to be, however.\nThe Park continued to win the\nvast majority of the loose ball\n,and threw the ball around in\nseven a side fashion. They\ndominated the half completely\nshowing IC the way with their\nspeed and skill. More to the\npoint they showed a brand of\nconfidence and fitness which\nIC could not even contemplate\nmatching. To their credit the\nIC team never gave up even\nin the face of a tremendous\nbarrage of tries. The Park in\nfact, ran in six tries in the\nsecond half without reply from\nIC, giving a final score of\n44-7. IC were well beaten but\nnot disgraced.\nTeam: B. Finney, A. Williams,\nR. Stern, R.

Glen\nSwaby put in an excellent\nperformance on the day and\nso to did veteran Colin\nHighan who netted two of the\ngoals with fierce first time\nshots. Up front, persistent\nrunning by ageless Bob Day\nand newcomer Steve Gee\nalways had the UC defence on\nedge. Bob, in one sortie,\nproved much too fast for the\nopposing centre backs when\nhe ran through to push the\nball past the goalkeeper with\nconsummate ease.\nThe second team, in a very\ndisappointing performance went\ndown 3-0, while the thirds\nafter a brave fight in an\nevenly balanced game lost\n2-1; Phil Singleton outstanding\nfor the home side.\nOn Saturday the annual\nouting to Oxford came to pass.\nThe firsts in an exciting, if\nnot the most entertaining of\ngames, scraped a21 victory\nover a useful St Edmund's Hall side. After scoring the\nequalise r, Ian Hyslop, in a neat interchange, laid on the\nsecond for our Dreaded\nRussian, centre forward with\nonly minutes remaining.\nThe depleted second team\nwere predictably defeated by\nNew College 6-3. Several of\nour players, however, turned\non some good football, in\nparticular, Gerry Lindon who\nshowed some nice touches up\nfront. The other game played\nwas that between Hertford\nCollege and our third team,\nalso without many of their\nstars, and this ended in a33 draw. The highlight of the\nmatch was the reappearance\nin an 1C shirt of Rob 'The\nGeneral' Carty, a club committee member of some years\nago and now an old boy, who\ncelebrated his comeback by\nscoring all three goals for IC.\nEvening entertainment was\nprovided by Rog Hunter, who\nonce more demonstrated his\nphenomenal drinking powers.\nSTOP PRESS\nIC rugby team beat UC 16--5 at\nKarlin.r rton cn V/ed ses day. j30N FIRE TICKETS\nThese are available from\nPara in the Union Office.\nTHE HOTLINE GOT SOME INTERESTING\nINFORMATION?

However, not losing\nheart at this IC kept going\nforwards and after a long spell\nof pressure a try finally came.\nA good run by Ned ended with\na loose nick, the ball came\nback quickly to Graham\nBattenshaw, who sent a pass\nto Gwyn Davies.

    "content": "10 FELIX PiG AFFAIRS\nCORNER\nTom Abraham\nTHE RESPONSE to the last\nPiG Affairs Corner has been\npathetic, partly because the\narticle itself was rather insipid,\nand partly because postgraduates are too busy working\nfor that degree which is their\npassport to the academic\nelite. The single mindedness with which research work is\npursued means that other\nrelated issues are totally\nignored.\nToo many students are\nworking on projects which are\nof little intrinsic value or\nsocial benefit. Since elitism\nis the prime motivation, to\nquestion the value of the\nproject would be unthinkable.\nTo place all the blame on the\nstudents would be unfair,\nsince they seem to be caught\nup in a conspiracy of silence,\nwhich militates against\nhonesty with regard to the true\nnature of projects. On too\nmany occasions students have\nsoldiered on with such projects\nspurred on by the vision of a doctoral paradise.\nIn the face of a deepening\nnational economic crisis, one\nmust ask whether the research\nwork being carried out is\njustifiable. More important,\nwhether the unrestricted\nexpansion of postgraduate\nnumbers is really warranted.\nThe main effect of the latter\nis to produce a pool of highly\nqualified but unemployable\ngraduates. This is especially\ntrue at a time of rising un-employment. A side effect of\nthe increase in numbers, is\nthat the facilities offered at\nthis college are insufficient,\nand in some departments the\nsituation has reached crisis\npoint.\nI feel that it is essential\nfor students to discuss among\nthemselves the philosophy\nunderling research work. As\nwell as this, the system of\nresearch on which postgraduate\nwork is structured is in need\nof drastic reform. Any i ni ti at i ve\nfor change, will have to come\nfrom us. To discuss this and\nother issues a special meeting\nof the Postgraduate Group will\nbe held sometime in November\u2014\nwe hope to publicise it as\nwidely as possible (anybody\nwho disagrees violently with\n\u2022what has been written is free\nto come along and propose a censure motion).\nTo my darling Rose, I am\nsorry about the lack of social\nevents for postgraduates. The\nsolution to this lies at the\ndepartmental or sectional level.\nThe Postgraduate Group will\nbe organising social events on\na college wide basis, but these\nwill mainly be held when the\nundergraduates are away.\nHowever, if in the meantime,\nif any departmental or sectional\ngroup wishes to organise a social, then ICPGG will\nsub sid is e it. If it is money\nyou want, then get in touch\nwith either John Porter\n(ext 4052) or me (ext 3103).\nThe Management Science\nsection have managed to get a group together and are\norganising socials with money\nfrom the Group.

Eacine-Jaciucs. 1974\nra\nSean Barker\nFEW PEOPLE are better qualified to speak on crime, and\npunishment than Lord Longford. He is not only a theorist on the\nsubject, about which he has written several books, but also\nsomeone who has tried to do something practical. He was chairman of the Labour Party Committee on Penal Reform before the\n1964 election, and it was\nthis committee that recommended the introduction\nof parole. He is further\nqualified in that for many\nyears he has visited people\nin prison, and has seen the\neffect prison has had on\nthem.\nHe introduced the subject\nby outlining the reasons\nfor prisons. Firstly there is\nthe aspect of deterrent,\nwhich is necessary to\nmaintain law and order.\nSecondly there is reform,\nbut although 75% of ex-prisoners do not return to\ngaol, he thought prison\nineffective in this respect.\nThen there, is the protection\nof society from dangerous\ncriminals, and retribution\nfor the crime. There is also,\nin some places, an idea of\nreparation to society, but\nthis is rare in England.\nLord Longford said that\nmany people in gaol should\nnot be there, but are only\nthere because of lack of\nalternatives, and he suggested that highly supervised work\nfor the community as one\nalternative. The reduction in\nthe number of prisoners\nwould reduce the overcrowding in prisons, relieving\nthe burden on the staff, and\nso relaxing the atmosphere\nin prison, which would\ngreatly facilitate the reform\nof the inmates.\nHe said that ten years in\nprison is enough to expiate\nany crime, and that life\nimprisonment was a hangover\nfrom the days of capitol\npunishment. Those who\nneeded confinement for longer\nperiods should be treated as\nmental cases.\nOne great improvement\nin the prison system, is\nparole, which prisoners can\napply for after a third of\ntheir sentence. At the moment\nthis is being somewhat abused,\nfor if there is no reform\nafter ten years, another year\nor two inside does not do\nany good.\nFor the future he hopes\nto see the expansion of the\nprobation service to help\nreleased prisoners. Many\nof those released can only\n\u00a7et manual work, and it is\nif fi cult to get any work of\na higher grade.\n\n"

It is all\nover with quite painlessly\nin a matter of seconds.\nIn addition to the\nAssociates and DIC's being\npresented, there were, after\nthe Rector's speech, two\nHonorary Associates (both\nretiring members of the\nCollege's technical staff)\npresented also and five new\nFellows including the retiring Principal of the\nUniversity of London, Sir\nDouglas Logan; the newly-appointed Chairman of the\nGoverning Body, Sir Henry\nFisher; and this year's Special Visitor Dr. Ralf\nDahrendorf, the newly-appointed Director of that\n\"dangerous left-wing establishment'' the London School\nof Economics.\nThe Rector's speech this\nyear was typically factual\nand to the point. He produced\na record of his experiences\nduring the year, broached the\nsubject of how the difficulties facing students in\nLondon may be partly\nresponsible for the falling\nintake of numbers, outlined\nthe College's serious\nfinancial troubles and then,\nafter a brief nostalgic sortie,\nexpressed his optimism for\nthe future of the academic\nactivities which have rec en ly been initiated including\nthe new department of Life\nSciences.\nThe Rector finished off\nby paying tribute to the\nretiring Chairman, Lord\nSherfield, who has held the\npost for twelve years (having\nsucceeded Vis count Falmouth\nwho died in office).\nThe highlight of the\nproceedings came with this\nyear's special visitor, arch-European Dr. Ralf Dahrendorf, whose recent appointment as Director of LSE\ncaused a major stir in the\nStudents' Union of that\nestablishment for it was\nasserted that whilst on the\none hand, the authorities\nwere telling the students\nthat their Union grant would\nremain at its painfully\nMichael Williams Photographs by Ramon New mann Vincent Ang mm\nHI1 \u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 .\n.

It was\nnever in doubt as to what\nhis solution to these difficulties would be: 'We need,\nin order to solve our survival\nproblems, rules and\nprocedures, organisations\nand institutions which\ntranscend our national\nboundaries'.\nAlthough mentioning that\nhe did not wish to make any\n'irresponsibly partisan'\nstatements as regards\nEurope, one can only feel\nthat he must have experienced great difficulty in\nadhering to such a premise.\nRemarks made concerning\nthe student body in general\nmay be significant: '..there\nis a sense in which student\npower is not power,\ncommunity politics is not\npolitics, and national\nrevolutions do not change\none iota of the problems\ndetermining our lives', and\nfinally, on the subject of\nour problems, '...we are not\ngoing to solve them if we\ndespair and embrace\nextremist solutions. What\nwe need ....is nerves and\ngood sense. I cannot help\nadding that I sometimes\nwonder whether our universities ...do enough to\ninstil this attitude in their\nstudents'.\nWith all the speeches,\npresentations and nodding\nover, Commemoration Day\ndrew to a close barring the\nafter-ceremony tea.\nThe last minute comment\nheard repeatedly was\n'Where was Sir Brian's collar and tie?'.\n\n"
