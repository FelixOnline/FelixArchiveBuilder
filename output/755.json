    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday November 21st19862 Great\nExpectations\nDear Sir,\nI find the attitude of certain\nstudent bodies towards the new\nEducation Act (which requires each\nInstitution of Higher Education to\nensure Freedom of Speech) quite\nincredible. If you believe that the\npresence of speakers will influence\npeoples' views then you must also\nbelieve that a highly active Union\nExecutive can influence peoples'\nviews. Now since many unions up\nand down the country are affiliated\nto the NUS, which is run by the\nNational Organisation of Labour\nStudents (NOLS) then you see this\nhas very interesting consequences.\nWho then finally decides the range\nof speakers allowed into a College?\nUltimately NUS and NOLS.\nNow the NUS has in the past\nmanaged to gain credibility by\nosten siv ely supporting minority\nviewpoints, while systematically\ndisabling the democratic apparatus\nto oppose such views. Remember\nLots of\nBickering\nI would like to complain about\nsome of the semi-intelligent tripe\nthat has appeared in your pages\nrecently. Obviously some of your\ncorrespondents are so obsessed with\npromoting their causes that they\nhave no time to think about their\narguments.\nFirstly the puerile bickering\nbetween the rabid right (John\nMartin, Colin Trotman etc.) and the\ntrendy left (Christine Taig, Chris\nMartin etc.) over the freedom of\ns ne ech/ no platform argument. Do\nthese fools not realise that the\nEducation and Public Order Bills\nare merely legitimate political tools\nemployed by the government to\nimpose their views on sections of the\npublic? It is not a question of the\nrights and wrongs, it is a question of\nwho has the power to implement\ntheir schemes. Frankly it looks like\nwe're going to have to accept that we\nwill have loans instead of grants, we\nwill be obliged to adjust our views\non the acceptability of speakers and\non the acceptability of social\npractices to fit those of the elected\npowers. You cannot just expect\ndemocracy or automatic rights, any\nexamination of the British political\nsystem will show you that the\naccepted practice in this country is\nthat a party has to win one argument\n(eg. an election) and is then given the\nright to automatically decide all the\nothers. Then again perhaps that is\nthe way these people are arguing.\nFurthermore I am appalled by the\nhip ocr is y of RCS. Of course when a bunch of mindless vandals from\nthough, the NUS is run by NOLS\nand the executive of socialist\nprinciples is the prime objective.\nOf course this is a gradual process\nand as Chris Martin (DoC) pointed\nout in the last FELIX\u2014\"The NUS\nare well aware of the dangers of\nextending the definitions more\nwidely, which would result in the\n(no platform) policy having no\ncredibility at all.\" However, in the\nshort term there is a solution\u2014\n'debating' principles.\nThe NUS are rightly scared that\nthe new Education Act will halt\ntheir long term plans by removing\ntheir veto on opposition views.\nSince you cannot possibly oppose\n\"Freedom of Speech\" without being\nexposed, the recent GU C as\nChristine Taig pointed out, actually\ndiscussed \"the principle of the govt,\ninterfering directly with student\nunions...\". Very emotive language\nand I suppose it keeps interest\nticking over.\nMaybe next time they will discuss\n\"the right of men to have babies\" to\ngalvani se the gay vote.\nPhilip Parker\nElec. Eng. Ill\nQMC nick the bell from Jez it is\ntheft. But what is it when RCS hacks\nnick street signs and hang them in\ntheir office? Why is it that RCS get\nto decide the laws pertaining to\ntheft, and why is it that their rules of\nmascot ry are automatically\nextended to QMC without anyone\nconsulting QMC. It's a bit like\nthrowing a ball at someone in the\nstreet and complaining its not\ncricket when they don't bat it back.\nFor three years QMC have been a pain in the backside nicking stuff to\nransom back Mary, its about time\nsomeone gave the thing back and\nstamped on all this idiocy.\nMark Cottle\nPeace in\nour time\nDear Sir,\nHow the worms crawl out of the\nwoodwork! Cannot Messrs.\nWooding and Wells (FELIX 754)\nfathom the intellectual argument\nthat they can only trade personal\ninsults for informed comment?\nFor the benefit of new readers,\nDavid Wooding's tactic of repeating\nmy name exactly five times in a letter\nis an old one, used by his cronies last\nyear, and reinforced with a pseudo-quotation. A phrase which the\n'honourable' David Wooding finds\nfunny, is attributed implicitly and\ndishonestly to myself. The idea of\nthe whole ploy is to anger the victim.\nTry growing up Mr. Wooding,\nyour style, along with the dregs of an\nargument are pathetic and\nlaughable.\nGrant\nRant\nDear Sir,\nIn last week's FELIX, Stephen\nBlanchard asks why students should\nbe penal is ed for entering higher\neducation by having to pay for\nthemselves in the form of student\nloans. If all the students in all the\nuniversities & polytechnics around\nthe country were totally committed\nto their courses I would agree with\nhim entirely. However, a large\nnumber of students, even at\nImperial, seem to come into higher\neducation as a way of putting off\ncareer decisions. This is not in itself\na bad thing, but some obviously\nwould have been better served by\nlooking more carefully at the\noptions available to them, which is\nwhat student loans would force\npeople to do.\nIf this causes a drop in numbers of\nstudents by causing them to take\nmore suitable options at 6th form\nlevel, then some departments and\nmaybe universities may have to\nclose, but this would merely serve to\nweed out the less productive ones.\nJust to set the record straight Mr.\nWooding and Mr. Weller, let me\nreiterate the sentiments of my first\nletter: It is, in my opinion, cowardly\nand dishonest to distribute leaflets\nwith no name on, however, I can\nunderstand that if you have so few\nprinciples you may not want to\nstand by them. Perhaps more\nimportant is the fact that nobody\ncould question the authors of the\nliterature, and nobody could\nquestion the authors of the\nliterature, and nobody could assess\ntheir bias. Moreover, I was given a leaflet whilst talking to the REME\nrecruitment officer. He said that the\nthing which narked him most, was\nthat they were not allowed to reply\nto them: I appreciate that the right\nof reply is something you guys\nwould like to see the back of as well.\nSince you both seem keen to\ndiversify into peace politics rather\nthan the real issue of my letter, let\nme put my bit in. Peace won't come\nas you seem to suggest if you throw\ndown your arms, wave a bit of paper\nand shout 'Peace in our Time'. Your\npeace seems to be precariously\nbalanced somewhere between\ninstability and downright disaster.\nAlso deserving comment is the\ncontemptuous insolence of Andrew\nWeller who seems to have made an\nestimation of my 'literary\nappreciation' from reading my'\nletter. Keep taking the pills\nsunshine. I assure you that I am\nquite cool enough without that ice\nand water to make an unprejudiced\ndecision on Barclays involvement in\nSouth Africa. So was the attendance\nof the last IC U GM. The lies of your,\nletter have been forwarded to\nBarclays PLC for their inspection.\nThe final absurdity of last week's FELIX: how the hell does Ms Taig\nNo department or university has a divine right to exist, and there are\npeople who regard universities and\npolytechnics as being full of people\nwho don't pull their weight (for\ninstance there was a letter in my\nlocal paper, just before the\nbeginning of term, which talked\nabout \"gross overspending\" in\nuniversities and \"dross in the\nuniversity system\"\u2014purely, so it\nseemed, because the letter-writer's son had been accepted by a university having only achieved\n\"mediocre\" grades).\nIt is to be hoped that this\nincreased pressure on departments\nwould cause the courses to be more\nindustrially orientated, since the\noutside world seems to be crying out\nfor graduates who are actually of\nsome use. This is not to say that all\ncourses that do not have a practical\nuse should be abolished (perhaps\nnot even the one run by the\nProfessor at Cambridge who\nspecialises in 10 dead Iranian\nlanguages), just that those that aim\nto be practical should be more\naware of the needs of industry.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Hamilton\nMet. & Mat. II\ntranslate 'some people like to\nexplore their own sexuality' into\n'supposed or actual homo-sexuality'? I am not a gay. And how\nexactly can students take a democratic decision to exclude\nother students from the democratic\nprocess? It sounds like you have\nmore empathy with Joe Stalin than\nJoe Student, Christine. How about\nstarting to use a little 'supposed or\nactual' intelligence?\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Martin\nSincerest\nGratitude\nDear Sir,\nMay I make use of the letters page\nof FELIX to thank all those people\nwho helped run the Guilds Carnival\nlast Friday. Their enthusiasm and\nsheer hard work were of an order\nseldom encountered at an IC event\nand so to the many Guildsmen and\nwomen whom I was unable to thank\nin person on the evening, may I say\nthat all your hard work into the\nsmall hours did not go unnoticed. In\nparticular I would like to thank all\nthe exec who took over much of the\nwork when the timetable had to be\nadjusted, leaving me in a blind panic\nsuffering from a total loss of\norganisation, and all the Links men\nwho put in such a sterling effort on\nthe Cocktail bar. Whilst the event\nwas not as well attended as I had\nhoped, all the helpers made it what I hope was a good night for those who\ndid attend. My sincerest gratitude to\nyou all,\nDavid Pugh\nGuilds Ents\n\n"

This is a controversial\nmove on the part of College. The\nJCR, which is currently controlled\nby the Union for the benefit of\nstudents, will effectively become a dining area for most of the time,\nthereby reducing its potential as a meetings and events room, and as a money spinner during conferences\nand exhibitions. This comes at a time when the Botany-Zoology\ncommon room has been lost, the\nFELIX Office has been moved into\nthe only piece of available space in\nthe Union Building, and Union\nRooms are heavily over subscribed by clubs and societies. All this to\nproduce more refectory space even\nthough the Southside refectory is\nundergoing massive refurbishment\nthis year in order to attract several\nhundred students. On the other\nhand perhaps more and more\nrefectory areas are what is wanted,\nbut should the Union be prepared to\nlose effective control of its one large\nfunction room? Do look at these\nplans; come to the Union Office if\nyou've any questions or ideas\u2014the\nmore comments we get, the better.\nProbably the Best Carnival in the\nWorld\nYet more effusive thanks to\neveryone who organised the Guilds\nCarnival.

If a high quality, good\nvalue charity event like this can't attract the numbers, it's a great\nshame; maybe Guilds shouldn't waste all the effort next year.\nDragging on...\nI was going to write this entire article\nabout the merits of dressing up in\ndrag, but they told me it would ruin\nmy image.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday November 21st198618 Guilds Float Home\nThe annual inter-CCU raft race,\nImperial's version of the Americas\nCup,took place on Sunday amid\nclaims that Guilds Union had used a raft almost identical to that used by\nRCS last year, with some form of\nespionage being used to obtain\ndetails of the innovative 'winged\nkeel' design. The competition\nbegan in Prince's Gardens, with the\nteams having to carry their rafts to\nthe Serpentine and then racing\nacross it. Guilds and RCS arrived at\nthe water together, although the\nshocking pink of the Guilds raft\ncaused a number of horses to bolt on\nthe way. The aquatic section was\nthen begun, with the Guilds raft\narriving at the opposite shore a clear\nfirst, followed by the RCS.\nAlso held on Sunday was another\ncom pet ion between the CCUs, a three-way tug-of-war. Initially the\nRSM team pulled with RCS, and the\nGuilds team looked obviously\noutclassed. However, in a dramatic\nchange in all eg ien ces the miners\nswitched sides, and pulled with\nGuilds. The match became a stalemate, with the RCS holding\nfirm against the other two teams,\nuntil everyone lost interest and went\nfor a drink in Southside bar.\nPhysics Firsts Hit Graduate\nCompetition\nA first-year lecture in Physics was\nsubject to a mass 'hit' on Tuesday\nmorning. The fl anning took place\nduring the course of the lecture and\nbecause of a large amount of\nshaving foam left on the desks and\nseats the following class was very\npoorly attended.\nThe hit has been condemned by\nall College authorities and students\nhave been warned that hit squads\nmay be refused entry to lecture\ntheatres. Entry to lectures is not\nallowed without special dispensation, although in the past this rule\nhas not been enforced. Guilds\nPresdident Duncan Royle has taken\na firm stand on the fl anning of the\nfirst year physics lecture :'The\ncontract (raising \u00a350 for rag) was\ntaken out by the mining first year\nChristine Taig, President of IC\nUnion, has written to senior College\nand Government officials to protest\nat a move by the Iraqi Embassy to\nobtain detailed information on Iraqi\nstudents studying in the UK.\nThe embassy has written to many\ncollege registries in the UK demanding information about all\nIraqi privately-funded students, and\ndetailing the embassy's plan to\ncontrol the transfer of funds to those\nstudents from families and other\nsponsors.\nThe latest move by the Iraqi\nand some of them were allowed to\ntake part in the hit. The Hit Squad\nshould not enter lecture theatres\nwithout special permission and to\nensure ad her ance to this the Hit\nSquad organiser, Chris Simpson of\nChem Eng II was present. Due to\ncircumstances beyond his control\n(namely mining first year) the\nlecture was actually interrupted. We\ntotally condemn this action.'\nTo prevent similar occur ances the\nhit squad have said they will only\naccept contracts on individuals, not\nwhole departments. A spokes flan stressed that the Squad disapproved\nof unofficial hits, victim is ation, use\nof substances other than shaving\nfoam, and squads who fail to clear\nup.\nEmbassy comes after a history of\nheavy-handed surveillance of Iraqi\nstudents studying in the UK, especially those who are thought to\nbe opposed to the ruling Ba'ath\nParty, and members of the Iraqi\nStudent Society.\nIt is alleged that Iraqi students\nhave been subjected to physical\nattacks by the National Union of\nIraqi Students and Youth (NUISY),\nwhich has been banned by most\nstudent unions in the UK and by the\nNational Union of Students.\nIC students graduating in July next\nyear will be competing for higher\nsalaries than ever before, especially\nthose who are planning to go into\naccountancy.\nAccountancy firm Arthur Young\nwill be offering graduates starting\nsalaries of \u00a311,000 a year for its\nSeptember 1987 intake, and the 80\ncandidates accepted will be able to\napply to do a masters degree in\nbusiness administration (MBA) at\nthe firm's expense.\nThis compares with the \u00a39,000\nexpected to be on offer from the\nother accountancy firms, such as\nCoopers and Lybrand and Ernst\nand Whinney. And these firms are\nnot expected to offer the\ninducement of an MBA.\nThe move by Arthur Young\ncomes in the face of increasing\ndifficulty in attracting high-calibre\ngraduates to accountancy.\nAccording to the firm, accountancy\nis often seen as a fall-back career, if\nall else fails. But their salary hike\nlooks set to put an end to that.\nBut for the real high flyers,\npotential salaries are even higher.\nSince deregulation in the City, the\n'Big Bang', stockbrokers are\noffering as much as \u00a320,000 to new\ngraduates, big bucks by any\nstandards.\nIt is estimated that at least 10% of\nIC graduates end up as accountancy\ntrainees. But fall-out rates are\nnotoriously high, with many\ntrainees failing the Institute of\nChartered Accountants' tough\nexams.\nBroken Glass\nA cleaner in the Physics Department\nhas been seriously injured by broken\nglass while disposing of waste paper.\nAs he was pushing the paper down\ninto the rubbish skip a broken glass\nphotographic plate severed an\nartery in his wrist.\nTerence Parker, Administrator in\nthe department, has circulated a letter in the Department asking\npeople to ensure that glass and\nsharp waste is separately disposed-of.\nIC Arrests\nThree students were arrested when\nthey used replica machine guns to\nstage a water fight in front of the\nIraqi Embassy on Wednesday.\nA diplomatic policeman saw the\nstudents, guns in hand, leap into a car, performing aU turn in Prince\nConsort Road, and speeding down\nExhibition Road.\nThe car was flagged down by a police motorbike and surrounded\nby ten armed diplomatic police. The\nstudents were frisked at gunpoint,\nhandcuffed, and taken to Chelsea\npolice station where they were\ndetained for an hour.\nOne of the students, a Mehanical\nEngineering second year, says, 'We\nall kept very calm but if someone in\nthe car had panicked I would hate to\nthink what might have happened.'\nNew Busses\nAn experimental minibus service\nwhich can be used to travel between\nSouth Kensington underground\nStation and the Huxley Building has\nbeen started by London Regional\nTransport. The service, route CI,\nruns from High Street Kensington\nto Westminster passing Imperial on\nthe way. Underground Travelcards\ngive free travel on this service which\nruns at intervals of 6 minutes.\nMary Returns\nMary, the mascot of Queen Mary\nCollege, was returned to its owners\nyesterday after three years in the\ncustody of RCSU.\nThe handover was made by\nRCSU in return for the bell from\nJezebel, the RCS fire engine, which\nwas stolen on Sunday 9 November.\nThe exchange took place near\nLiverpool Street Station.\nA set of minibus wheels, which\nwere removed from an ICU van by\nQMC students two years ago, were\nalso returned to RCSU.\nChristine Protests\n\n"

An hour and a half later and over twenty miles\nfurther east the retrieve lost the\nballoon near Reading when it was\nforced to make a detour due to a closed bridge. Having fruitlessly\nsearched the area north-east of\nReading, the retrieve followed\nstandard procedure and retired to a pub to ring the pilot's house. A message was passed via the pilot's wife, giving the location of the\nlanding and the balloon was quickly\nrecovered.\nThere then followed a fast drive\nback to Newbury for an evening\nflight.

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday November 21st19864 Small\nHall\nDear Sir,\nWe would like to reply to Ian\nHogate's so-called justification of\nthe rents (issue 753) through your\ncolumns, as we feel that his views are\nmisguided.\nIf Weeks is really the most\npopular Hall why did 28% of this\nyear's fresher residents opt for other\nCollege accommodation in\npreference to Weeks? (without\nknowledge of the new rent\nstructures incidentally). A survey\nconducted amongst residents\nshowed that by far the main reason\nfor choosing 'the best-equipped\nHall' was its small size.\nOn the facilities front, the\nkitchens have yet to be properly\nupgraded to self-catering standard\nand are inferior to those in Linstead\nwhere meals are provided. The\nheating is also inadequate as the\nrepairs promised over the summer\nhave not been completed.\nPeter Hallworth has been\ndeservedly praised for the remedial\nwork to bring Southside and Evelyn\nGardens in line with Local\nAuthority regulations. It is our firm\nbelief that the lack of ventilation in\nthe kitchens, showers and toilets is\njust one of the ways in which Weeks\ncontravenes these regulations. The\nstructural instability of the Hall\nmeans that conference guests only\nstay here as a last resort.\nOn a wider note we feel that the\nhigh rents charged in some\nresidences will deter more\nprospective students than the lower\nrents in the Houses will attract and\nsuggest that it would be in the\nCollege's interest to reconsider the\nissue.\nYours sincerely,\nWeeks Hall Committee\nMr John\nMartin\nDear Felix,,\nI would like to comment\nconcerning a letter from Ms.\nChristine Taig in last week's FELIX\nin which the allegation was made\nthat Mr. John Martin has\n'Homosexual Tendencies'.\nHaving known John for well over\ntwo years, I am at a loss to\ncomprehend this complete\nfalsehood, and I do not blame him\nfor the legal action which I understand him now to be taking as\na result.\nFurthermore, the realisation of\nMs. Taig that she should be\nperfectly sure of what she puts her\nname to should also be clear to the\nEditor, Mr. Jones.\nIf he were doing his job properly\nhe would have taken appropriate\nsteps to ensure that allegations are\nnot unsubstantiated lies. In which\ncase last week's scurrilous letter\nfrom Ms. Taig would not have been\nprinted.\nA copy of this letter has been sent\nto the Rector, and in view of all rules\nof decency and fair play I expect it to\nbe published in the next copy of\nFELIX.\nYours sincerely,,\nJonathan Davies\nMetallurgy & Materials III\nTrouble in\nChelsea\nDear Dave,\nLast Monday night, the manager\nof the Cadogan Arms opposite the\nChelsea cinema escorted my two\nfriends and I, three seemingly\ninnocent girls waiting for our film to\nbegin, out of his premises, accusing\nus of using it as a youth club and\ntelling us that we had better not\ncome back as we would not get\nserved.\nOur only crime was to show our\nstudent faces at his bar, and have a quiet grumble after he had been\nrude to us serving our drinks, and\ncharged us \u00a32.32 for half a beer, half\na cider and an orange juice and\nlemonade. When we got fed up of\nbeing pushed past by the\naforementioned gentleman, who\nwas piling up the glasses in front of\nour noses, we moved to the only\navailable space\u2014a step in front of a half empty food cabinet. A couple of\nus sat on the step, as others were\ndoing in the pub, and it was then\nthat the ever pleasant-manager\nreappeared to help us to our feet and\nthen the door.\nI was wondering whether any\nother students have experienced the\nsame treatment and, if so, I would\nlike to draw their attention to the\nawards framed on the wall opposite\nthe bar for friendly customer service\nand the welcoming atmosphere of\nthe pub.\nTo save others money and the\nindignity of being treated in such a way, I would like to suggest that\nthey walk a little further down the\nKing's Road to a different pub for\ntheir pre-film drinks.\nYours sincerely,\nVivienne Watson\nDave Pugh\nRules OK\nDear Dave,\nCan we use your letters column to\ncongratulate Dave Pugh on the\nexcellent way he organised\nCarnival. We have been at this\nCollege for several years and this\nCarnival was the best organised.\nEnough said.\nHugh Southey & Duncan Royle\nSweet\nFreedom\nDear Dave\nIn reply to Chris Martin's letter\nabout 'Freedom of Speech' I would\nlike to set the record straight.\nFreedom of speech in this country\nmeans that you can say anything\nyou wish to, and even the various\nlaws which restrict those who\ndefame or incite are only a minute\nand tiny dent on what can be said.\nThe NUS, he says, have a 'no-platform' policy for 'the like of the\nNational Front'. The National\nFront, however, are allowed public\nmeetings, candidature s for\nparliament and even television party\npolitical broadcasts, this clearly\ndemonstrates that the National\nFront are not breaking any laws, so\nit is perfectly possible to have\n'Freedom of Speech' given to those\nwho would act (as they see it)\nagainst various unwanted sections\nof the British Society.\nIt is only by hearing their\nrepulsive policies that we can put\nourselves in a viable position to\nattack and negate their arguments.\nEqually, there is no restriction (at\nleast in public.although it of course\ndoesn't apply to the NUS) on public\nsexism\u2014just look at the Church of\nEngland. I hope people have seen\nthrough the weak link in Chris\nMartin's letter between the terms\nracist and sexist, and the reference at\nthe beginning to freedom of speech.\nIt is perfectly legal therefore to be\nracist and sexist in public and\nsociety has decided that it is better to\nhear and destroy, rather than\n'certain views should not be\nexpressed in public!'\nFreedom of speech does not\nbelong to the oppressed, or the\noppressors, but to all.\nDave Burbage\nChairman IC ConSoc\nMr John\nMartin\nDear FELIX,\nI seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest with a comment that I was not aware that I had made. My\nfirst inkling was when Dave Jones\nshowed me a letter from Jonathon\nDavies implying that John Martin is\nconsidering legal action against me\nfor calling him a homosexual.\nI certainly did not do so; I have no\nidea whether Mr Martin is gay or\nnot and, what is more, I could not\ncare less. Making comments about\nsomeone else's sexuality is a childish\nand offensive ploy to which I hope I shall never stoop. What I meant\u2014and I thought I said\u2014was\nthe Mr Martin has never been\nharassed for being gay, regardless of\nwhether he is or not. If my wording\nwas misleading I apologise; I still\nbelieve that my meaning was quite\nclear. The sweet irony of this\nover wheal ming over reaction is that\nmy comment arose from Mr\nMartin's objections to an article in\nwhich I bemoaned the existence of\nhomophobia in Imperial College, a place where the term \"homosexual\"\nis considered to be an insult.\nYours,\nChristine Taig\nJones\nvs Jones\nI am writing to ask whether you\nare willing to confirm or deny that\nyou allowed Mr. Don Ferguson,\nStudent Services Officer, to censor\nthe last edition of FELIX, which\ncontained two articles of direct\nconcern to him (Hamlet Havoc and\nBringing The House Down). If the\nreply is to be in the affirmative,\ncould I further ask if there is to be a general policy for FELIX to allow\nCollege officials to censor stories\nand if so if there is any point\nwhatsoever in passing news items to\nthe FELIX office if they contain\nanything which may be of the\nslightest embarrassment to any\nCollege employee.\nYours faithfully,\nRay Jones\nEditor's Note,\nNo member of College is ever\nallowed to censor FELIX articles. I will occassionally permit people to\nread the proofs before FELIXgoes to\npress, but any changes they advise\nmay be rejected. Don Ferguson did\nnot read either of the stories\nmentioned above before FELIX was\nprinted. If the tone or content of\neither article seems biased in his\nfavour, it is because we are only able\nto print as news information which we\nhave been given \"on the record'. All\nsuch information is gratefully\nreceived.\n\n"

The new\nproposals are that the SCR should\nbe partitioned, and used in part as\nan eating area for the 'QT' snack bar\nwhich was opened just before the\nstart of term.

He said that there was a severe bottleneck in all catering\nareas between 1pm and 2pm, when\nthe majority of people took lunch.\nHe quoted several significant\nincreases in numbers using\nrefectories since 1984, including a figure of 117% for the JCR services.\nThis is largely because of the\nintroduction of the 'QT' snack bar\nin the JCR, though trading at other\noutlets has also increased\nsubstantially.\nMr Lloyd Davies went on to say\nthat the 'QT' snack bar had\noriginally been envisaged as a take-The Guilds Slave Auction, Rag's answer to Human Rights Week\nraised \u00a3350 on Tuesday. The highest\nprice, \u00a336, was paid by Guilds\nRugby for Guilds Hon Sec Anne\naway service, and that its turnover\nhad exceeded all expectations. In\nacting now, he said, the College was\ntrying to cope with the problem at\nthe outset.\nICU Hon Sec David Colley\nquestioned whether the use of the\nJCR as an eating area could not\nhave been foreseen, and described\nthe College's new scheme as 'sneaky\nand underhand'. He thought that\nthe College seemed to have gained\nsome of the Union's space by going\nahead with the development of the\nsnack bar and then shelving the\nchangeover plans.\nMr Lloyd Davies said that the\nrefectory issue ought to be treated as\na 'community problem', and\naccepted that the Union Snack Bar\nwas also suffering from space\nshortage because of high demand at\nlunch times.\nAccording to the University\nGrants Committee (UGC), Imperial\nCollege has sufficient space set aside\nfor refectory and student service\nuses for a college of 6,500. The\ncurrent student population of IC is\njust under 5,000.

This race, which is the\nclimax of the Autumn races for\nFours, attracted a total of over 520\ncrews from all over Britain. All\nevents were hotly contested with\nmany Commonwealth and World\nChampionship medalists entered in\nthe top events.\nThe top Imperial crew racing in\nthe Open cox less fours finished in\n5th place, a mere 13 seconds behind\nthe winners and several places in\nfront of the UL crew! In both the\nSenior A cox ed and Senior A cox less fours, IC crews were unlucky\nfinishing a close second to the\nCambridge University Crews. The.\nIC crews entered in the womens\nfours, mens Novice and mens Senior\nC events showed promise finishing\nwell up in their respective divisions.\nThe stars of the day, however,\nwere the Senior B four who,\nfollowing up their impressive\nvictory last week, again showed\nwhat talent there is throughout the\nwhole club. They convincingly won\nthe cox less fours event, overcoming\nall of VB A Roper's steering\ndifficulties, and then, having\nchanged boats' and taken a cox\nonboard, rowed straight back up to\nthe start and raced again over the\nthree and a half mile course to win\nthe Senior B cox ed fours event\u2014a very impressive result!\nFOOTBALL; IC III 3, St Marys 13\nThirds Force Draw\nLast Wednesday a somewhat below\npar performance from IC 3rds still\nforced a draw to put them above the\n2nds in the league. The 3rds, perhaps suffering from complacency after their emphatic cup\nwin, failed to take the early initiative\nand seize control of a fairly dour\nfirst half. The visitors took the lead\nwhen a flicked-on free kick was\nstabbed in through a crowd of\nplayers. With a little more urgency a set piece almost saw the equalizer; a short Paul Thompson free kick was\ncrossed by Paul Savage and Mark\nWoodgate headed just over. Hideo\nTakano speculative ly curled the\nequalizer and a few minutes later a Paul Thompson free kick was\nheaded home by an unmarked Paul\nSavage 'not quite' ghosting in at the\nfar post.\nPerhaps somewhat fortunate to\nbe leading at the interval, the 3rds began the second half with more\naggression. St Mary's equalise d through a40 yard free kick; keeper\nFerggus Batstone deciding to let the\nnet stop the ball instead of catching\nit. Sloppy defending against a throw-in let the opposition steal the\nlead. Still not playing their best\nfootball, the 3rds probed for the\nequalizer. The visitors became\nnervy; crude challenges and dissent\nresulted in three of them being\nbooked and one sent off for\nattacking Martin Lake. In the dying\nminutes Paul Thompson circumnavigated the penalty area and\nunleashed a tremendous left-footer\njust inside the post.\nA mediocre performance by the\n3rds really deserved no more than a draw, but the unbeaten run\ncontinues.\nTeam: F. Batstone, C. Gordon, M. Lake, M. Woodgate (C),K. Graves,\nC. Budgen, P. Thompson, H. Jakano,\nP. Savage, D. Semeria, W. Charles.\nTen Pins Toppled\nFor once IC managed to put a full\nteam out. This didn't necessarily\nmean they would all get there in one\npiece. Thanks to the driver's attraction to a red 2CV the C team\narrived in a state of shock.\nThis spread rapidly through the\nwhole team as we were given a lesson in how to bowl properly.\nThere was a glimmer of hope when\nthe A team held Portsmouth's away\nteam to a tied first game, C. Wheeldon being the star with the\nhighest score of the day, 196.\nHowever the other teams were taken\nto the cleaners, and the only other\ngame in which we scored was the\nfinal B team one, when the\nopposition was one man short.\nBirmingham\nDominate\nOn Saturday 15th, IC hosted the\nSouth East Region U AU fencing\ncompetition. Unfortunately, we\nwere not able to repeat last years'\nsuccess in this event, and lost\nnarrowly to Kings College.\nWe started the competition with\ntwo of our team members\nmissing\u2014foi list Adam Andreski\nwas injured and one of our sabre urs failed to turn up. A team was\nassembled, however, and we started\noff with the sabre match.\nThe sabre was hard-fought and\nwe ended up losing narrowly (5-4).\nUnfortunately, the IC foil team\nwere not at their best, and lost 7-2:\nthis meant that we could only afford\nto lose 1 bout at e pee. Full marks must go to the\ne pee is ts, who fought hard to level\nthe overall score at 13-13. In a tense\nfinish, however, we just failed to pull\noff what would have been an\namazing comeback.\nThe overall winners of the\ncompetition were UCL, who now go\nforward to the next round.\nTeam: Jon Davy (Captain), Rick\nJarvis, Simon Holden, Simon\nChenery and Kim Ming Looi.\nWe meet in the Union gym at\n12.30 on Thursday for tuition, and\nmore informally on Friday evenings\nfrom about 6.00-8.00. Anyone is\nmost welcome to come along to\nwatch or participate\u2014just bring a pair of trainers, loose trousers and at shirt.\nRugby, Gutteridge cup\nsecond round, Sunday\nNovember 16th; IC 1st XV\n0 St. Thomas' Hospital 1st XV 0\nStalemate\nThis was bound to be a hard-fought\nand close match, as St. Thomas',\nlast year's losing finalists, would\nobviously want to take out IC, who\nwon the cup. Both teams went out\nonto Harlington field determined to\nwin, and in the end had to settle for a draw. St. Thomas' won the toss and\nelected to kick-off, which suited\nImperial as they wanted to play\nagainst the wind in the first half. St.\nThomas' put the kick-off over IC's dead ball line, and a scrum was\ngiven in the centre ofthe pitch. This\nfirst scrum was a shock for the\nmedics, as IC's loose-head prop,\nJosh Somhon, and hooker Andy\nMartin combined to wreck a strong\nSt. Thomas' front run. The first\nquarter of the was all IC, as they\npiled on the pressure. St. Thomas'\nwere saved by the excellent boot of\ntheir fly-half, who was greatly\nhelped by the wind in the first half.\nHalf-time came with IC having won\nthe lion's share of possession in the\nscrum s, and, thanks to eighth man\nSteve Parker, a fair amount of line-out ball too; St Thomas' were quick\naround the field, however, and the\nloose ball quite often went their\nway. The second half was as hard\nfought as the first, and the last 45\nseconds saw some frantic defence by\nthe hospital side as IC pressed\nforward.

Although consistent\nresults were achieved, the tactical\nadvantage held by the Birmingham\nteam due to the light and variable\nnature of the wind ensured their\nsuccess. Helms Richard Brimelow,\nApostolos Leonidhopoulos and\nGareth David sailed well, and\nFresher helm Richard Jarman sailed\nconsistently, but all lacked the fine\nedge needed.\nIn a second series of races the\nladies team had their first match of\nthe season. Helms Jenny Bingham,\nSam Page and Helen Morgan all\nsailed well, showing great promise\nfor the rest of the season and future\nyears, but were also unable to pull\noff a victory.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday November 21st19863 Residences\nSince the rape in Hamlet Gardens\nearlier this term, IC's accommodation and security problems have\nattracted public attention fairly\nconsistently. Few of the issues raised\nare new, however. Security in student\nresidences is lax, and some rooms are\npoorly maintained This is not\nbecause College in unconcerned, but\nbecause it is not a sufficiently high\npriority when it comes to tha\nallocation of funds. Until a serious\ncriminal incident occurs, together\nwith all the bad publicity this entails,\nSherfield is happy to let students cope\nwith shabby accommodation, because\nit is not seen as an important factor in\ndissuading students from coming to\nCollege. The collapse of a roof in\nHolbein House, which quite\nconceive ably could have resulted in a fatality, was met with a pitiful lack of\nconcern. If IC Union can achieve\nanything this year, it should hammer\nhome that the state and number of\nstudent residences are unacceptable.\nI understand that measures may be\ntaken to divide the role of the Student\nServices office, so that the am big io us position of welfare organisation and\nrent collector are resolved If so, I applaud the changes; one can only\nwonder why such a scheme was not\nadopted a year ago.\nRag\nRag Week is now in its closing stages,\nand, from what I have heard, this year has been very successful financially.\nIt is a little sad that the party-type\nevents, such as the Beer Festival\nreceive most support from students,\nwhereas the number of \"direct\ncollecting\" events are getting fewer. I would urge all those who have\nattended and enjoyed any of the Rag\nWeek events so far this week to\nattend the VSO collection tomorrow,\nand persuade the general public to\nsupport the Rag charities.\nLetters Page\nI am very please that so many\npeople should feel moved to write to\nFELIX(we have not been able to print all the letters this week). At the same\ntime, I have been quite amazed by\nsome the correspond ance. If in future we receive as large a post bag as this\nweek'sI am going to be considerably\nmore selective in choosing which\nletters should be printed This may\nupset a number of people who seem to\ntake th attitude that FELIX shou dl guarantee to publish their scribbling s. Some of the letters I have received\nhave no purpose other than to\nintroduce the authors name. These\nwill not be included; if\ncorrespondence is nothing more than\na personal attack and a repeat it ion of\nsome stale argument then I shall\nsimply forward it to the person or\npersons for whom it is intended.\nFELIX\nI am still very pleased to meet\nanyone who is vaguely interested in\ncontributing to FELIX. I appreciate\ncomments that the paper has been a little dull recently, and this issue is\npart icu lal ry thin.

    "content": "Phoenix Centenary. .1886198a Next week\nmarks the\ncentenary of\nthe oldest\npublication at\nImperial\nCollege, the\nPhoenix. To\nmark the\noccasion a programme of\nevents has\nbeen\norganised,\nwith lectures,\nparties,\ndinners, and,\nperhaps most\nimportantly, a careers\nseminar for students who\nwish to\nbecome\njournalists. By\nChristopher\nEdwards and\nDavid Rowe\nPHOENIX HG Wells and\nthe early history\nIn December 1886, Herbert\nGeorge Wells founded the\nScience Schools Journal. In\n1890 it became the Royal\nCollege of Science Magazine\nand in 1904, the Phoenix. This\nfateful decision, to call it the\nPhoenix, has set the character\nof the magazine's history ever\nsince. It has been destined to\ndie occasionally during its 100\nyears, only to rise again,\ngloriously, from the ashes.\nHG Wells was editor for\nthe first four issues. He\ncontributed regularly until\n1893, and made his final\ncontribution, an appreciation\nof Huxley, in 1901.\nTime Machine\nWells is best remembered\ntoday for his works of science\nfiction. Among his novels,\n'The Time Machine' is one of\nthe best known. It was\npublished by Heinemann at\nthe end of May 1895, but this\nclassic story has a very\ninteresting history behind it.\nThree different drafts were\npublished before the\nHeinemann edition, and the\nfirst of these appeared in 1888\nin the Science Schools Journal\nunder the title 'The Chronic\nArgonauts'.\nWells later came to regret\nthe publication of this early\ndraft, which appeared in three\ninstallments: some years later\nhe bought copies of the\njournal containing his work\nand destroyed them.\n\"Fortunately he did not lay\nhis hands on the copies which\nare now in the possession of\nImperial College Archives\nand contain all of his nine\ncontributions,\" says Steve\nMarshall, editor oi Phoenix in\n1980.\nMarshall published 'The\nChronic Argonauts' in its\nentirety for the first time in\n1980, together with new\nillustrations by Paul Williams.\nStrike threat\nOn the occasion of the\nPhoenix's Diamond Jubilee in\n1946, some wag looked to the\nfuture and contributed a 'report', taken from the Times\nof 10 November 1986:\nThe students of the Imperial\nCollege of Science and\nTechnology were concerned\nyesterday in a scene\nreminiscent of the days of\n\"ragging\" of the violent 1940s. They claimed that their\nworking hours did not leave\ntime for attendance at the\nLectures of the Professional\nInstitutions and at Scientific\nDiscussions, these activities\nbeing, of course, the main\nrelaxation of the college.\nConsequently, it has been\ndecided to strike for the 80-hour week.\nThe author was clearly\nconfident that the Times\nwould still be going in 1986:1\nwonder if they were as\nconfident that the Phoenix\nwould also have survived.\nBut the author in 1946\ncould have known nothing of\nFELIX: that didn't appear\nuntil December 1949. Its\nappearance was to change the\nnature of the Phoenix\nprofoundly. From being a magazine containing college\nnews as well as literary works,\nit has gradually shed the\nformer role as FELIX has\nmatured. Originally published\nseveral times a term, Phoenix\nnow appears only once a year.\nBut Phoenix and FELIX,\noriginally in competition, now\ncomplement one another. \u2022\nph\noem x The boss: HG Wells, the\nfounder of the magazine\nStaff: An early meeting of the\neditorial staff of the magazine\nScientists\ncan't write\nDespite the efforts of Phoenix\neditors throughout the 100\nyears of its history, people still\ncriticise scientists for their\ninability to write. Someone\nwho knows more about this\nproblem than most is John\nMaddox, editor of Nature\nmagazine. Every week he\nhandles hundreds of papers\nsubmitted by scientists who\nhope to have their papers\nincluded in the prestigious\njournal. And although the\nscience may be good, the\nEnglish is often difficult to\nread, unclear and ambiguous.\n\"What is the problem?\"\nyou may ask. Scientists are\nemployed to \"do\" science not\nto write about it. But a brilliant idea or discovery is\nuseless unless it can be\ncommunicated to others, both\nfellow scientists and lay\npeople.\nJohn Maddox feels strongly\nabout the subject, and so his\nlecture on Tuesday, provocatively entitled 'Scientists\ncannot write to save their\nlives', promises to be\nentertaining and thought\nprovoking.\nThe lecture takes place on\nTuesday 25 November at\n12.45pm in the Read lecture\ntheatre, Sherfield. To get to\nthe Read theatre, take the lift\nto the level five of the\nSherfield Building. Admission\nis free.\nThis lecture has been\norganised jointly by Phoenix\nand the Imperial College\nDepartment of Humanities. \u2022\nFree\ncareers\nseminar\nfor\nbudding\nwriters\nInspired by John Maddox's lecture on Tuesday, thousands of IC students will\ndoubtless be eager to become\njournalists. The careers\nseminar on journalism on\nWednesday 26 November is\nconveniently timed for these\nbudding writers.\nThe seminar, which is free,\nwill take place in Mech Eng\n220 at 1.00pm. Among those taking part\nwill be ex-IC students who\nhave made their career in\njournalism. Also present will\nbe:\n\u2022Shiona Llewellyn, an IC\ncareers adviser who used to be\nmanaging editor of Radio\nTimes and Time Out \u2014 she\nwill talk about the business of\njournalism, and career\nprospects;\n\u2022Wynford Hicks, a freelance\njournalist who also lectures in\njournalism at the London\nCollege of Printing;\n\u2022Nina Hall, science correspondent of the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement, soon\nto become science editor of\nNew Scientist \u2014 she will deal\nwith science journalism in\nparticular.\nBut the emphasis of the\nseminar will be on the\naudience \u2014 so feel free to\ncome prepared with a long list\nof questions if you wish.\nRemember that there are\nliterally thousands of\nmagazines and newspapers in\nthe UK, and many of them\ncarry scientific material: they\nneed science graduates who\ncan write. But there is no need\nto feel constrained to science\njournalism: one IC graduate\nworks for Socialist Worker,\nanother is Belfast correspondent for Hot Press, the\nIrish music paper; and\nanother works for an occult\nmagazine.\nComing to the careers\nseminar doesn't guarantee\nyou a job in journalism \u2014 but\nit will explain some of the\npitfalls to avoid, and may give\nleads that you can follow\nup. \u2022\nTUESDAY\ni Centenary lecture,\nRead lecture theatre,\n12.45pm. 'Scientists\ncannot write to save\ntheir lives' - a lecture\nby John Maddox, editor\nof Nature magazine.\nAdmission free.\nWEDS\nCareers seminar, Mech\nEng 220, 1.00pm.

A party\nto launch the Centenary\nedition of Phoenix, with\nfood and drink.\nFRIDAY\nGrand Centenary\nDinner, 170 Queen's Gate, 7.00pm for\n7.30pm. The highlight\nof the week, with fine\nwines, good food, string\nquartet and jazz band\nfor just \u00a315 each A few\ntickets are still\navailable from the\nFELIX Office.\nBack to the\nfuture: the next\n100 years\nThis time next week, the\nCentenary Phoenix will be on\nsale, but already preparations\nwill have to begin for the next\nissue. The magazine has\nchanged a long way from its\noriginal format envisaged by\nHG Wells in 1886. Originally\nintended for treatises and\ndiatribes on scientific matters,\nbearing the banner of 'no\narticles of a light-hearted\nnature to be submitted', it\nsoon became transformed\ninto a form more creative than\nlogical.\nRecently, after its\nres sure c tion in 1980, Phoenix\nhas become an annual\noccur en ce, but now we are\nhoping to make it more\nfrequent \u2014 at least one each\nterm. But this can only be\nachieved if you write articles\nor submit artwork. Articles\nneed not be short stories or\npoetry; there is always scope\nfor satire and comedy,-features and critiques. Also,\njust because we are at a science\ncollege there is no need to\navoid talking about science\n'out of hours' in Phoenix \u2014\nbut having said that, don't write up your latest problem\nsheet. The stranger a subject\nis, the more likely it is to be\ninteresting.\nSubmissions should be sent\nto the Phoenix editor, at the\nFELIX Office, as soon as\npossible.\nCentenary issue: The\ncover of the Centenary\nedition of Phoenix\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday November 21st19867 Courtney\nat Kings\nWhen Courtney Pine appeared\non stage at Kings College on\nNovember 14th he was greeted by a packed hall consisting of devoted\nfollowers and other curious to see\nwhat was so great about this British\nsaxophonist who, if the press is to\nbelieved, is destined to become one\nof the all-time greats of jazz.\nAs soon as he started playing it\nbecame clear. Pine is a brilliant\nmusician and he was backed by\ntalented piano, bass and drum\nplayers. The set consisted of modern\nand traditional jazz as well as rearrangements of traditional African\nmusic, and a selection of music from\nhis recently released debut album\n'Journey to the Urge Within'. The\nsheer variety and energy of Pine's playing kept the audience swaying\nfor two hours and he was met with\ncontinually e static applause.\nJazz is more conducive to a seedy\nnight-club than King's Nelson\nMandella Hall, but the atmosphere\nwas electric. Courtney Pine has an\nalmost naive approach to\nperforming, he was gen u in ally surprised that anyone present had\never heard of his album, and then\nexplained that 'this piece had to be\nthe last' because he had to get the\nnight-bus home! However he\nshowed no sign of nerves and clearly\nenjoyed every second of the show.\nPine is a talented player and\nwriter (he penned much of 'Journey\nto the Urge Within') and this,\ntogether with his down to earth\napproach leads me to believe the\ncritics. Although he has played in\nLondon alot recent iy, for example\nat the Camden and Soho jazz\nfestivals, time may be running out\nfor you to see him as, apparently, a move to New York is likely soon.\nIt is often easy to appreciate\nrecorded jazz as it is to appreciate\nlive, but Courtney Pine does have\nthat extra dimension that makes it\nwell worth scouring the listings for\ndetails of any of his future live dates.\nLiz Holford\nBLACK VENUS Black Venus by Angela Carter\nPublished by Picador \u00a32.95\nThis is an exciting set of eight\nstories, original, witty and daring,\nby the woman who helped write the\nscript for 'A Company of Wolves'.\nThese tales are all very innovative\nand different-there is the one about\nthe runaway girl from the\ntransportation colony in America\nwho lives with the Red Indians, or\nthe son of a Yorkshire chef,\nconceived during the cooking of a lobster souffl e. Another strange\nstory concerns a girl who, as a baby,\nwas taken by the wolves who ate her\nfather, and reared by them. When\nher human relatives find her again,\neight years later, her wolf-like howls\nrouse the wolves to rescue her.\nThe whole book is full of interest,\naction, odd characters and\nimagination-ordinary surroundings\nwitness exotic happenings. This\nwould make an ideal Chirstmas\npresent for anyone under 45, or with\na certain flexibility of mind.\nBlowing the Blues\nI.C. Dramatic Society\n'After The Fall\" by Arthur Miller.\nTue Dec. 2nd Sat Dec 6th Union Concert Hall 7.30pm Thurs/Fri/Sat \u00a32.00\n\n"
