It seems as\ni hough Tim Booth, lead singer of the band,\nhurt his neck after his manic on stage antics.\nOasis have become the first band to censor\nthe growing number of fans' websites dedicated to them on the Internet. The group's management company are working with the official\nOasis Homepage to ensure unofficial websites\ncarrying copyrighted lyrics, sound files and\nphotographs comply with their requirements.\nPrimal Scream have finally confirmed that\ntheir summer tour is to go ahead. However,\nthe original intention of a national big tent tour\nhas been abandoned after local licencing laws\nproved insurmountable, although the London\nand Glasgow dates will be held in big top\ntents.\nUrusei Ycrtsura were forced to cancel a gig\nin Bari, a port town in Southern Italy, after\ndeath threats from the local Mafioso last week.\nGuitarist Graham Kemp said, it was going to\nbe a communist gig, but the Mafia gave the\nguy who booked\nthe gig a message ]\nj^ fn yg say in q* that if it\nwent\nahead,\nIThis\ncommunist band\nfrom Scotland would be in danger'. So basically to avoid getting shot, we decided to pull it.'\n23059?\nTRICKY\nShepherds Bush Empire\nI clamber out of the mens. There's a band on\nstage, and as it begins to strike me that ifs not\nthe band that was there when I left, they\nlaunch into a soul-shattering ly perfect rendition\nof Overcome. Tricky had arrived.\nWeird gig. Stung somewhat by the stigma of\ngoing to the Empire alone when my plus one\nplus sed out, I'd parked myself into the\nshadows at the back of the stalls\nand settled into a couple of\nmelancholy beers. Gazim\naround as the place fille c up I'd become increasingly aware of my own\nmon adic state against\nthe apparent eup ho ria-in-companionship\nof others.\nIt was with such a sinking mood that I missed almost entirely the support act,\nencased in my own\nthoughts. What little I saw did not impress,\nthough since the wooden\nplatform on which I sat resonated in excess of the PA's ample output, it would be only\ncharitable to note that I was unable to\nhear them in their full glory. For Tricky, I took to\nthe floor proper.\nEverything you'd ever expected/demanded\nof Tricky, everything Maxinque lead you to\nbelieve you deserved only to be thwarted by\nPre-Millenium Tension, everything was here\ntonight, in spades - grave digger's spades. It\nwas dark, it brooded, it rang the halls with\ncrunching basslines as Martine floated angelically above (pointedly diss a pea ring off stage\nfor the more evil bits). Occasionally returning to\n'old favourites' like Black S/ ee/it dealt\nmainly with songs from Tension, but\nbending them about each other\nto suit the moment, currying\nsongs together with remarkable ease. The crowd\nwere lost, and took to\nswaying to the chaos,\nnot dancing to it.\nIt strikes me in reflection how strangely cy li cal the gig was, with\nthe recently released\nMakes Me Wanna Die\nbeing revisited several\ntimes during the night,\neach with more be ze rk energy from an increasingly a gita ed Triky (half the\ncrowd in front of me and I still\nfelt threatened). I 've never seen\na man's head move from shoulder\nto shoulder that fast and by the end\n(strange relief when it came) his trashing of the\ndrums was less ac liche, more a concession.\nHe could have eaten them.

Sympathy for the defeated candidate came from Sarah Thomas who\nsaid: \"I really do feel for her and\nknow how hard it is, to run a campaign and lose.\" She went on to\ndescribe the embarrassment of failure and \"having it broadcast college\nwide - it's horrible.\" Ms Thomas, the\nlosing candidate in the March\nDP(C&S) race, discouraged speculation as to her being a candidate in\nJune commenting that \"after last time\nI think that it's time to get out.\"\nPaul Brown, IC Radio Chair and\nan ICU Council member, also\nexpressed compassion for Ms\nBunston saying, \"I think that it's a shame, I think that she did quite a good campaign.\" Mr Brown suggested that her defeat could be accounted\nfor by her reticence in expressing her\nown convictions saying, \"I think that\nif she hadn't been quite so un-opinionated she would have been all\nright.\"\nIt is unclear what would happen if\nNew Election were to win for a third\nsuccessive time in June, with suggestions that the current ICU President\nwould be asked to act as a 'care-taker\nPresident' for the Summer. Mr\nAllsop confirmed that he would\nprobably accept such a request say-ing, \"I'm quite prepared to give as\nmuch assistance as I possibly can\",\nbut insisting that he would prefer to\nreturn to his PhD.\nElection\nAnalysis\nSince 'New Election' was introduced\nfor the 1989 sabbatical election, students have called for the re-opening\nof nominations only twice. Before\n1989 the only way to register protest\nas to the quality of the candidates\nwas by voting as an 'abstention'.\nThe most recent time that a candidate failed to get elected in the Spring\nElections was in 1993 when Max\nJalil trailed New Election by 145\nvotes (727 to 582). This poll was the\nold position of Hon Sec (Events),\nbefore the two separate Deputy\nPresident positions were created.\nIn the June 1993 rerun Charles\nLeary, who had withdrawn from the\nMarch election, took the position\nwith one of the lowest every\nturnouts, managing to gather only 82\nvotes. This was enough to see him\nhome as New Election only managed\nto a measly 32 first preferences.\nThe 1990 election for the Deputy\nPresident post was won by New\nElection as well, when the single\ncandidate was rejected by a margin\nof 103 (603 to 500). Ben Turner suffered a similar fate to Max Jalil when\nSt Mary's powered in with over 170\nvotes for reopening of nominations.\nHowever Mr Turner was election\nthe following May when he overcame two other candidates, Spenser\nLand and Graeme Littler, in another\nlow turnout. This time less than 400\nvotes were cast, but with New\nElection managing just 40 first pref-e rence s, Ben secured victory after the\nfirst reallocation.\nRecords were smashed last March\nwhen Sam Baker suffered an incredible defeat at the hands of a 'well\norganised' New Election campaign.\nOver 1,000 students cast their votes\nfavour of the RON, and this easily\nsurpassed Ms Baker's paltry total of\n144 first preferences.\nMedics' power-sharing deal in doubt\nEDWARD SHIRMAN\nThe new Imperial College School of\nMedicine (ICSM) students' union\nlooks set for a difficult Summer term\nafter the two students standing for the\npresidency of St Mary's Student\nUnion were disqualified earlier this\nweek on academic grounds. The\nannouncement that the candidates'\n'academic standing' was unacceptable to the Mary's Dean was made at\nthe Medical School's Annual\nGeneral Meeting on Wednesday.\nIt had previously been agreed\nbetween the two main elements of\nthe prospective ICSM, St Mary's and\nCharing Cross & Westminster\nMedical Schools, that even though\nMary's is the smaller college its president would act as overall president\nof the medics. Charing Cross and\nWestminster also have a sabbatical\nPresident and sources from the\nHammersmith based medical school\nhave suggested that they may now\npush for the lead role in the new\nICSMSU.\nNick Carter was elected earlier this\nweek as Student Union President of\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nMedical School, along with VicePresidents Oliver Dale (Internal) and\nAndy Heeps (External). On a slightly\nlower turnout from last year, Vikram\nDahr was chosen as Secretary and\nSally Price as Treasurer.\nNext year's Royal School of\nMines Union Executive is also now\nknown, with the only candidate,\nDavid Bowers, scooping the position\nof President with all of 68 votes.\nAlso elected were Martyn\nButtenshaw, with exactly the same\nnumber of votes as Mr Bowers, and\nKirstin MacKinnon, who had the\nlargest appeal, managing 80 first\npreferences.\nAlex Ashworth scraped in as Pit\nEditor, with the largest new election\nvote against him. The influential post\nof Academic Affairs Officer will be\njointly filled by Debbie Middleton\nand Ewan Laurie, who secured 60\nvotes in their victory.\n\n"

    "content": "20 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 23RD MAY FELIX SPORT\nNice yacht, but too many punters\nCourse Croisiere EDHEC (CCE) is\nthe biggest student event in Europe.\nOriginally just a student regatta, C CE now includes the Trophee Terre, an\nevent involving a multitude of land-based sporting activities, as well as a recruitment fair for the sponsors who\ntake advantage of some 6000 students present, including those from\nEDHEC (Ecole Des Hautes Etudes\nCommerciales du nord) who organise the whole event as a final year\nproject.\nThe regatta itself is open to four\nmain classes - two handicap fleets,\nfor which almost any boat from\nseven to fourteen metres is eligible,\nand three one design fleets of 1st Class 8s, Beneteau Figaros and JOD\n35s. Although some of the event is\npure fun, the sailing is of a very high\nstandard, especially in the highly\ncompetitive JOD 35 fleet, of which\nICU Yacht Club formed part. Many\nof the JODs featured professional\nskippers and tacticians and large\nsponsors, with the top two or three\nboats using the regatta as training for\nthe highly prestigious Tour de\nFrance a la Voile, a six week yachting marathon around the entire\nFrench coast - the culmination of\nFrance's most exiting one-design circuit. ICYC performed with surprising\nsuccess as we recorded results of\nbetween eighth and sixteenth out of\nforty all week. Unfortunately, the\nfirst day's racing proved to be our\nundoing. Falling foul of a subtlety of\nthe class rules, we were binned for\nboth races for using too many crew-members. At least we got our own\nback on the crew which had protested against us, beating them consistently for the rest of the week. One of\nthe best races of the regatta was offshore and at night. Nothing quite\nbeats flying a spinnaker in the dark as\nyou watch the navigation lights of\n210 other yachts over a six mile\ncourse, wondering just how many of\nthem you are beating. This night race\nended with a light show to Ride of the\nValkyries, to welcome the fleet\nhome.\nOn shore we all took advantage of\nthe amusements provided by our\namazingly forgiving hosts (usually\nfree beer for a few hours after the rac-ing). A big top had been hired for the\nevenings, where helicopter coverage\nwas displayed on huge screens high\nlighting the day's successes and the\nmany cock ups at the backs of the\nfleets. This was followed by continued partying until at least three,\nattempting to dispel the common\nbelief that the French club scene is\nstill useless, with a bass system\nwhich managed to produce ripples in\nthe water. Our ranks were usually\nswelled by a vast influx of tourists,\nlocals and supporters.\nOur plans for next year'sC CE are\nalready under way, with ICYC looking at returning with the JODs if we\nsecure a sponsor or else in the\nPhillips Whirlpool Figaros if we\ncan't. Either way, if you think you\ncan spare a week in the Easter hol s, know anything about boats, pulling\nFrench women or would like to have\nan opportunity to learn, there will be\nplenty of space next year. We would\nlike to enter a land team, and will\nneed a larger group so that ICYC can\nman a sponsor's stand and have a party crew to take over when we really do need to go to bed!\nTraining restarts next term with the\nHamble winter series for the racers\nand regular cruising weekends for the\nlazy gits. Contrary to popular belief,\nsailing is cheap so there's no excuse.\nLook out for the display on the\nWalkway for details.\nDuck: another cricket cock-up\nGRAHAM Having convinced ourselves that\nQMW I's \"can't be THAT good,\"\nthe match started with them dispatching us for 35 off the first five overs.\nA plague of bungled catches and\nclumsy fielding followed and soon\nenough, Q MW had notched up a century for hardly any wickets.\nHowever, due to a combination of\nfire y pace, tricky spin bowling and\npiss-poor bowling they slumped to\n130 for 8. Sadly our renewed optimism was short-lived when Q MW staged an annoying eighth wicket\nstand of about 70. We finally s kitt led them out for 206.\nOur innings started with a strong\nopening partnership of 2 and got\ngradually worse, with the score at 30\nfor 5 our hopes of victory grew slim.\nBut, Michael took Pete's helpful\nadvice which was, \"Don't stand there\nand defend the ball, tw at it over the\nboundary!\" to heart and cleaved a rapid 47. Poor fielding and repeated\nshouts of \"Mine mine ... Oh SHIT,\"\nplus some dainty cow-corner work\nby Ruggy left us at a respectable 105\nall out. Never mind lads.\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUMS ALBUM OF THE YEAR\nFaith No More\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE\nARE FLOATING IN SPACE\nSpiritualised\nBetween the beginning of the title song and\nthe end of the bluesy Cop Shoot Cop, there are\nseventy minutes of pure laid-back cool here.\nThis is an album that switches and changes\nwhilst constantly keeping a wall of sound at\nthe foreground and remains interesting\nthroughout. At stages, it goes through a Primal-scream-do-loaded phase (Come\nTogether\\s a good example). Here, horns and\nswathes of brass punctuate the simple\nmelodies and hypnotic droning in the otherwise organ-laden atmosphere. Then we get\nstages of Pink Floyd-ness with delayed guitars\noverlaying great organ backdrops on songs\nsuch as / Think t'm In Love.\nThere are also moments of just plain weirdness for example quite often, there are tracks\nthat end in, what sounds like, a band trashing\nall of their instruments at once. Hey, this would\nbe just fine if you want to reach some sort of\nmonumental crescendo after a triumphant\ntrack, but after about two minutes this gets\nA TASTE OF ...3RD STONE\nRECORDS VOL.2\nVarious\nThis is what label compilations should be all\nabout: 18 mostly exclusive tracks by 18 different\nartists, a generous 78 minutes long and all for\na mere fiver. However all the value for money\nin the world is worthless if the music isn't up to\nanything, so it's another triumph that the cool:\npants ratio is unusually high.\nMost of 3rd Stone's output is most accurately\ndescribed by A.R. Kane's self descriptive\nphrase \"dream-pop\": gorgeous tunes with\nadded twin k ly bits, basically. None of the more\nwell-known acts on display provide anything\nparticularly great, however - the aforementioned A.R. Kane's Cool As Moons merely\nserves as a reminder of how brain-melting ly brilliant they once were; Bark Psychosis' Murder\nCity replaces their usual intricate, jazzy sensibilities with sledgehammer noise, to no great\neffect; Spacemen 3's/ Want You Right Now\nlurches through a lo-fi narcotic haze; and, God\nhelp us, Chapterhouse give us // Won't Be\nWrong which is, of course, utter shite. Ifs thus\nleft to lesser-known talents to provide the real\nhigh points, which is appropriate; no point in\npreaching to the converted after all.\nInsides break a3 year silence with the brittle\nAll Life Long, auguring well for their forthcoming\nnew album. No-Man's Sweetside Silver Night is\na swooning piece of romantic ising, and Fancy\nSwim by Reverberation marks them out as a kind of French Spritualized, only more clear-boring, ff\nAs far as lyrics go, Spiritualised have got it\nsorted. Literally. If Jarvls got his wrists slapped\nfor saying that he was sorted for E's and whizz\nthen singer, J. Spaceman, is just as guilty\nalthough maybe he is a little more subtle\nabout things. On Home of the Brave, for exam-ple, he talks about sometimes having his\nbreakfast right off of the mirror, or sometimes\nhaving it right out of the bottle. Fucked up\nindeed.\nThis is an album of more than just weird\nsounds and mad lyrics. It is more than a set of\nwell-timed loops and samples. It is an album\nto create a mood and an atmosphere. Ifs\nthere to be in the background-not specifically\nlistened fo. It may sound insulting to describe\nan album in that way but I'm not talking background fo just any old cocktail or dinner party. I mean those ones where it will just sort of take\non its own Identity. Ladles and gentlemen, ifs\ntime to sit back and relax...(7)\nAlok\nheaded: high on life rather than illegal sub-stances. If all this spacious dreamin ess gets a bit much there's also the likes of E.A.R. and\nOctal, whose Stairs Leading Up (Pad 21 is\nbleached-white and forbidding, the point\nwhere the dream turns nasl y and you wake up\nsweating and dry mouthed. There's even a couple of punk tunes from the subsidiary\nThem's Good label. So, while this may be a mixture of contrasting flavours ifs definitely a taste worth acquiring. (8)\nK.S. Pulaski\nIT MUST BE A DREAM\nBim Sherman\nIfs been a long time since I have been\nsup rise d by an album. I remember a few years\nago listening to Marvin Gaye's What's Going\nOn for the first time in almost disbelief that such\na great album had managed to evade my ears\nfor so long. Listening to It Must Be A Dream\nbrings up much the same sentiments. No\ndoubt, the album is not as good as What's Going On, but the way in which it sounds wholly refreshing is much the same.\nThe album is a re-work of Sherman's last\nalbum Miracle with eleven top mixers, each\nmixing a song each, brought in to give his reggae style a more upmarket dance music feel.\nOne might expect the m ish mash of mixers to\nspoil the broth, but each song compliments the\nnext perfectly as drum and bass tunes slip and\nslide among the ooze of Sherman's lyrics.\n1088/11\n2 3 0 5 9 ?\nBloody hell, they play harder than Ire mem ber. Collision is an epic opener with sufficient\nenergy and bare-faced cheek to justify f he wildly arrogant album title. It roars and\nscreams along, riding an A bomb to apocalypse like Slim Pickens, insane grin plastered\nall over its twisted face. But it's not all metal\nmayhem round these parts. Just remember\nthe irony-free cover of Easy, and then listen fo\nit blatantly\nrehashed\non the\nsoulless\nsoul of. i| She\nLoves me 11\nNot. One of FNM's strengths has always been\na refusal to toe the rock-funk line that From\nout oi Nowhere drew in the sand, but their\nexperimental is m is often hit and miss. It probably pains them to hear it, but they are usually at their best when rocking like bastards, as\non The Last Cup of Sorrow, where slabs of\nfinest Metallica are cut with scary whispering\nand monolithic bass. Naked in Front ES xJ l of this Computer is a barefoot sprint\nacross chopped glass, ticker tape drum-beats dragging you along for\nthe ride. The variable quality of the\nalbum might be due to the fact that some of\nthe band members are obviously a bit crap.\nWhen lead singer Mike Patton is left to get on\nwith it, he produces some wonderfully claustrophobic sounds. Home Sick Home lets you\nfeel the hot breath of Big Brother on your\ncheek as panic folds in around your head.\nNew boy John Hudson seems to be pretty\nhandy with an old Queensryche riff too, but\nultimately ifs not enough to lift the album\nfrom a mire of mediocre tracks that bury any\nsparks of real power. Album of the year? Not\neven close. (5)\nNorm\nWith so many others trying the cross - over\nof styles lately, you would think it might be easy\nto pigeon hole Sherman. Ifs not. The album is\ncertainly more Massive Attack than Fugees and\nmore Bob Marley than Shabba Ranks, but\ncomparisons are not what this album deserves\nas it really is a change from the norm. There's no catchy seventies samples, no needless\nanger in the lyrics and not one filler track in the\neleven. There is no doubt that I love this album.\nI had never heard of Bim Sherman before, and\nunless I keep a look out I probably will never do\nso again. This is a stunning album that every\none should own. but you will be lucky if you\neven ever hear it.(8)\nJames\nmusic\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 3 RD MAY COLUMNS 1 7\nNOTE: The views expressed here\nare not necessarily those of the\nEditor or Imperial College Union.\nCome to think of it, they may not\neven be the views of the author, it\nwould seem.\nHaving just got the b iggy out the\nway, a further raft of elections has\ndescended upon us, namely the\nConservative leadership contest and\nthe ICU equivalent. One of these is\nof direct relevance to students at\nImperial, and the other one will pick\nthe Union President. As for the for-mer, most of the news has been taken\nup by the unprecedented spat\nbetween Anne Widdecombe and\nMichael Howard. It is true to say that\nthis is precisely what the Party\nwished to avoid, despite the unquestioned amusement value of 'Doris\nKarloff describing Howard as having 'something of the night about\nhim', but I must confess that the end\nresult will probably be beneficial.\nMake no mistake, Michael Howard\nis an adept politician, a point that\neven his most ardent opponents\nwould endorse. The problem is that\nhe is deeply unpopular with the\nBritish people, and consequently\nwould consign the Conservatives to a hefty stretch in opposition. What is\nneeded is a popular, but not necessarily populist, leader. Principle is often\nsacrificed at the altar of populism, as\nSimon Baker\nhas been witnessed in New Labour\n(though you can't argue with their\nelection strategy!). Moreover, the\nparty needs a uniting leader. Given\nthe shift in the\nparty on Europe,\none would conclude that a 'right-winger'\nwas needed,\neliminating Ken\nClarke. This\nleft-right Europe\ndivide is\nimmensely dam-aging. Not for\nthe reason you\nwould expect\nme to say, but\nfrom the standpoint that if you\nare on the left-wing of the\nConservative\nParty you must y Q^g Q f be a rampant\nfederalist, contrasted with the right\nwhere nothing short of leaving the\nEU will do, or so people say. Both\nare, of course, ludicrous propositions. The European issue should not\ndivide Tories into two wings. One\nNation Toryism is not in principle\nagainst defending British sovereign-ty, for example. An acknowledgement of the value of the Single\nMarket with a scepticism of relentless harmon is ation and integration\nfor their own sake s should unite all\nthe party, not bitterly divide it. That\nsaid the split is much less evenly balanced than\nbefore the ele c tion. Taking all\nthat into\naccount, my\nmoney's on\nWilliam Hague.\nreason\nThe other election will have\nbeen decided by\nthe time that you\nread this, which\nis why I can say\nwhat I am about\nto. After the\nstunning victory\nof New Election\nlast time, only\none candidate\ndared to face\nthis fearsome\nopponent. Other commitments prevented me from attending the hus-tings, but last week's cover story and\nAndrew Dorman-Smith's characteristically excellent interview tell us\nenough to be going on with. My con-clu sion? God help us. Previous candidates at least had the decency not to\nbelieve in their crazy platforms (such\nas the brothel proposal), but this has\nthe smack of sincerity. As for the\nactual manifesto, the constant change\nand evasion makes Tony Blair look\npositively intransigent. Furthermore,\nsaying that you are not in a position\nto understand fully your principal\ncampaign pledge is laudably honest\nbut displays an aptitude for own-foot\ntarget shooting previously only seen\nin Sherfield. One point did shine\nthrough, which could go down well\nwith the powers that be. Our can di date's stance on the medical schools\nexactly mirrors the College management strategy, namely give 'em\nwhatever they want. At a time when\nthere is a genuine fear that the 'old'\nCollege will very much play second\nfiddle to the new medical boys and\ngirls, we have a Union Presidential\ncandidate, who clearly feels the same\nway. If Sherfield feared Union trou-ble-making over the mergers, their\nprayers may well have been\nanswered. Then again, New Election\ncould make it two on the trot. I, how-ever, do not predict election out-comes.\nAnd finally, let us join together and\nwish my old sparring partner Ian\nCaldwell a happy 43rd birthday.\nThough 43 is not one of the big land-marks, like 40, it is most definitely\nworth celebrating in style. Come to\nthink of it Ian, if you're looking to\nhold a big party, I have just the\nvenue...\n-/ Westminster Eye - Hamish Common\nI mm mm -Cu:I \u201e 1 / \\ C*l: \u201e 1- 1\n\"ow refreshing to\nbe able to write\n-about a Labour\nscandal for once.\nMohammed Sarwar, the\nmillionaire Labour MP for Glasgow Govan, has\nbeen accused of giving \u00a35000 to Badar Islam, an\nIndependent Labour candidate, for toning down his\ncampaign against Sarwar and concentrating his\nefforts on the other candidates. A second can di date, Peter Paton, standing as an unofficial Labour\ncandidate, has complained to the police about Mr\nSarwar's bribery.\nGlasgow Govan was one of the most bitterly\nfought seats this election, with Labour and the\nScottish National Party battling it out in this and\nmany other seats in Scotland. Mohammed Sarwar\nhas previously been embroiled in scandal, when\nthe internal Labour election for his candidacy of\nGlasgow Govan had to be re-run due to irregularities in recruiting party members just before the\nelection.. Labour have not wasted any time in dealing with this, promising to discipline Mr Sarwar,\npossibly to the extent of expelling him from the\nparty if he is charged. If he were convicted, he\nwould be expelled from the House of Commons.\nMr Sarwar for his part denies any wrongdoing, and\nis consulting his solicitors for a defamation case.\nThe Conservative Party are not surprisingly\nkeeping quiet for the moment, since their scandal\nrecord is a little to 'impressive' for them to claim\nLabour corruption. Of course their isn't any great\ninternal party corruption in Labour, nor is there\nmuch in the Conservative Party itself - rather than\nit operating as a government. Power breeds corr up tion, and Labour have not had the chance to be\nproperly corrupt yet (although their local authority\nrecord is rather worrying). In the Sarwar case, Mr\nDewar, the Scottish Secretary, has asked the\nAdvocate-General to investigate the case, taking it\nfar higher than it would be done usually. All the\nrelevant people got their\nsay too, with the Home\nSecretary, Jack Straw saying that with a breach of|\nparliamentary rule, the law\nwould have to take its\ncourse. The Chief Whip\n(responsible for discipline\namong other things in the\nparty) informed Mr Sarwar\nthat no disciplinary action\nwould take place yet.\nOf course Labour can do\nwithout this sort of scandal\noccurring so soon in a parliamentary term, but Blair\nwill have to accept it as\npart of the job as Prime\nMinister. If Mohammed\nSarwar was charged and\nexpelled from the party or\nthe Commons, it may work\nto Labour's advantage in showing that they are prepared to keep their own house clean, having spent\nso much effort in criticising the Conservatives'. Mr\nSarwar may find himself as a victim of a zealous\nLabour administration, but allegations of corruption in a General Election, even if for only one seat\nare one of most fundamentally serious that can be\nmade, and if it was true, most of the Commons,\nincluding Labour Members, will be glad to see the\nback of him.\n(A Beyond the blue horizon,\nLies an island filled with pain,\nAn island fr ought with discord,\nWhere dark depression reigns.\nThe journey to this island,\nFilled with pleasure and delight,\nIs short, and soon forgotten,\nOnce the island is in sight.\nYour arrival there is sudden,\nAnd the time spent there so cruel,\nHere, self-pity, all pervading,\nTurns all sane men to fools.\nThough departure may be possible,\nThe timings dim and distant,\nSo pack for the duration,\nFor the island is insistent.\nX A "

    "content": "careful when standing on the two planks which separated\nyou from the toilet pit and the possibility of standing knee-deep in shit. You could watch the sun set over Rethymno\nas you stirred your typical meal of pasta in the al fresco\nkitchen.\nMy fellow volunteers included Germans, French,\nAustralians, Scandinavians, Britons and Israelis as well as.\nGreeks. Between us we covered the 11 km of beach where\nthe mother turtles nested. There are several other nesting\nsites, all with teams of volunteers, on a few of the other\nislands (the most important site in the Mediterranean\nbeing Zakynthosl and the mainland of Greece and Turkey.\nIt was mid August and hatchlings were emerging each\nnight from their nests buried in the sand where the moth-er's had laid clutches of about a hundred eggs two\nmonths earlier. I was sad to have missed the amazing\nexperience of witnessing a mother turtle coming ashore\nto nest but saw plenty of the cute hatchlings. After hatch-ing, the young turtles dig their way up through a foot of\nsand and lay torpid just beneath the surface until a drop\nin temperature triggers them to emerge under the cover\nand less dehydrating conditions of darkness. They scramble over the sand like little wind up toys, using the reflection of the moon on the sea to direct them to the watery\nworld where, if they're very lucky, they will live for perhaps\na hundred years. Females are mature at around twenty-five years and, somehow, they manage to return to the\nbeach from which they hatched to lay the next generation\nand repeat a cycle which has been going on since the\nage of the dinosaurs.\nHowever, if care is not taken they may have the same fate\nas their extinct relatives. The older citizens of Crete can\nremember a time when the beaches turned black with\nmasses of hatchlings. The recent development of tourism\nin this area is gradually turning them white again.\nMother's are deterred from coming ashore at night by\nbeach furniture left out and the noise from hotels, ta vem as and couples bon king on the beach. The nests are\nat risk from vehicles and being stabbed with umbrella\nstands. Hatchlings confuse the lights of the hotels with the\nsea's horizon and wander around until they dehydrate.\nPropellers and fishing nets maim and drown adult turtles.\nFortunately there are organisations like the STPS which are\nmaking an effort to ensure the survival of the loggerhead.\nTheir work is both scientific and practical. The volunteers\nset off before dawn and search the beach for nests laid in\nthe night. The number of eggs are counted and then protective cages are placed around the nests. Mother turtles\nare tagged after they have finished laying so that individuals can be recognised again and their movements\nrecorded. They have a rescue centre which rehabilitates\ninjured turtles and returns them to the sea. The STPS are\nalso trying to stop the problem at its source by working\nwith local people such as fishermen and hoteliers and\ngiving slide shows to tourists at night. The work's hard but\nvery rewarding.\nSo if you're looking for something constructive to do this\nsummer I can think of one organisation who want to hear\nfrom you.\nFor more information,\ncontact:\nThe Sea Turtle Protection\nSociety of Greece,\n35 Solomou Street,\nGR -106 82,\nAthens,\nGreece.\ntravelogue\n\n"

His mental state throughout is questionable -drawing continual cartoons and living in the loft (ala\nShallow Grave) cannot be normal, however it is unsurprising considering considering the aura of death that always\nhovers around him.\nAs the perpetrator commits his crimes, we travel with\nhim, seeing how\nthe teachers\nteased him in\nclass or how\nthey were the\nshattered idol of\nhis wet dreams.\nOn this journey\nwe see flashes\nof his family life;\nsister whom he\nidol is ed, father\nwhom he worshiped and\nmother whom\nhe misses the\nmost.\nIt is hard to tell\nwhere exactly\nhis unbalanced\nmental state\noriginates from;\nthe novel gives a constant juxtaposition\nbetween family\nand schooling\ntrauma, within which it is impossible to place exact\nmotives. What is clear is the perpetrator's self-centred-ness, \"Yours are the only stories that interest you\" and\n'They were out there, people of importance...because of\nme\" being Iwo prime quotes which sum up much of the\nActs of Revision\nMartyn Bedford\ncriminal's attitude.\nUltimately this book is\nsubtler than merely being\na diatribe of violence.\nThrough school experience, it explores the way nothing\ncan be absolute.\nFor example an\nelectron is both a particle and a wave - both\nthese statements\nare correct. This\nis a lesson many\nof those at IC\nwould do well to\nheed; \"the\nobsession with\nfacts\" is not the\nonly way of think-ing.\nThis novel is\nwell written and\na flowing read -however it does-n't live up for one\nmoment to the\nscreaming blurb\non the front\ncover. \"Wildly\nfunny\" - not at all,\n\"A disturbing\namount to think\nabout\" - well, maybe a bit, but not much.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 23RD MAY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 19\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nEdited by David Roberts\nFair, free and\nopen to all? Union = apathetic\nDear Felix,\nIs it just me, or is the Union rapidly becoming a \"them and us\" set-up?\nLook at the evidence - who else\nhas seen the photo of our President in\nthis year's prospectus? Does the\nUnion really believe that a rugby\nplayer looking like an extra from Just\nWilliam is a true representative of\nICU in 1997? I for one do not feel\nrepresented by this image - I don't want everyone to believe that ICU is\nsome \"rug ger bugger\" extension of\nEton. Could we not have found a picture that shows the cultural diversity\nthe Union claims it represents?\nThe other thing I 've noticed from\nthe two sets of Presidential Elections\nthis year, and from overhearing\nrecognised Union types discussing\nthe candidates, that neither uncontested candidate has been seen as\n\"suitable\" by the established clique.\nAsk yourself - would the two New\nElection campaigns have been quite\nso vigorous had the uncontested candidates been from within the\n\"group\"? I'm not entirely sure they\nwould. When the Union claims to\nrepresent all it's members, how can\nso many decisions be made behind\nseemingly closed doors?\nOr am I just being paranoid?\nA Swift (Mech Eng II)\nFirstly, the content of the College\nprospectus is not under the Union\ncontrol. The College do ask the\nUnion to contribute some material,\nbut they decide the format them-selves. Secondly, decisions aren't made behind locked-doors -they're made at meetings which\nany ICU member is free to observe\n- but pitifully few do. The dilemma\nis that at present those who do regularly attend have a strong \"hack\"\ninfluence, and thus have a strong\ndesire to concentrate power upon\nthemselves.\nMs Bunston received an extreme\ngrilling at Hustings, purely\nbecause yet again the large majority of those attending were from\nthis group. The problem is how to\nbreak down this pattern - and\nmake ICU's decision making bodies (primarily Council and Exec)\ntruly representative of IC students.\nDear Felix,\nHaving attended the Resident's Viewing of the drawings for the\nRoyal Albert Hall's expansion over\nthe next five years tonight, we are\ndismayed to note that no-one from\neither Exec, Council, or officers of\nICU as a whole were there to represent the student body. Given that the\nbuilding work will be going on\nthrough each year until 2001 (cr eat ing an excessive amount of noise in\nthe process) we found it distressing\nthat the only official representatives\nof those affected were the few students and odd warden from Beit and\nLinstead Halls.\nSurely with the planned expansion\nto Beit and the Union building following Biology's departure - and\nhence large amounts of students\nstudying here during May and Junesome official presence would be\nexpected? Is our Union apathetic\nenough to ignore the plight of these\nstudents, or is it just another example\nof the poor service we receive?\nConcerned students of Beit Hall\nYou are indeed right. There\nshould have been a representative\nof the Union there.\nAn apology\nDear Felix,\nI would like to apologise to Simon\nBaker, Alex Feakes and Andy\nThompson for my childish prank in\ndefacing last week's edition of Felix.\nI am a silly two nk and promise never\nto do it again.\nYours with deepest regrets,\nAntoine\nAnd don't do it again, or you'll be\nto bed with no supper. Mr Baker\nwas exceedingly upset.\nAnd finally...\nDear Felix,\nI completely agree with your article entitled 'Dogs on Campus' on\npage 4 of issue 1087 (last week's). There are far too many, especially\nin Geology.\nLater,\nEdd\nI guess that counts as humour\ndown the Mines.\nLetters may edited for content or length.\nThe deadline for letters for the next issue is Tuesday 27th May.\nLetters may be e mailed to: felix@ic.ac.uk\n^ T f ELIX\nStudent Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\n\"Seconds away, round three.\"\nHere we go again. Two weeks of\num ming and ahh ing by may-be-might-do candidates before a rush of\nlast minute nominees dash around\nthe Union to get their required twenty second ers. It's not a very stable\nstate of affairs, and not one which\ninspires much confidence in the running of the Union.\nNevertheless, unless a firm candidate with firm ideas steps forward,\nthe students who vote will not like to\nsee their Union deposited into the\nhands of \"Oh alright, I 'll do it\"\nPresident from the Union 'clique'.\nThe surprisingly high turnout for\nthis second ballot perhaps emphasises the strength of feeling in this matter (though not suggesting that Ms\nBunston is part of that 'clique').\nMr Swift, (letters, right) makes\nthe point that any successful candidate requires the blessing of this\n'clique' lest they receive the full\nblast of an active New Election cam-pai gn.I am not sure that this is necessarily true. Previous elections have\nbeen fought between members of\nthis so-called clique, thus perhaps\nnullifying the benefit of being\n'anointed'. Additionally, any clique\nis a constantly jostling sea of egos,\nso two such candidates would be\nsplitting the 'clique' vote.\nThis leaves us needing a President\nwho is not seen to have been put up\nto the job and who is strong and\ncapable. Applications to the nomination papers opposite the Union\nOffice.\nThere are two conflicting strands\nhere. Mr Swift complains that\nun favoured candidates are the victims of \"vigorous\" New Election\ncampaigns, designed to sway the\nfloating voters of Imperial College.\nBut, given that the majority of the\npeople who vote are 'involved' in\nsome way with the running of the\nUnion and therefore know who to\nvote for, New Election must influence very few people. Providing he\nhas faith in the Union's impartiality\nand ability to conduct the elections,\nthen surely the student's themselves\nare capable of deciding who would\ndo a good job.\nWhat he does get right, though, is\nthe fact that many decisions seem to\nbe made behind the Union's closed\ndoor. To a certain extent this is true,\nnot many people outside the 'clique'\ndo know what is going on; the blame\nlays partly with Felix for not being\nbroad enough in its coverage, but\nmainly with the student officers and\nthe students they represent.\nThese meetings are open to all.\nGo and see your Union in action and\nsee if it works!\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

Made for around\n\u00a320,000 this first film by 23\nyear old Emma-Kate\nCroghan features a day in\nthe life of five Australian\nstudents. Every element of\nstudent life is included,\nfrom searching for ac como dati on and sex to trying to\ndodge lecturers owed\nwork. Unfortunately the lack\nof money behind the film\nsometimes shows and\nthere's not that much to it,\nbut the characters are all\nendearing and ifs an\namusing way to while\naway an hour or so.\nBeavis And Butthead Do America Okay, so it isn't exactly\nShakespeare but then anyone\nwho goes to see a film with\n'Butthead' in the title wouldn't really be expecting that would\nthey?\nFor the uninitiated, Beavis\nand Butthead are two American\nteenagers with a very basic\nvocabulary and sense of\nhumour. To put it bluntly, they\nmake Anthea Turner look in tell i gent. You may have caught\ntheir animated TV series on\nMTV of Channel 4 but now they\nare invading the country\nthrough the medium of film.\nThe story, such as it is, centres\naround the catastrophic theft of\ntheir TV, eventually leading to the duo finding themselves\ntravelling across America with the FBI hot on their trail. Did\nI mention that Beavis has a vial of deadly virus sewn into\nthe seat of his pants?\nAs you can imagine, this is hardly taxing on the brain\nand that is probably the strong point of the film.

Chicago's Natural History Museum is\nthe setting for a battle of\nwits between an evolutionary biologist and the\n\"Kathago\", an evil DNA\nconcoction of reptile, insect\nand human. Humourously\nhandling extremely\nmacabre scenes such as\nbeheaded victims this is\ns uprising ly enjoyable stuff.\nThe cat-like monster, when\nit finally comes out from the\nshadows, is refreshingly\ndifferent to the usual variation on Alien, and would be\ncute if it didn't have such a fondness for certain parts\nof the human brain.\nDespite a slightly disappointing ending, the joyous\nway in which each victim is\ndispatched means this is\nrecommended therapy for\nexam stress.\nsj mk Beavis and Butthead on their tour of America. Wonder what they're laughing at?\nyou were seven. You'll either leave the cinema at the end\nand find yourself shouting 'full cavity search!' at the next\nperson you meet or you'll have left the cinema five minutes into the film wondering who on earth would want to\nwatch such puerile rubbish.

Visually st rik ing, this multi-Oscar winning epic is full of symbolism and\npoignant images, such as young American POWs being\nforced to play Russian roulette by their captors. This was\nthe first film to tackle the sensitive issue of Vietnam and\ndoesn't shy from portraying the insanity of the war. The\nleads put in incredible performances, as does Meryl\nStreep as De Niro's girlfriend. It was justly given an Oscar\nfor best picture in 1978 and, since it is now available in its\noriginal widescreen format, deserves to be in any self-respecting movie fan's video collection.\nEqually as visually impressive as The Deer\nHunter is the less well-known The Mission\nStarring with de Niro is Jeremy Irons as an\neighteenth century Christian missionary\nattempting to convert a South American\ntribe. De Niro plays Mendoza, who was once a slave\ntrader but is now also a missionary, and the film centres\non the struggle between the two for the leadership of a converted village. It won a deserved Oscar for cinematography in 1986, but there is something missing which is\nprobably why it failed to win the best picture award for\nwhich it was nominated. The director is unable to make\nus care for either of the missionaries, so when the film\nreaches its climax with a battle between the two the viewer is unconcerned who wins.

My luxurious ferry docked at Rethymno before dawn and pandemonium ensued as tourists arrived and Cretans returned\nfrom the mainland along with lorries of food and livestock,\nall disembarking in the darkness amid the futile whistles\nof a couple of policemen. I made my way to the seafront\nthrough the old port's narrow streets. When I arrived I was\nrudely awakened from my naive dream of an idyllic\nstretch of sand as the sun rose over the beachside t aver nas and the stragglers from the previous night staggered\nback down the littered street to their hotels to recover until\nthe sun sank again. I realised why the loggerhead was\nfighting a losing battle in trying to nest on these beaches.\nI took a bus to the STPS campsite 5 miles along the coast\nroad. A short trek brought me to an olive grove in the hills\noverlooking the sea. Thirty or so tents nestled in the shade\nof the trees, their inhabitants snoozing between being\nwoken by the occasional thud of an olive falling on the\nroof.

The design brief for the crack\nresearch team working on the pro-j ect, code named \"Project Magic\",\nwas \"functionality, novelty and\nexclusivity\".\nPhil Evans, Beverage Research\nProgramme Manager, reported, \"We\nlooked at a whole range of concepts -including windowed bags, pouches\nand even see-through bags, but the\ntetrahedral shape scored highest by\nfar for all three of the aforementioned\nattributes.\" To verify this, PG Tips\nenlisted the expert help of Imperial's Dr Marquis. As a member of IC's Thermofluid section, Dr Marquis\nstudies fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer, making him\nthe obvious choice for this momentous task.\nDr Marquis claims that the innovative bags are the currently the closest thing to ideally shaped tea bag.\nHe said, \"The processes that go on\nwithin the tea bag are a lot closer to\nwhat happens when you brew tea in a pot.\" To test the bags, Dr Marquis\nand his team apparently employed\nthe latest virtual reality computer\nmethods to enable them to investigate the liquid flow process involved\nwhen a tea bag brews. \"We back-lit a typical brewing container with a tea\nbag in it and then we made a video\nfilm so that we could actually see the\ntea coming out of the tea bag\"\nexplained Dr Marquis.\nA fundamentally important aspect\nof the brewing process is the rapid\ncirculation of liquid through the bag.\nIn this respect the tetrahedral bag is\nparticularly successful. Kevin Potter,\nPG Tips beverage development man-ager, explained the advantages of the\nnovel bag. \"First of all, the natural -3D shape of the pyramid bag means\nthat it acts like a mini tea pot, giving\nthe tea 50% more room to move than\nconventional 2-D tea bags. Secondly\nit floats just below the surface just\nlike an iceberg allowing much faster\ntransfer of the tea liquor\". As a result\nof this the bags provide a whopping\n15% more flavour over a40 second\nperiod, although quite how this was\nestablished remains to be seen.\nDr Marquis' research has indeed\npaid off and PG Tips are reaping the\nfinancial benefits of some well\nfounded research, as increasing numbers of people are turning towards\ntheir tremendous tetrahedral tea bags.\nMeanwhile, Imperial College leans\nback and sips its tea, basking in the\nnational coverage that this project\nand its novel designs have brought.\nAlbert Hall expansion plans go public\nLILI TC HE ANG The Royal Albert Hall is planning a major reconstruction in the hope of\nimproving facilities for future audi-en ces. The Albert Hall, a grade one\nlisted building, will be expanding to\nrational is e its loading areas and to\ndevelop a more open foyer to accommodate small exhibitions, talks and\nconferences.\nMuch of the work is to comply\nwith the minimum foyer space\nrequirements for refreshment and circulation space in a public arts build-ing, but also to lessen the impact of\nlate night loading and unloading for\nthe local residents. This will help the\nAlbert Hall remain competitive in\nrelation to venues such as the\nBarbican centre and others around\nLondon.\nThe main reconstruction will\ninclude building an extension to the\nsouth entrance, which can be used as\nadministrative space for the running\nof the Hall as well as providing a larger box office area and a refreshment area.\nOther changes include the possible\nreplacement of the Hall's famous\n'sonic mushrooms', installed in the\nsixties to improve the acoustics, in\nfavour of a design similar to the original ceiling design. This is likely to\nincorporate a concave shape in order\nto reduce echo. Additional insulation\nin the ceiling will reduce noise emanating to the surrounding residences.\nCirculation space will be further\nimproved by opening the basement\nrooms around the south-side\nentrance, along with the introduction\nPHOTOS: LILI\nThe Royal Albert Hall (top), as seen on an average English spring morning.

An\noverwhelming preference was\nexpressed in favour of reopening\nnominations for the position of ICU\nPresident.\nThe result was announced in Da\nVinci's on Tuesday evening, to the\nlargely uninterested masses competing in the Bar Quiz. The declaration\nwas delayed when the returning of fi cer, current ICU President Eric\nAllsop, was unable to find Clare\nBunston. Over 600 students came out\nagainst the single candidate, with Ms\nBunston receiving just 123 votes.\nOn hearing the news of her comprehensive defeat, Ms Bunston's only comment was \"New Election\nwon easily\", before leaving the\nUnion Building with her boyfriend\nLuke Moralis, a defeated candidate\nfrom last year's Presidential\nElection. Before the result was\nannounced, Ms Bunston rejected the\nidea that she might be stressed, insisting that \"I'm one of those people\nwho believe in fate.\"\nNomination Papers were posted\nfor the second re-run at 9.30am on\nWednesday morning, with the constitution specifying that the must stay\nup for ten College days. With a Bank\nHoliday during following fortnight, it\nlooks likely that the election campaign itself will be limited the subsequent to seven days, with voting\naround the 16th and 17th June.\nWhen Felix went to press, two\ncandidates had already signed up.\nPHOTO: ULI Clare Bunston, smiling in the face of defeat last Tuesday evening.\nLaurie Tweedale, former Opsoc\nChair, proposed by Sarah Thomas,\ncurrent Council Chair, had 17 second ers. Mo Dulloo, President of the\nThe Result\nNew Election 644\nClare Bunston 125\nRCSU, has also signed his name, but\nhad no proposer or second ers on\nThursday afternoon. Paul Brown,\ncurrently IC Radio Station Manager,\nhas confirmed that his PhD supervisor had agreed to let him take a year\nout from his studies, and was seriously considering standing.\nOther candidates who may yet put\nthemselves forward include Omar\nKheir, who withdrew from the first\nPresidential election. He denied that\nhe would be a candidate for the June\nballot, but suggested that he would\nbe a nominee \"not next time, but the\ntime after that.\" Both Al Hussein,\none of the two candidates who withdrew from this election, and Guarav\nMisra, another object of speculation,\nwere unavailable for comment as\nFelix went to press.\nWith the Mary's vote falling by\n74%, Sami Ansari, the St Mary's Student Union President, commented\nthat the SU did not put pressure on\nmembers to vote in a particular man-ner, but \"let it drift.\" This was despite\nreports that second year students had\nbeen heavily press uri sed into voting\nfor New Election. Mr Ansari also\npointed to the fact that many 3rd and\n4th year students are away from college on electives and that others currently have exams.\nThe leader of the medics emphasised that inter-campus wrangling\nwas of lesser importance to \"getting\nas much as we can from admin\", and\nthat Imperial College needs \"a very\ncontinued on page two\n\n"
