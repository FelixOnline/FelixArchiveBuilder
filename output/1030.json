Consider\nthe set of positive integers\n(1,2,3....). Set theory s tafe s that this set, alt be ugh infinite has the same size as the\nset of even integers\n(2,4,6...). The reasoning is\nthus \u2022 it is possible to write a list where by each integer is\npaired off with and even\ninteger (1-2, 2-4, 3-6 ...).\nNo matter how long you\ncontinue this task, you will\nalways have as many integers as evens. Hence the\nsets are the same size even\nthough the set of integers\ncontains the set of evens.\nThis is the difficult point.\nSurely, I reasoned, because\nboth sets are infinitely long\nit is not possible to reach as tote where one can assess\ntheir sizes or compare them.\nInfinity means too large for\nnumbers hence mathematical operations. In no way is\none larger than the other.\n1 would be interested to\nhear other peoples' views\non the subject (ie we're low\non letters).\nSandy added to the\nbird bath had the useful side effect of making the tiny refulgent\nBored?

    "content": "News\nRed Faces\nBY THE NEWS TEAM FELIX has learnt that a new\nPassive Infra-Red (IR) security\nsystem is causing more than a few problems for the Department\nof Computing. Following a spate\nof high profile thefts ( FELIX10201028) the department chose\nan IR system to cover their 'high\nrisk' areas. All of Level 4's rooms\nhave been fitted with a system\nwhich can be manually activated\nwhen staff leave their offices. The\nproblem seems to be that staff\nreturn while the system is still\nactivated. Sources in security\nhave revealed that the alarms\nwere triggered seven times\nduring a single evening last\nweek.\nDr Jeff Magee, Assistant\nDirector of the Computing Department, discounted suggestions that the system was running into difficulties. While admitting that there had been\ntwo or three false alarms, he\ninsisted that the system is now\nfully debugged and that he is\n'fairly happy' with it. Dr Magee\ndeclined, for reasons of security,\nto specify which other parts of\nthe department, in addition to\nLevel 4, are covered by the IR\nsystem.\nLocked Away\nBY RACHEL WALTERS Two men were jailed last week\nfor crimes committed at\nImperial. Cyril D' Souza was\ngiven a five year jail sentence for\nthe theft of \u00a3600,000 during his\ncareer as a St Mary's hospital\ncashier. Michael Noble escaped\nmore lightly, being put away for\n60 days having caught burgling\nthe college in February.\nMr D 'Souza was arrested in\nFebruary after 12 years of em-be zz le ment, which apparently fed\nhis gambling habit ( FELIX1006). On admitting a theft\namounting to \u00a3652,840.58 he was\nquoted as saying, \"I suppose you\ncould say I was gambling crazy.\"\nThe massive fraud was only\nuncovered when St Mary's completed an internal financial\naudit and found the irregularities. D 'Souza managed to\nspend the majority of the\nembezzled funds, leaving college\nlooking to their employee\ninsurance to make up the lost\nmoney.\nMr. Noble, who was\nsentenced at Horseferry Road\nmagistrates court last Friday, has\na record of offenses for burglary\nand theft. He is reported to have\ncased Imperial College twice to\nestablish what he could steal\nbefore actually being spotted\nacting suspiciously by a security\nguard.\n(Smoker's continues from page one)\ndealt with by the police in recent\nyears. But, stressing the 'good\nliaison' IC security have with the\nlocal constabulary, Mr Reynolds\ninsisted that students found with\n'traffic k able amounts' would 'go\nstraight to the police'.\nTerry Briley, Deputy Head\nof Security, echoed Mr Reynold's comments, insisting that he was\nprimarily concerned with the\nwelfare of the students involved.\nHe worried that students who\nleft Imperial with a criminal record might find it difficult to\nget jobs. He acknowledged that\nuse of cannabis was no more\nharmful then the excessive use of\nalcohol often seen on campus,\nFELIX but expressed his fear that entry\ninto 'the whole drugs subculture'\nwas damaging and dangerous.\nAn ex-Southside resident\nwho was caught smoking cannabis last year said that the response to the problem was un-realistic. \"Revision of IC policies\nisn't going to change anything,\"\nhe insisted. \"As soon as you get\nrid of the small time dealers,\nthey'll be replaced, and the\nepidemic will go on.\" According\nto the student, Imperial's tense\natmosphere partly explains the\nwidespread use of cannabis. He\nsaid that his former l/8 th ounce\ndaily habit 'was escapism in the\nsense that academic IC life is so\nfull of pressures.'\n\"She's Got Seoul!\" writes Rachel Walters. Lucy Chothia, Imperial College\nUnion President, jetted off to South Korea yesterday to attend the 1995\nWorld Youth Leaders' Conference. She has taken a pictorial history of IC, as\nwell as an Imperial lager glass and key rings, to add to a collection of student memorabilia that is being assembled for the event's posterity. The mass i gathering, to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, will see 190\nuniversities from 57 countries represented. The United Kingdom de leg at i has 11 student leaders from around the country, although Gemma William\nUniversity of London Union President declined her invitation in favour of th National Union of Students conference this weekend.\nMary's Turnout\nBY THE NEWS TEAM St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool Students' Union turned\nout in force this week to elect\ntheir team of Union representatives. In contrast to the\nConstituent College Unions based in South Kensington, there\nwere a number of contested\nposts, with three students vying\nfor the job of Mary's President.\nWith over three hundred votes\ncast, Sarah Edwards easily overwhelmed her two opponents to\ndecisively become next year's President, taking exactly 200\nballots.\nThe other position which\ndeals directly with Imperial\nCollege Union, Vice-President\n(External Affairs), saw a closer\nrace. Wayne Miles was still\nclearly ahead of Davina Hansen\nthough - 206 votes to 108. The\nsecond Vice-Presidential contest,\nthis time for Internal Affairs, was\neven tighter with Samantha\nAntony managing to defeat ReOpen Nominations ( RON) by\njust under 50 votes - 182 to 134.\nInformation and Educational Representative posts were\nfilled by Katie Armstrong and\nLouise Moran respectively. The\nSocial Secretary and her\nAssistant are Suzie Barnes and\nPtash Patel, and Wendy King is\nnext year's senior bar manager.\nFour posts are unfilled, including\nthe important job of Treasurer,\nwith by-elections expected to be\nheld in a month's time.\nCommenting on the results\nClaire Moloney, the current\nMary's President, expressed her\nhope that those elected would\ncollaborate with Imperial College\nUnion officials. \"I have every\nconfidence in the new Executive,\" she said, adding,\n\"Hopefully they'll work well with\ntheir counterparts on the South\nKensington site.\"\n\n"

You see, I 've been very lonely these past few long summer\nnights and have taken rather a shining to one of my\nhedgehogs. I know it can be dangerous, but the way\nher spines glisten under the lab spots and her little\nnose twitches from side to side when I insert my needle into her is just too much for me to bear.\nI know it is unethical to get too attached to one's experiments, but I can't help myself. Sometimes we\ngo for walks by the road side, or see who can cross\nslowest. I experience this exhilarating sense of pressure every time a car drives past. It's just something\nelse! We haven't spoken about sex yet, but I can tell\nthat it's on Harriet's mind. I am not very experienced\nand was wondering if you could advise me on how to\nproceed.\nLonely of Silwood\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: Well, why not? It'll certainly be a prickly poke!\nYou could try the old man's tummy tickle r( otherwise known as\nno. 88 in the Kama Sutra) - it's always been a pleasant eye opener\nfor me. Do watch out when you roll over though!!!\n^ ear, \u00a3 ) \u00ab v in \u00ab , i BECAME a professor because of all the power I thought it'd give me with\nthose nubile young scholar-esse s. Instead I have\ntutorials with dysfunctional square-eyed geeks. How\nam I ever going to release my sexual emotions?\n\u2022 OAVINASAYS: Those nubile\nyoung scholar-esse s, as you :S.V jT/f fT fT fi^^M call them, have bette - y things to do. Dream on!\nREADING your advice last week, I decided to\ntry my luck with the\nFriday FELIX lonely hearts column. I hit jackpot straightaway, as\nsomeone with wide interests and a PhD asked me\nfor a chicken curry in\nL instead. Tragically, when I arrived I just\ncouldn't pick out my\npoulet \"dish\" from all the\n\" middling height, nondescript, rather des per ate-looking\" cocks. So, if\nyou' rereading this,\nGraham, get down to\nBasics and show me your\nswipe card!\nGertie\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: Raise your\nsights! Just because he has a PhD and \"wide interests\" does-n't mean you should endure\nLinstead's fodder. Hit the high\nlife! Surely if you meet at the\nRitz there will be NO conf u sion!\nI 'VE become passionately\ninvolved with my aeronautics tutor. It's really\nconvenient, as she lets\nme off all the course work. Trouble is, I 've got\nan embarrassing fetish I haven't revealed. Ever\nsince I saw Marilyn Monroe with her skirt billowing around her waist\nI 've wanted to do the\nsame in our wind tunnel,\nwith my tutor in the\nnude, recording it on\nvideo. How can I persuade her?\nAndrew\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: I'm not sure\nthat if she catches wind of your\nideas she'll be around for the\nfinal take. My advice is to keep\nyour gusty goings-on FIRMLY UNDER WRAPS!\nI RECENTLY passed my\nLink's initiation and was\nhence looking forward to\ngreater success with the\nbabes. Karl told me that\ndrinking and running KELLY'S CACTUS-LOVE BREAKUP - BAV mW TV TWO\nLAST term I met a true\nst unna in the JCR.\nUnfortunately he left me\npanting for more, as he\nmoved on to my best\nfriend. She has suggested we share him, but I don't think so! There are\nlots more gorgeous hunks out there, and she\nshould bloody well go off\nand get her own!\nSamina\nDoC\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: What's your\nproblem, girl ie? Eyesight?\naround Beit Quad naked\nmakes you irresistible.\nBizarrely, every chick I meet now kicks me in the\nballs and tells me to \" Go get a life\". What does\nthis mean?\nTim\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: Who can say?\nChicks should be so lucky, eh?\nHOW TO\n123i CONTINUES TOMORROW UNFORTUNATELY\nRECENTLY on a Geology\nfield trip we were having a right old la ff down the pub\nafter a good days' digging\nwhen a chubby lad waddled\nover. I have to admit I'd had\na few, and I felt sorry for the\npoor blok e. So, to cut a very\nshort story short, I gave him a good time in the ladies.\nUnfortunately he's been playing poodle ever since. I can't shake him off!!!! What am I to do?\nKate\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: In these kind of\nsituations dear, you have to be\ncruel to be kind. Swallow your\npride and jump on the next\nblok e you see, hopefully while\npoodle is watching. This should\nput him off. Do try and pick a better one this time, though.\nHELP! There's a man in\nmy lab who thinks I'm a hedgehog! He keeps on\ninsisting I go for walks\nwith him down country\nlanes and jump in front\nof oncoming cars! I don't know what to do. I think\nhe might be planning some advances on me and I really couldn't bear\nany more violence ... and\noh those needles...\nHarriet H. Hog\n\u2022 DAVINA SAYS: I have a sneaking feeling you might be\ncohort ing with a highly suspect\nindividual! My advice is stay\naway girl! You don't know\nWHAT he might think of doing\nnext.\n\n"

With\nall the misery about, common people just need a good laugh.\nAnd you can be sure his mates are laughing\nbehind his hack tonight.\nNUS? Not Us!\nSO THE DISCREDITED National\nUnion of Students thinks it can\njoin ICU through the back door.\nDo we look mad? Imperial is a college full of\nbig-brained science scholars, not bird-brained arty\ntoss ers. We've fought hard to gain our unique position\nin the UK. And we won't give way, not through the\nfront door, the back door or over our dead bodies.\nHonest Imperial students can't be convinced\nwith sweet talk and fancy words. It takes good\nhard cash, and lots of it.\nAbout four hundred thousand million pounds\nwould be about right.\nA million for every loser.\nHot water for QT\nCOLLEGE'S PLANS for our famous\nQueen's Tower are certainly\nambitious.\nAnd that's just what General Custer's second in\ncommand said when was told about 'Plan B'. The Queen's Tower is for jumping off, yes. But\nthe only thing that the divers should meet is ROCK\nHARD EARTH.\nHave our bigwig bosses actually thought this\nthrough? What will IC do with all our ambitious\nunder-achievers if they are to be denied their final\nrights-of-non-splash age? If anything the Queen's Tower should be\npacked up and sold to Euro-Disneyland.\nCos with plans like these, it's obvious our\nSherfield rulers have already made the trip.\nMay 22nd June 21st Typical Gemini, you're a comp lele lightweight.

You won't need to seek attention this time, all eyes will be on\nyou. It will be a natural progression from Git to King.\nYour 'shiniest-happiest-Leo' day is Friday.\nVl'RQO\nAugust 24th September 23rd As the queen of virgins you should be able to take\nyour pick as to which tunnel of lu r ve you choose to\ngrope down. But beware, if you're too nit-picky you'll\nend up with amble reason to be as neurotic as usual.\nYour (de)flowering day could be Tuesday.\nSeptember 24th October 22nd Your normal spineless self is no more this week.\nThanks to those steroids you're well on your way to\nbecoming the channelled and determined individual\nyou always dreamed of. But adhere to good advise\nabout buying cuddly toys. They're not hip anymore\nand may result in rekindled that 'teddy i ove' infatuation which proved so embarrassing in court.\nYour letter of the week is X.

(Keep your big mouth shut too).\nThe number 3 bares great significance for you.\nNovember 23rd December 22nd Now remember, engage brain before opening mouth.\nIf you don't take heed of this advice then expect\n'tactless', 'thoughtless' and 'plain stupid' to be the\nprobable middle names fist-tattooed across your face.\nYour words of the week are 'Xanthippe' and 'Ough'.\nCSVgRJCOXfK.\nDecember 23rd January 20th Relax this week Capncorns and enjoy a bit more of\nlife than you have so far. Grab the bull by its horns\nand get together with a Taurean; find a china shop\nand leisurely paint the town red.\n'Ph' is your letter of the week.\nJanuary 20th February 1 9th You are quite simply, too mad, for this week. In fact\neccentric is too kind - wacko would be more\nappropriate. Get in touch with the real world and start\non a concentrated dosage of Lithium. Perhaps a change of vocabulary wouldn't go a miss either.\nThe word of the week for you is 'pig-headed'.\nTISCES\nFebruary 20th March 20th Wet, wet, wet. You can feel it in your fingers and feel\nit in your toes... Sort yourself out you miserable\nindividual. Stop being so soppy and pull yourself\ntogether.

Try to be less\naggressive in general. You take up a sport or join a drinking club to channel your energy into.\n'Pavement Pizza' should be your colour for the week.\nlyi wm s April 2 1 st May21 st You're a hunted individual this week - that crazy\nCapricorn is after your horns, so get running.\nYou'll find 'invisible' to be an invaluable tone.\n\\7\u00a9QD QC2 GD QQ QG QQ C?

Yet\nthis updating does throw up some\nnew social aspects for the film\nmakers to grapple with. The basic\ntheme, baseball, remains same but\nmodern day additives such as one\nparent families, foster children and\nmixed-race families are introduced.\nIf politically correctness immediately comes to mind, you'd be\nright.\nRoger is a foster child who\nbelieves the only chance for his\nfamily to get back together is if\ntheir local baseball team, the\nAngels, win the pennant. However,\nas in all sports based films, the\nteam are a bunch of no hope rs heading for bottom of the league.\nWhat they need is some divine\nintervention, so when Roger prays\nto the stars, help comes in the form\nof real angels who give the team a helping hand. (Ahhh, how sweet\nand pretty!) Also, as with all proper\nangels, Roger is the only person\nwho can see them.\nWhen the team start winning,\ntheir bad tempered, bad mouthed\ncoach, George Knox (Danny\nGlover), starts to believe the kid's visions. Roger becomes their\nessential mascot, while Knox sees\nhis team perform miracles in the\noutfield.\nAngels also stars Christopher\nLloyd as an angel called Al, wild\nand wacky as ever, and Tony Danza\nalmost un recognisable as the burnt\nout pitcher whose talent was\nabused by Knox in a previous\nbaseball team.\nBut Angels is sentimental and\nbland; Disney production at its\npeak. With $50 million taken at the\nUS box office, it just goes to show\nthat family films can still profitably\nexist even with those happy\nendings.\nSo there's really only one\nreason for seeing this film and\nthat's keeping young ones occupied\nfor about an hour and a half. \u00a9\n\u2022 B; S':\"::;V:! ordinary here, but who cares?\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n)\n. \u2022;\u2022\nto; pi \u2022\n\u2022 : down,\".\nkick b:.'!;' \u2022\nmachine head - old\nUmm.

    "content": "Incoming & Xtra Curricular\nRecord Breakers... Imperial Apathy... Calling all Clubs and Societies\nFelix 'Breaks'\nRecord\nDear Felix,\nAfter writing an article entitled\n\"Student breaks 2 UK records\",\nonly to have Felix lose it, we were\npleased to learn that it would\neventually be printed in the issue\non Friday 19th May. We were\nhowever extremely disappointed to\nfind the article, which we considered extremely newsworthy, to be\ntucked away in the middle of Felix.\nI draw your attention to an item\nwhich appeared on the front page\nof the issue of 5th May. This is a story about a girl who devised a recycling scheme for cans at\nImperial. I am amazed that a story\nsuch as this is deemed newsworthy\nenough to go on the front page\nbut that a student who breaks 2\nUK records while flying an Imperial\nCollege glider is not considered\nimportant. I would have thought\nthat a student breaking 2 UK\nrecords was news enough in itself.\nHow many other students can\nclaim this feat? That the records\nwere broken in an Imperial\nCollege glider recently purchased\nfor the club surely only adds\nweight to the argument.\nWendy Yates and Mark Sadler\nImperial College Gliding Club\nBeing a glider pilot myself, I can\nreally appreciate the feat that Pete\nMasson has achieved. Getting the\nright conditions is a rare opportunity and in using them to such an\nend, I can only take my hat off to\nPete.\nI am, however, also disappointed that Pete's record did not recieve\nmore acclaim and can only apologise for this mis-appreciation. It is\nalso worth considering the impact a gliding record will have on Joe\naverage. \"Records are broken all\nthe time why should gliding be so\nspecial?\" Well, true I suppose. The\nanswer is in finding the balance.\nUnfortunately, in your case, the balance fell towards the wrong end!\nPreponderance\nof GreyScientists\nDear Felix,\nI have been doing my best to suppress my outrage for some time\nbut I can no longer hold these\nopinions to myself. What is happening to this place - a university -a London, England university? It\nshould be a bal still ion of free\nthought, uninhibited expression, a place where the worlds future\nleaders form their values and\nmake the choice of which path\nthey will take and which principles\nthey will embrace! Not hanging\naround in dingy common rooms\nreading the Daily Mail, drinking\nwatery hot chocolate and discussing the merits of various bank\naccounts!\nWhat's happening to this place?\nLast week's pathetic election\nturnout is symptomatic of the\ndreadful dull grey ness of our stu-dents' politics. Apathy is too good\na word! Implying a deliberate general protest by non conformity, an\nhonourable idleness. This is nothing but brain death. A collection of\nover seven thousand 18-24 year\nolds and Felix struggles to fill its\npages with even the most pious of\nofferings. You are a member of the\ngroup traditionally considered the\nmost politically active and radical\nof the country. You are expected to\nfill an essential role in society - to\nchallenge, to question and to\nmake opinions be heard. This is\nthe time when your beliefs and\nprinciples are gained and built\nupon to try however vainly to\nrelieve the man on the street from\nthe power hungry and to do your\nlot to improve the world. And judging by the current feeling it looks\nas if we're destined to plunge further into control, regime, de st ruc tion, unhappiness and ugliness.\nThere. I just needed to get that\noff my chest.\nAlan Bailey,\nMech Eng Post Grad\nIt sounds like the bottle has burst on\nyet another victim of the Imperial\napathy spell. It only takes a while to\nrealise that there's more to life than\nImperial. If you don't like Imperial\nthen there's London, if you don't like London then what are you\ndoing here?\nI do agree, however, with your\npoint about students not taking\nCollege politics seriously. Is this a problem with the students or a problem with the system? I would\nsuggest the latter. Maybe the times\nof student politics are changing and\nstudents no longer feel the need to\npress their political views. Students\npoor turnout at meetings and elections is evidence to suggest this. My\nopinion is that you can't change the\nstudents but you can change the\nEdited this week by Piers Daniell\nsystem.\nHandbook\nBlues\nDear Felix,\nThank you to everyone who sent\nme their club and society information for the iCU Handbook. Those\nwho included lots of information\ncan expect to be inundated with\nnew members as new first years\ndrool at their potential for events...\nTo those of you who forgot important information like email address\nof chair being, regular meeting\nplace and time etc, tough, as all\nentries are going in as I have\nreceived them, and you will be forever tormented by the words \"I would have joined, but I didn't know how to contact them...\".\nYou all have until the Union\nOffice open on Tuesday 30th May\nto get extra information to me. This\nincludes the 60+ clubs who didn't send me anything in the first place.\nI will clear my pigeonhole sometime on that Tuesday... anything\nreceived afterwards will not be\naccepted. You have been warned!\nFrom,\nHelen-Louise Windsor\nslightly annoyed Handbook ed.\n(except with Hellenic Soc\nbecause they cheered me up)\nLetters maybe commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions. Deadline: Monday6.00 pm. Even More Revision Killers\nKeys: Music, Dancing, Cocktails, Carnival\nTo avoid Felix's editing scissors,\nI 'll be unusually brief and to the\npoint this week. So hang on to\nyour bits for a whistle stop tour of\npleasure...\nFriday - Shaft\nGet ready to dance yourself dizzy\nin a boogie wonderland, as we\nthrow caution and credibility to\nthe wind, and celebrate all things\ntacky with 'Shaft' - a night of 70's and 80's Disco and Pop classics.\nAs usual, it's free before 9pm, \u00a31\nill FELIX26 IM IV95 after, and there'sT Shirts and\nCDs for those who dress up.\nMonday - Madness\nMonday Madness - beer promotion in Da Vinci' s what do I need to add?\nWednesday - Club Spanque\nThe small, but perfectly formed\nClub Spanque 8pm11.30 pm. Infinitely more fun than a night\nin front of the telly.\nThursday - Cocktail Night\nFun with fruit and umbrellas -the ongoing saga of Da Vinci' s Cocktail Night. 5pm11 pm. Friday, 5 June - Pop Tarts\nAnd now for something at least a little bit different. ICU puts it's toe cautiously into the waters of\n'Indie-dom' (for want of a better\nword), and has a break from too\nmany 'Repetitive Beats'. So, if you\nthink we've been too DanceCentric in the past, and you want\nto hear guitars and stomp around\na bit, then prepare yourself for\n'Pop Tarts' - from Retro-Indie to\n90's pop for tonight at least, the\nworld is your oyster!\nThe Best Of The Rest...\nFriday, 9 June - Live Music\nLive dance music from our own\nstudy bands - check out posters\nfor details!\nFriday, 16 June - Carnival\nIt just keeps on growing! The line\nup for The Midsummer Night Carnival now also includes the\nchance to win a surfboard, and\nthere's a barbecue as well as steel\nbands, foam parties, Whirl-y Gig,\nbands and DJs, circus acts, chill\nout area, cocktail bar, surf\nmachine, free candy floss and\n'Bizz' soft drinks, and a2 am bar.\nAll this is yours for only \u00a35 and it\npromises to be the best night of\nthe year, so get your tickets now!\n\n"

It looked like an\nancient civilisation. But then a wheelchair bound ex-Imperial\nresearcher, Steve Hawkswing,\nrecognised the tower he'd jumped off as a student.\"\nA radical feminist group,\nthe 1C Bearded Babes, has\nclaimed responsibility for the\nillicit transfer. \"We did it last\nnight when no-one was\nlooking,\" said leader, Miss\nLucy Look-here. \"For too long\nthis phallic symbol has\nhampered our progress at IC.\"\nThe moon is eighty million\nyears old.\nNUS BID TO JOIN ICU BY H.

Speaking to FELIX, Mr Reynolds\nstressed the wider issues at stake,\nin particular how college should\nbest handle individual cases.\nMany of the students caught in\nthe past week had said that their\nmain fear was of their parents\nfinding out, and Mr Reynold's questioned whether college had\nany right to 'run and tell\nMummy that their 18 year-old\nwas caught.'\nMr Reynolds expressed\nconcern over the scale of\nmarijuana use in college. \"If we\nthrew everyone we found smoking cannabis to the wolves, we\nwould have no one left,\" he\njoked. The extent of usage in\nhalls of residence has become\nmore apparent with the\ninstallation of the new fire alarm\nsystem. Whilst the new detectors\nwill not react to cigarette use,\nthey are triggered by the ionising\nsmoke of cannabis.

    "content": "News\nUnion Moves to Halt Harassment\nBY TED W SHI R MAN The increasing number of\nharassment cases being brought\nto the attention of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) has led to\nthe drawing up of an official\nUnion policy on the matter. With\nthe previous Union sexual\nharassment policy due to expire\nthis June, it was decided that\nICU needed a comprehensive\nstrategy.\nThe new paper describes the\nprocedure which students can\nfollow if they feel intimidated, by\neither other students or staff\nmembers. It sets out examples of\nbehaviour which could be\ndeemed offensive. While encompassing both racial and sexual\nabuse, the policy suggests that\n'public or persistent unwarranted\ncriticism of performance' is also a form of harassment which needs\nto be addressed.\nThe new document was\ndrawn up by a number of Union\nofficials with the cooperation of\nCollege, who will shortly be\npublishing their own policy. The\nICU harassment regulations are\nclearly only enforceable in Union\ncontrolled areas, but students are\nexpected to adhere to it at all\ntimes.\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, has described the\nexercise as an attempt at\n'formal ising' the idea that\nharassment is offensive and that\nstudents must not misbehave in\nthis way.\nMs Chothia suggested that\nstudents could be brought before\nCollege disc ipl in aries if they\noffend outside Union premises. It\nis anticipated that the policy will\nbe advertised around College,\npossibly with concise forms\nbeing posted in the Union building.\nThe policy was formally\napproved by the ICU Council\nmeeting last Tuesday, where the\npaper was only briefly considered\nbefore being passed. The single\namendment was by Charlie Bell,\nRoyal College of Science Union\nPresident, who wished to include\nmention of the fact that the\nCCU's have welfare officers.\nMs Chothia admitted that\nshe was surprised that no other\nalterations were proposed, adding\nthat she was somewhat sorry\nthere was no further consideration of the policy.\nAnnual Meeting\nBY RACHEL WALTERS Last Friday's Imperial College\nUnion Annual General Meeting\npassed off in a record twenty\nminutes with the now standard\nsmall turnout.\nAlthough the attendance of\nabout sixty students was less than\none third of that officially\nrequired, nobody formally\ncomplained that the meeting was\nin quo rate and so the decisions\nwill still be valid.\nItems on the agenda\nincluded the election of next\nyears' Union officers and the\napproval of the present officers'\nannual reports. The seven\ncandidates who stood unopposed\nfor officer positions were ratified\nwithout complaint, with current\nRoyal School of Mines President\nVino d Fernandez gaining the\nposition of Council Chairman.\nThe new position of Equal\nOpportunities Officer was filled\nat the Union Council meeting on\nTuesday, but there are still no\ntakers for the job of Women's Officer.\nThe reports from the current\nbatch of Union officials were\npassed, and the meeting closed.\nAs the assembled crowd were\nleaving the room the chairman\nwas reminded that next years'\nsabbatical election results had to\nbe approved at the meeting. This\nwas achieved without objection.\n(Leagues continues from page one)\nadding \"we are very strongly\nenthused by it.\"\nThis year's simplified league\nis based on assessment of eleven\ndifferent criteria, including the\nquality of university teaching,\nstudent facilities and\nemployment prospects. The analysis of the top-rated\nuniversities gives results that\nshow no dramatic changes from\nlast year.\nOverall, the league shows\nthat the continuing expansion of\nhigher education is leading to a marked pressure on the lower and\nmiddle ranked establishments. In\nparticular, the availability of\nstudent accommodation and good\nstaff/student ratios are becoming\nincreasingly difficult to achieve.\nStudent housing continues to\nbe one of Imperial's weaknesses,\nwith rooms available for only\n40% of undergraduates. IC comes\nwell down the league, although it\ndoes fare better than any other\ncentral London college.\nNew procedures to grade the\nquality of university teaching,\nfrom the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England\n( HE FCE), form the basis of the\nacademic component of the\nTimes league. Although the\nHE FCE analysis is yet to be\ncompleted, Imperial has come out\nstrongly so far.\nMore worrying is the\nemployment prospects for\ngraduates: according to the\nleague tables only 46% of\nImperial's students had found\npermanent jobs a year after they\nhad left college, though a further\n35% had taken up positions in research.\ne^/o riaL Those of you who are reading\nthis newspaper in the logical\nnumerical order - I suggest you\nkeep going and return here later.\nDo not collect \u00a3200.\nIf you're Chinese, or else you\npreviously skipped ahead then\nwhat can I say? We learnt a lot\nputting together our ' Friday Felix'. Our principal lesson is\nthat tabloids are more fun!\nA common complaint\namongst FF staff was that what\nseemed easy when read in The\nMirror (and the office has been\nstrewn with tabloids this week) is\nactually very difficult to pull off.\n(Fnawr, fna wr. Ahem)\nFor instance, everyone\nthinks they can write the page\nthree blurbs, \"bouncy Brenda,\n21, etc\". But not everyone is\ncalled Brenda (and people always\nsay bouncy). Brenda never\nbounces, read the Sun and see.\nYou're working with around\nthree unchanging physical\nattributes everyday. It's harder\nthen it looks. (Fnawr fna wr..) Somebody from the real\nmedia told me earlier this week\nthat you can always tell whether\na journalist is from the tabloids\nor the qualities by their clothes.\nScruffy individuals are broadsheet chatterers whilst immaculate suited hawks are almost\nalways from the gutter.\nHmmm. I need a shave.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Wei Lee\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kote Cox\nMusic Vik Bansal\nModels The JJ Agency\nNews Rachel & Co.\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nPuzzles Tim St Clair\nS Flles Rebecca Mileham\nEight Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week J.

The film that put him there; angels.\nThis week rotation takes a shallow dive as we enter the\nrealm of that underwater purveyor of music, catfish.\n(|) blight y boys go stateside\nI have to admit that I 've never really\nhad much time for the wild hearts. Having seen them three times,\nthey've always come across as a merely more scuzzy version of the\nnow sadly defunct Senseless Things\nand yet they seemed to rake in all\nthe plaudits. The irony of it is that\nthey've now got ex-Things singer,\nMark Keds, playing with them.\nBitterness aside, their second\nIp, the cunningly and subtly titled\np. h.u.g., still doesn't manage to rub\nme up the right way. It's another\nraucous melange of punk and\ndrunk, quirky pop metal, veering\nfrom the off-beat but curiously\nmemorable ('v day'), through\ntestosterone-fuelled anthems like\n'just in lust' to epic guitar workouts\nlike 'caprice'. All above average\nstuff but it left me feeling more\napathetic than empathetic.\nNevertheless, as the newly\ninaugurated Master of the Obvious\nStatement I have to say that if\nyou're a Wildhearts' fan, you'll\nprobably love it. (6)\nFrom the Amersham Arms to\nthe apex of America - not exactly\nwhat you'd call an orthodox route\nto success. And yet, that's what\nShepherds Bush band, erm, bush\nhave done with US sales of their\ndebut album, sixteen stone,\nstanding at 800,000 and counting.\nSo do the first British band since Def\nLeppard to make it big over there\nbefore coming back over here,\nstand up under scrutiny?\nIn my book, yes. Okay, so\nthere's no denying that they sound\nlike Nirvana and Soundgarden in\nequal measure, and cheekbone-pin-up Gavin Rossdale could not\nhave sounded more like Kurt\nCobain (rip) if he'd had a voice\ntransplant. But, hey. Oasis can get\naway with sounding like Status\nQuo, so who am I to complain?\nRecent single, 'everything zen',\nis a great song in its own right and\nthe surprise is that the great songs\nkeep on coming. 'Little things' is a case in point and the likes of\n'glycerine', with its orchestral\naccompaniment, show that they can\ncome over all atmospheric in a convincingly un contrived manner\ntoo.\nA truly accomplished debut\nthen. They may have started like\nDef Leppard but let's hope that they\ndon't end up like them. (8)\nAnother album from,\nastral asia, the techno offshoot of\nold time festival favourites, the\nMagic Mushroom Band. Repetitive\nbeats, some far eastern sounds and\nfloat y female vocals all mix together\non the album, axis mundi.\nThese days though there are so\nmany bands making this type of\nmusic that you really have to excel\nto stand out from the crowd. Just\noccasionally I found myself getting\nbored with this one, but there are\nalso some fine moments which\nmore than compensate. Astralasia\nneed to progress if they're ever\ngoing to sell a million but they\nsound like they're enjoying\nthemselves and probably don't care. (6)\nThere's a surreal intro to most\nof state of grace's songs, as\nwitnessed on their new album,\n/ambo ree pop, which grabs your\nattention. Things start to go\ndownhill when the vocals kick in\nthough, and it rapidly wipes away\nany initial impressions you had.\nIt's a shame because their music is\ngood, sounds fresh and leaves you\ncraving for more stuff like the\nclosing part of 'bitter sun'. But the\nalbum left me disappointed because\nthey seem to be capable of better\ntracks. Too bad. (5) 0\nci whole\n\"Choose your favourite piece of\nLondon\" they told me. Bah!\nHumbug! And what? Tear this\nmarvellous city apart and offer up\nthe components as microcosms of\nits true glory? Sabre-toothed\nsacrilege! The very act of such\nfavour it is m dismisses the essence\nof a city which prides itself on\nbeing such a cultural imbroglio. To\nbe precise: I can't! From the tip of Canary Wharf\nto the sleazy bowels of Soho, up to\nthe trendy-treadmill of Camden\nTown and over the ugliness of\nOxford Street to Notting Hill with\nits myriad exchanges. Down to the\nriver, home to many amateur\nthespians, and then onward to the\nplush greenery of Kew gardens I, for one, won't choose! Each spot\nholds some devilish charm, or\nsome melancholy memory (yet to\nbe had?). I mean, when you can\njump in a car (if you are lucky\nenough to live with well-off flat\nmates) at 2:00am and bomb\nacross to Brick Lone's legendary\nBagel Bake for a late night snack\nand find the restaurant next door\nstill alive in true Eastend style; or\nnose around Portobello market on\na Saturday afternoon, picking your\nway through the funky clothes\nstalls, cool cafes (perchance to\nhang-out with Nick Cave?) and\noutlandish bus kers, why say 'THIS\nis my London?' Madame Jo Jo's is\njust waiting to invite you in for a night to remember and a wander\naround China Town, with a bit of\nimagination, could turn into a sordid affair worthy of a Miller\nnovel. No, I'm not being flippant,\nand I'm trying not to sound like an\nAZ guide either. My point is that I can't do without any of it. Which\nby extension implies that I can't favour any over another, lest it\noverrun my cherished diversity.\nSo I take pride in being a citizen of this metropolis and, as\nmy mood dictates, I choose an\nappropriate place for my musings.\nConfining yourself to some part or\nother is hopelessly romantic, and\nquite frankly down-right foolish.\nSo there. I'm greedy. I want it all. I can't and I won't, choose. Why\nshould I? London simply, and\nquite obviously, wouldn't be\nLondon otherwise. Ask me which\ncity in England I'd choose and\nthat's different. Well, the answer\nwould still be the same. 0\nMM FELIX the wild hearts "
