    "content": "Editorial\nStuff I forgot\nJust a little thing (don't even think it) that\nyou might find interesting. Last Thursday\nCollege released a statement (it was in\nFelix, on page 3) which basically said that\nthere's nothing to worry about as far as\nthe Iraqi embassy is concerned, and that\nwe should all be good little boys and girls\nand still turn up to lectures. Fair enough.\nThe only thing is, when Felix attempted\nto contact Angus Fraser (Managing\nDirector of College) to get a comment\nabout the statement, he wasn't in college.\nNeither was His Rectorness. Neither was\nGordon Marshall, although his secretary\nassured Felix that he would be in college\nat 3.00pm. At 3.00pm she claimed that he\n'...had been in, but was now gone for the\nrest of the day...'.\nWell, I certainly believed her. And I'm certain that it was pure coincidence that\non the first day after the 'commencement\nof hostilities' (aren't government phrases\ngreat?) none of the three most high\nranking college personnel were nowhere\nto be found. And you believe that too,\nright? Hmmmm....\nCensorship\nLast week a letter was published in Felix,\nby a person using the pseudonym 'A Real\nMan', which contained some rather, well,\ndod gy sentiments. This week Alison\nPayne, an Elec Eng PG, wrote a letter\nprotesting my decision to print said letter.\nHer letter is in this week's letters page. I have also been informed by 'El\nPresidente' Shan that Angus Fraser has\nwritten to my humble self, expressing a similar view. (I haven't got it yet, but\nShan has a copy).\nRight. Time to make a few things clear,\nI think. Reread the first paragraph of Ms\nPayne's letter (page 20, in case you're\nlazy). Therein is my editorial policy, not\njust for letters, but for any submissions to\nFelix. After that she's talking about a pet\nhate of mine: Censorship. As far as I'm concerned it sucks. Thumbs down. Should\nbe banned (subtle joke there?).\nI will print any material submitted to\nFelix, regardless of my personal feelings\ntowards its contents (for example, I think\nmuch of what has been said about the\nsituation in the Gulf is wrong, as I attempted to make clear last week),\nsubject to only two constraints:\n(i) Space\n(ii) Legal matters\nAs to the first, it's merely a matter of\nwhen the material comes in, and how\nmuch space we have left. I attempt to fit\nin as much as possible. If something\nwon't fit, as a rule it goes in next week.\nThe only significant exceptions are theme\nissues, when we plan to publish an issue\ndevoted to a certain subject. An example\nis the up-coming travel special: For the\nlast three weeks any articles, etc.,\nconcerning travel have been horded up\nto be printed in that issue.\nThe second is out of my control. I am\nlegally responsible for material printed in\nFelix. Thus, if printing it means being\nsued, and I don't feel strongly enough\nabout the subject at hand, then it won't be printed unless the situation changes.\nSorry.\nComing back to the letter in question,\nto say that it could not 'enhance or\nenliven' Felix 'in any way' is, quite\nobviously, wrong. If nothing else it has\nprompted Ms Payne's and Mr Fraser's letters, and given me a chance to rant on\nabout what I consider to be a bad thing.\nAlso, as far as this particular letter is\nconcerned, I had other reasons for\nprinting it, not just those stated above.\nNo, not as a joke (sorry Ms Payne), and\nnot entirely to show 'what a sad case\nsome of the men at IC are'. In my\nopinion the letter was extremely bigoted\nand offensive, and yet only two people in\na college of just over seven thousand\n(quite a few), only two (not many) people\nhave written in to complain.\nBlackmail. And other dirty tricks\nI'm beginning to think that College has a whole department set aside for this kind\nof thing. Perhaps there's a director for\nthem. If so he probably acts as an advisor\nto the CIA, in an attempt to make them\nmore devious and efficient.\nTwice this week people have spoken to\nme about subjects connected with college,\ntowards which they have strong feelings.\nThings which they feel something should\nbe done about. Twice this week people\nhave asked me not to use their names in\nFelix, for fear of reprisals. These events\nwere not unconnected (no prizes if you\nguessed that already).\nOne of these people has written a letter, which I have attributed to 'An Elec\nEng student'. The other has forbidden me\nto even mention the subject, for fear that\nit would be obvious as to whom I had\nbeen speaking, whether or not I used the\nperson's name.\nI agree whole-hearted ly with the basis\nof both person's feelings, and agree that\nsomething should be done about both\nsubjects. But it is a bit hard when people\nare afraid to come out in the open with\ntheir feelings.\nSo, having (hopefully) set up a suitably\nenigmatic opening, you should (hopefully)\nbe asking 'So what are they afraid of?' (I live in hope). Basically, in both cases, the\npeople concerned are worried that if their\nidentities become known to their\ndepartments their degrees may suffer.\nAnd you thought that your degree\ndepended on your academic performance.\nI'd love to think that these fears are\nunfounded. I'd love to think that all\ndepartments are impartial in their\nadjudication of people's academic\nqualifications, and separate the college\nwork of students from their extracurricular activities, whether or not these\nactivities bring the student into conflict\nwith their department. That's what I'd like to think.\nRacism\nAnother letter. In answer to any claims of\nracism in last weeks news article\nconcerning the removal of a man from\nthe union building, the termed 'coloured'\nwas used only in a descriptive sense, in\nthe same manner as the estimation of his\nage and height. No offence was intended.\nI don't feel that describing a man's colour\nimplies any racist statement, and\npersonally think that until we get over\nthe barriers surrounding the words 'black'\nand 'coloured', etc. we are far from being\ntruly egalitarian.\nStaff meeting Monday Lunch (1.00pm) Credits\nTypesetting & Printing: Rose & Andy\nNews Editor: Toby\nArts Editor: Adam T Music Editor: Sarah H Features Editor: Roland\nCartoonist: Guess!\nThe Team: Stef, James, Ian,\nBenjamin (it's ridiculous!), Bri, Seb, an\nIraqi student, Anna Teeman, Liz Warren,\nRichard, Christ!, Undala Alam\nCollators: ICSF: Massie, Steven, Stephen,\nTom, Nick, Alex, Bumble.

    "content": "FELIX reviews last Friday's carnival..\nal\n991\nFor those of you who have an\ninordinately short attention span, or are\nterminally hard of thinking, here is the\nconclusion of this report: The 1991\nCarnival was a great night out.\nIt was a drizzly Friday night with a dull\ngrey sky that looked like getting worse.\nThe skies opened soon after the doors,\nand the RCS burger stand was soon\nrained off (steamed hamburgers don't taste too good). They returned later in\nthe evening, when the rain had reduced\nto a fine drizzle.\nThe music started with a disco playing\ndownstairs with the usual tracks, slowly\nattracting people and preparing them for\nthe first band.\nBoyGirl Soup, a band of uncertain title\nwho seemed just as unsure of their music,\nhad a few problems with the sound gear.\nEvery time one of the guitarists touched a string, the speakers emitted white noise\nat an ear blasting volume. The trouble was\ncured, but the delay was enough to\nconvert a slightly bored audience into a thoroughly bored one. About one in three\nof their songs was quite successful and\nsome were even dance able, but the\nmomentum the band generated by a good song was not enough to carry them\nthrough the less impressive ones. The\ntrouble with the band was not that they\nwere particularly bad, or that their\nsongs were particularly dire, but that they\ndidn't seem to have enough material.\nInstead of picking and choosing the best\nsongs that they had written, they seemed\nto be playing everything they had ever\nwritten. A reasonable band, but I would\nbe very surprised if they made it big\ntime.\nUpstairs, in the concert hall, the Love\nKittens started playing. The lead singer\ndidn't much like us to start with, but we\ncertainly liked him and the rest of the\nband. He showed his lack of enthusiasm\nfor IC students by s lagging off the way\nwe danced. He was right, it was dire to\nstart with. Soon, though, the whole room\nlivened up, and their distinctive brand of\nheavy indie rock went down really well.\nThey were applauded so much that they\neven came on for an encore. For\nDesmond Decker\n\n"

    "content": "H Tony Benn Speaks Tony Benn MP, a leading figure in the\nanti-war movement, spoke to a packed\nMech Eng 220 on Wednesday at a meeting organised by Socialist Workers\nStudent Society and Imperial College\nUnion Labour Club. The purpose of the\nmeeting was to attempt to build an antiwar society at Imperial College.\nMr Benn, once a producer of the BBC's North American Service and well known\nfor his anti-American views, strongly\ncriticised US motives for intervention in\nthe Gulf. He claimed 'It is quite clear' that\nPresident Bush is taking advantage of the\npresent state of Soviet weakness, and\n'wants to dominate the world'. He\nenvisaged a post-war situation in which\nthe 'superpower of all\u2014America\u2014can\nbuy, bully and control people into\nsupporting their policies'.\nTo attempt to illustrate the incongruity\nof the US position, he pointed to the\nUnited States own invasion of Grenada,\nPanama and Vietnam, and its support of\nIraq's aggression against Iran. He implied\nthat the US had been manipulating the\nUnited Nations to its own end, and stated\nthat the Prime Minister, Mr Major, had\nconfirmed on Monday that UN Secretary\nGeneral Perez de Cuellar had not been\ninformed of the United States decision to\ncommence the air strike against Iraq\nbefore that strike had taken place.\nMr Benn also claimed that there was a definite link between United Nations\nresolution 242, demanding Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and\nGaza, and the UN resolution demanding\nIraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.\nIn an interview before the meeting,\nwhen asked about the escalation of the\nwar, Mr Benn replied that in Northern\nNigeria, President Saddam had been\nelected 'Man-of-the-year' in a BBC World\nMend-a Bike\nFulham, London SW6 ITD\n071-371 5867\nService competition. He criticised the\nmedia coverage of the war, and said that\nin Britain we were 'actually quite out of\ntouch'\u2014all we were seeing on British\ntelevision was a display of hardware, and\n'Kate Adie in a flak-jacket trying to look\nas if she's in danger'. According to Mr\nBenn, what was actually happening in the\nworld was a huge surge of opinion\nagainst 'the American war'. The tabloids,\nhe claimed, were being used to whip up\nhatred against the Arabs.\nHe said that Turkey had now been\nNew Hall?\nThe ex-Libyan embassy on Prince's Gate\nmay be bought by Imperial College.\nGordon Marshall, Director of Estates, said\nthat IC was 'looking at it' because it is\nwithin the campus area. He said that the\nbuilding was in 'excellent condition' and\nhas been worked on for the last two\nyears. The price is not yet known.\nA smashed window was the only\ndisturbance at the Carnival last Friday.\nThe window was broken in the early\nhours of Sunday morning when a man\npunched through one of the thick pains,\nshooting glass 15 feet across the Quad.\nHe was found by Benjamin Turner,\nUnion Deputy President, wearing a blood\nbrought into the conflict by the use of the\nair base at Inchirlik, and if it were\nattacked by Iraq, all NATO alliance\ncountries would also be drawn in.\nIraqi students under threat of\ndeportation or internment were\nencouraged by Mr Benn to get in touch\nwith a Labour MP immediately.\nMr Benn was joined in speaking at the\nmeeting by Gary McFarlane and Reem\nAbdel Hardi, both of the National Union\nof Students.\nBreak-in\nA burglary at Willis Jackson Hall was\nfoiled this week when a resident\nchallenged one of the two thieves. When asked if he was a resident, the man ran\ndownstairs to the flat that had been\nburgled.\nBoth men then fled into the garden and\ndown the Fulham Road. Giving chase, the\nresident caught one of the men.\nsoaked T shirt, formerly white. His hand,\nbadly lacerated, had been crudely\nbandaged.\nFriends and Union Staff escorted him\nout of the Quad, where he was then\ninvolved in a fracas. This was resolved,\npeacefully.\nCarnival Punch\n2\n\n"

    "content": "Rip-Off!\nDear Andy,\nMy parents were furious that my graduation photographs were, in the\nwords of the photographers 'unsuccessful'.\nThis didn't happen to just me\u2014my\ngirlfriend's photos were similarly\nunsuccessful, and I would like to know to\nhow many others this happened.\nThe company to blame are 'Camera T from Cheshire.

Whether Christian, Jew,\nMuslim or adherent to another faith, we\nmust unite in prayer to bring peace to\nthis situation and peace on God's terms.\nThis is a plea to all to pray for peace.\nThere will be a Christian prayer meeting\nto pray for peace in the gulf. This will be\norganised hopefully, by a joint body of\nrepresentatives from all the student\nChristian groups in the college and will\nbe advertised on posters around campus.\n1 would urge my Jewish and Islamic\nfriends, among others, to arrange similar\nmeetings.\nLet me finish with a thought.\n'For our struggle is not against flesh\nand blood, but against the rulers, against\nthe authorities, against the powers of this\ndark world and against the spiritual\nforces of evil in the heavenly realm'\n(Ephesians 6:12).\nGod bless you all,\nMark Randall.\nRacism\nor Fact?\nDear FELIX,\nI wish to complain about your reporting\nof the Union bar brawl (FELIX 18.1.91).

A great band,\nand well worth seeing in future.\nThe next band downstairs was Sax\nAppeal, a jazz band consisting entirely of\nsaxophones (what a surprise!) and\npercussion. They played fairly heavily,\nwith a distinct beat, presumably to make\ntheir music more popular and more\ndance able. Unfortunately they failed on\nboth counts. The music was too heavy to\nsucceed as jazz and didn't have enough\nclear melody to dance to. A pity, since\nthey had been billed in the same room\nthat the disco had been located earlier.\nSince the band failed in their\ncompromise, they scored a definite and\nresounding miss.\nNow for the high point of the evening,\nthe band that everybody came to see.\nDesmond Decker was fabulous; the\nconcert hall was packed out and\neverybody was dancing.

That said, this chicken has style,\nand was dressed in full leathers.\nSomehow all the songs seemed to sound\nlike The Israelite but the repetition didn't get boring.

There's only one way to describe\nDesmond Decker; out of this world.\nAs usual, Guilds organised the casino,\nwhich was packed (as always), and an\nalmost constant barrage of films was\navailable in the senior common room.\nTickets came close to selling out, and\nthere was very little trouble; one jerk\nstuck his hand through a window, but\nthat was about it.

    "content": "Brits Awards\n\u2014Wembley Arena, 19.1.91\nFor the second night of Wembley's own Greatest Hits Parade, the line-up promised a riot. The only night to be sold out with touts asking up to \u00a395 per seat.\nBilly Bragg Yes, in desperation to afflict as many people as possible with his dir g ant whining, Billy Bragg walked on. Most of\nWembley walked out. Obviously the\nshock of seeing him at nineteen different\nangles on the immense overhead video\nscreen was too much of a shock for\nthem.\nRide\nThe fans, b aggies and Cure-heads alike,\nbounced back for young demi-gods, Ride.\nAll bands were severely stunted by the\n20 minute set brutally imposed upon\nthem, but did not flinch. Ride gave us\ntheir schizophrenic best, including fave s Dreams Burn Down and Chelsea Girl. The\nsound was crap, but what more do you\nexpect from Wembley?\nCarter The\nUnstoppable Sex\nMachine\nOn came Carter, or did they, standing\non either side of the stage. I expected\nthem to come on and do something\ninteresting, silly me. The concept of live\nobviously being way above their heads as\neither end of the stage they stayed. The\ndrum machine launched into their first\ntrack, I got a headache and launched\nmyself towards the exit.\nGedge's bowl?\nJesus Jones get Real\nJesus Jones\nNext came the winner of The Memeber\nWho Does Nothing But Dance Stupidly\naward. Will you please welcome Jesus\nJones? Following the current trend, they\nadvertised their latest hits with a quick\nplug for The New Album( out next\nweek!). 'Back on Planet Purple, things are\ngetting Real,' but no-one cared that the\nsongs sounded the same when their\ncrazed circus gave so much to watch.\nAnd the members definitely HAD to\nwatch the guitarist's lethally flying hair.\nThe video close-ups shot at typically\ndrunken TO TPs and DEF II angles\nrevealed suitable expressions of glee,\nec stacy, insanity and, of course, blind\npanic. Good on video but boring live,\nwith none of the wildness of the early\ndays. They didn't even play Info Freakol\nNext!\nNew Model Army\nFresh from their tour, New Model Army\nhad a perfected set, if somewhat\nminiscule for such an epic band. If ever a band deserved more it was now. Between\nthem, the Cure and NMA fans had sold\nWembley out and it showed.\nThe plaintive notes of a live electric\nviolin told us we were in for this epic,\nand Vagabonds began. Slade surveyed his\nminions, just as harsh, convicting and\nuncompromising through the eyes of the\nruthless camera. He commanded the\nencapsulated crowd like a thirty foot icon\nfrom the screen dangling above. Only the\nhardest survived the sweat and violence\nof their soldiers below. They don't make\n'em like that any more! Only NMA could\nbreathe life and devotion into the sip id venue.\nThe tracks were carefully chosen, the\nbest of Thunder and Consolation, from\nthe serenity of Green and Grey to the\nclimax / Love The World and the single\n(as ever) Get Me Out.

Now the\nscreen was useless, drenched in too much dry ice and atmosphere to be seen, but\nall eyes were on the band and... Robert\nSmith's pony-tail!

No, it was\nyet another Greatest Hits Parade, all\nhighly sterile to fit as many pop singles\ninto the allot ed45 minutes. The b aggies loved it. The fans sweated. The Cure\nwere a success, but seemed a little shy at\nthey're TV glory as Bob Himself hunched\nand snarled and laughed behind his\noversize clothes and hair.\nThankfully, they were divinely allowed\nan encore to bring the festival to a close.\nWe were given Five Imaginary Boys who\nare still capable of a cult following,\ninternational prestige and a place in\ntoday's chart. And with the emotional\nflood of Disintegration, the song which\n'should have been a single', Wembley\nagain subsided into silence and waited for\nthe next legend to arrive.\nThe Cure are Never Enough\nThe Morons From Planet Purple\n\n"

    "content": "Mozart 200\n\" PP'P; Only the brain-dead or inhabitants\nof cultural wastelands such as the\nPhysics department can have failed\nto notice that 1991 is 'Mozartjahr'. We\nhave been bombarded by market speak, merchandising and hype for the last\ntwelve months and it's probably not\ngoing to stop even after December 4 (the\n200th anniversary of his death). What can\nany sensible human being do, apart from\nfind a remote tropical island without aTV station, CD player or any possibility of\nencountering Nigel Kennedy in any form\nwhatsoever?\nWell, if you must succumb to wall-to-wall Mozart mania, you could do worse\nthan the Barbican's Mozart 200 season.\nThis was put together by Jeffrey Tate,\nECO Principal Conductor, and Dr Hans\nLandesmann, Barbican Centre Artistic\nAdviser and Salzburg Festival Director,\nwho mercifully appreciate several things\nabout Mozart that stop this festival\nbecoming as sickly as a box of Austrian\nchocolates.\nFirst, a Mozart festival should be, above\nall, about his music (and I don't just mean\nEine-Kleine-bloody-Nachtmusik). The\nconcert programme consists of a chronological series, each concert\nconcentrating on one or two years of the\ncomposer's life. In this way, well-known\npieces are matched with lesser-known but\nequally fine compositions. This is a refreshing change when compared with\nthe band-wagon jumping offerings of, for\nexample, the Mozart Festival Orchestra\n(also at the Barbican on February 28th), who will be playing: the overture from\nthe Marriage of Figaro; Eine Kleine\nNactmusik; the 23rd Piano Concerto in A; and Symphony no 41 in C( the Jupiter). It\nobviously took them seconds of racking\ntheir brains to come up with that\nprogramme.\nSecond, Mozart 200 has not aimed at\ncompleteness (in the style of the Phillips\ncomplete Mozart CD collection\u2014a snip at\nSI,800). The organisers have recognised\nthat while Mozart was a brilliant\ncomposer, he also wrote to commission\nand wrote a lot of dross. If you don't believe me, just try listening to, for\nexample, the clarinet, oboe and bassoon\nconcertos. They are all good pieces of\nmusic individually, but you may notice a passing resemblance of ideas if you play\nthem consecutively. Also, do you really\nwant to listen to a piece for two flutes,\nfive trumpets and timpani (I think that's the scoring?)? The Barbican series has\nshown delightful restraint and aimed for\nquality, not quantity.\nThird, the accompanying exhibitions\nboth acknowledge the central role the\nMozart myth has exerted (the exhibition\nMozart in Art 1900-1990, which explores\nart its responses to Mozart's music) and is\ndoing its level best to debunk it. In the\nfirst part of the festival, A Mozart\nChronology unravels his biography. In the\nsecond part, exhibitions on Mozart's wife\nConstanze (not the flighty, heartless\nspendthrift she is often portrayed as) and\nMozart and Freemasonry unravel some of\nthe mysteries woven about him.\nA season of Mozart films in the\nBarbican Cinema covers varying\ninterpretations of Mozart's life, including\nthe acclaimed Noi Tre (We are three) and\nAmadeus. There are also free foyer\nconcerts by Guildhall students.\nOn the concert side, I shall certainly\nnot want to miss the March10 concert\nwhich includes the sinfonia concertante\nfor oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn and\nthe concerto in C for flute and harp. I also have to admit a sneaking desire not\nto ignore on principle the concert with\nNigel Kennedy on February 27, as that's a smashing programme as well.\nMozart 200 runs at the Barbican Centre\nfrom January 25 to March 27 and from\nSeptember 28 to December 5. For most\nconcerts, tickets cost between \u00a34 and\n\u00a315.\nLiz Warren.\nSpeaking Technically\n|: What? \u00a34.95 for a book that is only\n73 pages long sounded like a bad\ndeal, and certainly out of the price\nrange of the average student. An average\nstudent being one that has no money,\nsound familiar?\nDr Sinclair Goodlad, a lecturer at IC,\nattempts to solve all the problems that\nanyone could possibly have with\n'speaking technically'. You could be\nforgiven for not knowing if he succeeded,\nthe apparently easy-to-use book is heavy\ngoing. I tried reading it just about\neverywhere (well almost!) and I found\nGoodlad's style of highlighting the vital\npoints as '...boxed-in headlines...'\ndistracting. They are supposed to provide\na checklist when preparing the 'next\npresentation', and they do work fine on\ntheir own, just not in the text.\nThe text covers just about any possible\neventuality that could face a 'professional\nscientist or engineer'. The stress of the\nbook is aimed more towards the\nsuccessful professional (they can afford\nthe book) than the student. If you find\nyourself making the odd after-dinner\nspeech, or have difficulty with the\ntelephone this book will help. It will also\nbe useful for those whose departments\ninsist on presentations and talks, without\noffering any advice on how to do them.\nby Sinclair Goodlad\nSpeaking Technically demonstrates just\nhow bad some lecturers are\u2014recommend\nit to your tutors, they could learn a lot.\nHaving said this, there really is some\ngreat advice in the booklet that is\nrelevant. This includes advice on valuable\nsubjects such as easing nerves, and ideas\non how to prepare your work. But I really don't think that it justifies the\nexpense. However, if you find yourself\nwith some free time, I'd recommend you\ngive it a try. It might just help. Get it\nfrom the library.\nDick.\n6\n\n"

First he criticised\nthe arts as the preserve of the monied\nminority, and then demands that subsidies\nshould be withdrawn, which would serve\nno purpose other than to force the ticket\nprices up, out of the hands of even more\npeople, or even force the theatres to\nclose. The matter of subsidies is not one\nof cheaper tickets for people who would\nnot notice the difference, but of survival\nfor our main arts centres.\nTo say that 'no one gave a toss' about\nthe closure of the Barbican Theatre\nshows that Mr Bailey doesn't pay very\nclose attention to the media. For several\nweeks afterwards the papers were full of\narticles and discussion on this very point,\nand on the general state of theatre in this\ncountry. The only reason that there has\nbeen nothing since is that the subject has\nbeen condemned to the media limbo of\n'Old News'. He apparently knows nothing\nof the massive fundraising campaign to\nsave the Young Vic when it too entered a financial crisis. Solely through public\nsupport this young innovative theatre was\nsaved.\nMr Bailey also seems to misunderstand\nthe role of the arts. Only a very small\nproportion of the arts output is to\nproduce a thing of beauty solely for\nentertainment's sake. Ironically, those that\ndo are often the most successful, take for\nexample Lloyd-Webber's musicals. They\nhave little or no educational, or political\nvalue, yet are by far the most successful\nproductions in the West End. Virtually\nevery other piece of theatre tries in some\nway to question moral, political and social\nissues, to leave its audience not only\nentertained, but also educated, or at least\nmore informed of the complex questions\nthat dominate our lives. This, I suspect, is\nMr Bailey's real objection to the arts. His\nphrase 'Pathetic government bashing\nethnic fringe theatres' reveals all too\nclearly that he doesn't like the idea of\nanybody criticising or questioning his\nbeloved (extreme) right wing views. Such\ndebate, Alan, is fundamental to a democracy such as ours. Freedom of\nspeech is rather important, you know.\nHave you ever been to the theatre? Not\nall of it, if any, is performed with purely\nanti-Tory motives.\nIndeed, the only reason that the big\ncompanies need sub sidi sing is that too\nmany people have Mr Bailey's bigoted\ntype views, and are unwilling to try\nsomething different, and, dare I say it,\nmore challenging than a day at the footy.\nIf more people did try the theatre, more\nwould enjoy it, and subsidy would be\nunnecessary, because of increased\nattendance. One only needs look at the\nroaring success of the theatre in Glasgow,\nleading to its nomination as last year's city of culture to see that.\nBut I forgot didn'tI? Scots don't vote\nTory.\nYours rationally,\nPendragon.\nP.S.I heartily agree that more money\nshould be given to the NHS, but I think it\ncould come from a better source. Perhaps\nthe huge profits made by many 1st Division football clubs, or a tax on the\nmillion pound transfer fees?\nPro Censorship?\nDear Sir,\nAs Editor of FELIX, I am sure that you\ntry to print as many of the letters that\nyou receive as is possible, regardless of\nwhether you agree with the content or\nnot, in order to allow a full range of\nviews and arguments to be presented.\nHowever I feel that at some point, you\nmust exercise your editorial power and\nsay 'no' to letters which cannot enhance\nor enliven your magazine in any way.\nI refer in particular to the letter in last\nFriday's issue (Jan 18) from 'a Real Man',\non the subject of shagging.\nI assume the author wrote the letter as\na joke, to be provocative. If you decided\nto print the letter for the same reason\nthen I must object\u2014since this letter is\nobviously a( sick) joke, then anyone\nwriting in to protest will be dismissed as\na raving feminist with no sense of\nhumour. If your aim in printing the letter\nwas to show what a sad case some of the\nmen at IC are, then w hy bother? We can\nall see that by looking around the JCR\neveryday.\nAlthough it may be true that letters\nprinted do not reflect the views of the\neditor, I think that you do not do yourself\njustice if you allow complete crap to be\npublished.\nYours sincerely,\nAlison Payne, PG Elec Eng.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nAn Iraqi student presents his views on the situation in the\nThe Puppet Whc\nI would like to express my views, as an Iraqi, on the Gulf War. Before I go into\ndetail about these views, I would like to\nstress that I am, and have always been\nvehemently opposed to Saddam and his\nBa'ath regime. Now I am just as opposed\nto the USA, and the war it has started in the Gulf.\nFirstly, I'd like to present the\nbackground to the war. Whilst watching\nthe tremendous growth of economic\npower of Germany and Japan, the US has\nbeen experiencing a deep economic crisis.\nThe US felt it had to get itself out of the\ncrisis the only way it knew how: oil. An important American report had shown\nthat most of the oil fields outside the\nMiddle East were on their way to\nexhaustion, and that the only major\nsources of oil in this region for the next\ncentury would be in Iraq, Kuwait and\nSaudi Arabia. Controlling this region .\nmeant controlling the oil, and therefore\nhaving superiority over Japan and\nEurope, who rely far more on oil imports\nthan the US.\nFor a while the US maintained control\nover this region through the use of\npuppet governments and manipulation of\nthe regional balance of power. Their\nmain bases of cot nr ol were in Iran, before\nthe Islamic Revolution, and in Israel.\nThey also tried for years, without success,\nto put military bases in Saudi Arabia and\nother Gulf countries, but their lack of\nsuccess did not matter much until the\noverthrow of the Shah by the Islamic\nRevolution in Iran. The US felt it had to\nremedy this situation; it's therefore no\nsurprise that soon after the Iranian\nRevolution, Saddam got into power\n(helped by the US) and was encouraged\nto wage war on Iran.\nSaddam, with America on his side, was\nhoping to gain a quick victory over Iran,\nso that he could fulfil his dream of\nattaining regional mastery. The US, a country which does not like to see any\nstate in the Middle East gaining strength\n(with the exception of Israel) wanted Iran\nand Iraq to fight for as long as possible,\nthereby weakening both countries.\nSaddam gradually became disenchanted\nwith the US, firstly after the Israeli strike\non Iraq's nuclear installation, and later by the exposure of the Tran-Contra' scandal.\nAfter the eight year war with Iran, a war\nwhich brought immense destruction and\nloss of life to both countries, and yet\nbrought no real gains to either side,\nSaddam put pressure on Kuwait and\nSaudi Arabia to stop demanding debt\npayments from Iraq, his reason being that\nhis country suffered economically while\ndefending them from Iran. Saddam also\ndemanded payments from Kuwait for\ndropping oil prices against OPEC regulations, claiming that this cost Iraq\n\u00a314 billion annually.\nI believe that the US intended to fight a war against Iraq as soon as it saw that it\nwas getting too strong. The US saw the\ntension growing between Iraq and Kuwait\nand almost encouraged Iraq to invade.\nPrior to the invasion, the US Ambassador\nto Baghdad said that the US had no\nopinion on Iraq's border disputes with\nKuwait, and even while Saddam was\nmassing his troops on the border with\nKuwait the US was negotiating on loans\nwith Iraq. This shows that the US effectively gave a 'green light' for\nSaddam to invade, so that the US could\nuse 'the liberation of Kuwait' (liberation\nfor whom, the corrupt Sabah family or\nthe migrant workers who actually ran the\ncountry?) as a pretext for taking military\ncontrol over the region, and starting a war. Some would say that they gave\nSaddam five months to leave Kuwait, thus\nallowing him to secure peace, but the US\nrefused to compromise in any way during\ntheir negotiations. The clearest indication\nof this is their veto of the French peace\nproposal on January 14. The US knew\nthat Saddam, fearing his deposition,\nwould not leave Kuwait without a face-saving compromise.\nI think that the US wanted to avert any\nchances of a peaceful settlement, and this\nis why it refused to link the invasion of\nKuwait to the invasion of Palestine and\nits continuing occupation, a link which I and millions of other people can see very\neasily. Israel, a state created and given\ntremendous support by the West, like\nSaddam, invaded a country recognised by the UN, Israel, like Saddam has expressed\ninterests in extending its regional power.\nIsrael, like Saddam, has tried to build\nnuclear weapons, but unlike him, has\nsucceeded in building a hundred\nwarheads, some of which may be used in12 Cut His Strings FELIX\nthis war. And yet for all these similarities\nbetween Saddam and Israel's invasions,\nthe US has refused to link the two together. Some may argue that Israel has\ndone all these things for its security. One\ncould argue that Saddam too, invaded\nKuwait for his own security, although I think that this does not justify his\ninvasion, an invasion which I totally\ncondemn. 'There's a difference', some\npeople might say, 'Saddam is a brutal\nindividual, his security is not important,\nand he should not exist'. This is true\nenough, but Israel, in its present form, is\nblatantly racist and brutal, and never\nshould have existed.\nThe US, a country which gave millions\nto the Contras so that they could terror is e thousands of innocent civilians in Nicaragua, a country which backed\nPinochet, a brutal dictator, so that he\ncould overthrow a democracy in Chile,\nsays that it is fighting for democracy. I believe that the Iraqi people have striven\nfor democracy for the past 22 years, but\ntheir efforts have been su pressed by the\nBa'ath Party of Saddam, a Party which\nwas given help by the US, much in the\nsame way as Pinochet of Chile, and the\nContras in Nicuragua. For years the Iraqi\npeople have suffered under Saddam and\nhis regime, a regime armed to the teeth\nby both East and West, but their cries for\nhelp were almost completely ignored by the media and governments in the West.\nIt was not only the Kurds who suffered:\nin the South of Iraq thousands of Arabs\nliving in the marshes were gassed to\ndeath, and yet, with the exception of the\ngas attack on Halabja, all other attacks on Kurds and Arabs in Iraq, the sum of\nwhich resulted in the genocide of tens of\nthousands in Iraq, were almost\ncompletely ignored by the media. This is\nthe same media which now ignores the\n150,000 deaths in Iraq as reported by\nTurkey and Spain only two days into the\nwar. (Anyone doubting the plausibility of\nthe figure should remember that in the\nfirst two days of the war, bombs whose\ntotal explosive effect was five times that\nof the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima were unleashed on Iraq and\nKuwait). An American general said,\nbefore the war, that they 'will bomb\nBaghdad back into the Stone Age'. He was subsequently sacked, presumably for\nhaving given away the intended effect of\nthe air raids on Baghdad.\nThe truth is that Saddam was just a puppet created by the US, and now that\nthe puppet's strings have become twisted,\nthe puppet makers, discontented with\ntheir puppet, have come to do the dirty\nwork themselves.\nIf the US really wanted peace in the\nMiddle East it could get it immediately: it\njust has to stop interfering. All the major\nproblems in this region (like other regions\naround the world) have been caused,\neither directly or indirectly, by the West;\nthe creation of Israel and of the filthy\nrich oil states, the propping up of puppets\nsuch as Saddam, the conflicts in Lebanon.\nI urge all those who support the war to\nthink and learn about the history of\nWestern interference in the Middle East,\nand to engage in debate about the\nnecessity of the war, a debate which has\nbeen almost completely suppressed by the\nmedia. No doubt those of you who\nsupport the war don't like it and its\nbrutality, but feel that it is a necessary\nevil. Well, before you commit yourself to\nsupporting mass genocide, you have a responsibility to learn more about the\nissues involved.\nI appeal to all those who are opposed\nto the war to campaign against it. There\nare many people across the world who\nhave willingly died in their fight for\nfreedom of speech. You have that\nfreedom, so please don't waste it. Use it\nto stop the war before it spreads and\nbecomes far more disgusting than it\nalready is. Saddam has said that he 'Will\nleave Iraq a barren land', meaning that\nhe would gladly sacrifice all of his\ncountry and its people before he is\ndeposed. The US knows this, and quite\nfrankly, does not give a damn about the\npeople (not even their own), after all,\nthey put him in power in the first place.\nThe corrupt feudal monarchy of Kuwait\ncalled upon the US to start a war in order\nto gain their 'liberation'. I would like to\nmake a call for peace, for it is only\nthrough peace and non-interference in the\nMiddle East that the people of the region\ncan build just and democratic nations.\n13\n\n"

I felt at first that this rhythm should be\nannoying me but I liked it. Things got\nbetter; in came some excellent chunky\nguitar followed by relaxed vocals that\nmay have been happier on a slow Happy\nMondays song. These soon changed as\nthe song got louder and louder with\nchoruses of 'Sugarblast' being sc reached and gloriously over driven guitar\nscreaming in the forefront.\nThe track ends by unexpectedly\nchanging into a dreamy drug induced\nsequence of soft vocals and odd noises\nwhich lead perfectly into the next track, /\nAm The Sky, which sounds like an\nadventure into the realms of the delay\npedal. Just as the track gets going it is\nsadly faded out only to be continued on\nthe B side as an intro to the final song,\nMarshmallow Madness. This starts off\nwith some beautiful flange d guitar and\nmellow lyrics that lure you into a false\nsense of security then once again the\nguitars take over in a confusion of\noverdrive and wah-wah.

    "content": "FELIX\nAnna Teeman continues to discuss her opinions on the current crisis in the Gulf...\nWhat Can Be Done?\nWe are indisputably at war, but the\nreason why is unclear. The President of\nthe United States is himself confused.\nPresident Bush has given a variety of\njustifications for war. The cynics see this\nas weakness but the truth is that he\nbelieves every reason he gives. What he\nsays varies simply because he is\nattempting to give a particular reason at\na particular time to be in line with public\nopinion.\nAt one stage we heard that oil was the\nreason to go to war. Mr Bush said this\nnot just because he believed it but\nbecause he thought that it was what\npeople wanted to hear. It is the one\nreason that has been condemned by\npeace activists globally. The argument is\n'would the international community, or\nUSA, have interfered if Kuwait had grown\nvegetables?' The West has a history of\ninterference in the area that is based on\nit's presence at the birth of the Middle\nEast oil industry. The Western presence\nin the Middle East has been a reality for\nmany years. The West was never present\nin Afghanistan. The Western involvement\nin the Gulf War is an extension of this\nhistorical interference.\nIt can be argued that the Gulf War is\nabout oil, but on two different levels:\nfirstly, historical linkage with the West\nthrough the oil industry, and secondly, an\nattempt to protect about a quarter of the\nworld's known oil reserves. As the\nworld's energy policies stand, these oil\nreserves are vital to the maintenance of\nour modern lifestyle. The moral validity\nof Western involvement in the conflict is\nnot so easily defended on it's historical\nsetting. This interference is based upon\nwestern greed for the benefits of Arab oil.\nHow did everyday human greed carry\nthe Middle East to a conflict situation?\nThe Western Alliance with its European,\nAmerican and Arab members is at war\nwith an Arab country. The predominantly\nWestern-led Alliance is fighting an eastern\ncountry. West met East and not only\ndidn't know what to say but it didn't know what language to use. Neither East\nnor West was willing to lose face, but the\nWest was totally unwilling to\ncompromise. The Western perception of\nthe morality of the situation is of no\npractical value. Their attempts at\nnegotiation were based on a radically\ndifferent perception of the situation from\nthe Arab point of view. The West folded\nits arms and passed judgement on Iraq,\nfrom an entirely Western set of moral\nvalues. The French (admittedly a nation\nthat has reaped enormous profits from\narms sales to the Arab states and of\nArgentine Exocet fame) did attempt\nnegotiations with the Arabs on their\nterms.\nOn their political involvement and\ndiplomacy, no Western ally is blameless.\nIraq has been armed and funded by the\nWest. Iran was also armed by the West.\nIran and Iraq bought Western weapons\nand filled Western coffers. Not only did\nthe Western countries reap enormous\nfinancial rewards, but for years stood by\nand watched Arab kill Arab. Then the\nunthinkable happened, Iran and Iraq\nstopped fighting. Iraq, under a brutal\ndictatorship, still functioned as a cohesive\nunit. It seems hardly surprising that a country armed to its teeth should enter a new conflict.\nMuch has been said about one\nindividual, President Saddam Hussein, as\nif the war was solely due to him. Hussein\nis product of western greed, ineffectual\ndiplomacy and irresponsible meddling.\nThe Americans, under the aegis of the\nCIA, actively sponsored the rise of\nHussein in Iraq. Both Iraq and its leader\nare the Frankenstein creations of the\nWest.\nNow blame is allotted, where do we go\nfrom here? At the end of this war (as at\nthe end of any war) there will be a peace\nconference. At the end of the Second\nWorld War, the aggressor, Germany, was\nnot shackled or financially undermined,\nshe was disarmed but her infrastructure\nwas rebuilt and a new society was born.\nDespite the obvious inequities of the land\nsettlements that accompanied peace,\nEurope has been in a stable state for over\nfifty years and Germany has never since\nbeen an aggressor: in fact, quite the\nopposite. At a Gulf peace table the\nwestern allies will sit alongside Middle\nEast leaders. The West cannot impose\neither its morals or culture on that peace\nconference. The countries of the Middle\nEast must be the major players in the\nnegotiations and the West must act just as\nobservers, or, at most, intermediaries.\nThe only good to come from this\nterrible conflict would be a long-lasting\npeace based on solutions to all the\ngrievances of this troubled region. Such\nsolutions include the restoration of\nKuwaiti borders, Iraqi disarmament, and\nthe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian\nproblem. The role of the West is not to\ndictate how these problems are solved,\nbut to sit silently and observe, and if\nrequested, to aid communications. If we\ndo not trust our Middle Eastern\ncounterparts to sort out their own\nproblems, it is a reflection of our own\narrogance rather than the reality of the\nsituation.\nA cessation of hostilities in the area will\nprovide the Middle East with an\nopportunity to settle its problems and\nprovide the West with a route out of the\ninterference and meddling that has\ncontributed to what will perhaps be the\nbloodiest of modern wars.\n14\n\n"

    "content": "Bitch Magnet\nmm\nH Bitch Magnet is American slang for a look er,a blok e who attracts chicks\nwithout having to do so much as wiggle\nan eyebrow. They don't sound like\nlook ers. They don't sound sane. This\nband is about screaming noise and\njudd e ring sense dynamics.\nNow that the thirst for American rock\n'n' roll has died down Bitch Magnet are\nreduced to the level they know. This does\nnot mean their European tour started\nwell. On the contrary, their date\nsupporting the Wedding Present at the\nKilburn National was a wreck. For a band\nused to playing to a maximum audience\nof 200 the crowd of thousands, who\nweren't particularly interested in anything\nwithout David Gedge, was daunting to\nsay the least. To compound this, their\ntour van had been broken into and they'd lost their guitars, t shirts, cash and custom\namp.\nPerhaps unluckily their last tour\ncoincided with the sub-pop boom and\nthey were quickly picked up and\npromoted in the national music press.\nThis is a stark contrast to their recent\nsituation where the only attention was a two star review.\nBut their material is impressive and the\nnew album, Ben Hur, definitely represents\nthe quality side of American music. The\nraw power, of this, their third release is\nstrengthened by the production of the\nnoise god. Steve Albini, whose rough\nengineering and fetish for powerful beats\nand scratchy guitars is clearly audible.\nThe progression from Star Booty ('1 still\ndon't know how 1 got that guitar sound')\nto Umber and now Ben Hur is natural.\nThe rougher sounds are smoothed out\nand all that remains is the more musical\ntones without all the noise. The guitar\nsound is still crazed and Sooyoung Park's barely audible vocals still relate the tales\nof their American experience. Above all\nelse a thread of thinly conceal able violence runs through the LP. The aura of\nthe band certainly contradicts such an\nobservation and singer/bassist Sooyoung\nPark claims not to have been in a fight\nsince the age of eleven.\nIt is on the stage that the band\nsch itz oph re nic tendencies are brought\nunder the spotlight. As soon as the first\nfew riffs hang over the crowd the band\ntransform. Wielding guitars as terrible\nweapons. After opening with perhaps\ntheir least instant song, Dragoon, and\nrunning through most of Ben Hur they\nreverted to the old favourites of Star\nBooty. Although the distinctive guitar\nsound has been lost with the amp he still\nmanages to bend his strings into shapes\nwhich previously existed solely in his\nhead.\nWhat more can I say? A great bunch of\nguys who I sat and talked to for two\nhours without gleaning any juicy chunks\nof gossip and who play shit-hot American hardcore/rock 'n' roll.\nSeb.\n17\n\n"

God-squad\nfor that matter. No doubt you believe a woman should stay at home, and have at\nleast five children (condoms aren't allowed are they?) thus ballooning the\nalready huge population. Maybe that's a bit extreme but 1 really have had enough\nof religious self-righteous bullshit,\nespecially when these men (?) will never\nrequire an abortion.\nLet's talk about the Pro-Life world. The\nwoman who is raped and reminded for\nnine months of her humiliation. Who perhaps eventually takes her own life, or\ndies having a back-street abortion. And here is the bit that men cannot\ncomprehend: a woman can feel such\nmaternal instinct that she would keep the\nbaby, even though it reminds her of her\nordeal. Or more generally, even if she\ncannot properly look after it. She will\noften sub con cio us ly make the child's life\nhell.\nFor fifty thousand years, until maybe\nforty years ago, the female mind has\ndeveloped requiring different instincts to\na man's. She must show strong maternal\ninstinct, must acf submissive to the man.\nAnd free from the physical aspect of life,\nshe must develop a superior intellect vital\nin ensuring the standing of the family.\nHow any men can dare to presume that\nthey can pass judgement on abortion, a thing they cannot possibly understand,\npisses me off. However it is consistent\nwith my view of Christian hypocrites.\nDear Andy,\nIn an attempt to present an honest and\n'student y' image of College life many\ndepartments ask students to show\nprospective candidates around. These\ntours are only worthwhile if the\ndepartments can find students who enjoy\nthe course and College life and are\nwilling to guide school leave rs around.\nThe Electrical Engineering department\nseems strikingly lacking in these students.\nThe Head of Department first sent out a begging letter to second year students,\nand when this failed to rouse the troops,\na lecturer boldly stated that students who\nshowed candidates around would be\nadded to a list. He added that being on\nthis list could positively affect references\ngiven. Do 1 detect a slight hint of\nblackmail?\nBut for those of you who are undecided\nI would say this. The problem we face is\nnot so simple as the Pro Life make out.\nWhat must come from discussion is\npractical law. Even regardless of any\nmoral question, the facts are that women will always require abortion. The Irish\nalternative appears to be inhibit sex\neducation, religiously prohibit the use of\ncontraceptives, and make abortion illegal.\nBack-street abortions are reason enough\nto allow legal abortion. The law must set\nSOME time period after which abortion is\nillegal (the maximum being the time at\nwhich the baby can safely be removed\nand survive). However it is my opinion\nthat the ultimate decision should be that\nof the woman involved.\n7. 'God created man in his own image'\nonly because the bible was written by a man.\n8. Will you God fearing idiots stop\ntreating the bible as if its reliable,\nunbiased, primary history evidence. Why add '(John 3:16)' as if it proves its true?\nThe bible was written by men. Men are\ncorrupt. Why do you believe it?\nOne Christian said that God had told\nhim the bible was true. When1 put it to\nhim that Mormons say that God tells\nthem that the book of Mormon is true he\nsaid that they are ha luc in a ting. So I put it\nto him that he says that it is possible for\nsomeone to hal uci nate visions of God.\nEveryone except him that is!!\nYours,\nAthena.\nI would normally be very happy to take\npeople around, I did so often at my old\nschool, but 1 would be honest and almost\ncertainly strongly discourage most\napplicants from coming.\nThe problem is not only the Electrical\nEngineering department. Iam embarrassed when I see students being\ntaken around the Union Building, through\na probably empty and not too clean\nsnack bar, and shown the lively and\nfriendly hack bar.\nUntil I feel that I can truthfully say that\nthe course is stimulating and has an\nelement of practicality 1 shall not be\nvolunteering to take people around.\n1 have asked the editor to withhold my\nname from this article in case it adversely\naffects my references.\nAn Electrical Engineering Student.\nOn\nAN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS.\nFRIDAY Hang Gliding 12.30pm Southside Upper Lounge.

Beneath its\n' I apparent face of prosperity, the rebuilt Tokyo is sick. Unemployment\nand drugs are rife and many young\npeople have turned to motorcycle gangs\nfor comradeship and thrills.\nDuring one of the nightly street battles,\nKaneda and Tetsuo, members of one such\ngang, duel with a rival group. Around them, a riot flares. As demonstrators and\npolice clash, a terrorist escapes with a small child, kidnapped from an army-controlled laboratory. The child, identified\nonly as experiment 26, is a freak with\nextraordinary mental powers.\nNumber 26 is recaptured, along with\nTetsuo. To their surprise, the lab's doctors\nfind that Tetsuo possesses great latent\npowers rivalling those of the greatest\nexperiment of all, AKIRA. When Tetsuo is\nreleased, these powers have been\nawakened.\nAKIRA, the experiment that had to be\naborted, killed, frozen in a huge complex\nto await resurrection. He reaches out\nfrom his concrete grave and calls to\nTetsuo, his saviour, the catalyst for\nrebirth.\nAKIRA. He must be stopped or Tokyo\nwill be destroyed in a cataclysm rivaling\nthat of the third world war. Twenty-six is\njoined by the other children, 25 and 27,\nto cripple Tetsuo. He must now fight their\ncombined powers, the army, and the\nforce that is consuming his identity, in\norder to release the greatest power of all,\nAKIRA. A record 1 billion yen were used in the\nconstruction of this feature length\nanimation. Three times the normal\nnumber of cells were used in order to\ncreate the realistic style and feel\nnecessary to translate the best-selling\ncomic series into film. It works\nbeautifully.\nThe author/director/producer,\nKatsuhiro Otomo, has created a detailed\nworld with each character endowed with\na full personality. The three aspects of\nthe future; the rebuilt city, the restless\nand dissatisfied masses, and the dark but\nexciting underground, are juxtaposed\nwith frightening authenticity.\nThis film is highly powerful, with a realism never before encountered in\nanimation. The characters are highly\nbelievable, and the situation so\nconvincing that when fantastic powers\nare exposed the viewer suspends disbelief\nand concentrates on the massive struggle\nfor survival that ensues.\nDon't be fooled by this film. It is not a Tom-and-Jerry cartoon nor a Fantasia\nextravaganza. It is more in the\nBladerunner mould, set in a cyberpunk\nnear-future. At just over two hours, it is a long film, but it will hold your attention\nthroughout.\nThe best recommendation I can give\nthis film is to say that I will definitely be\nseeing this again, taking with me most of\nthe FELIX staff.\nAKIRA opens at the Institute of\nContemporary Arts (ICA) today and runs\nuntil the 7th March.

For those of you who do not\nnumber yourselves among the film\nfraternity, this is a pseudonym used\nwhenever a director declines\nresponsibility for the final cut of the film.\nSo what was done to the film after\nDennis Hopper finished shooting?\nWell, a little bit of the plot justification\ngot cut out. Anne Benton is an Artist,\nplayed by Jodie Foster (developing a nice\nline in victim roles), who witnesses a brutal mob killing. When police\nprotection proves to be inadequate, she\ngoes on the run. Milo is a professional\nhitman employed to track her down, to\ndo this he completely absorbs himself in\nhis target's lifestyle, slowly falling in love\nwith her. Eventually he catches her and\nmakes her an offer: Die, or become my property...\nThe studio appeared to have tried to\nturn this dark comedy/thriller into a straight thriller. Luckily, the attempt\nseems to have been almost entirely\nunsuccessful. It is never made clear why Anne falls in love with Milo, and what\ncameos we do see are suggestive of\nothers that were lost. The film still retains\nits disturbingly funny edge despite this\nhacking around, and is worth a visit.\nPendragon\n\u2014 Film \u2014 Book \u2014Season\nMartha Gellhom worked as a journalist for over six decades\nreporting in both war and\npeacetime. Selected articles, giving the\nfeel for a decade, have been collected to\ngive The View from the Ground.\nShe gives meaning to the statistics\nhistory is full of and conveys the feel of a people around her, in response to events\nboth famous and peculiar; or unknown\nand regular. Beyond mere factual\nreporting, she questions why things\nhappen and then postulates reasonably.\nShe has seen many countries in many\ntimes and in the pages finished so far,\nMartha Gellhom has made interesting and\npersonal, history that had become\nmundane.\nThat, above all else, makes this book a gem to read. Unfortunately it is\nsimultaneously relevant to our immediate\ntroubles.\nShe has thus given history a face at\nwhich to gaze; and which now gazes\nback at us.\nSpecial Offer\nMartha Gellhom's The View from the\nGround, was provided by the Pan\nBookshop on Fulham Road. The\nproprietors have agreed to give a discount of 1 0 % on all books, including\nany ordered books, for a trial period until\nthe end of February to all IC students on\nthe production of their IC union cards\n(except for the rare species who wish to\npay by credit card). The shop is located\nat 158, Fulham Road, London SW10\n(071-373 4997).\nUndala Alam.\nPostcards From the Edge\nj Meryl Streep plays the drug\n1\naddicted actress, Suzanne Vale, in\nthis witty portrayal of the chaotic\nlife of an aspiring Hollywood player.\nConfronted by a hard headed producer,\nGene Hackman, who tells her what's what on the film set, she disappears to\nthe comfort of an overdose.\nThe story that unfolds tells of her\ncontinuing battle to stay off the drugs and\nget her life together, dealing not only\nwith the stress of fighting her way up the\nHollywood ladder of fame and fortune\nbut also coping with her mother, played\nby Shirley MacLaine. Following\ndetoxification, the film companies insist\nthat Suzanne must stay with a 'responsible party' for insurance purposes.\nUnfortunately for her this turns out to be\nher mother and the pent-up tensions of\nchildhood soon rear their ugly head.\nMacLaine portrays to perfection the\nshow biz mother who's been through it\nall before as a musical comedy star of the\n50's and 60's. Her tone, attitude and\nexpression matches Streep's performance\nof the sometimes anxious and 'spoilt as a child' Suzanne. Their carefree airs turn\nsharply to both obvious and vicious comic\nmoments as one attacks the other about\ntheir addictions\u2014Doris about her\ndaughter's drug taking and Suzanne about\nher mother's alcoholism.\nThis encompasses the main theme of\nthe comedy, the difference between\nalcohol and other drugs - absolutely\nnothing kids, so play with both of them\ncarefully. The script, photography and\nacting (by all), one minute hurls you into\nfits and then gags you on an equally\ncomic, but tragic line. Go see it, enjoy\nand laugh, but above all look out for\nthose visual and verbal gems.\nChrist\n\n"
