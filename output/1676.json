Within minutes,\nwell-known underage\nfresherAymeric was on the\nfloor. He wasn\u2019t laughing\n(ROFL) but rather in a\nbizarre contorted sleeping\nposition. The first weeks\nof term must have really\ntaken their toll.\nAfter half an hour the\nminibus had made it all\nthe way to Hammersmith\nwhere they successfully\norganised a pick-up of a\njob-hunting alumnus. The\nremainder of the journey\nwas largely uneventful,\nexcept for a notable\npit-stop at a sizeable\nsupermarket with ID-obsessed till operators. As\nthe drowsy runners neared\ntheir destination, the dark\nWelsh roads became\nnarrower and bumpier.\nThis did not deter wannabe\nrally-driver/medic Henry,\nhowever, who breezed\nthrough the country lanes\n\u201cAs the drowsy\nrunners\nneared their\ndestination,\nthe dark Welsh\nroads became\nnarrower and\nbumpier\u201d\n\u201cOn Sunday\nsome hardcore early\nrisers opted\nfor a run up\nthe much\nsteeper side\nof Snowdon\nin\u2018Everest\nconditions\u2019\u201d\nmidnight, the revellers\ndisembarked in a nauseous\ndaze and quickly entered\ntheir accommodation for\nthe weekend \u2013 it had begun\nto rain. To describe the hut\nas bare-bones would be\ngenerous, but the runners\nwere simply happy to have\narrived before the minibus\nplunged into a Welsh\nditch.\nThe next day the squad\nawoke early, with their\nsights set on ascending the\nhighest peak in England &\nWales: the majestic Mount\nSnowdon. After a short\ndrive to a car park near the\nvisitor centre for \u201cElectric\nMountain\u201d (which is in\nfact dedicated to energy\ngeneration rather than\nsome sort of rock band),\nthe adventurers began\ntheir climb from a modest\naltitude of just 110m\nStarting out as a group,\nthey soon spread out as\nthe incline became rather\nsevere. On the ascent\nthe group passed many\nincredulous walkers, and\nalso witnessed a pair uni-cycling down the track!\nThe runners made good\nprogress \u2013 zooming past\nthe tempting caf\u00e9 without\nrest \u2013 and the leaders\nreached the summit of\n1085m in just over an\nhour, after running the\n7.5km without a break.\nAt such dizzying\nheights, the front-runners\nsoon grew cold as they\nwaited for the rest of the\nsquad. They found shelter\nfrom the relentless bitter\nwind behind the wall of the\nlarge cafeteria and station\nfor the famous Snowdon\ntrain. Unfortunately \u2013\nbeing off-season \u2013 both\nof these luxuries were\nclosed, leaving the group\nto face the harsh reality of\na long stumble back down.\nOnce everyone\nhad arrived, the team\nhuddled in a circle and\nbegan chanting to warm\nthemselves up. The most\npopular songs referenced\nthe arm span of lanky\nfresher Matt (He\u2019s Got\nThe Whole Club In His\nSpan), and claimed they\nwere in fact from King\u2019s\nCollege (Everywhere\nWe Go). After posing\nfor several pics with the\nstunning views of thick\nfog and being mistaken\nfor Coventry University\nHockey Club the runners\nbegan the daunting\ndescent.\nOn the way down\nthere were more stops for\nphotos at the route attractions such as \u201cLion King\u2019s\nPride Rock\u201d and \u201cThe End\nof the World\u201d, and this\ntime they did stop in the\ncafe, enjoying warming\nhot beverages despite the\nshocking lack of contactless payment (and card)\nacceptance.\nOnce back at base\ncamp the team annoyed a\nlocal cafe by consuming\nmostly home-made sandwiches on their premises\nbefore heading back for\nsome well-earned rest.\nThat evening, the squad\nre-boarded the minibus\nand took a short trip to civilisation in Caernarfon for\na decent firework display,\nbefore returning to the hut\nfor a night filled with the\ngame Articulate and some\nhijinks (featuring six in a\nbed).\nOn Sunday the group\nsplit into two, with some\nhard-core early risers\nopting to try a run up\na much steeper side of\nthe mighty Snowdon in\n\u201cEverest conditions\u201d of\nheavy hail and strong\nwinds. The other half\nlazed in bed before taking\na far easier run along the\nnonetheless undulating\nroads, then rustling up a\ncracking breakfast despite\nthe somewhat limited\nkitchen equipment.\nBefore long the team\nwere all showered and it\nwas time to pack up and\nreturn to the suffocatingly\npolluted metropolis of\nLondon. That night, all\nthe runners took their time\nto appreciate the joys of\nWiFi and mobile signal,\nbut vowed to return to\nsome rural, picturesque\ntrails soon.\nFor find out more about\nCross Country & Athletics, email run@ic.ac.uk.\nThe intrepid runners celebrate reaching Snowdon\u2019s summit // ICXCAC\nvery efficiently (and very\nsafely).\nArriving just after\nAn uncanny recreation of that scene from Lion King // ICXCAC\n\n"

Previous\nwinners include Ali\nSmith\u2019s How to Be Both\nand Eimear McBride\u2019s\nA Girl is a Half-Formed\nThing. If you\u2019re looking\nfor a book which marries\ndiscussion of complex\nissues like gender, race,\nsexuality, and death, with\nengaging narrative, then\nthe Women\u2019s Prize is the\nright place to look.\nThis year\u2019s winner:\nThe Power by Naomi\nAlderman\nhurt is a kind of wealth.\u201d\nThis is the sentence\nthat sums up the spirit of\nNaomi Alderman\u2019s novel\nThe Power the best for\nme. It is a novel which, at\nits centre, is about the relationship between gender\nand power. When I first\nread the novel this year it\nchanged the way I thought\nabout the world in a way\nno book has for years.\nIt tells the story of four\nprotagonists in a world\nwhere massive social\nand political upheaval\nis taking place. Women\nhave suddenly developed\nthe power of electrocu-tion, shifting the balance\nbetween the genders.\nWomen take political\noffice, start new religions,\nand become the leaders of\ngangs and mafias. Beyond\nthat, men and women must\nbegin to adjust to the new\nrelationship dynamics\nbetween them, changing\nthe way they relate to one\nanother forever.\nWhat I love about this\nnovel is that Alderman\nrefuses to take the easy\nway out in her narrative.\nThe world doesn\u2019t become\nan instantly more peaceful\nor gentle place because\nwomen are in charge; the\npower dynamics between\nmen and women remain\nnuanced, and those with\npower still abuse it. The\nPower also deals with\nwhat it\u2019s like not to fit into\nthe gender constraints of\nsociety and the pain that\ncan cause, but also shows\ncharacters finding comfort\nand camaraderie in being\ndifferent.\nI think that the genius in\nthis book is that it shocks\nus, without anything novel\nactually happening. There\nhas always been a gender\nbased power imbalance,\nand the imbalance has\nalways affected the way\nmen and women treat each\nother. However, the way\nAlderman reverses this\npower dynamic forces\nthe readers to see the\nmisogyny in our society\nwith brand new eyes. All\nthe struggles men face in\nthe book are also faced by\nwomen in parts of our real\nworld: from sexual abuse\nand harassment, to being\nunable to leave the house\nwithout a guardian. Here\nAlderman is asking why\nthis no longer shocks us.\nThis novel really asks\ndifficult questions of its\nreader: Is it possible for\na society to truly be equal\nwhen there is a difference in physical power\nbetween the genders? Are\nwomen naturally the more\npeaceful gender as they\nhave often been assumed\nto be? Is it possible to have\npower without abusing it?\nAlderman answers these\nquestions with sophistication and nuance that the\nreader will find refreshing.\nThis isn\u2019t a book where\nthe concept out shines\nthe writing, in fact quite\nthe opposite: Alderman\ndelivers on everything\nshe promises. The Power\nis likely to take the place\nit deserves as a modern\nclassic, and one of the\nmost important books\nabout gender of our gen-eration.\nBooksWriterKatie Cook introducestheWomen\u2019sPrizeforFiction,andgiveshertakeonthisyear\u2019swinner\u2013Naomi\nAlderman, whose novel The Power centres around gender and violence.\nNaomi Alderman, winner of the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction // Naomi Alderman\n\u201cWhat I love\nabout this\nnovel is that\nAlderman\nrefuses to\ntake the easy\nway out in her\nnarrative.\u201d\nThe Women\u2019s Prize\n2017 runners up: my\nfavourite pick\nAWomen\u2019s Prize runner\nup for 2017 and another\none of my favourite books\nof the year is Stay With\nMe by Ayobami Adebayo.\nSet in Nigeria in the 1980s\nand 90s, Stay With Me is\nabout a childless woman\u2019s\nsearch for meaning in a\nculture where motherhood\nis everything. It also\nexamines how infertility\naffects the main character\u2019s relationship with her\nhusband and his family,\nwho eventually persuade\nher husband to find a\nsecond wife.\nFor me, Stay With\nMe has the charm and\ncharacter of novels like\nChimamanda Ngozie Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun\n(another Women\u2019s prize\nwinner), but also provides\nthe thrill of a crime drama,\nwith many twist and turns\nthroughout. Like Ngozie\nAdichie, Adebayo is able\nto skilfully transport the\nreader to the vibrant world\nof the main character,\ncontrasting the bright and\nbustling city in which she\nlives with the loneliness\nand desperation infertility\ncan cause. This is a novel\nwhich I think will help\nmany people understand\nthe pain of infertility, as\nwell as make women who\ncannot have children feel\nunderstood and heard in a\nworld where their stories\nare often ignored.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\nthat she shouldn\u2019t, that\nshe never would. What\nmatters is that she could, if\nshe wanted. The power to\n\n"

These men, and\nmany others who committed similar acts, did so in a\nculture that allowed them\nto get away with it \u2013 a\nculture that didn\u2019t listen\nto those who spoke out, or\ndidn\u2019t take them seriously\nenough.\nBut while we\u2019re used\nto looking on from afar at\nthese cases, I want us to\nfocus a bit closer to home.\nStatistics from the UK\npolice say that 400,000\nwomen will be the victims\nof sexual violence each\nyear \u2013 the majority of\nthese will suffer in silence,\nwithout reporting what\nhas happened. University\ncampuses are no different:\nthe NUS has reported that a\nquarter of women students\nhave been sexually as-saulted, and many more\nharassed. Those who do\ncome forward are only the\ntip of the iceberg.\nAbout two months ago,\none former student who\nhad been sexually assaulted got in touch with me,\nto tell her story. But while\nthe assault alone would\nhave been horrific enough\nto endure, what followed\nwhen she reported it was\nfar worse: a seven-month\nlong investigation, during\nwhich time she felt\nignored, unsupported, and\nnot listened to. She was\npassed from the Union\nto the College, and back\nagain, with no single\npoint of contact. She went\nfor long periods with\nabsolutely no contact from\nthose in charge, despite\nnumerous emails. The\nwhole experience greatly\ndamaged her mental\nhealth, to the point where\nshe felt she was losing her\ngrip on reality.\nShe raised the complaint when she found out\nthe perpetrator would be\nassuming a position of authority in a student society,\nbut \u2013 shockingly \u2013 when\nthe verdict came through,\nthe Union said that, since\nhe wasn\u2019t in that position\nwhen he committed the\nassault, it had no impact,\nand he should remain in\npost. To me, this shows a\ncomplete misunderstanding of how sexual violence\nworks: it\u2019s not really about\ndesire or lust, but power,\nand how abusers can\nwield it over others. At a\ntime when this message\nis being shouted loud and\nclear from the front page\nof every newspaper, the\nfact the Union did not take\nthis on it jaw-dropping.\nAny institution is\nmeasured, not by its\nsuccesses, but by its\nfailures. The Union and\nthe College did not do\nenough, as a whole, in\nthis case, and the results\nare clear. Whether or not\nindividuals are to blame\nis a moot point: there\nwere many people who\ncould have intervened,\nand didn\u2019t, and there are\nmany people at fault. This\nalumna\u2019s experience sends\nout extremely concerning\nmessages about how\nsexual violence is dealt\nwith at Imperial, and\nwhether those in positions\nof responsibility can real\ndeal with it \u2013 how could\nthis have happened?\n2\nListen to the Felix Podcast!\nFelix have teamed up with IC Radio to\npresent the Felix Podcast!\nEach week Rob Garside will be interviewing\nthe team all about how Felix is made, and\nthe stories we publish each week.\nListen at the IC Radio Mixcloud:\nwww.mixcloud.com/ICRadioPodcasts\nStudents support TEF but fear medal system will have\nnegative impact on graduate prospects\nNEWS\nConcerns remain over\nthe way teaching\nquality is assessed as\nvalue of student input\nis slashed by half.\nJoanna Wormald\nDeputy Editor\nS\ntudents largely\nagree with the\nprinciple of the\nTeaching Excellence Framework (TEF)\nbut are less convinced\nabout the way it is\ncurrently implemented,\naccording to a survey\ncommissioned by a\nconsortium of student\nunions, including Imperial College Union.\nThe Teaching excel-lence: the student perspective report analysed data\nfrom a survey of 8,994\nstudents from 123 higher\neducation institutions. It\nfound 84% of students\nagreed universities should\nbe encouraged to provide\nexcellent teaching. This\nis the driving idea behind\nTEF, which uses three\nmetrics to judge teaching\nquality and give universities a gold, silver, or\nbronze rating.\nThe current methodology considers graduate\nprospects, drop-out rates,\nand NSS scores. More\nthan half of students\nfavoured their feedback\nbeing used to evaluate\nteaching. However, the\nweighting given to NSS\nscores will be halved in\nthe third year of TEF. This\nmeans student feedback\nwill be \u201csignificantly less\nimportant\u201d in future TEF\nrankings.\nWhen asked to rank\nfactors that demonstrate\nexcellent teaching,\ngraduate outcomes came\nbottom. While 68% of\nstudents said universities\nshould be responsible\nif teaching is \u201cnot good\nenough to enable them to\nsucceed\u201d, only 34% believed universities should\nbe held to account if job\nrates are low. Just 18%\nagree universities should\nbe accountable when students drop out.\nThe vast majority of\nrespondents said the TEF\nshould also consider IT\nfacilities, library services,\nand course-specific re-sources.\nMost students were\nin favour of the medal\nranking system but 3 in 5\nwere against linking TEF\nratings to tuition fees.\nUnder initial plans, universities with a gold would\nbe able to increase their\ntuition fees in line with\ninflation. However this\nhas since been impeded\nby Conservative plans to\nfreeze tuition fees in a bid\nto win over young voters\n(Felix 1670).\nProblems remain with\nthe medal system. Half of\nstudents would reconsider\nor not apply to their current\nuniversity if it had a bronze\nrating. For gold-rated uni-versities, 6% of students\nwould reconsider or not\napply. This varied by\nethnicity: BAME students\nwere twice as likely not to\napply to a gold-rated university compared to white\nstudents.\nThere were also fears\nthat the rating of a university could harm graduate\nprospects. Students were\nconcerned employers\nwould look more favourably on someone with a\n2:1 from a gold- or sil-ver-rated university than\nsomeone with a first from\na bronze-rated university.\nFurthermore, variation\nacross departments could\nlead to gold-rated universities running bronze-rated\ncourses and vice versa.\nThe Union said: \u201cWe\u2019re\npleased to have worked\nin partnership with over\n20 other students\u2019 unions\nto gain an insight into\nwhat students think of\nthe Teaching Excellence\nFramework, and we\u2019re\nproud that our research\nis having a real impact\non the debate within the\nhigher education sector.\nWe look forward to raising\nthe findings with College\nthrough our Academic\nRepresentation Network,\nhighlighting the importance students place on\nteaching excellence and\nthe quality of resources,\nrather than employment\nrates, when deciding if\ncollege has met their expectations.\u201d\nTEF ratings released\nearlier this year caused\ncontroversy when several\nUniversities minister Jo Johnson announced further TEF\nchanges// Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\nEmployers\nmay prefer\ncandidates\nwith a 2:1\nfrom a gold- or\nsilver-rated\nuniversity than\nsomeone with\na first from a\nbronze-rated\nuniversity.\nA consultation published in September 2016\nrevealed concerns that\nusing graduate prospects\nwould disadvantage universities offering courses\nin fields such as creative\narts, where \u201chighly-skilled\nemployment\u201d is less\ncommon. This would\nalso be the case where\ngraduates take a gap year\nor work in lower-level\njobs before gaining high-ly-skilled employment.\nThe report also revealed\nan \u201cassociated risk\u201d of universities accepting fewer\nwomen, ethnic minorities,\nand people from disadvantaged backgrounds on to\ntheir courses in order to\nachieve a higher graduate\nemployment rating.\nNon-continuations\nare more commonly the\nresult of university-re-lated factors other than\nteaching quality. An \u201cunintended consequence\u201d\nof the non-continuance\nmetric was also noted:\nuniversities may reduce\nthe number of students\nwho are \u201cless likely to\nsucceed\u201d or make courses\nless demanding in order\nto improve retention. So\nthe metric is not strongly\nlinked to teaching quality\nand will potentially lead to\naccepting only privileged\ncandidates that are more\nlikely to succeed. But the\nmeasure remains, with the\ngovernment insisting that\nnon-continuation rates are\n\u201ca good proxy for student\nengagement\u201d.\nStudent satisfaction is\nuseful in reflecting teaching quality so long as data\nfrom the \u201cteaching on my\ncourse\u201d questions of the\nNational Student Survey\nare used rather than\noverall satisfaction rates.\nProblems here are largely\nto do with lower satisfaction scores awarded\nto female and ethnic minority academics. Not to\nworry though: government\nanalysis insists there is no\nsignificant relationship\nbetween the proportion\nof female academics and\nsatisfaction scores and\nonly a \u201cvery small\u201d relationship regarding ethnic\nminorities.\nRussell Group universities\nwere given bronze ratings.\nImperial was one of eight\nRussell Group universities\nthat achieved gold status.\nAt the time, Imperial\nprovost Professor James\nStirling said: \u201cExcellence\nin education is at the\nvery heart of our mission.\nOur teaching must be\nas innovative, agile and\nworld-leading as our\nresearch.\u201d\nThe survey was conducted by trendence UK\nand gathered quantitative\nand qualitative data from\nundergraduate and postgraduate students.\nUniversities are keen\nUnintended consequences\nto achieve high TEF\nscores, since many feel\nthey are attractive to potential students. However,\nsix universities have\nrecently been reprimanded\nby the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) over\nunsubstantiated claims in\ntheir marketing materials.\nLeicester University,\nFalmouth University,\nTeesside University, East\nAnglia University, the\nUniversity of Strathclyde,\nand the University of\nWest London were all\ninstructed to remove\nmisleading material from\ntheir websites, implying\nthat universities were\nleaders in specifc subjects\nor regions.\n\n"

Furthermore,\nBalaji reports frequently\nhaving to make emergency runs to the Union for\ncurly fries during night\nshifts, draining his student\nloan. \u201cI\u2019ve had to lift that\nfucking spanner so many\ntimes, I no longer have\nthe strength in my arms\nto do any coursework.

A\nspokesperson also clarified\nthat the College would not\nbe providing any of the\nfunds, as they had \u201cmuch\nmore important things to\nbe buying\u201d.

Harvey Weinstein\nhas inspired many stars,\nmostly women, to share\ntheir stories of abuse\nby people with power.\nFinally, these hard-hitting\ntopics may finally be\ndiscussed at a meaningful\nlevel through their association with a billion-dollar\nindustry. These issues\naren\u2019t old news and they\naren\u2019t insignificant, but\nwomen\u2019s rights have not\nbeen resolved in over a\ncentury.\nMargaret Atwood\ndrew upon many feminist\nthemes which have\nremained universally\nconstant throughout\nhistory in her 1985 novel\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale. She\nimagined the downfall of\nAmerica into Gilead, an\nauthoritarian patriarchy\nwhose greatest concern\nis to reproduce. Nuclear\nwaste has caused most\nwomen to be sterile and\na strict class system has\nbeen developed so that the\nrich may procreate using\n\u201chandmaid\u201d surrogates. In\nGilead, surrogacy is not a\nmedical procedure \u2013 it\u2019s\neven more intrusive. These\nwomen are subjected to\nritualised rape, leading to\none of the most disturbing\nbook chapters I have ever\nread.\nThough many would\nlike to say feminism is no\nlonger an issue, it cannot\nbe denied that in some\nways nothing has changed,\nas evidenced by The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and the current\nsituation in Hollywood.\nIt\u2019s not fantastical to think\nthere are still people who\ncould imagine exploiting\nanother person\u2019s sexuality,\nwhether it\u2019s their will or\nnot. A problem that was\nbig enough to base a novel\non in the 80s has resurfaced in a big way.\n\u201cRegardless\nof its political\nmessage, the\nnovel still\nshines due\nto Atwood\u2019s\nmasterful\nwriting style\u201d\n\u201cThe novel has\nalways been\npowerful and\nkeeps growing\nin power\nas it gains\nexposure\u201d\nWhile I see sexual\nassault as the most striking\ntheme of The Handmaid\u2019s\nTale there are many\nmore which can also be\nparalleled with present\nday. Abortion, homopho-bia, and racism are also\ncovered byAtwood as well\nas by modern media. Even\nthe political climate that\nwas around while Atwood\nwrote is echoed by ours. It\nwas a time of conservative\nrevival with Reagan and\nThatcher taking control.\nI\u2019m sure you can picture\nthe equivalents that I\u2019m\nthinking off. Based upon\nthis book, society seems\nto have stalled since its\npublication. It\u2019s been said\nthat a recent TV adaptation of Atwood\u2019s novel is\neven more disturbing than\nits source, but I think the\ntrue horror can be found in\nhow it compares to reality\nthrough time.\nRegardless of its\npolitical message, the\nnovel still shines due\nto Atwood\u2019s masterful\nwriting style. Often it\u2019s\ndeceptively simple with a\nsatisfying mixture of short\nand long, listed sentences.\nThough easy to follow,\nthere\u2019s a hint of mystery,\nsomething unfamiliar.\nAtwood likes to play with\ntense, often changing\nbetween paragraphs. It\u2019s\nnot always noticeable, but\nmakes the text all the more\nunsettling. The narrator,\nOffred, can seem unstuck\nin time. Her stories of\nbefore start with a strong\nsense of memory and\nnostalgia. Then, slowly,\nshe reverts and seeps back\nto another time, absorbed\nby it. The whole novel\nis part of Offred\u2019s mind,\nand Atwood doesn\u2019t hold\nback on reminding us that\nshe is a biased narrator.\nOffred recounts the same\nscenes multiple times\nwith different outcomes,\na trick Atwood plays with\nin other works. The reader\nmay seek the truth, ask\nwhat really happened to\ncharacters, but it\u2019s more\nmeaningful to delve into\nwhat the narrator believes,\nwhat she wishes for, to\nknow when she\u2019s lost\nhope.\nOur exploration of the\ndystopian world is through\nits characters and their\nemotions. Atwood doesn\u2019t\nturn her political idea\ninto a battle, revolution\nor epic quest. It\u2019s simply\na description of a corrupt\ngovernment and the effect\nit has on its people. No\none has grand goals, they\nonly want to survive,\nand reclaim their identity\nif they can. Dystopian\nnovels of late have been\nriddled with teen angst and\nlove triangles. This novel\nis a call back to the true\npower of the genre \u2013 an\nexploration of people and\nhow the future needs to be\nprotected from emotional\ndisaster.\nStill, Offred isn\u2019t a beat\ndown, obedient character.\nShe may act that way, but\nin secret she rebels. You\ncan still feel the person\nshe was before the regime\nthrough her witty narration and clever references.\nAtwood\u2019s playful voice\nalso adds a little uplift\nwith the inclusion of small\nbut frequent jokes. Even\none of the most powerful\nquotes from the book\n\u201cNolite Te Bastardes Carborundorm. Don\u2019t let the\nbastards grind you down,\u201d\nwas a made up phrase that\nAtwood found amusing\nduring her school days.\nThis particular phrase\nhas been taken as a\npowerfulmessagebymany\nand is a popular choice for\ntattoos. But the influence\nof the novel extends\nbeyond body adornment.\nLast June, Hulu released\nits TV adaptation which\nhas since won eight Emmy\nAwards and been renewed\nfor season 2. The striking\nHandmaid uniforms from\nthe series with their white\nbonnets and red capes\nhave been worn to protest\nchanges to Planned Parenthood and abortion laws\nin America. Vera Wang\nused the bonnets in her\n2017 Spring/Summer collection to comment upon\nfemale oppression. Her\nconservative but slightly\nprovocative designs have\nbeen said to look like\n\u201carmour\u201d. This seems\nto be the influence The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale has \u2013 it\ninforms readers of political threats and inspires\nthem to rally together into\na stronger entity.\nAs for the future, I don\u2019t\nsee Atwood\u2019s work disappearing any time soon.\nThe novel has always\nbeen powerful and keeps\ngrowing in power as it\ngains exposure. Hopefully\nin the next 30 years there\nwill be changes that finally\nturn the book\u2019s themes\ninto history, as there\nshould have been since the\nits publication. Until them,\nlessons and inspiration can\nbe found in its pages.\nMargaret Atwood is a prophet of our times // Creative Commons\nIn the relentless tread of time, a man searches for the\ngreater miracle of life\nAustrian writer Thomas Glavinic\u2019s The Greater Miracle explores one man\u2019s life when pushed to the extreme in a\nbrilliant piece of storytelling.\nBOOKS\nClemens Jakubec\nBooks Writer\nF\nreedom \u2013 a word\nas awe-inspiring\nas it is undefined.\nThere are many\nways of tackling the issue\nof what freedom means\non a general as well as\non a personal level. In his\n2013 novel The Greater\nMiracle Thomas Glavinic\nsheds light on the problem\nof freedom from a very\npersonal perspective.\nThe novel is split into\ntwo storylines, that run\nparallel to each other. The\nfirst one unfolds in the\npresent day and gives an\naccount of the protagonist,\nJonas, trying to summit\nMount Everest. The\nsecond one tells the story\nof Jonas from the earliest\ndays of his childhood to\nthe present. He grows up\nin theAustrian countryside\nwith his mentally disabled\nbrother. Because they\nare subject to frequent\nabuse by their alcoholic\nmother, Jonas and his\nbrother are adopted by\nPicco, the grandfather of\nJonas\u2019 best friend. Picco\nis a wealthy man, to say\nthe least. They live in a\nmansion, are surrounded\nby servants and live an\noverall very luxurious life.\nBecause of the wealth and\npower of Picco, Jonas and\nhis best friend Werner are\npretty much allowed to\ndo whatever they like. At\none point they even blow\nup the pigsty of a local\nfarmer with no serious\nrepercussions.\nTheir life seems\nperfect until Jonas\u2019\nbrother is killed. Jonas\nhardly recovers from the\nshock and he feels even\nworse when Werner dies\nshortly thereafter in a car\naccident. As if life could\nnot get worse anymore,\nnow Picco also dies from\ncancer. Being the only one\nof Picco\u2019s sons left alive,\nhe inherits a fortune. As\na young man with a near\ninfinite amount of money\non his bank account, he\ntries to live his life to the\n\u201cGlavinic is\nnotorious for\nexploring the\nbehaviour\nof people\nin extreme\nsituations in\nhis novels\u201d\n\u201cGlavinic\u2019s\nbrilliant\nstorytelling\nand the\nexciting plot\ndefinitely\nmake for a\ngreat read\u201d\nfullest. He travels around\nthe world, restlessly\nsearching for something\nhe cannot quite grasp.\nAlthough the outline\nof the story resembles a\nsimple adventure novel\nin some ways, this book\nis not necessarily an easy\nread. The two storylines\nare written in rather different styles. The first one is\nfast paced and especially\ntowards the end of the\nbook almost hurries the\nreader through the story.\nThe second one, on the\nother hand, is written in a\nmore fluent way, bridging\nlong time spans and telling\neverything calmly and in\ngreat detail. These two\ndifferent styles sharpen\nthe contrast between what\nhappens in the present and\nwhat happened in the past,\nand now essentially is a\nmemory of Jonas.\nGlavinic is notorious\nfor exploring the behaviour of people in extreme\nsituations in his novels. In\nthis novel it is Jonas, who\ngrapples with the question\nof what to do with one\u2019s\ntimeonthisplanet.Already\nas a teenager he thinks:\n\u201cTime is neutral. Time is\nindifferent to everything.\nTime is relentless. Not\none second, that is not\nfollowed by the next. Not\none second, that would not\nhave passed. No matter if\ngood or bad.\u201d It seems\nthat what drives Jonas,\nwhat makes him spend\none year in an apartment\nin Rome without leaving\nthe house, or build a treehouse in the dark forests\nof Norway, is exactly the\nsearch for an answer to\nthis question. He travels\naround aimlessly, not\nknowing what to look out\nfor, until the search itself\nappears to become what\nhe has been looking for in\nthe first place. It is in some\nsense a logical conclusion\nfollowing from Jonas\u2019 life\nto climb Mount Everest,\nthis beast of futility, which\nhas become both the life\ngoal but also the end of the\nlives of so many. In fact,\nwhen Jonas nearly dies\non the descent back down\nfrom the summit, the only\nthing that goes through\nhis head is \u201cgo on, keep\nsearching\u201d.\nIt makes sense that\nJonas\u2019 life and the whole\nnarrative culminate in\nJonas climbing Mount\nEverest. When asked\nabout why he wanted to\nsummit Mount Everest,\nEnglish mountaineer\nGeorge Mallory famously\nanswered: \u201cBecause it\u2019s\nthere!\u201d. That is exactly\nwhat Jonas comes to\nrealise, that maybe\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s there!\u201d is the\nbest explanation we will\never be able to give for\nwhy we do anything.\nWhat I liked about this\nbook is its lack of naivety.\nGlavinic does not pretend\nthat money is irrelevant for\none\u2019s happiness. Indeed,\nwhat makes Jonas free is\nhis money. Those who do\nnot have to worry about\nmoney have the time to\nfocus on finding out what\nactually makes their lives\nworth living. Money,\nquite literally, buys you\ntime. While reading this\nbook, I was constantly\nreminded of A Happy\nDeath by Albert Camus,\nwho also describes the\nlife of a man who acquires\na lot of money and then\nfinds himself in a situation\nwhere he is essentially free\nto do whatever he wants.\nStill, while Camus tends\nto actually explore the\nmoral implications of this\nkind of life, The Greater\nMiracle does come\nacross as a bit of a clich\u00e9\nsometimes. However,\nGlavinic\u2019s brilliant storytelling and the exciting\nplot definitely make for\na great read. What makes\nhis books great is that\nthe describes people in\nvery singular and extreme\nsituation, which inevitably\nmakes the reader think\nabout how he or she would\nact under those particular\ncircumstances.\n\u2018It makes sense that Jonas\u2019life and the whole narrative culminate in Jonas climbing Mount Everest.\u2019 // Wikimedia\n\n"

Surely this is part\nof the problem: the perception that people with\ndisabilities cost more than\nyour average Joe.\nMany research reports\nhave been published about\nthis issue, and all of the\ncase studies agreed that in\nthe end hiring people with\ndisabilities is good for\nthe bottom-line. A recent\nguidance publication from\nthe Department for Work\nand Pensions list many\nbenefits to the company:\nfor example, hiring people\nwith disabilities can bring\nadditional skills such as\nBSL, increase the diversi-ty, enable a better service\nfor the diverse range of\ncustomers, and increase\nthe number of high quality\napplicants. Employers\nalso reported that providing adjustments resulted in\nbenefits such as retaining\nvaluable employees, improving productivity and\nmorale, reducing workers\u2019\ncompensation and training\ncosts, and improving\ncompany diversity. The\npublication found that\nsince the adjustments are\nusually low cost, they are\nmuch cheaper than the\nfor the adjustments if\nneeded.\nBut let\u2019s look at some\nstats: those with a disability are twice as likely to be\nunemployed compared to\nnon-disabled people in the\nUK. This could be due to\ninaccessible workplaces,\nnegative attitudes from\nemployers, or simply\ninflexible working hours.\nBut does that mean you\nshould not disclose?\nWell, disclosure is\nsimply a word to describe\nthe kind of tricky situation\nof deciding whether you\nchoose to tell the employer\nyou\u2019re disabled; it\u2019s not\njust a case of whether you\ndo it, but also, when you\ndo it. Personally, I ask\nmyself the question \u201ccan I\ndo the job without my disability affecting my performance?\u201d If the answer\nis \u201cyes\u201d then I don\u2019t\ndisclose straight away;\nbut otherwise it becomes\na case of when you should\ndisclose, because you definitely should! There are\nmany things an employer\ncan do to help, but nothing\nwill be done if you do not\nraise your voice. If your\ndisability is rather obvious\n(like mine) then disclosing\nas early as possible would\nmean fewer awkward\nsurprises at interviews\nand such. However, the\nabove is merely my own\npersonal advice, and above\nThe importance of\nraising disability\nawareness\nB\nefore stepping up for this role\nearlier this year, I tried to look for\nthe Disabilities Officer at the time\nto ask for some advice. I discovered,\nafter three days of searching, that no one\nran in the elections, so the position was\nnot filled. Even though this position seems\nniche in the Imperial community, it is\nextremely important for those who need it\nand for those who may not know that help is\nthere, I found this to be disappointing. This\nwas one of the main reasons I ran. I really\nwant to create a supportive environment\nand maximise inclusivity and integration.\nAs well as attempt to change the culture\nabout disabilities in the Imperial and wider\ncommunity.\nIt is such a critical and hopeful time for\nthose with disabilities, as the White City\ncampus shows great potential for a more\naccessible environment and better services.\nI recently went to look around the new\ncampus to ensure that we have the best\npossible facilities to meet the needs of\neveryone.\nIt is important to raise awareness about\ndisabilitieswithinthestudentbody,aswellas\nwithstaff.Thisprovidespeoplewhohavenot\nhad as much experience with disabilities an\ninsight into the variety of disabilities, as well\nas the needs of those affected. Thus I have\nbeen organising many events for Disability\nHistory Month (22nd November to 22nd\nDecember), which display the difficulties\nfaced by Imperial students on a daily basis.\nThe events vary from disability sports events\nto British Sign Language workshops, as well\nas information stalls and talks! And we need\nyour help \u2013 you can volunteer for the events\nhere: https://goo.gl/ysTtBi\nLIBERATION\nHisham Abdel Aty\nDisabilities Officer\nPeople with disabilities can be reluctant to disclose to their work // Flickr/Uncoolbob\ncost of employee turnover.\nNot only that, but there is\nthe Access to Work grant,\nwhich will cover the cost\n\u201cAll the\ncase studies\npublished\nagree that\nhiring\npeople with\ndisabilities is\ngood for the\nbottom-line\u201d\n\u201cIt is\ncompletely\nyour personal\nchoice whether\nto disclose,\nwhen to do it,\nand how\u201d\nall you must remember\nit is completely your\npersonal choice whether\nto disclose, when to do it,\nand how.\n\n"

CINAMMON ROLLS\nYou will need...\n\u2022 3 cups of flour\n\u2022 3 tsp. baking powder\n\u2022 3 tbsp. sugar\n\u2022 \u00bd tsp. salt\n\u2022 \u00bd cups milk\n\u2022 2 tbsp. butter\n\u2022 Peel from 1 orange\n\u2022 2 eggs\n\u2022 2 tsp. cinnamon - as\nmuch cinnamon as\nyou can, actually\n\u2022 \u00bd stick of butter at\nroom temperature\n\u2022 Sugar\n1. In a big bowl, mix all the dry ingredients\nfirst until they are homogenous. In a separate\nbowl slowly heat the milk, butter, and orange\npeel until the butter is melted \u2013 you can use a\nmicrowave for it, but remember to use a micro-waveable bowl if this is the case.\n2. Add the liquids to the dry ingredients. Add\nthe eggs \u2013 I normally beat them before actually adding them so the batter ends up nice and\nsmooth. Mix well until everything is incorporat-ed.\n3. Now, depending on the type of milk and\nbutter you are using, your mixture might not be\nready for the next step. If it\u2019s too dry, add a bit of\nmilk; if not, add a bit of flour \u2013 it has to be solid\nenough not to stick on your fingers, but not too\ndry to start crumbling.\n4. Let it rest for 10 minutes.\n5. Roll the dough until you are happy with how\nthick it is. If you make it thick, you are going\nto have a fluffier cinnamon roll. If you make it\nthinner, you are going to have more cinnamon.\nIt depends on what you want for your end result.\n6. Spread the butter on the surface of the dough.\nTry to make it as even as possible. Sprinkle the\nsugar and then cover in cinnamon. If you can see\nthe dough through the cinnamon, you definitely\nneed to add more! Now roll!\n7. If you want to want them now, just cut the\nroll in slices that are 2-3 cm thick and bake them\nfor 20-25 mins at 175\u00baC (remember to add some\nbaking paper on the tray so you have less things\nto clean afterwards). Or, you can save them for\nthe next morning - just make sure to use some\nfoil and keep them in the fridge over night. Preferably, slice the roll in the morning.\nA\ndmit it, we\nall need our\nsugary boost\ns o m e t i m e s\n(though this might be\nheavily frowned upon\nby my friend who wrote\non healthy eating last\nweek...) Maybe it\u2019s just\nMICROWAVE BOWL\nCAKE\nYou will need...\n\u2022 4 tbsp. of self-rais-ing flour\n\u2022 4 tbsp. of chocolate\npowder\n\u2022 4 tbsp. of milk\n\u2022 4 tbsp. of sugar\n\u2022 4 tbsp. of oil\n\u2022 1 egg\n1. Mix well in one bowl and microwave for\n5 mins.\n2. Add a helping of ice-cream and dig in\nwhile it\u2019s still hot!\nAs for serving size of this recipe\u2026 well, I think\nmost cakes, regardless of size, only serve one.\nIf you\u2019re backing away now because you see\ntablespoons and you don\u2019t have that thing in your\none-fork-and-one-spoon household, fear not! Just\nuse the simple quantitative skills that got you into\nImperial, aka ratios! Using the same measuring tool\n(cups or spoons), measure out a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio of\nflour, milk, sugar, oil, and chocolate powder.\nThis recipe is versatile: you can change the flavour\nof the cake merely by substituting the chocolate\npowder. For example, replace with matcha powder\nfor a green tea flavoured cake. You can also adjust\nthe consistency of the cake by changing the dry:wet\ningredient ratio. How exactly you do that I don\u2019t\nknow, but putting that sentence in makes me sound\nlike I know what I\u2019m doing.\nPANCAKES,\nPANCAKES,\nPANCAKES!\nYou will need...\n\u2022 5 tbsp. of self-raising flour\n\u2022 3 tbsp. of milk\n\u2022 2 tbsp. of sugar\n\u2022 1 egg\n\u2022 Some butter\n\u2022 A pinch of salt\n1. Mix all ingredients well.\n2. Place some butter in a heated pan.\n3. Pour a spoonful of batter onto the pan.\n4. Flip the pancake when the surface starts\nto bubble.\n5. Serve when both sides seem cooked\n(solid, not watery). If you\u2019re worried about\nuncooked pancakes, try not to put too much\nbatter in the pan.\n6. Add a slab of butter or drizzle some honey on top and dig in!\nServes 1, because you can never have too many\npancakes.\nAdd blueberries or chocolate chips to your liking,\nduring or after cooking. If you want chocolate\nflavoured pancakes just add 1-2 tbsp. of chocolate\npowder. Since I\u2019m not going to show it off to Gordon\nRamsay, I\u2019m not usually too fussy over whether the\npancakes are perfect circles, and you shouldn\u2019t be\neither. A weirdly-shaped, sweet, flour-based blob is\nas good as any pancake.\nFOOD\nChun Yuan Hii\nFood Editor\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\n22\nM\nicrowaves are truly students\u2019 saviors \u2013\nall those Tesco ready meals it churns\nout hot and steaming, not forgetting\nthe heavenly sound of popcorn as it\u2019s\nprepared for your stomach. Now add one more item\nto the list of wonderful things the microwave can\ndo \u2013 cakes!\nBy chocolate powder I mean the regular hot\nchocolate powder you might find in your cupboard,\nnothing baking grade \u2013 remember: we are striving\nfor simplicity. You can just use any kind of wheat\nflour: self-raising flour will give a fluffier cake, but\nnormal flour will do too, if you\u2019re not too picky.\nRemember that if you want to get a normal cake, and\nnot a squished one, you\u2019ll need to add some baking\npowder \u2013 normally, you add 1 tbsp. of baking powder\nfor every 1 cup of flour, but I\u2019d say you should go\nwith \u00bc or even \u215b tbsp. in this case. Milk is any\nmilk \u2013 whole, semi-skimmed, quarter-skimmed,\nanything will do. I\u2019m not too sure about plant-based\nmilk like almond milk though. Guess you\u2019ll have to\nexperiment yourself to find out!\nThe point of university\nlife is that you can have\npancakes anytime you\nwant \u2013 that\u2019s basically all\nthe time.\nW\nhat is the best thing in the world?\nBesides sugar, I mean (and maybe\npizza, and ice-cream, and chocolate\nand...oh, you\u2019ve gotten my point!).Yes,\nyou\u2019ve guessed right \u2013 cinnamon! While you might\nbe thinking \u201cbut cinnamon rolls are not quick!\u201d, let\nme tell you how wrong you are. If you prepare them\nin the evening, you can bake them in the morning\nwhile you are taking a shower \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take that\nlong, there\u2019s not a lot of work involved, and what\nbetter breakfast is there than hot cinnamon rolls?!\nBeing a student is not always bad, right?\nme, but occasionally, after\na nine-to-five day full of\nlabs and lectures, you just\nwant to have something\nwarm, sweet, and \u2013 most\nimportantly \u2013 quick and\neasy to make. I once added\nso much sugar to my tea\nthat my housemate asked\nme, in a very serious tone,\nif I was making tea or di-abetes. Oh well\u2026 Without\nfurther ado, here are some\nsimple recipes that work,\neven after a long harsh\nday.\n\u201cIt sounds\nfancy, it\u2019s\ndelicious,\nnutritious,\nfilling and,\nif you care\nabout such\nthings \u2013 very\nInstagramable\u201d\nFinally \u2013 time to celebrate with a nice meal out!\nFOOD\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\nI\nf you are still reading\nthis \u2013 congratula-tions! You\u2019ve made it\nthrough the first half\nof this first term. While\nit\u2019s not a big deal, I feel\nlike I need a pat on the\nback every time I manage\nto get more than five hours\nof sleep, so\u2026 surviving\nfor so long made me think\nthat I actually have to\ncelebrate. I mean, I only\nhave three deadlines and\ntwo tests coming up, but\nif I can survive so far, I\u2019ll\nmanage to hang on a bit\nlonger. Trust me, so will\nyou.\nAnd now that you\u2019ve\nrealised what a great thing\nyou\u2019ve accomplished, I\nthink you want to cel-ebrate, right? I am not\nsaying that you should go\nbankrupt for one celebratory meal, but I think that\nyou should invest a little\nbit in it. Treat yourself!\nGo crazy! This is why\nit\u2019s called \u201ccelebrating\u201d,\nright?\nSo, here comes the list\neat everything on this list,\nyou\u2019ll have to go to the\ngym. Or change half your\nclothes for a bigger size.\nBut do try some of them!\nBest breakfast\nHaving breakfast out\nis a bit weird for me as I\nwouldn\u2019t normally wake\nup early enough to have\ntime to go out and not be\nlate for class when I can\njust sleep in a bit more\nand enjoy my cereal. But\nsometimes, when I have a\nfree day and I cannot sleep,\nI like exploring what this\ncity has to offer. The good\nthing is that, for breakfast,\nthere are few places where\nyou have to wait the same\nlength you might wait for\nlunch or dinner.\nThis is how I\u2019ve discovered Chiltern Firehouse (1\nChiltern St, Marylebone)\nand their a-maz-ing breakfast \u2013 biggest problems\nwith it are that I don\u2019t\nhave time for it everyday\nand I definitely don\u2019t\nhave the funds. But it\u2019s\na great experience! I\u2019ve\nonly eaten there once and\nI still want to recommend\nit. And because it\u2019s celebratory and it\u2019s breakfast\nout, I\u2019d say try something\nthat you don\u2019t normally\ngo for \u2013 lobster and crab\nomlette! It sounds fancy,\nit\u2019s delicious, nutritious,\nfilling, and \u2013 if you care\nabout such things \u2013 very\nInstagramable.\nCelebratory steak is a\nmust!\nMy best friend took\nme to have some steak\nafter I finished my first\nyear \u2013 he is a huge lover\nof steak \u2013 and I must admit\nthat, even if the meal itself\nwas somewhat out-of-this-world, the experience itself\nwas more than I asked for.\nHIX Oyster and Chop\nHouse (36-37, Greenhill\nRents, Cowcross Street)\nis not something I would\nhave picked for myself but\nafter having the Glenarm\nEstate Porterhouse for\ntwo to share (yes, I had to\nGoogle the exact name),\nI keep telling myself that\nI need to go back at least\nonce more \u2013 especially\nsince I\u2019ve heard that they\nhave a Sunday roast.\nI seriously cannot praise\nthis steak enough, and\nbefore you take my word\nfor it, you should know\nthat I constantly complain\nabout how tasteless most\nfood is in London. You\nshould seriously find some\ntime and go give them\na try \u2013 but double check\nthe prices before ordering\nsomething as they tend\nto be quite high (I should\nthank my friend for also\npaying for the dinner,\nright?)\nCelebratory dessert\nWhenever I am talking\nabout food, I try not to\nsound too pretentious, but\nI cannot constrain myself\nthis time and I am going\nto recommend, in my\nopinion, the best cake in\nLondon \u2013 and trust me,\nI\u2019ve eaten enough cake in\nLondon to know the best\nwhen I try it \u2013 it\u2019s a Godiva\ncafe. Truth be told, I\u2019ve\nonly been to one Godiva\ncafe (the one in Harrods\n\u2013 87-135 Brompton Rd,\nKnightsbridge) and I have\nno idea if there are any\nother around, but this one\nis perfectly placed as it is\nfairly close to uni.\nI\u2019ve tried all their cakes\nand I love most of them,\nbut, my favourite by far\nis the white chocolate\nbaked cheesecake. I eat it\nat least once a month and\nI have to admit that it\u2019s\nbeen consistently good\n\u2013 not just once in while\nwhich can happen in some\nplaces. The chocolate is\nnot overpowering and\nit matches perfectly the\ncheese flavour. You almost\nfeel like you are not eating\nsomething sweet, and the\nconsistency is just great \u2013\none slice is a bit too much\nfor a single person and\nthis is a shame. It comes\nwith melted chocolate that\nmakes it a little bit too\nsweet but it\u2019s amazing on\nits own!\nTreat yourself with a meal that is nicer than your usual pasta and celebrate the fast approaching of the end of the\nterm! We\u2019ve got you covered for all three meals of the day because dinner must be cake!\n23\nof best places to have a\ncelebratory meal \u2013 places\nand dishes tested by the\npickiest! Maybe you\ncould just have a day in\nwhich you decide to try\nall these amazing places:\nwalking from restaurant to\nrestaurant in the search of\nthe things that make you\nhappy. Just remember that,\nif you actually manage to\n\n"

During the first\nquarter of game we were\npushing the University\nof East Anglia\u2019s defence\nback, making them work\nfor first downs. As the\ngame carried on, however,\nthe Imperial Immortals\u2019\ninjuries grew, and \u2013 with\nour small squad size for\nthe game \u2013 this made it\ndifficult for us to structure\nourselves.\nAmongst our injured\nplayers was Francisco\n\u201cwhat\u2019s a training session\u201d\nCosta who, after only a\nfew training sessions, was\nable to make great tackles,\nstopping two UEA touch-downs. Fran did his best to\nkeep up with the automatic\nadjustments and coverages\nat every play, but was unfortunately taken off after\nhis second head injury of\nour offense had good\nimprovement, making a\nlot more yards than we\nmade against Kent, as our\nrookie-heavy offense gets\nused to the triple option\nstyle of play.\nA big congratulation to\nMichael \u201cAlex Moran\u201d\nUrashima for stepping up\nto the role of quarterback\nafter our first string QB\nrolled his ankle. Michael\nhad great play awareness\nand avoided tackles left\nright and centre, trying to\nmake the right read and\nfollow the play.

    "content": "ARTS\nFRIDAY, 17TH\nNOVEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n12\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nn his second longest\nplay, Shakespeare\nchronicles the\nelection to, and subsequent removal from, the\nposition of consul \u2013 a magistrate wielding executive\npower \u2013 of Caius Martius\nCoriolanus, played here\nby Sope Dirisu.\nCoriolanus is elected to\nconsul by his fellow soci-etal-elites: a war hero and\ndefender of the city from\nthe neighbouring Volscians, Coriolanus is, in\ntheir eyes, the epitome of\nthe perfect Roman citizen.\nNot so to the common\nfolk \u2013 the plebeians \u2013\nwho despise Coriolanus\nand attempt to block his\nappointment to the senate\nthrough their tribunes.\nThe play is one of Shakespeare\u2019s most complex\nworks, juggling numerous\nmotifs from class war to\nthe relationship between\nmother and son, all with\nthe noticeable absent of\nsoliloquises \u2013 so often an\naudience\u2019s insight into the\nminds of Shakespeare\u2019s\ncharacters.\nWith no running commentary on Coriolanus\u2019s\nthoughts, the task of\ninhabiting the title role\nbecomes considerably\nmore difficult, but it is\none Dirisu steps up to.\nHe commands the stage\nwith an presence that is\npalpable from the stalls,\ninstilling fear, awe, or joy\nwhen the moment is right.\nHis speeches are delivered\nwith suitable emotion\nwhile avoiding becoming\nhammy and taking his\nRSC debut in his stride.\nCrucially, Dirisu avoids\nportraying Coriolanus\ndefinitively as an anti-hero\nor a villain. Instead, Coriolanus\u2019s merits and flaws\nare left for the audience\nto weigh, like any good\nelectorate should.\nThe performances from\nthe rest of the cast range\nfrom good to exceptional.\nJames Corrigan struggles\nin the first half of the play\nas Tullus Aufidius \u2013 head\nof the Volscian army \u2013\nbut his relationship with\nCoriolanus in the latter\nhalf is executed well, and\nprovides one of the production\u2019s most engaging\nscenes.\nPaul Jesson embodies\nMennenius with a Brian-Blessed-esque level of\njoviality, while Hannah\nMorrish as Virgilia \u2013\nMartius\u2019s wife \u2013 performs\nher role beautifully on the\nfringes of the action as\n\u2018the strong, silent type\u2019 to\nquote Tony Soprano. And\nKatherine Toy\u2019s small role\nas Valeria provides superb\ncomic relief.\nProduction value is\nalso excellent. The quick\nscene changes, from min-imalistic urban squalor\nto equally minimalistic,\nbut ever more polished,\nluxurious Roman living\nquarters provide a noteworthy juxtaposition\nbetween the rich and poor.\nAll of which is rounded\noff with composer Mira\nCalix\u2019s score and Alexandra Ferrari\u2019s operatic aria\nto compliment the play\u2019s\ndefining moments with\ntingling beauty.\nThe star of the show\nhoweverisHaydnGwynne\nas Volumnia, Coriolanus\u2019s\nmother. Gwynne, in conjunction with Dirisu, plays\nout the most intriguing\nand complex mother-son\nrelationship in any\nShakespeare play, Hamlet\nincluded. Volumnia makes\nno secret of her influence\non Coriolanus and her\ndesire to paint him as a\nwar hero to appease the\nplebeians. On hearing\nof Coriolanus return to\nthe city after battle, she\nremarks \u201cO he is wounded;\nI thank the gods for\u2019t.\u201d\nHer power awards her the\nstage\u2019s best real estate,\nwith Volumnia occupying\nits centre whenever she\nspeaks, displacing even\nCoriolanus.\nIt is here, in the\nmoments mother and son\nspend together, when the\nadaptation comes into its\nown. No truer is this than\nin Act V Scene III, where\nan outcast Coriolanus \u2013\nhaving vowed to destroy\nRome with the Volscians\nand take revenge on the\nplebeians \u2013 is begged\nby Virgilia and his son\nto return home in peace.\nWhen neither wife nor\nchild can convince\nCoriolanus, the task is\nleft to his mother. After\npleading with and begging\nher child to forgive the\ncity, Volumnia takes\nCoriolanus\u2019s hand and\nthe pair fall into silence.\nPerhaps ironically for\nShakespeare, it is not\nthe role of a speech or a\nsoliloquy to provide the\nplay\u2019s most critical and\nemotional moment, but\nthe stage direction that\nfollows Volumnia\u2019s plea:\nHe holds her hand, silent.\nCoriolanus breaks down\nand succumbs, once again,\nto his mother\u2019s will. His\nlust for revenge vanishes\nas quickly as it arrived.\nAs with Dirisu, Gwynne\ngives the audience enough\nmaterialto form an opinion\non Volumnia, without dictating their feelings. We\u2019re\nnever quite sure if Volumnia\u2019s motives are that of\nan overbearing mother,\ndesperate to see her son\nachieve is full potential, or\na puppet-master attempting to realise he own lust\nfor power through her son.\nRegardless of her\nmotives, her plans\nultimately fall flat, as\nCoriolanus is killed by\nAufidius in the final scene.\nSadly, it is here where the\nplay itself falls flat. Angus\nJackson, the director, and\nproduction team have\nmade much in the run-up\nto opening night of the\nfittingness of Coriolanus\nin the modern political\nlandscape. Here we have\na would-be political leader\nwho cares not for pandering to the electorate,\ninstead insisting \u2018Action\nis eloquence\u2019; a tactic that,\ndespite its honourability,\nbears no fruit. Fitting\nindeed, in a \u2018post-truth\u2019\nworld, where populism\nseems to reign supreme.\nBut the production\nfails \u2013 if you will allow\nthe reviewer \u2013 to breath\nenough breathlessness\ninto Shakespeare\u2019s text at\nthe key political moments.\nThe play\u2019s opening riot\nscene feels disjointed from\nthe rest of the play, and\nCoriolanus\u2019s death \u2013 the\nonly in the play \u2013 is far too\nmuted to make jaws drop.\nCoriolanus sets out to\nprovide an on-the-pulse\ncommentary of current\naffairs, but comes up short.\nInstead, the play shines in\nits character development.\nFrom bit-parts to the roles\nof Volumnia and Coriolanus himself, the actors\nshine and give the play\nan abundance of soul that\ncould touch even the most\nhardened of war-heroes.\nCoriolanus runs to\n18th\nNovember. The Rome\nMMXVII season runs until\nearly 2018.\nPolitics and the value of rhetoric in early Rome\nThe Barbican opens its Rome MMXVII season with the seldom performed myth of Coriolanus. An attempt to hold\na mirror to the current world of politics falls flat, but the characters shine through.\nTullus Aufidius and Coriolanus fight for a seat in the Central Library // Helen Maybanks\nARTS\nAdam Gellatly\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Let\u2019s\nassume Imperial College\nis committed to tackling\nmental health issues.\nLet\u2019s say they are.\nI mean, they opened\na counselling service,\ndidn\u2019t they? I\u2019ve seen\nmental health campaigns\naround. Some allocation\nof resources is going\ninto it, so it must be one\nof their priorities. Right?\nRight?\nLet\u2019s now go through\na logical argument. It\nrequires three assumptions as its main ingre-dients:\n- Practicing sport\nhelps to keep your mind\nhealthy.\n- Gyms are a standard,\nconvenient way of practicing sport, especially\nfor busy people.\n- Imperial College is\ncommitted to tackling\nmental health issues.\nOkay, we mix these\nassumptions in our brand\nnew logical blender,\nand we get a nice, cold,\ncreamy smoothie called\nthe Ethos Energia gym.\nYou look at your creation\nand are pretty confident\nit\u2019s going to be amazing.\nI mean, you followed the\nrecipe: if Imperial wants\nto help with students\u2019\nmental health, sport is\none of many ways to\ndo so, and gyms are the\nmost standard way of\npractising sport, it surely\nfollows that they should\nshoes of someone who\nmakes the resolution to\nstart a gym habit. You\ngo the first time, see the\n90% occupancy notice,\nget changed, go in, and\nobserve the panorama.\nYou\u2019ve vaguely heard\ninterval training is good,\nso you make your way\nto the treadmills to have\nyour first session. There\nare three people waiting.\nMaybe the first two\nor three times you are\nresilient and decide to\nwait, but if you\u2019ve had a\nlong day, you might just\ngo back home without\nstarting, completely dis-there. After that, there is\nstill space to buy many\nmore of all of them. And\nyou\u2019ll free up a lot of\nspace upstairs to expand\nthe weights area, buy\nmore machines, and in\ngeneral just have a much\nbetter gym.\nCan we just transform\nthe waiting area into an\nextension of the gym?\nOf course! Some staff\nmembers report that\nthe space is not used a\nlot anyway. Sometimes\nlarge groups of kids\ndo have to wait there,\nbut I\u2019m sure they can\nwait where the vending\nmachines are. It\u2019s only a\nbit of waiting. You don\u2019t\nneed to be treated like a\nking. The space where\nthe vending machines\nare can definitely be\nturned into the waiting\narea.\nAnd okay, if you\u2019re\none of those that is\ngoing to miss the ping-pong table, get a grip\non yourself. It\u2019s just a\nping-pong table. Surely\nyou can make this little\nsacrifice for us. Take\nit for the team. I am\nconfident you can find\nsomewhere else to fill\nyour ping-pong urges (I\nhear Imperial has a very\ngood table tennis club).\nSo yes, here I am,\nasking Alice Gast to\nexpand the gym at Ethos.\nI trust you can do it.\nShow us you care about\nyour students and staff.\nIf you agree with me,\nplease sign the petition.\nI\u2019m sure most Imperial\nstudents and staff agree\nthat there is a problem,\nso let\u2019s try to actually\nmake an impact, even if\nyou will graduate before\nthis ever happens. Link\nto the petition is: http://\nbit.ly/2AIT0hD\nProportion of people who agree with me on this issue // Alan Perfect\n\u201cEthos has\na very large\nwaiting area at\nthe entrance.\nWhy not\nexpand into\nthat area?\u201d\ncouraged by the insane\nnumber of people there.\nSo yes, it is absolutely\noutrageous that Imperial,\nwith its supposed commitment to mental health\nissues, has such a small\ngym for the amount of\nstudents and staff there\nare. And the situation\nwill only get worse\nas student numbers\nincrease.\nThankfully, there are\nways to tackle this issue\nhead on. Ethos has a very\nlarge waiting area at the\nentrance, full of tables\nand chairs. Why not\nexpand the gym into that\narea? There is enough\nspace to move all the\ncurrent treadmills, elliptical trainers, static bikes\nand rowing machines\n\u201cEthos\u2019 gym\nsize is not\nencouraging\nmore people to\ngo to the gym\nregularly\u201d\ninvest in having a world-class gym facility, with\namazing personnel, state\nof the art equipment,\nand accessibility to any\nkind of student or staff\nmember, regardless of\nage and gym experience.\nExcept you attempt\nto try the smoothie and\nfind out something is\nnot right. It\u2019s not really\nthat the ingredients are\nwrong. It\u2019s that there are\ntoo many people who\nwant to drink it. You find\nyourself surrounded by\n20 people asking to have\na bit, and before you\nknow it, you\u2019ve ran out\nof smoothie before even\ntrying it.\nThis is the problem\nwith the gym at Ethos\nat the moment: it\u2019s too\nsmall for the amount\nof people who\u2019d want\nto use it. Anyone who\nhas tried to go on a\nMonday at 5pm knows\nthis for sure. You\u2019ll find\nqueues for treadmills\nand rowing machines.\nGroups of three or even\nfour sharing a bench.\nWeightlifters squeezing\ninto the minimal space\nneeded to do a side\nlateral raise without\nhitting everyone with a\n12kg weight.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nI am not saying sharing\na bench at the gym is\nbad (it\u2019s actually often\npreferable). I just don\u2019t\nthink Ethos\u2019s size is encouraging more people\nto go to the gym regular-ly. Put yourself into the\n\n"

He said\nthe problems facing the\ngovernment were due to\n\u201cthe people we are negotiating with\u201d, saying that\n\u201cdemanding billions and\nbillions to leave\u201d \u2013 the\nBrexit divorce bill \u2013 was\n\u201coutrageous\u201d.\nHe went on to say it\nshould be easier to hire\nand fire workers, and\nargued that corporation tax\nshould be \u201celiminated\u201d,\nadding \u201cthere are ways of\ngetting around paying it...\nI\nmperial College\nLondon has been\npraised for its approach to cheating,\namid rising concerns of\nImperial praised for its approach to cheating\nplagiarism.\nWriting for the Times\nHigher Education, barrister and Imperial alumnus\nDr Daniel Sokol lamented\nthe low standard of proof\nrequired to convict students of cheating. A guide\nby the Quality Assurance\nAgency for Higher Education published last month\nrecommends verdicts be\ndecided on the balance\nof probabilities. This is\nthe standard used in civil\ncourt cases and means\nstudents are found guilty\nif it is deemed it is more\nlikely than not that they\nhad cheated.\nImperial implements a\nhigher standard of proof,\nrequiring guilt to be established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt \u2013 the same standard\nrequired in criminal trials.\nThe QAA says this may be\nappropriate given the seriousness of the offence but\ncould also \u201cbe too strict to\nenable effective decision\nmaking\u201d.\nDr Sokol has urged\nmore universities to\nfollow this \u201cenlightened\napproach\u201d. He argues that\nalthough some guilty students may get away with\ncheating due to this high\nstandard, it also means that\nfewer innocent students\nare likely to be convicted.\nHe told Felix: \u201cSome\nuniversities say that\nstudents are much more\nlikely to give [cheating]\na go because there\u2019s less\nchance of being convict-ed, but I haven\u2019t seen any\nevidence of that.\u201d He also\nargues the consequences\nof expelling an innocent\nstudent \u2013 such as reduced\njob prospects and emotional and mental distress\n\u2013 are more serious than\ndishonest students achieving a better grade.\nUniversities and science\nminister Jo Johnson\nlast month warned the\nseriousness of cheating\n\u201cshould not be underestimated\u201d. Contract cheating\n\u2013 where students pay\nsomebody else to write\ntheir essays \u2013 is on the rise,\nwith one essay-writing\ncompany reporting a 20%\nincrease in UK customers\nover the past two years.\nEarlier this week, Ohio\nState University accused\n83 students of cheating\nby using messaging app\nGroupMe.\nyou should allow profits to\nbe reinvested\u201d.\nThe comments made by\nSir Dyson, who supported\nLeave in the runup to the\nreferendum, provoked\ndebate online: Wes\nStreeting, the Labour MP\nfor Ilford North, said on\nTwitter: \u201cNo corporation\ntax and firms able to hire\nand fire at will. That\u2019s\nJames Dyson\u2019s vision for\nBrexit Britain \u2013 and families will pay the price.\u201d\nImperial state their\nBrexit approach will be\n\u201cpragmatic and positive\u201d,\nand they wish to \u201cdefend\nour international values\u201d.\nProfessor Alice Gast,\nImperial\u2019s President, is a\nmember of the Mayor of\nLondon\u2019s Brexit Advisory\nGroup.ShemetwithDavid\nDavis MP, Secretary of\nState for Exiting the European Union, and Sadiq\nKhan, Mayor of London,\nin September to discuss\nthe impact of Brexit on\nhigher education. Imperial is campaigning for\ncontinued access to the\nEU\u2019s research networks\npost-Brexit. In an interview with Le Monde this\nweek she said that the\nprospect of Brexit was\nworrying.\nA Union representative\ntold Felix they \u201ccampaign\nto protect the rights of all\nour members, including\nthose from Europe and\nfurther overseas\u201d. They\nsaid the Union will work\nwith College to \u201censure\nthat Imperial remains a\nwelcoming and inclusive\nenvironment for all, and\nthat our students remain\npart of the international\nscientific community\u201d.\nThe Dyson School\nof Design Engineering\nwas launched in 2015,\nfollowing a \u00a312 million\ndonation from the James\nDyson Foundation. Sir\nDyson graduated from\nthe Royal College of Art,\nand made his name with\nbagless vacuum cleaners.\nHe is currently worth\naround \u00a37.8 billion. Dyson\nproducts were formerly\nmade in Wiltshire, until\n2002, when production of\nvacuum cleaners moved\nto Malaysia. This was followed by the production\nof washing machines in\n2003.\nA \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit\ndescribes what will\nhappen if the UK leaves\nthe EU without a formal\nagreement in place. While\nPrime Minister Theresa\nMay initially claimed \u201cno\ndeal is better than a bad\ndeal\u201d, this phrase has been\nmarkedly absent in her\nrecent rhetoric. However,\nshe still admits that no\ndeal would be preferable.\nA number of prominent\nvoices have disagreed:\nDonald Tusk, President\nof the European Council,\nhas said that \u201ca no-deal\nscenario would be bad for\neveryone, but above all for\nthe UK\u201d, while the International Monetary Fund\nhas also said that a no-deal\nBrexit would cause economic damage to the UK\nand the Eurozone. Kier\nStarmer, Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting\nthe European Union, told\nthe BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today\nprogramme that a no-deal\nscenario is \u201cunthinkable\u201d,\nand that \u201ca responsible\ngovernment would allow\nus to come to that place\u201d.\nEarlier this year, a joint\nreport by the University of\nSussex and the Resolution\nFoundation thinktank\nstated that the average\nfamily would lose \u00a3260\na year, and predicted\nincreases in prices for\ngroceries and motor ve-hicles. They argued that\nthese increases would hit\nlow-income households\nhardest.\nThe UK is set to leave\nthe EU on 29th March\n2019, two years after\ninvoking Article 50 of the\nTreaty on the European\nUnion. May is currently\nfacing pressure from\nwithin her own party on\nBrexit, as Michael Gove\nand Boris Johnson sent her\na letter earlier this week,\nexpressing their concerns\nthat \u201ccurrent preparations\nare not proceeding with\nanything like sufficient\nenergy.\u201d\nSir Dyson called the Brexit divorce bill \"outrageous\" // Wikimedia\nJames Dyson says to \"walk away\" from Brexit talks\nNEWS\nDr Daniel Sokol,\nImperial alumnus,\nrecommends use of\nhigher standards of\nproof when deciding\ncases of cheating.\nJoanna Wormald\nDeputy Editor\n\u201cImperial\nimplements\nthe same\nstandard of\nproof required\nin criminal\ntrials\u201d\n\n"

In\nits fourth season, however, they double-down on this, in an examination of the cyclical, inter-generational nature\nof trauma. It\u2019s the show\u2019s most difficult season to date, but ends with a glimmer of hope.\n\u201cThe take-home message\nis that trauma\nis often\ncyclical, and\npsychic scars\ngenerational\u201d\nT\nhe third season of\nBojack Horseman\nended with the\nquestion of\nwhether our problematic\nprotagonist would ever\nbe able to move on.\nFollowing the death of\nhis co-star and on-screen\ndaughter Sarah Lynn\nduring their drug binge,\nBojack sets off in his car,\ndriving far away from\nthose he has let down.\nRamming his foot down on\nthe accelerator and taking\nhis hands off the wheel, he\ndrifts along the road, until\nhe sees something that\nmakes him slam on the\nbreak: a group of horses\nrunning through the open\nplains. They are able to\ndo something that Bojack\nhas been unable to \u2013 they\nare moving forward, into\nthe future. Soundtracked\nby the haunting vocals of\nNina Simone singing her\nheartbreaking \u2018Stars\u2019, it\nfelt like a culmination of\nthree seasons in which\nBojack and his fellow\nHollywoo characters had\nbeen circling around the\nsame ideas of desperation.\nSeason 4 of Bojack\nHorseman sees the\nmajority of the characters\nbreaking new ground\n\u2013 Princess Carolyn is\nlooking into the possibility\nof balancing her personal\nand professional lives,\ntaking on a new boyfriend,\nas well as her new role\nas a manager (the incomprehensible difference\nbetween an agent and a\nmanager is a running gag\nthroughout the season);\nTodd is coming to terms\nwith his asexuality, and\nlearning to make peace\nwith who he is; and Mr\nPeanutbutter and Diane\nare trying to work through\nthe issues in their relationship amid a gubernatorial\nrace \u2013 but for Bojack, this\nseason will explore the\nroot of his cyclical behav-iour, reaching further back\ninto the past than it has\nhim, and the reasons\nbehind his personality.\nThe take-home message:\ntrauma is often cyclical,\nand psychological scars\ncan be generational.\nFollowing on from\nthe first episode, marked\nby a distinctive lack of\nBojack, we get him back\nin the next one. In \u201cThe\nOld Sugarman Place\u201d\nhe begins expunging the\nghosts of his past, beginning with his toxic relationship with his mother;\nBeatrice Horseman (ne\u00e9\nSugarman) is an emotion-ally-manipulative bully,\nwho traumatised Bojack\nboth physically and\nmentally, but \u201cThe Old\nSugarman Place\u201d takes us\nback to her childhood, and\nthings begin to become\nclear. A brother dying in\nthe war sends her mother,\nHoney, into a spiral of\ngrief, which is \u2018cured\u2019 by\nthe stalwart of American\nmid-century psychiatry: a\nfrontotemporal lobotomy,\nrobbing Honey of any\npersonality or vitality.\n\u201cLove does things to a\nperson, terrible things.\u201d\nshe advises, \u201cBeatrice,\npromise me you\u2019ll never\nlove anyone as much as I\nloved Crackerjack.\u201d\ndebutante who feels stifled\nunder her father\u2019s author-ity, she skips town with\nBojack\u2019s father, a lover of\nthe Beats who is planning\non writing \u2018the great\nAmerican novel\u2019. Looking\nafter Bojack crushes her\nyounger self\u2019s dreams,\nand \u2013 with her mother\u2019s\nadvice ringing in her head\n\u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that she\ntreats him so terribly.\nWhether this cycle can\nbe broken is a question\nraised by the arrival into\nthe show of Hollyhock,\nwho believes Bojack is\nher illegitimate father.\nAparna Nancherla does\nsterling voice-work as\nHollyhock, bringing a\nvulnerability and likeability to the role, and she\nimmediately fits into the\nBojack universe. While\nBojack has never shied\naway from conversations\naround mental health, this\nseason develops the topic,\nlooking at the heritability\nof mental illness: while\nHollyhock would provide\na meaning for Bojack\u2019s\nlife, she also serves as a\nAmy Sedaris delivering an emotion-shredding performance // Netflix\nTELEVISION\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nCreator: Raphael BobWaksberg. Starring: Will\nArnett, Amy Sedaris, Alison\nBrie, Paul F. Tompkins.\nBOJACK HORSEMAN:\nSEASON 4\never gone before.\nFor the last three\nseasons, we have only seen\nwhat Bojack\u2019s formative\nyears were like in passing,\nbut over the course of these\ntwelve episodes we get a\nmuch clearer look into the\nenvironment that formed\nMr Peanutbutter running for Union President // Netflix\n\u201cAparna\nNancherla\ndoes sterling\nvoice-work\nas Hollyhock,\nbringing a\nvulnerability\nand likability\nto the role\u201d\nIt\u2019s a hard episode\nto watch, and Bojack\nHorseman\u2019s creators dou-ble-down with the penultimate episode, \u201cTime\u2019s\nArrow\u201d, which lets us\ninto Beatrice\u2019s demen-tia-addled mind, filling\nin the gaps between her\nchildhood and her mother-hood. A Barnard-educated\n\u201c\u2018Ruthie\u2019is one\nof the greatest\nepisodes of\nBojack thus\nfar \u2013 a huge\nachievement\u201d\n\u201cAmy Sedaris\nis doing some\nof the best\nwork of her\ncareer, and her\nperformance is\none of the best\non current TV\u201d\nreminder that he manages\nto taint everything he\ntouches \u2013 above all his\nrelationships with others.\nThis season is probably\nthe most difficult season to\nwatch of Bojack thus far,\nsomething that is aided\nand abetted by some of\nthe experiments in style\ntried by the creators: in\ntwo episodes, we get\na markedly different\nanimation style as the\nwriters let us into the\nminds of the characters.\nIn \u201cStupid Piece of Sh*t\u201d\nBojack\u2019s own negative\nthoughts are expressed\nas jagged scribbles, as\nwe spend some time in\nhis claustrophobic head,\ndrawn down by cycles of\nnegative thoughts and impulsive behaviours. Later\non, in \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow\u201d,\nBeatrice\u2019s dementia is represented through rifts in\nreality, with backgrounds\nfading in and out, characters\u2019 faces left blank or\nscrawled out, and words\nrearranging themselves.\nThe zany nature of\nthe world of Hollywoo\nusually serves as a balm\nfor some of the rawer\naspects of Bojack, but\nthis aspect is somewhat\nlacking in this season.\nWest coast navel-gazing\nis explored through Mr\nPeanutbutter running for\ngovernor of California \u2013 a\nplot line that culminates\nin the episode \u201cUnderground\u201d, which sees\nJessica Biel (described\nas an \u201cattempted movie\nstar\u201d) setting fire to Zach\nBraff after Mr Peanutbutter and Diane\u2019s house falls\ninto a sinkhole generated\nby fracking. These serve\npolitical issues like gun\ncontrol can seem a little\npasted-on: when Diane\nsparks a debate about gun\ncontrol in \u201cThoughts and\nPrayers\u201d it isn\u2019t given\nenough time to develop\nfrom the personal to the\npublic.\nTodd\u2019s storyline\ndevelops little throughout\nthe season, although since\nthe main theme is self-ac-ceptance, it is unsurprising\nthat this is the case. His arc\ndoes manage to introduce\nanother of his schemes in\nthe latter half of the season:\nclown dentists, who\nprovide enough material\nto generate running gags\nfor a good six episodes.\nOther than these\naspects, the remaining\ncharacters experience an\nunremittingly bleak time\nof it. The cracks in Mr\nPeanutbutter and Diane\u2019s\nrelationship \u2013 both literal\nand metaphorical \u2013 begin\nto really show through,\nprompting the question of\nwhether their differences\ncompliment each other,\nor make them intrinsically\nincompatible. As usual,\nAlison Brie and Paul F.\nTomkins deliver great\nvoice work, with Brie in\nparticular impressing this\nseason. Her drink-induced\nbreakdown comes around\nhalf way through the\nseason, but time can\u2019t heal\nall wounds, and we end\nwith another argument,\none that has Brie and\nTomkins breaking through\ntheir characters\u2019 fa\u00e7ades \u2013\nemotionally repressed for\nDiane, and glibly unaware\nfor Mr Peanutbutter \u2013 to\ndeliver emotionally-hon-est performances.\nNone of the plot lines,\nhowever, can match\nPrincess Carolyn\u2019s, as she\nattempts to settle down\nwith Ralph Cheeseman.\nOver the previous seasons\nof Bojack, we\u2019ve come to\nknow Princess Carolyn\nas a character defined by\nher strong work-ethic and\ncan-do attitude; as she\nunleashed the revelation\nlast season that she felt\nshe had wasted her youth\non Bojack, she comes into\nthis season attempting to\nclaw back some of what\nshe feels she has missed.\nThings, naturally, don\u2019t\npan out, leading to one\nof the most emotional-ly-crippling episodes of\nthe season: \u201cRuthie\u201d,\nin which we are taken\nthrough one of the worst\ndays in Princess Carolyn\u2019s\nlife. She begins the day\npregnant, in a loving re-lationship, and in control\nof her business, but ends\nit with nothing \u2013 not\neven her precious family\nheirloom, or at least the\nidea behind it, is safe from\nthe harsh realities of life.\nEven the framing device,\nwhich gave us some hope\nfor Princess Carolyn\u2019s\nfuture, is whipped away\nat the last minute, as the\nscreen cuts to black. It\u2019s\nnot only one of the season\nstand-outs, but one of the\nbest episodes of Bojack\nthus far \u2013 a huge achievement when you consider\nthe strengths of some\nprevious episodes.\nAmy Sedaris is doing\nsome of the best work\nof her career, and this\nseason elevates her performance into one of the\nbest currently on TV. Her\nperformance in \u201cRuthie\u201d\nis emotionally devastat-ing, and she absolutely\ndeserves an Emmy nod for\nit during awards season.\nShe also manages to get\nher mouth around some\nserious tongue-twisters \u2013\nexample: \u201cPortnoy finds\njoy in hoi polloi boy toy!\u201d\n\u2013 of which there are a\ncouple in each episode on\naverage.\nHer performance\nis complemented by a\nnumber of newcomers\nto the Bojack universe:\nAndre Braugher is magnificent as the incumbent\ngovernor Woodchuck\nCoodchuck-Berkowitz;\nJane Krakowski, who\nhas emerged as one of\nthe stand-out stars of\nUnbreakable Kimmy\nSchmidt, is fantastic as\nHoney Sugarman; and\nWendie Malick manages\nto take us through the\nentirety of Beatrice Sugarman\u2019s adult development,\nfrom optimistic teenager\nto embittered mother, and\nthrough to cantankerous\ncare-home resident, in one\nof the strongest performances of the season.\nBut while the season\nmight be one of the\nbleakest seasons of\nBojack yet, it also feels\nlike the most confused:\nprevious seasons managed\nto maintain a perfect\nbalance between humour\nand tragedy, but there\nare certain episodes of\nseason four that don\u2019t\nreally seem to work, particularly when they follow\non from the gut-punches\nBojack-creator Raphael\nBob-Waksberg is so adept\nat delivering.\nIn some ways, this\nseason was very much\nneeded: all the major\ncharacters are left, if not in\na better place emotionally,\nthen in a more truthful\nposition, setting things up\nfor another strong season.\nDespite so much time\nspent examining his past,\nthe character who seems\nto move on the most\nis Bojack himself. The\nseason ends on a hopeful\nnote \u2013 the most optimistic\nin the show\u2019s history \u2013\nsuggesting that, maybe\nthis time, the cycle can be\nbroken, once and for all.\nBojack Horseman\nSeason 4 is on Netflix.\nBojack ends this season with the first hint of optimism we\u2019ve been given // Netflix\nas welcome distractions\nfrom the main thrust of\nthe season, although the\nattempts to shoehorn in\n\n"

It\nachieved an overall score\nof 18.5%, which is a\n\u2018Failed\u2019 rating. In contrast,\nManchester Metropolitan\nUniversity, which topped\nthe table, scored 77.6%,\nand the London School of\nEconomics, which came\nhighest of the Russell\nGroup, scored 64.4%.\nThe league tables,\nwhich have been running\nfor ten years, take a\nnumber of metrics into\naccount when deciding the\nrankings, largely centred\naround what environmental and ethical policy the\nuniversity has in place,\nand the amount of support\nenvironmental initiatives\nhave on campus. Half the\ninformation is gathered\nfrom publically available\nsources, while half is from\ndata published by other\nagencies.\nand scored zero on environmental policy, ethical\ninvestment, education, and\nwater reduction. It scored\nhighest in environmental\nauditing and management\nsystems, and sustainable\nfood.\nRhidian Thomas, Imperial College Union\u2019s Ethics\nand Environment Officer,\ncalled the results \u201cat once\nboth breathtakingly poor\nand entirely fair\u201d, saying\nthat \u201cCollege\u2019s chummy\nrelationship with the\nfossil fuel industry is an\nugly stain on its academic\nrecord \u2013 coupled with\nits continued pursuit of\nenergy-intensive expan-sion, there\u2019s no wonder\nit did so badly\u201d. He went\non to tell Felix he was\n\u201chugely proud of the\nUnion\u2019s decision to back\ndivestment last year\u201d, and\nlooked forward to \u201cthe day\nwhen College too finds the\nmoral conviction to put its\nmoney where its mouth\nis\u201d.\nThe student group\nDivest Imperial, which\ncampaigns for Imperial to\nstop investment in oil and\ngas companies, called the\nresults \u201cappalling, especially for a \u2018world-leading\u2019\ninstitution which markets\nitself on global outlook,\nsustainability and environmental responsibility\u201d.\nIt said that for many students the results would be\n\u201cunsurprising\u201d, given that\n\u201cthe constant, visible presence of environmentally\nand societally damaging\ncompanies is simply a fact\nof life on campus\u201d.\nPeople & Planet reported that Imperial has no\ncurrent policy on ethical\ninvestments, and accepted\nnearly \u00a324 million in donations from the fossil fuel\nindustry between 2009-2014. Imperial reportedly\nhas nearly \u00a39 million\ncurrently invested in the\nfossil fuel industry, including nearly \u00a32 million\nin Statoil, \u00a3300,000 in BP,\nand \u00a31.5 million in Shell\n\u2013 nearly double what was\ninvested in the previous\nyear.\nDivest Imperial said\nthe fossil fuel industries\n\u201cseem woven into the\nfabric of university,\nblatantly contradicting the\naims of the College, and\nundermining the research\ninto renewables and\nclimate change undertaken here\u201d. The group set up\na stall the Thursday after\nthe results were released,\nasking Imperial students\nand staff to guess where\nthe university had placed.\nSustainable Development\n(ESD) was another metric\nin which Imperial fared\nbadly, scoring zero. People\n& Planet describe ESD as\n\u201cworking with students to\nencourage them to consider what the concept of\nglobal citizenship means\nin the context of their\nown discipline\u201d, as well\nas encouraging thinking\nabout ethical issues and\ndeveloping \u201ca future-fac-ing outlook\u201d. According to\nPeople & Planet, Imperial\nlacks any form of framework or strategy for ESD.\nImperialhasanumberof\ndepartments dedicated to\nsustainability and climate\nchange, including the\nCentre for Environmental\nPolicy and the Grantham\nInstitute for Climate\nChange. It also states on\nthe website they \u201crecognise the effect that [our]\noperations and activities\nhave on the environment\u201d,\nand \u201cseek to establish an\nethos at all levels and in\nall departments towards\nprotecting and improving\nthe environment\u201d.\nHowever, out of a total\ncommunity of staff and\nstudents numbering more\nthan 13,000, Imperial only\nemploys a single senior\nstaff member responsible\nfor sustainability. People\n& Planet also failed to find\nevidenceofanannually-re-viewed, publicly-available\nenvironmental policy, or\nsustainability goals in a\nnumber of areas, including\ncommunity involvement\nand biodiversity.\nOne Imperial academic\nsaid that they were \u201cnot\nat all surprised\u201d about\nImperial\u2019s results in the\nleague tables. They told\nFelix: \u201cIt\u2019s about time\nthe College takes this as\nseriously as the other 140\nuniversities ahead of us in\nthe table. We\u2019re not only\nmissing a trick, we\u2019re\nbeginning to look like an\nunashamed laughing stock\nof penny-pinching suits.\u201d\nIn a statement, a College\nrepresentative said they\n\u201crecognise that we have a\nresponsibility to carry out\nour mission sustainably\nand to minimise the environmental impact of our\noperations\u201d. They referred\nto their \u201cworld-leading\nresearch in energy, the\nenvironment, and climate\nchange\u201d, which produces\n\u201cfact-based reports that\nadvance the field, inform\nthe public, and contribute\nto global policy\u201d.\nDivestment in fossil fuel\ncompanies has become a\npoint of contention across\na number of UK campus-es. The University of East\nAnglia divested last week,\nfollowing a four-year\ncampaign by students and\nactivists.\nAside from the ethical\narguments against investing in fossil fuel compa-nies, there is also the economic threat of the \u2018carbon\nbubble\u2019: current valuation\nof fossil fuel companies\nis based on the assumption that all reserves will\nbe consumed, but it is\nlikely that international\nagreements will limit the\namount of hydrocarbons\nconsumed. Mark Carney,\nthe Governor of the Bank\nof England, has warned\nabout the \u201cpotentially\nhuge\u201d threat this bubble\nposes to investors.\nThe ranking of universities is carried out by People\n& Planet throughout the\nsummer. Universities\nhave the opportunity to\nappeal their score before\nit is published. Sian Berry,\nthe Green Party politician\nwho came third in 2016\u2019s\nLondon mayoral race, said\nthat the rankings are \u201cimportant for anyone \u2013 staff\nmember or student \u2013 who\nwant to improve their university\u2019s record on green\nand ethical issues\u201d.\n\u201cImperial\nplaced\n141st\nof 154\nuniversities,\nmaking it\nbottom of the\nRussell Group\u201d\nThis year\u2019s results are a\nsharp decline for Imperial,\nwhich came 96th\nin the previous version of the table,\nand was 16th\nout of the 24\nRussell Group universities\nin 2015.

After\nshe reported the attack,\nthe College and Union\ntook seven months to\nconclude her allegations\nwere true, in which\ntime the perpetrator had\nbecome president of the\nsociety.\nSexual abuse is widespread on university\ncampuses: some reports\nsuggest that a quarter of\nfemale students in the\nUK have been sexually\nassaulted, with many more\nexperiencing harassment.\nGiven the scale of the\nproblem, it is reasonable\nto assume that the College\nand the Union are able\nto respond to reports of\nsexual abuse in ways\nthat are fair, supportive,\nand put student welfare\nfirst. Helen\u2019s experience,\nhowever, was defined\nby miscommunication,\nlack of a reliable point of\ncontact, and the absence\nof support for the victim,\nsociety, or investigator.\nI first met Helen towards\nthe end of September,\nexactly six months since\nshe had first reported the\nincident. We spent about\n40 minutes in a cafe near\nwhere she is now working,\nand discussed the case.\nHer responses to my\nquestions were measured\nand considered, but it was\nclear that she felt \u2013 and\ncontinues to feel \u2013 angry\nand disillusioned with her\nexperience.\n\u00a7\nHelen did not raise a\ncomplaint immediately,\nremaining conflicted\nabout the decision for\naround two months: \u201cI\nwas terrified that personal\nattacks would be used to\ndismiss my allegation:\nI\u2019d had some wine, I was\nwearing a low cut dress,\nI like to flirt with people\nanyway. This prevented\nme from coming forwards,\ndespite knowing what had\nhappened was non-consensual,\u201d she said.\nWhat prompted her to\nreport it, however, was\ndiscovering that David\nwas running to be president of the society associated with the event. Such a\nrole, she felt, would place\nhim in an \u201cinappropriate\nand potentially dangerous\u201d position of power.\nThis was something she\nhad experienced herself;\nduring her freshers\u2019 year\nat another university, her\nrespect for a student president\u2019s authority meant she\nwas taken advantage of\nsexually, and she feared\nthis could happen again.\nHours before the\nsociety\u2019s AGM, she told\nthe outgoing president\nwhat had happened; they\nresponded with sincerity\nand recommended that she\nreport it to the Union.After\ninforming two Union staff\nmembers, she was referred\nto the College, who, during\ntheir initial investigation,\npassed her between three\ndifferent individuals.\nWhile this was because the\nCollege wanted to follow\nthe recommended guide-lines, providing her with a\nfemale staff member when\nshe gave her statement, at\nno point was she assigned\nan official point of contact.\nAfter giving her statement,\nshe went nearly a month\nwith no contact, despite\nCont. pg 4\nNEWS\nImperial sink to\nthe bottom of\nthe green league\ntables\nPAGE 6\nCOMMENT\nWe need to\nexpand Ethos\nright now\nPAGE 9\nMUSIC\nTaylor Swift's\nnew album is\none to avoid\nPAGE 19\nTV\nOur take on\nBojack season 4\nPAGE 20\nThe long delays and lack of support from the Union greatly affected Helen's mental health and wellbeing // Felix\n\n"

The place is\nknown for its open mic on\nTuesdays, with the likes\nof Erykah Badu and Macy\nGray having stepped up\non that stage. The house\nband and host are the real\nattraction; the band will\nriff with any performer\nthat comes to the stage\n\u2013 despite not knowing\nwhat they\u2019re planning to\nperform \u2013 and with the\nhost, they flow in and out\nof interludes tightly. The\nrest of the week is filled\nwith amazing nights:\nfusion jams happen on\nWednesday and Friday,\nand a reggae night is\nheld on Thursday. The\nplace is open \u2018til 1am\nmost nights and is worth\nchecking out, even if it\u2019s\njust to try some pretty\ndecent Caribbean food.\nRonnie Scott\u2019s\nSoho\nThe most renowned\njazz club in London,\nRonnie Scott\u2019s, delivers\nthe highest quality live\nmusic in the whole of the\ncity. It must be the reputation of the place, because\nworld famous jazz artists\ndown to anxious students\nalways play at their finest,\nhoping to prove themselves in front of their\nmusical peers. The jam\nupstairs on Wednesdays\nis definitely the best night\nfor 50s/60s jazz vibes:\nhosted by a trumpeter who\nplays all your favourite\nlicks one after the other,\nthe music goes on \u2018til 3am.\nThe jam opens up after the\nfirst set, and musicians\nwho want to perform sit\nbehind the band, waiting\nto be called up. In terms of\nthe music they play, it can\nbe a bit showoff-y, with\nperformers playing their\nfastest lines in the highest\nregister possible. But it\u2019s\nstill very impressive to\nwatch, and if you\u2019re lucky,\nyour favourite musician\ntravelling through London\nmight even show up\nand play a couple tunes.\nVortex Jazz Club\nDalston\nThe Vortex holds many\ngreat performances from\na variety of international\nacts; they hold a pretty\ndecent jam session on\nSundays also. Lead by a\nguitarist, which gives a\ndifferent dynamic to the\nusual piano combo, the\nhouse band perform to a\nhigh standard, similar to\nRonnie\u2019s, yet without the\nsame pressured atmosphere (or cleanness). It\u2019s\nquite a relaxed environ-ment, with seats and a\nsmall bar with an accompanying view of Gillett\nSquare (one of the weirdest\nplaces in Hackney). It\u2019s\nmore of an alternative to\nRonnie Scotts (essentially\na free version of the\nclub) but still provides\nexcellent music from very\ncompetent musicians.\nMau Mau Bar\nNotting Hill\nHome to the Jazz\nRe:freshed residency,\nMau Mau Bar hosts all\nthe best up-and-coming\nLondon musicians on their\nThursday shows. This\nplace gives you the opportunity to hear the next\nstars in the London jazz\nscene before they blow up.\nGroups such as Binker and\nMoses, Yussef Kamaal,\nand the Ashley Henry Trio\nhave come through Mau\nMau Bar into popularity.\nThe intimate setting of\nthe stage is slightly raised\nabove the audience who\ncrowd round, giving a\nunique experience to the\nlisteners; probably the last\ntime that you\u2019ll be able\nto stand so close to them.\nMetric Jazz Jams\nSouth Kensington\nOkay, maybe not on the\nsame level as the other\nplaces, but the jazz jams\nat Metric every other\nTuesday are a great place\nfor Imperial students to\nlisten to decent live music\nat their favourite local\nvenue. Plus, it\u2019s probably\nthe only time you\u2019re\ngonna see Metric filled\nwith not (completely)\npissed people. Being a stu-dent-lead jam, it\u2019s a very\naccessible way of playing\njazz with people of similar\nskill levels and the organisers are very welcoming\nto whoever wants to come\nup and play a tune.

Few frontmen\ncommand as much energy\nand adoration from their\nfans as an inebriated Tim\nKinsella who, in between\nFrench horn solos, spent\nmore time on top of the\ncrowd than the stage, repeatedly hurling his tambourine before realising he\nneeded it for the next song.\nIt was plain to see how\nmuch this moment meant\nto those in attendance; not\na single lyric was missed,\nwith many older fans\nscreaming their lungs out\nin a desperate attempt to\nrelive and recapture some\nlost youth.\nThis was a funeral as\nmuch as a reunion, with\nKinsella announcing \u201cwe\nplayed our first show in\nOctober 1989 and, barring\na miracle of money, this\nis going to be our last\u201d,\nclearly evident in his\nexpression how dear and\nspecial everything about\nthe band was to him. The\njubilant, beaming smile\non Nate Kinsella\u2019s face\nthroughout the gig was\nalmost tear-inducing, especially when paired with\nsongs of lost childhood\nand the inevitability of\ngrowing up. As the main\nshow was brought to a\nclose with \u2018Ooh do I love\nyou\u2019, the magical atmosphere in the room was\noverwhelming. We were\nthen treated to an encore\nwith their iconic cover of\n\u2018Take on me\u2019 (you need to\ncheck this one out, trust\nme). Few bands have had\nthe impact and emotional\ninfluence of Cap\u2019n Jazz,\nand their final night\ncouldn\u2019t have been a more\nfitting farewell.\nMUSIC\nAlex MontgomerieCorcoran\nJazz Man, Music Writer\nMUSIC\nKieran Naylor\nMusic Writer\nJesus Christ walked on water, but Tim Kinsella surfed on\nland // Wikimedia\nJazz greats have walked through these doors for decades // Flickr: vjlawson2001\nThe new Taylor Swift album can\u2019t come to the phone\nright now. Why? Oh, \u2018cause it\u2019s shit.\nBigger and bolder than her previous works, Taylor Swift\u2019s sixth LP is far removed from her country roots. It\u2019s a\npowerful statement that unequivocally cements her as one of this century\u2019s most mediocre sensations.\nI\nt\u2019s not too long since\nthe world was introduced to girl next\ndoor and singer-song-writer, Taylor Swift, with\nher guitar and her country\ntinged pop. Upon entering\nthe scene, Swift instantly\nmade massive waves in\nthe music industry and\npop culture, for better or\nworse, with singles like\n\u2018You belong with me\u2019\nand \u2018Teardrops on My\nGuitar\u2019. The young and\noh-so-naive Swift would,\nin the early 2010\u2019s, evolve\ninto your standard cookie\ncutter international pop\nstar with the clean, polished image and corporate\npieces that labels like PC\nMusic could unironically\nship. Singles like \u2018We Are\nNever Ever Getting Back\nTogether\u2019, \u2018Shake it Off\u2019\nand \u2018I Knew You Were\nTrouble\u2019 were marketing\nmasterpieces, with just the\nright lyrics and amount\nof saccharine plastic\nproduction to secure mass\npopularity. Then there\nwere the rough years. With\nnegative media attention\nand the notorious back and\nforth with a certain Mr. K.\nWest, the pristine image of\nSwift had been gradually\ntainted in the public eye.\nThe biggest catalyst\nfor Swift Inc.\u2019s latest\nre-branding effort Reputation would have to be\nthe aforementioned bout\nwith Kanye over the (now,\ninfamous) \u2018Famous\u2019 verse\non West\u2019s latest project,\nThe Life of Pablo. For the\nunaware, West, in the first\n30 seconds, proclaims that\nhe \u201cand Taylor might still\nhave sex\u201d as he \u201cmade\nthat bitch famous\u201d. This\nresulted in a lot of publicised tension between the\ntwo parties, the apex being\nKim Kardashian releasing\na video depicting Swift\u2019s\nconsent to the audacious\nverse.\n\u201cSonically, this\nhas to be one\nof the worst\nproduced pop\nalbums in a\nlong time\u201d\nThat brings us to today.\nSwift is now a hip, mature,\nand self-aware pop star.\nOr at least, she tries to\nbe. As a declaration of\nher edginess, she released\nan hour-long album that\nimmediately fell flat on\nits face. Her previous\nmaterial was passable; I\nwouldn\u2019t actively choose\nto listen to it, sure, but I\ncould stomach it without\na knee-jerk reaction as\nintense and visceral as I\nhave now. Sonically, this\nhas to be one of the worst\nproduced pop albums in a\nlong time. The sounds that\nproducers Max Martin\nand Shellback bring on\nReputation are absolutely\ngrating, with some of the\nworst mixing I have ever\nhad the misfortune to hear,\nespecially prominent on\nthe first track \u2018...Ready\nFor It?\u2019.\nThe opener presents\nsome sort of cheap imitation of West\u2019s Yeezus, with\na large, buzzy baseline and\nblaring horns. The vaguely\nindustrial production of\nthe start is immediately\njuxtaposed with Swift\u2019s\nsickly sweet harmonies,\nand then synth pads which\neventually all end up in a\nnauseating mix. The mishmash of bass, horns, distorted snares, and Swift\u2019s\nvocals at the end resembles something of a sonic\ntrain wreck, and is frankly\nunlistenable thanks to the\nhorrible mixing.\nOther deeper cuts like\n\u2018Look What You Made\nMe Do\u2019 and \u2018Gorgeous\u2019\nhave some laughable\nproduction choices. As\nthe album progresses,\nthe Yeezy fetish dies off\nand Swift quickly settles\ninto her old routine, with\nsome basic synthpop and\na smattering of whatever\nis currently in (in this case\ntropical house and a trap\nsong featuring Future).\nThey are not in any way\nremarkable. In fact, they\nare the very opposite, dull\nand dross. Swift does an\nimpeccable FKA Twigs\nimpersonation in \u2018Dress\u2019,\nuncomfortably similar\nin structure and melody\nof Twigs\u2019 \u2018Pendulum\u2019.\nSomewhat surprisingly,\nthe final track has a\nfunny jittery piano piece,\nexpressing some real,\ngenuine emotion for the\nfirst, and perhaps only,\ntime on the entire album.\nIronically, this was the last\ntrack and this atmosphere\ndies off after the first\nminute, when an awkward\nguitar strolls into the mix.\nLyrically, the album is\nfilled with cringeworthy\nsnippets of half-baked\nattempts to be shocking.\nThe main culprit here is\nSwift\u2019s hyper literalism,\nwhich left me wincing. I\nguess only a work of great\nart from an artist who had\nmastered their craft could\nevoke such a physical\nreaction. Swift forgoes\nany semblance of subtlety,\nspouting pure shite in an\nalmost vulgar, brutish\nway. There are a couple of\nsongs in particular which\ndisplay Swift\u2019s literary\nprowess. On \u2018I Did Something Bad\u2019, she\u2019s a witch\nbeing burned at the stake\n(\u201cthey\u2019re burning all the\nwitches even if you aren\u2019t\none, so light me up (x8)\u201d).\nOn lead single \u2018Look What\nYou Made Me Do\u2019 she\nexplains the reinvention\nof her image and identity\nby suggesting that the \u201cold\nTaylor can\u2019t come to the\nphone right now. Why?\nOh, \u2018cause she\u2019s dead!\u201d.\nSwift also describes her\npast year as \u201cso Gatsby\u201d.\nWhen Swift isn\u2019t being a\nlyrical bull in a chinashop,\nshe sings about her relationship and love life, not\nsaying anything new or\nworth noting.\nThe biggest achievement of it all was my\nunending patience to sit\nthrough this, and to come\ninto it with an open mind.\nReputation doesn\u2019t do\nmuch well: not the vibe,\nnot the arrangements, and\ncertainly not the lyrics. In\nfact, it is not unreasonable\nto say it does nothing well.\nFlat generic vocals mixed\nin with drab over-produced\nand poorly mixed music\nall makes for a product\nto attract attention, not an\nalbum with any intrinsic\nartistic merit. This is the\nright product for Swift\u2019s\nmarket segment, those\npreteens from when Swift\nfirst broke through, now\nangry hormonal teenagers\nwho can relate to this\nvapid mess.\nIn tatters // Big Machine\nMUSIC\nSuraj G\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Taylor Swift.

He did not, however,\nrecommend removing him\nas president.\n\u201cIreadtherecommendations and immediately felt\nfaint. I couldn\u2019t believe a\nmonths-long investigation\ncould result in a mere slap\non the wrist,\u201d Helen said.\n\u201cThe focus on drinking\nwas irrelevant and offen-sive, as it suggests that\n[the perpetrator's] alcohol\nconsumption was to blame\nfor his actions.\u201d\nHelen has appealed the\nrecommendations, and is\nawaiting a decision by the\nGovernance Committee.\n\u00a7\nThe Union\u2019s constitution states that one of their\nreasons for existence is\nto promote the \u201cwelfare\nof students at Imperial\nCollege London\u201d. While\nHelen is, as an alumna,\nno longer a member of the\nuniversity or Union, her\nexperience sends a worrying message about how\nsexual misconduct cases\nare dealt with. Since 2010,\nthe College has dealt with\nat least eleven complaints\nof sexual misconduct;\nwhile the Union is unable\nto provide official data on\nhow many cases they deal\nwith yearly, it is highly unlikely that this is the first\ncase they have dealt with,\nand more cases are likely\nto occur.\nThe National Union of\nStudents (NUS) \u2018Hidden\nMarks\u2019 report, carried\nout in 2009-10, was the\ncountry\u2019s first nation-wide\nreport into women\nstudents\u2019 experience of\nsexual harassment and\nassault. The report made\nfor shocking reading:\none in seven women\nstudents had experienced\nserious sexual or physical\nviolence, and \u201cmany\nwomen students struggle\nto get through their course\nwithout coming into to\ncontact with harassment\nor violence in one form or\nanother.\u201d\nWhat was most signif-icant, however, was the\nlow number of women\nwho report such incidents:\njust 2% of victims of \u2018less\nserious sexual assault\u2019,\nand 4% of those who\nhad experienced \u2018serious\nsexual assault\u2019 reported\nit to their institution. A\nUniversities UK taskforce in 2015 found that\nnon-reporting can be the\nwomen on campus; one\nparticipant said Imperial\u2019s\n\u2018ingrained misogyny\u2019\nwas \u201cso deep that it had\nbecome normal.\u201d\nFor both the College\nand the Union, there does\nnot appear to be an official\npolicy on sexual violence,\nalthough they both list\nsources of support on their\nwebsites. While sexual\nassault is covered by the\nCollege\u2019s Student Disciplinary Procedure, there\nis no specific policy on it,\nunlike, say, their policy on\nharassment and bullying.\nThe closest the Union\ncomes to one is their Safe\nSpace Policy, which \u201caims\nto create an environment\nwhere all students, staff,\nand visitors feel safe and\nprotected.\u201d They told\nFelix that their policy is\n\u201cclear that we encourage\nreporting... and have a\nzero-tolerance approach.\u201d\nThere are clear steps\nthe College and the Union\ncould take to address the\nissue of sexual violence:\nHareem Ghani, the\nNUS National Women\u2019s\nOfficer, has said that \u201cas\nuniversity communities\nwe should respect the\nleadership of the victim/\nsurvivor in driving a\nprocess that we support\u201d,\nwhile the Universities UK\ntaskforce concluded that\nhaving effective reporting\nmechanisms and well-trained staff were key to\nencouraging students to\ncome forward.\nFintan O\u2019Connor,\nDeputy President\n(Welfare), has highlighted\nthe need for increased\nsupport systems, telling\nFelix that the Union \u201chad\na duty to do better\u201d earlier\non this term. The Union\nhas been working with the\nCollege to secure funding\nto develop a sexual violence support programme,\nwith six Sexual Violence\nLiaison Officers being\ntrained \u2013 two of whom are\nUnion staff \u2013 scheduled to\nbeinplaceinJanuary.They\nhave also implemented\nactive bystander training.\nIn a statement to Felix, a\nUnion representative said\nthat they acknowledged\n\u201cthere is more that the\nUnion and College can\ndo to reduce the risk of\nincidents occurring and\nto increase support for\nvictims\u201d. They will be\nreviewing this case during\ntheir governance review\nthis year. A College representative told Felix that\nthey will be \u201cconsulting\nwith groups who specialise in supporting victims\nof sexual assault or rape\u201d,\nto ensure they can offer\n\u201cthe best support possible\nto students\u201d.\n\u00a7\nComing forward is one\nthing, but the experience\nthat follows is another.\nThe recent spate of\nhigh-profile cases brought\nagainst those in power \u2013\nboth in Hollywood and\nWestminster \u2013 coupled\nwith the sense of solidarity that campaigns such\nas #MeToo generate, have\nresulted in more victims\ncoming forward. But this\nis only half the battle:\nstudents, staff, and alumni\nneed to know that their experiences will be listened\nto and acted upon.\nWhile Helen \u2013 like\nmany other women \u2013 has\nlet countless instances of\nsexual harassment and\nassaultslide,shehadprevi-ously reported two sexual\nassaults by strangers to the\npolice. Although there was\nnot sufficient evidence to\nidentify and prosecute the\nperpetrators, she always\nfound the officers kind and\ncapable. One of the key\ndifferences between how\nthe police and the Union\nhandled her cases was\nhaving a reliable point of\ncontact on the police force\nwho she felt was on her\nside, and always willing\nto keep her informed of\nprogress.\n\u201cIf I had known at the\nbeginning what my experience [with ICU] would\nbe like, I would have gone\nto the police instead,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThe insincerity\nand incompetence I encountered with the Union\nwas demoralising. What\ntroubled me most was\nthe thought of how many\nother sexual abuse victims\nat Imperial have surely\nsuffered similar treatment,\nand conceivably even\nhad their cases buried by\nnegligence.\u201d\nAn organisation is\nnot best judged on its\nsuccesses, but on its\nfailures. Helen\u2019s experience represents a single\nperson\u2019s experience, but\neven that is one too many\nwhen one considers the\nimpact of such cases.\n\u201cUnless the Union can\ndemonstrate they are able\nto handle sexual abuse\ncases efficiently, fairly,\nand supportively,\u201d she\ntells me, \u201cit is clear to me\nthat it should not take on\nthis responsibility.\u201d\nNames have been\nchanged.\nIf you have been affected by anything discussed\nin this article, please\nconsider phoning The Samaritans (116 123), Rape\nCrisis (0808 802 9999), or\nSurvivors UK (020 3598\n3898) for confidential\nsupport and advice.\nVictim says Union \" should not take on\" sexual assault cases until they show they can handle them fairly\nAfter reporting her sexual assault, Helen's experience was defined by miscommunication, lack of a reliable point of\ncontact, and absence of support.\nNEWS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\u201cHelen says\nthat her\nexperience\npushed her\nback into a\nsuicidal state\u201d\nseveral emails to the staff\nmembers she\u2019d been in\ntouch with.\nThese periods of radio\nsilence continued throughout the investigation.\nWhen she heard back from\nthe College, they said the\ncase had been passed on to\nanother staff member, who\nthen informed her it had\nbeen passed back to the\nUnion. She then waited\nmore than six weeks for a\nUnion staff member \u2013 who\nhad been assigned to lead\nthe investigation \u2013 to get in\ntouch, asking for another\nstatement. Even when the\ninvestigation was drawing\nto a close, she experienced\na period of two weeks in\nwhich she tried repeatedly\nto get in touch with the\ninvestigator, with no\nsuccess.\n\u201cI spent most of this\ntime in complete despair.\nThe most painful times\nwere when I knew [the\nperpetrator] was enjoying\nevents which I stayed\naway from, out of fear that\nI would come across him,\u201d\nHelen said. \u201cThe other\noverwhelming feeling\nwas of isolation. I had no\nreliable contact and would\ngo weeks hearing nothing.\nI was consumed with the\ncase, while nobody responsible for it seemed to\ncare, or even acknowledge\nit. This made me feel my\ngrip on reality was slipping.\u201d\nHelen has a severe,\nlong-term mental health\ncondition which intensifies\nemotional pain, requiring\nher to go to hospital every\nweek for treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve\nbuilt up resilience, but\nthis experience pushed me\nback into a suicidal state.\nAt times, I was barely\nable to sleep or work,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAbsurdly, the sexual\nassault investigation was\nmore distressing than the\nsexual assault itself.\u201d\nThroughout the inves-tigation, there was also a\ncomplete lack of certainty\nabout when it might come\nto an end. Given that\nHelen raised the complaint\nafter finding out the perpetrator may be in a position\nof authority once the academic year began, it was\nvital to her that the case\nconcluded before then.\nFor many freshers, this is\ntheir first time living away\nfrom home, and it can be\na period of great vulnera-bility.\nEven after a sabbatical\nofficer \u2013 who Helen had\napproached for help \u2013 had\nnotified the investigator of\nthe effect the investigation\nwas having on her mental\nhealth, the investigation\ndid not pick up pace. The\nexpected finishing date\nwas pushed back again and\nagain: at the end ofAugust,\nshe was told it would conclude by mid-September;\nbut when this date passed,\nshe was told to expect a\nresolution by the month\u2019s\nend; this date, too, passed,\nand the deadline shifted to\nthe middle of October, by\nwhich point the Freshers\u2019\nFair had been and gone.\nA Union representative\ntold Felix that investigations are \u201coften sensitive\nand complex\u201d, meaning\nthey \u201ctake a long time to\nreach an outcome\u201d. They\nsaid that \u201ca lengthy period\nof investigation can add to\nthe distress experienced,\nand we apologise that this\nhasrecentlybeenthecase\u201d.\nWhile the College has said\n\u201cit would not be right\u201d to\ncomment on a specific\ncase, a College spokesperson told Felix \u201cwe deeply\nregret if anyone feels that\nan investigation of sexual\nassault or harassment has\nnot been handled by the\nCollege with the urgency\nit warrants... we will seek\nto learn from this experience.\u201d\n\u00a7\nWhat caused these\ndelays? One clear problem\nwas the gathering of\nwitness statements.\nHelen was able to name\nfour individuals (not\nincluding the perpetrator)\nwho might have seen\nwhat happened, and their\ntestimonies had to be\ncollected independently.\nThis process continued for\nmonths, and not a single\nperson involved was able\nto submit a statement\nwithout some miscommu-nication. During this time,\nHelen was forced to act as\nintermediary, being asked\nto contact the witnesses\nherself.\n\u201cCoordinating the\nwitness statements was\nextremely frustrating,\u201d\nHelen said. \u201cI would have\na period of silence, then a\nperiod of being pelted with\ncontradictory messages.\nNothing made sense, and\nI wondered if I was being\nlied to. I felt completely\nout of control.\u201d\nOne witness, Emily,\nfirst reached out to the\nCollege at the beginning\nof June, voicing her\nconcern at not having been\ncontacted, and offering to\nsupply a statement. The\nCollege replied to her the\nnext day, saying that they\nwould be in touch with\nher shortly, but she never\nheard from them. She\nonly managed to provide a\nstatement to the Union in\nmid-September. Another\nwitness, Nick, a graduate,\nwas first contacted in June,\nbut in mid-September the\ninvestigator told Helen\nthat he had not been in\ncontact with him; it was\nnot until late September\nthat he was able to provide\na statement. At the end\nof August, the Union\u2019s\ninvestigator told Helen\nthat he had been in contact\nwith another witness,\nPaul; just over two weeks\nlater she was told that Paul\nhad not been in touch.\nA few days later, Paul\nconfirmed to Helen that he\nhad been in touch with the\nUnion, but the investigator\ncontinued to deny that this\nwas the case: receipt of\nhis statement was never\nacknowledged.\nDespite the investigation being passed to the\nUnion in June, and Helen\nbeing told in August\nthat the investigator was\nawaiting a statement from\nthe perpetrator with an\nimminent, hard deadline,\nit was not until October\nthat David\u2019s statement was\ntaken.\nThe key witness,\nJohn, was first contacted\ntowards the end of June.\nAn initial meeting with\nthe Union was cancelled,\nand over the next month\nhe sent five emails to the\ninvestigator and visited\nthe Union offices in\nperson three times, with\nno response. After providing a witness statement, he\nwaited nearly two months\nto hear a response, during\nwhich he emailed the\ninvestigator another five\ntimes.\nWhen concerns were\nraised over this lack of\ncontact, the Union cited\nissues with data protection\nthat prevented them from\nreaching out to witnesses,\nsaying that they had not\nbeen given explicit permission by the College to\nuse the email addresses.\nImperial College Union\ndoes not have its own\ndata protection policy, and\noperates under College\npolicy; the decision to\ndelay contacting witnesses\nwas one reached by the two\norganisations. The data\nprotection concern they\nraised, however, related to\ncontacting alumni, while\nJohn and most of the\nother witnesses were still\nstudents at the time the\ncomplaint was raised.\n\u00a7\nThe Union investigation\nprovisionally concluded at\nthe end of October, more\nthan nine months after\nthe assault occurred, and\nseven months on from\nwhen Helen first reported\nit. During that time, her\ncase had been bounced\nbetween at least half a\ndozen people, from the\nUnion to the College and\nback again.

Some\nolder people currently live\nin the zone unofficially,\nhaving refused to leave\ntheir homes. However, the\nland cannot be officially\nre-used without a full\nassessment of the risks.\nJim Smith, Professor\nof Environmental Science\nat the University of Portsmouth, will lead a team of\nUK and Ukrainian scientists developing the first\nenvironmental management information system\ndevised for an exclusion\nzone following a nuclear\naccident.\nProfessor Smith will\nwork with the Ukrainian\ngovernment and other\npartners in developing the\nsystem. He is an expert in\nmodelling pollution by ra-dionuclides, and is helping\nthe country to develop\na plan for the future. It\nis hoped that the system\nwill ensure that decisions\non whether and when to\nallow farming and other\nactivities to resume in the\nzone are underpinned by\nscientific advice.\nThe human exclusion\nzone around Chernobyl\nwas put in place due to\nchronic radiation fallout\nfollowing the accident.\nRadiation was detected\nacross Europe \u2013 including\nthe UK \u2013 and as far afield\nas Canada. About 135,000\nresidents were evacuated\nfrom the region which\nthen became a no-go\nzone. The exclusion zone\nalso brought the loss to\nthe country of hundreds\nof thousands of acres of\nforestry and agricultural\nland.\nIn 2015 Professor\nSmith published the first\nlong-term study of the\nhuman exclusion zone\u2019s\nenvironmental health,\nwhich found wildlife in\nthe Chernobyl exclusion\nzone was thriving 30 years\nafter the accident.

Take some time out of your day to recognise the importance of\nself-care, and look at how you can include some in your life.\nCOMMENT\nShervin Sabeghi\nRCSU Welfare Officer\nW\noohoo it\u2019s\ns e l f - c a r e\nawareness\nweek! I\nhope you\u2019re as excited\nabout that as I am! No?\nOkay \u2013 well keep reading\nand see how you feel at the\nend.\nWhen I first became\nRCSU Welfare Officer\n(aka \u2018The RCSU Condom\nGuy\u2019), I wanted to put self-care on my agenda from\nthe off. It\u2019s something I\ndon\u2019t feel is encouraged\nmuch on campus; there is\nplenty of information and\ndissemination of services\nto help us when things go\nwrong, but nowhere near\nenough about how to stop\nthings happening in the\nfirst place.\nBut what does self-care\nactually mean? The idea\nis, surprisingly enough,\nhow to care for yourself:\nhow to keep mentally and\nphysically healthy, and\nknowing when to seek\nhelp for something you\ncannot deal with yourself.\nThere are two main strands\nof self-care. Firstly, it\u2019s\nstopping problems before\nthey start \u2013 healthy daily\nand lifestyle choices will\nhelp do this, as well as addressing problems before\nthey develop too far.\nSecondly, it\u2019s empowering\nus with the knowledge and\nconfidence to deal with\nminor ailments ourselves,\nwhere possible, since\nthis is inevitably quicker\nand more personal, and\nreduces the strain on\nhealth services.\nA lot of self-care is\ncommon sense, really,\nbut it is worth reminding\nourselves of it, and to\nexplicitly spend time\nthinking about our own\nself-care methods. It is\nall quite personal, and\ndifferent things will work\nfor different people, but\nhere are some things I\u2019d\nsuggest:\nHealth\nDisclaimer: not a\ndoctor. (FREMULON!)\n\u00b7 Probably the most\nobvious thing I\u2019ll say: keep\nactive. Be it just walking\nto and from campus\neveryday (unless you live\nin Beit, in which case that\ncertainly does not count),\nor having some focussed\nexercise time. Find what\nworks best for you and\nyour timetable, but don\u2019t\noverdo it! Recognise you\nhave your limits.\n\u00b7 Eat healthily: another\nsuperobviousone.Healthy\neating isn\u2019t about restricting what you eat, it\u2019s about\nbalance and enjoyment!\nWe\u2019re all basically scientists here, so experiment.\nPlay around with your diet\nand find what makes you\nfeel better. Our bodies all\nreact very differently to\ndifferent foods, so there is\nno one-size-fits-all diet.\n\u00b7 Sleep: get enough\nquality sleep. While\nthere\u2019s no fixed amount\nfor everyone, generally,\nhaving uninterrupted\nsleep, in a settled location\n(i.e. your bed) for a sufficient amount of time will\nlead to greater daytime\nenergy levels, productiv-ity, and emotional stability (which is nice to have\nevery so often.)\n\u00b7 Pharmacists \u2260 just\ncashiers: did you know\nyou have to have a full\ndegree to become a phar-macist? They are trained\nto give advice on minor\nailments and everyday\nhealth issues, but are criminally underused. Next\ntime you have a cold, or an\nache, or similar, consider\ngoing to your local Boots\nand talking to someone\nthere (they also have an\namazing meal deal \u2013 I\u2019d\nrecommend the smoked\nham and egg club with\nQuavers and an Innocent\nsmoothie.)\nSocial life/work life\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget to have\na social life: work\u2019s hard,\nand important, but don\u2019t\nforget that connections\nwith people are crucial;\nthey can make you feel\nvalued and build confi-dence, so don\u2019t (regularly)\nsacrifice socialising for\nwork. It\u2019s easy to neglect,\nso actively slotting in time\nfor socialisation during\nbusy times can be useful\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget to do\nwork (please forgive the\nmitigate them. Be lame\nand write these things\ndown; make your self-care\nplan explicit rather than\nsomething you sort of do\nin the background\n\u00b7 Plan ahead where\npossible: don\u2019t let life\nthrow nasty surprises\nyour way for things you\ncould have prepared for.\nHaving a basic idea of\nwhat you want to achieve\nduring the next week, and\ncompartmentalising things\non paper can help things\nbecome less overwhelm-ing.\nSo, those are my main\ntips but, hey, what do I\nknow really? I\u2019m just\nanother student. Find\nwhat works for you and\nkeep to that. I would also\nsay, though, that it\u2019s easy\nto worry that you\u2019re not\ndoing enough of the \u2018right\u2019\nthingsyoushouldbedoing,\nor that you\u2019re becoming\nstressed about your stress.\nSelf-care is important,\nbut it\u2019s not possible to\nalways get things right!\nA major part of self-care\nis knowing when to get\nhelp. The simple idea\nbeing: seek help when you\ncan\u2019t deal with a problem\nyourself anymore. The\nsteps in between are very\nimportant, though. There\nare many stages between,\nfor example, \u2018feeling a bit\ndown\u2019 and full blown de-pression, yet often people\ndon\u2019t act until the last\nstage. There needs to be\na culture shift at Imperial\nso that we don\u2019t feel like\nwe should have problems,\nor accept them as a natural\npart of being an Imperial\nstudent. We deserve to be\nhappy whilst we study,\nand to feel empowered to\nstop major issues before\nthey develop.\nTaking some time out to evaluate your stresses can be vital // Creative Commons\n\u201cWe deserve\nto be happy\nwhilst we\nstudy, and stop\nmajor issues\nbefore they\ndevelop\u201d\nDevil\u2019s advocacy): university can be a constant\nbarrage of temptation to\ndo something that isn\u2019t\nyour work and a skill we\nall need to possess is that\nof saying \u2018no\u2019. Sometimes,\nwork really does need to\ncome first and recognising\nthat there will be other\nnights out, house parties,\npub trips etc. is necessary.\nGeneral points\n\u00b7 Recognise your\nweaknesses: we all have\nthem \u2013 I know, myself,\nI\u2019m so bad at prioritising\nwhat I spend time on, and\noften side-line myself\nwith things I shouldn\u2019t\nbe doing (like this article\nmaybe\u2026?). By embracing\nyour weaknesses, you\ncan begin to look how to\n\n"
