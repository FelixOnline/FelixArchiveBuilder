The first half was a close affair\nwith penalties keeping the score board\nticking over for both sides. The first try\nof the match came early in the second\nhalf scored by the Imperial Medicals.\nImperial fought back, however, taking a 5\npoint lead with an unconverted try only a\nfew minutes of normal time left. Imperial\nMedicals hit straight back with strong\ndrive from the kick off resulting in a try to\nlevel the scores and force extra time at\n19-19.\nExtra time was very tense with only a\npenalty eventually winning the match for\nthe Imperial Medicals leaving Imperial\nto wait another year for the elusive JPR\nWilliams Match victory.\nCongratulations to both sets of players\nfor providing an amazing match for the\nrecord Varsity crowd!\nFull Varsity Results\nImperial v Medics\nNetball 4th Team 10-15\nNetball 3rd Team 17-34\nNetball 2nd Team 22-24\nNetball 1st Team 38-42\nSquash Mens 1st 5-0\nSquash Mens 2nd 5-0\nSquash Womens 0-3\nBasket Ball Mens 134-55\nBasket Ball Womens 96-8\nWater Polo Mixed 10-1\nHockey Womens 1st 6-2\nHockey Womens 2nd 2-1\nHockey Mens 2nd 0-0\nLacrosse Mixed 15-3\nFootball Mens 1st 5-1\nFootball Mens 2nd 3-1\nRugby Womens 7s 17-5\nRugby Mens 2nd 3-13\nRugby Mens 3rd 0-43\nBadminton Mens 1st Imperial Win\nBadminton Mens 2nd Imperial Win\nRugby Mens 1st 19-22\nImperial 13 1/2\nMedics 8 1/2\n.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nVarsity Day 2008\nPHOTO | IAN GILLET\nImperial College Union is pleased to\nannounce that involvement in our Clubs\nand Societies continues to grow with\ntotal memberships already past last\nyear\u2019s record number.

What\nis it with Americans and the\nthree-quarter length trouser-shorts abominations that make\nthem look like adult-sized\ntoddlers?\nThe newest Gap collection has\nsome great casual light-weight\ncotton hoodies, and henley\ntees.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nFriday 29 February 2008 felix\nFashion\nCOOL\nLAME\nI\nt is no secret that shopping is\nan addiction; for some the high\nachieved when purchasing a new\ndress or slipping your feet into\nnew leather shoes is matched by\nlittle else. For others, over-indulging at\nTopshop becomes a regular habit, reducing those that don\u2019t get their fortnightly fix to a jibbering wreck. But\nwho says that next hit has to be from\na mass production line (hands up how\nmany of you have seen someone else\nwearing your polka dot dress from\nPrimark)? West London is home to\nsome of the world\u2019s top fashionistas,\nand even they tend to run out of wardrobe space by the end of each season.\nThe less environmentally-inclined may\ntrash their old Cavalli (shockingly, over\none million tonnes of clothes ends up\nin landfill every year), but most hedge-funders feel that taking their designer\nrags down to the charity shop constitutes giving back to society. While\nyour George at Asda top shrinks to the\nsize of a doll\u2019s dress after a stint in the\ntumble-dryer, these classic items have\nbeen known to out-live their owners.\nNip into any of the charity shops along\nKings Road and you\u2019ll be fighting with\nthe next generation fashion designers\nfor this season\u2019s floral dresses and sec-ond-hand, two-tone Kurt Geiger\u2019s.\nVintage clothing meccas such as\nRetro Woman and Retro Man in\nNotting Hill Gate (32-44 Pembridge\nIt\u2019s vintage darling\nRoad) are where you should head for\nsomething more out of the ordinary.\nLet\u2019s face it, second-hand Chanel aint\u2019t\nhaute couture, but it\u2019s better than\nNext. Whether day-glo tank tops are\nyour thing, or beaded brocade dresses,\nthese stores guarantee items that you\nwon\u2019t see your lab partner sporting at\nthe Summer Ball. While some patience\nis required to trawl through the many\nrails of clothing on offer, the gems to\nbe discovered are worth the effort. At\nthe recent ethical fashion show held at\nthe union, items such as a vintage black\nsilk Ghost dress and a cream dress with\ngold detailing from Aquascutum shone\non the catwalk. For boys, their shirts by\nbrands such as Thomas Pink and Bluray are a snip at \u00a310-\u00a320. Match with\na new (old) cashmere vest and jeans\nand you\u2019ll be a hit in the local bar. Even\nbetter, there\u2019s money to be made \u2013 nip\ninto Retro Man or Woman with your\nnicer wardrobe rejects plus proof of ID\nand address and you might be offered a\nfew quid for them (the same applies for\nbooks and music too!). Not only can\nvintage fashion be kinder to the wallet\nand reduce the burden on landfill, its\nloyal followers never fail to turn a head\nfor all the right reasons.\nMany thanks to Retro Man and\nWoman for providing clothes for the\nEthical Fashion Show held at Imperial\nCollege Union.\nHannah Theodorou\nT\nhis years\u2019 Oscar red carpet\ndresses were on the whole\nshockingly vanilla. In fact,\nnot even vanilla, fiordilat-te. No-one dressed up as a\nswan (a dress I actually loved). Perhaps\neveryone was trying to desperately stay\noff the radar of \u201cworst dressed\u201d. Isn\u2019t\nall publicity good publicity? Everyone\nknows Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s name. Or if not the name\nBj\u00f6rk, then crazy-swan-lady.\nTilda Swinton, oh Tilda Swinton.\nWhy a black velvety sheath of a dress?\nShe could\u2019ve looked so lovely with her\nglowing skin if she\u2019d worn something\nflattering to her figure. I mean, she already has to contend with the fact that\nshe\u2019s a ginger, why make things worse\nCelebrities congregate on a red carpet\nfor yourself. I\u2019m kidding, I love gingers.\nWell, strawberry blondes.\nHeidi Klum looks like she\u2019s about to\ndo panto. She has at least a few more\nyears till she falls to that level. Remove\nthe shoulder construction monstrosity and it would be a perfectly pretty\ndress.\nJohnny Depp can do no wrong in my\neyes. When he was born he hit every\nbranch on the beautiful tree. I love him\nwith Vanessa Paradis, they always turn\nit on for the red carpet with their own\ninimitable style.\nMarion Cotillard likes mermaids.\nShe likes them so much she wants to\nbe one. At the moment she\u2019s just dressing like a mermaid; she must do this for\na year to show her commitment. The\nnext step is a mermaidoscopy. Then\nher outside can match her inside.\nDiablo Cody\u2019s outfit is liquid awe-someness, solidified and made into\ndress form. I love the fact that she\u2019s\nmetamorphisised from stripper to\nscreen writer and yet has no problem\nwearing leapord print. She looks like\nshe\u2019s having fun in her dress, rather\nthan trying not to breathe in a stiff,\nconventional dress.\nEllen Page \u2013 dissapointed in her\ndress; she may as well have turned up\nin jeans. It looks like she\u2019s styled by\nMarks & Spencer. She looked better\nknocked up in Juno.\nSarah-Jane Skeete\n\n"

The\nshow was inspired by\nan earlier collaboration between Bernstein and Robbins (those crazy guys who created\nWest Side Story): Fancy Free, a ballet\nabout three sailors on 24 hours shore\nleave in New York City.\nAfter this proved a hit, the creators\nteamed up with Betty Comden and\nAdolph Green, who also starred in\nthe original Broadway production, to\ndevelop a full-blown musical around\nthe idea. The show was a smash\nand ran for 436 performances, and\nin 1949 was adapted into an Oscarwinning movie by MGM.\nThe film simplified the plot and\nditched much of Bernstein\u2019s beautiful score in favour of more \u2018accessible\u2019 studio-written numbers. It\nstarred Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra\nand Ann Miller, and was notable for\nbeing the first movie musical shot\nlargely on location.\nMain Characters:\nGabey: The main romantic lead\nChip: Timid sweetheart and your\ntypical tourist\nOzzie: Sailor obsessed with sex\nHildy: Wise cracking taxidrvier, also\ndesperate for sex\nClaire: Man-eating sexpot who is\ndesparately trying to stop being a man-eating sexpot\nIvy: Typical sweetheart\nPitkin: The baddie\nLucy: Hildy\u2019s roommate, happens to be\na nerd with a cold. Well, she\u2019d fit in at\nImperial...\nPlot\nOn the Town is the story of a 24-hour\nadventure involving three sailors: Chip,\nOzzie and Gabey who are on leave\nfrom their ship. Chip plans to see as\nmuch of the city as possible, relying on\nan out-dated guidebook from his dad.\nOzzie plans to meet a lot of girls. You\nmight want to take note, Imperial boys.\nGabey is the most serious of the three,\nand hopes to meet one special girl.\nThe three of them go off in search\nof Ivy Smith, the girl Gabey finds on\na billboard and believes is the one for\nhim. He becomes obsessed with her\nand gives the three men a mission: in\na city of 2.5 million women, find this\nbillboard girl: Ivy Smith.\nAs a policeman chases them because\nGabey takes the billboard off the wall,\nthe three split up. Gabey heads for\nCarnegie Hall (a bit like the Royal Albert Hall) where Ivy takes singing les-sons, Ozzie heads toward the Museum\nof Modern Art where she studies paint-ing, and Chip tries to find her through\nthe marketing division of the subway\nthat made her \u201cMiss Turnstiles.\u201d\nChip becomes distracted from his\nsearch by a cab driver named Hildy\nEsterhazy and later on, her roommate\nLucy. Meanwhile, Ozzie gets distracted\nby an engaged anthropology graduate\nstudent named Claire de Loone.\nGabey finally finds Ivy; she is standing on her head during a singing les-son, waiting for Madame Dilly, her\ninstructor, to come back from a quick\ntrip to buy some Scotch. Gabey makes\nplans to meet Ivy that night in Times\nSquare.\nGabey goes to Times Square to meet\nIvy but she never shows up. Ready for\ntheir big night on the town, the three\nsailors are short one girl. So Hildy calls\nroommate Lucy to join them. The six\ngo off for night of fun in the clubs of\nNew York, spending most of their\ntime running away from Claire\u2019s fianc\u00e9\nJudge Pitkin W. Bridgework and looking for Ivy.\nGabey eventually finds Ivy on Coney\nIsland and is joined by his friends. Before they can relax, they are cornered\nby everyone they have encountered\nand are arrested. Shit. The next morning the three are escorted by the police\nback to their ship to go back to sea.\nSongs to look out for:\nNew York, New York: Oh come on,\nyou must know this!! \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a\ntown\u201d\nI Can Cook Too: One to belt out when\nthe flatmates aren\u2019t around.\nLonely Town: Sweet, poignant song\nabout being lost in a strange town. One\nfor the Freshers.\nIf you liked this, try:\nWest Side Story: Yes I know we covered this already, but it is a seminal\nmusical and it was done by the same\nguys that did On the Town.\nAnything Goes: It\u2019s another musical\nabout sailors with some great production numbers and general opportunities for showing off.\nHow can I find out\nmore?\nWell, interesting you should mention\nthat! IC Musical Theatre Tour is doing\nOn The Town as their Summer musi-cal. What is tour I hear you ask? Well,\nafter rehearsing in the summer term we\ntravel to Budleigh Salterton in Devon\nfor two weeks of performing, eating\ncream teas, lazing on the beach and\npartying until the early hours. Last\nyear\u2019s production of West Side Story\nwas a big hit, playing to packed-out\naudiences. This year we hope to be\njust as successful and have just as\nmuch fun with On The Town. The\ninitial meeting where you can find\nout more about the show and tour\nin general and meet the production\nteam is on Monday 3rd March in the\nUnion Dining Hall at 8pm. Auditions\nwill be on the following weekend\nwith rehearsals continuing through\nthe Summer Term.\nby Dale Bassett\nMore information on any aspect\nof tour can be obtained by\ncontacting the MTSoc Tour\nChair. Email robert.felstead02@\nimperial.ac.uk\nOn The Town: The three sailors\u2019 attention was momentarily diverted\nas they compared cock sizes with buildings on Manhattan\u2019s skyline\nsuch. \u201cPortrait of the Composer Arthur\nLourie\u201d by Pyotr Miturich is strangely\nmodern again, while also looking like\nit could be a Picasso, possibly demonstrating the links between the French\nand Russian art, which I still don\u2019t think\nthe RA has fully demonstrated in From\nRussia. \u201cBeauty\u201d by Boris Kustodiev\nmakes me smile. It is a huge portrait\nof a large jelly-like pink nude smiling\ncheerfully, and sitting on an elaborate\nfloral bedspread. It\u2019s good fun.\nRoom six contains Neo-Primitivism, which is not a very happy move-ment. Lots of crude images in strong\ncolours. \u201cThe Promenade\u201d by Marc\nChagall stands out though: a grinning\nman holding a songbird in one hand\nwhile he whirls his girlfriend through\na bright white sky with the other. She\nflies in a deep purple dress above a\ncubist village. She is very expressionless given the situation. I like their\ndecorative floral picnic blanket in the\ncorner. \u201cSelf Portrait with Pyotr Konchalovsky\u201d by Ilya Mashkov is a wall-sized painting, mostly in brown, which\nfeatures \u201chalf-naked strong men\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s\nfundamentally homoerotic. It might be\nthe moustaches that do it. Beside it is a\nstill life of fruit, again by Ilya Mashkov.\nThe fruits are in screaming rainbow\ncolours while the rough background is\nslate grey. I really like this one, but then\nI always love the colourful stuff.\nIn the room of Cubo-Futurism I\nrather appreciate \u201cThe City at Night\u201d\nby Alexander Exter. It\u2019s so cubist you\ncan\u2019t tell what it is without looking at\nthe title. Next to it, I also like the quite\nsimilar \u201cMoscow\u201d by Aristarkh Lentulov, which is busy and bustling with\njagged shapes and varied colours.\nRoom eight is getting all modernist\nand abstract. There are a number of\nKandinskys here. \u201cWinter\u201d is not obviously of his usual style, and is in fact\nmuch better. It\u2019s strange how his pale\npink works so well splotched together\nwith the darker colours. I thought \u201cSupermatism\u201d by Kazimir Malevich was\na Kandinsky when I first saw it. In fact\nit\u2019s superior: crisper, cleaner, bolder. It\u2019s\nat this point I realise there have been\nno sculptures in this exhibition, unless\nyou count one model next to the exit,\nwhich is unusual in mainstream exhibitions but doesn\u2019t seem inappropriate\nat all. I am not a particular sculpture\nfan, and do not consider it a necessity.\nThe exhibition ends in total contrast\nto how it started, despite progressing\nonly 40 or so years in time. Here we\nhave \u201cBlack Cross\u201d, \u201cBlack Circle\u201d and\n\u201cBlack Square\u201d by Kazimir Malevich.\nThey are what they say they are, on\na flat white background. You get the\nimpression of a sudden, significant\nchange in art occurring as the exhibition draws to a close, which is powerful\nin making you thirsty for more art.\nTo sum it all up, From Russia is a rare\nopportunity to see a lot of big names\nand iconic works under one roof. It is\nimportant to seize the chance to see\nsuch travelling collections when you\ncan, as half the UK population seems\nto be doing. It is unfortunate that the\nexhibition is proving so hugely popu-lar, but I feel reluctant to criticise it\nfor this. I want art to be available to\nthe masses, so restricting the number\nof visitors to it would be wrong. In\nan ideal world this exhibition would\nbe open for longer, but obviously the\nart is merely on loan from Russia so\nthe 18th April deadline is inevitable. I\nwould like to have seen this collection\nshowcased in a bigger museum more\ncapable of catering for these crowds,\nthough I can\u2019t name off the top of my\nhead a venue that would really be any\nmore suitable. The RA have clearly\ntried their best.\nFrom Russia is on at the Royal\nAcademy until the 19th April.\nGood luck getting tickets, my\ndarlings!\nBlack Square by Kazimir Malevich. It really is just that Van Gogh\u2019s Portait of Dr Felix Rey who was probably his psychiatrist!\n\n"

Well, what a quick\ntwo weeks I\u2019ve had. The old\nclich\u00e9 says time flies when you\nare having fun. \u2018Tis very true...\nThis week we\u2019ve finally had\nspace to put in the Amy Macdonald\ninterview. It is rather naff but who\ncares? My first, so you have to forgive\nme. I\u2019m new to all this, that\u2019s my ex-cuse. Macdonald seemed really down\nto earth, unfazed by fame and all that\njazz. Glad it hasn\u2019t gone to her head,\nnot like some people. Not mentioning\nany names...\nAnyway, I\u2019m drifting off the point. I\nwent to the Union last Friday for the\nFresher Ball 2 thingy just for a laugh,\nas you do. I was not impressed with the\nmusic! It\u2019s not on. I mean, it was alright\nat the start, playing some half-decent\ndance stuff with the likes of Rihanna\nand Kanye West but then it just went\ndown hill from there. Basically, the DJ\njust played a crapload of dance that no\none in their right mind would choose\nto listen to. Honestly! Anyway, I\u2019ll stop\nranting about how terrible the music is\nat the Union. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve just gone\non a bad day. Let\u2019s move on to something more relevant in the world of\nmusic.\nThe Brit Awards dawned on us last\nweek. Best British male went to Mark\nRonson, beating strong competition\nfrom Jamie T, Mika, Newton Faulkner and Richard Hawley. Personally, I\nthink Mika deserved it. Let\u2019s not get\ntoo greedy though; best breakthrough\nact is not something to be sniffed at.\nOn the other side of the coin you have\nKate Nash. You either hate or love her.\nEither way, she picked up best British\nfemale. I\u2019m indifferent. Her tunes are\ncatchy and singalongable but I have to\nsay, she\u2019s not my cup of tea.\nTwo gongs went to The Arctic Monkeys for best album and best British\ngroup. Take That took best live act and\nsingle and The Foo Fighters clinched\ninternational group and best album\nfor Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.\nGood choices, I approve.\nI have to say I am sufficiently pleased\nthat 19 year old newcomer Adele received the critic\u2019s choice. I do see a\nbright future for that girl. Hands up if\nyou saw Kylie and Kanye West coming\nas best international solo artists? Kylie\nwill never get old, she is the princess of\npop, after all. How can you not fall for\nher charms and intoxicating voice?\nTaking a slight diversion... one thing\nI hate about not living at home is not\nbeing able to play my beloved piano.\nAs I don\u2019t have the luxury of living in\nthe 5 star hotel that is Southside, I have\nto console myself by going to the music\npractice rooms now and then. What\na trek. Most of the time, they\u2019re frig-ging booked too, leaving me feeling\ndejected and angry at the whole world\nin general. Ah well, that\u2019s enough from\nme. Enjoy this week\u2019s section!\nIf you fancy reviewing some\nmusic or gigs, send us an email\nat music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nget yourself on the mailing list.\nFree music giveaway soon, stay\ntuned!\nAmy Macdonald is a 20 year old singer/\nsongwriter from Glasgow. Having first\npicked up a guitar she found left lying\naround the house from her father\u2019s pop\ngroup days at the age of 12, Amy has\nconsolidated her considerable success\nthis year with a number one debut album \u2013 \u2018This is Life\u2019 which won her the\nbest newcomer of 2007 award by Radio Forth. The singles, \u2018Poison Prince,\u2019\na song inferring to the Pete Doherty\u2019s\ndrug addiction and his rather messed\nup life, released online as a limited edition and \u2018Mr Rock & Roll,\u2019 first allowed\nher to break into the Top 20. She has\nalso released a live cover of \u2018Mr. Brightside\u2019 by \u2018The Killers\u2019 recorded at the\nKing Tut in Glasgow.\nWith a number one album under\nher belt whilst busy touring being her\nmain agenda at the moment and with\na forthcoming single release \u2013 \u2018Run\u2019 in\nMarch, is it any wonder that Amy is\nhitting the hightime? This is definitely\nthe Life!\nWhat have you been up to\nrecently?\nI\u2019ve had a bit of a whirlwind recently.\nBut it\u2019s all been quite exciting. I\u2019ve been\ndoing a lot of promotion over here and\nin some places in Europe as well. It\u2019s all\ngoing good.\nHow would you describe the\nmusic that you make?\nIt\u2019s always been described as being a lot\nof different things. From that point of\nview, I write a lot of simple pop songs\nthat are easy to listen to. They are about\ntopics that anybody can relate to.\nWho are your inspirations and\ninfluences?\nI love all different types of music. The\nreason that I\u2019ve started in this is because of the band Travis \u2013 they inspired\nme. And then after that I listened to\nbands like Oasis, Ocean Colour Scene\nand The Libertines and now bands like\nThe Killers. I get inspired by loads of\nstuff really.\nWhen did it hit you that you\u2019ve\nfinally made it?\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had that feeling,\nbut I mean, it\u2019s really exciting to be in\nthe position that I\u2019m in. I feel really\nhonoured to have been given such a\ngreat chance and people are taking my\nmusic so well.\nAnd with a number one album,\nthat is something pretty amazing\nisn\u2019t it?\nYeah, it\u2019s great that it went to number\none, after so long since it had been re-leased. It just felt like the momentum\nwas still going.\nWhich track from the album are\nyou most proud of?\nI don\u2019t think you can choose a particular track because the album as a whole\nis what I\u2019m truly proud of.\nHas success gone to your head\nyet?\nNo, not at all. I only ever got into this\nbusiness for music. I was never in it to\nbe famous or have my face all over the\ncountry on the covers of Heat magazine or anything. I\u2019m still just the person I that I have always been back at\nhome in Glasgow and I think I will be\nin the very foreseeable future.\nSo is it all just the music for you\nthen, not the money, not the\nflashy lifestyle?\nIf I can earn enough money to get by,\nby doing this, then I\u2019d be happy.\nIs success something that money\ncan buy?\nI don\u2019t think that my success has been\nbought. I know I\u2019ve put so much hard\nwork and at times it has been really\nhard to keep going and I have done so\nand I\u2019m really content with how things\nare.\nMusic-wise, do you think you are\nsimilar to anyone?\nNot really. I kind of get the obligatory\ncomparisons to other Scottish singers/\nsongwriters like Katy Tunstall, Sandi\nThom. We all sing but make completely different styles of music, so I don\u2019t\nthink the comparisons are really ac-curate. But now that the album\u2019s been\nout for a while, I don\u2019t tend to get the\ncomparisons so much, I\u2019ve just been allowed to be my own person.\nWhat are you listening to at the\nmoment?\nWell, I constantly listen to music, I\u2019ve\nrecently bought the new album by Tom\nPaxton and I\u2019m listening to that.\nWhat do you think makes good\nmusic?\nThere can\u2019t just be a generic \u2018What\nmakes good music?\u2019 because everyone\nhas different tastes and everyone likes\ndifferent things. There are so many\nthings that can make a good song,\nwhether it be a good melody, the lyrics,\nthe production. So I don\u2019t think it matters as such as there are loads of ways\nthat music can be good.\nWhat aspect of being famous do\nyou enjoy the most?\nWell, I don\u2019t see myself as famous. I\nnever got into the music business to\nbe famous. I still live a normal life. I\ndo normal things like going out with\nfriends, going to the pub etc\u2026\nIf you were to go to uni, what\nsubject would you study and\nwhy?\nI was meant to be going to go to uni to\nstudy social sciences, with geography\nbeing my main subject.\nWas that your favourite subject\nback in school?\nYeah, my favourite teacher was my\ngeography teacher and that made the\nclasses a whole lot easier.\nWere you the teacher\u2019s pet by\nany chance?\nNo, not at all.\nWhat kind of student were you?\nLazy slacker, a hard worker?\nWith everything I do, I have always worked hard, it\u2019s part of my\npersonality.\nIf you weren\u2019t making music,\nwhat kind of job would you like\nto be doing?\nI\u2019d probably like to get into radio, be a\nradio DJ of some sort.\nWould you say you\u2019re a \u2018Party\nGirl\u2019?\nNo I don\u2019t go to that sort of stuff.\nDo you ever get stage fright?\nNo, not at all. I\u2019ve been really lucky as\nit\u2019s not something that I suffer from.\nI think it would be terrible if being in\nmy job and getting nerves everyday, it\nwould take the fun out of it if you are\nnervous and worried about how things\nare going to go.\nName me something that will\nalways get you going? Caffeine,\nhot chocolate?\nProbably just music. I don\u2019t drink coffee and I\u2019m not really a hot chocolate\nfan. I can\u2019t take hot drinks.\nWhich cold drinks do you like\nthen?\nIrn Bru.\nIf you can meet anyone alive or\ndead who would it be and why?\nFrank Sinatra. Because I think that he\u2019s\nsuch a wonderful talent. A wonderful\nsinger, it would be great to a do a duet\nor work with Frank Sinatra.\nWho are your role models?\nI don\u2019t know. If I am honest, there are\nmusicians that I look up to but I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019d base my own life on them. I\nthink I just take anything as it comes\nand make my own decisions.\nHave you got any mottos in life?\nWhat is meant for you won\u2019t pass you\nby.\nDo you ever get days where you\nthink sod it, I can\u2019t be bothered\nwith this anymore?\nEverybody gets a bit of that but it\u2019s\nnever to do with playing the music or\nsinging. Doing promotion and signing\ncan get quite repetitive and tedious.\nWhen\u2019s your new single \u2018Run\u2019 going to be released? Tell me about\nthis track for people who haven\u2019t\nheard of it yet.\nIt is going to be released on the 3rd\nMarch. \u2018Run\u2019 is a song that I wrote\ncompletely inspired by the band \u2018The\nKillers\u2019. I love \u2018The Killers\u2019. I went to see\nthem perform and I wanted to write a\nsong that I felt \u2018The Killers\u2019 could per-form, essentially.\nWhen does your tour start?\nMonday 4th February in Belfast.\nSo is it a national tour, or will you\nbe going abroad?\nFebruary, I\u2019ll be touring in U.K. and\nMarch, the rest of Europe.\nWhat do you see yourself doing in\n10 years time?\nIf I can be doing this in 10 years time,\nI\u2019d be ecstatic, but if not I\u2019d probably\ngo back to university and do something\nrelated to geography. I\u2019m happy with\nwhat I\u2019m doing at the moment, if that\ncontinues then its great but if not, we\u2019ll\nsee what happens.\nOl\u2019 Amy Macdonald lives on a farm, Ee-I-Ee-I-Oh! Oh, and in a city too apparently\nSusan Yu\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 29 February 2008 felix\nPolitics\nDry Wit & Tonic\nSamuel Black\nYou\u2019ve all heard about Mosquito\nAlarms. Probably not by that name, but\nthey are the alarms that emit a sound at\na frequency that young people can hear\nbut is inaudible to adults. The science\nis simple; your hearing range decreases\nas you age which means that children\ncan hear higher-pitched sounds than\nadults. The concept has been taken\nfurther, in a radical new piece of technology created by Dr James Watson\nIt\u2019s called the ScareBlack; it works\nlike a scarecrow but uses sound and\nscares not crows, but dark-skinned\npeople. In fact, the parent company has\na range of devices from ScareMuslim\nto ScareHobo. The ScareBlack emits\nan unbearable sound, which foreigners\ncan hear but that is completely inaudible to English folk. Any person within\nhearing range of the product is forced\nto move away from the sound. I went\nto the ScareBlack factory in Staffordshire to find out more about the product and I was shown the ScareBlack in\naction. First I was allowed to hear the\nScareBlack, obviously being the blue-blooded Englishman I am, I couldn\u2019t\nhear a thing.\nThen I rubbed some shoe polish on\nmy face. When the ScareBlack was\nturned on, the noise was extremely\nunpleasant and I had to move away.\nThe creator, Dr James Watson, told me\nabout the product\u2019s conception \u201cI was\non the train one day, and an Afro-Caribbean family got on and sat opposite\nme, effectively ruining my journey. It\nwas at this point that I promised myself\nI would find a way of keeping foreigners away from myself \u201d.\nThe science behind the ScareBlack\nis slightly different to that of the Mosquito alarm aimed at children. \u201cEach\ndemographic group of people have\ncertain frequencies of sound that they\ncan and can\u2019t listen to. This is why\nwomen don\u2019t listen to reason, it\u2019s at a\nfrequency they can\u2019t hear\u201d explained\nDr Watson, \u201cAll we do is set the product to the correct frequency and voila\u201d.\nThe British government is very interested in the possible applications of the\nalarm. With immigration continuing at\never-increasing numbers and an English population that feel like strangers\nin their own country, the ScareBlack\nprovides the perfect solution. Huge\nspeakers are being erected all along\nthe English coastline in order to deter\nimmigrants from entering the coun-try. A special ScareIllegal-Immigrant\nhas been developed for the government and has been deployed in major\ncities such as London, to tackle those\nwho slip through the net. A government spokesman commented \u201cFinally\nwe have an effective way to get those\nbloody foreigners out of the country\u201d.\nLocal councils and police forces are\nalso finding Dr Watson\u2019s invention incredibly useful. Homelessness in South\nKensington has been eradicated; the\nScareHobo has driven vagrants away.\nPolice forces across the country have\ncracked down on human rights protests by using the ScareHippie; the no\nprotest zone around Westminster has\nnever been so well-enforced. Some\npolice forces have started installing\nthe ScareBlack in some homes. If the\ntrials are successful, there are plans to\ninstall ScareBlacks in homes around\nthe country. Preliminary results show\na 70% reduction in burglaries. This is\nnot the only area of law enforcement\nthat will soon be using Dr Watson\u2019s in-vention. At airports and in other forms\nof transport, the ScareTerrorist will\nsoon be rolled out, promising to be the\nlast line of defence in our fight against\nterrorism\nDespite these obvious benefits, some\nhave voiced concerns about the new\ntechnology. The British Military would\nlike to see greater controls about who\ncan actually obtain the alarms. Certain areas of Afghanistan have become\nno go areas because the Taleban have\nmodified the ScareBlack into what\nappears to be a \u2018ScareWhite\u2019. Captain\nRick Wood of the 4th Battalion com-mented, \u201cWe can\u2019t actually enter the\ntown, they\u2019ve set up loudspeakers eve-rywhere, in homes, schools and hos-pitals. The only option is to bomb the\nloudspeakers regardless of civilian casualties\u201d. On a lighter note, Union President Stephen Brown has had some difficulty entering Beit Quad to get to the\noffices. It would appear that a student\nhas hidden a ScareScot somewhere in\nthe bushes.\nCertainly the ScareBlack is a revolutionary piece of technology, one\nthat promises to change our society\ntremendously. As it becomes more\nintegrated into our daily lives, will we\nnotice any difference? This reporter\nthinks so, however he also believes that\nat a conceptual level; the existence of\na device that restricts exclusively the\nright of assembly, of one demographic\ngroup within society, is abhorrent and\nentirely inconsistent with the tenets of\ndemocracy that this country is built\nupon.\nThe government has been ordered to\nrelease minutes from two meetings\nheld in the run-up to the Iraq War in\n2003. The order comes from Information Commissioner Richard Thomas\nafter a request under the Freedom of\nInformation Act was rejected by the\nCabinet Office. Mr. Thomas said that\nthe release of the minutes is in the public interest as they would give greater\n\u201ctransparency and public understanding of the relevant issues\u201d.\nThe Cabinet Office has 35 days from\nTuesday to appeal this decision and is\ncurrently \u201cconsidering\u201d its response. In\nhis request, Mr. Thomas added that it\nis \u201cparamount\u201d that people are held accountable for their actions. The person\nasking for the minutes said the Cabinet\nOffice\u2019s refusal created \u201ca public impression that something not entirely\ntruthful has been uttered\u201d. The Office\nhad refused to release the minutes as\nthey claim information related to the\nformulation of government policy is\nexempt from disclosure. However, in\nthis case the public interest in having\nthe minutes released outweighs the interest in withholding this information;\nMr. Thomas made a point of explaining\nthat this disclosure does not \u201cnecessarily\u201d set a precedent for future Freedom\nof Information requests concerning\ncabinet minutes. The Commissioner\nagreed to allow the redaction \u2013 blacking out \u2013 of various parts of the documents to prevent damage to Britain\u2019s\ninternational relations.\nFollowing the leaked legal advice to\nformer Prime Minister Tony Blair from\nLord Goldsmith raising concerns over\nthe legality of the war, these minutes\nare needed in the public domain. The\nUnited Nations regards the Iraq War as\n\u201cillegal\u201d without the second resolution\nand the Attorney General\u2019s concerns\nwere not presented to parliament.\nSerious questions have already been\nasked over whether Britain was lied to\nby Tony Blair on the issue of weapons\nof mass destruction and it appears that\nwe as a nation were intentionally mis-led. The invasion of Iraq followed the\nbiggest political protest this country\nMiscreant deterrent falls into the wrong hands\nIraq War minutes to be released\nhas ever seen with over 1 million people marching in London in opposition\nto the war.\nThe government as yet has not decided the course of action to take; a\nspokesman said that \u201cthe requirements\nof openness and transparency must\nbe balanced against the proper and\neffective functioning of government\u201d.\n\u201cAt the very heart of that system is the\nconstitutional convention of collective cabinet responsibility,\u201d he added.\nThe way to ensure that those responsible for the war in Iraq are culpable is\nto release the minutes into the public\ndomain, albeit a censored version. The\nway the government handled the Iraq\nWar, throughout all stages of planning\nup till today has been secretive and\nmisleading.\nLiberal Democrat foreign affairs\nspokesman Edward Davey said: \u201cLabour\u2019s wall of secrecy over the Iraq war\nis gradually being dismantled brick by\nbrick. The case for an independent\ninquiry into the decision to go to war\nis only strengthened by these continuing efforts to delay and obstruct those\nseeking the truth.\u201d\nJames Goldsack\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n34 Friday 29 February 2008\nfelix\nSport\nIC Women\u2019s football finished 2nd in\ntheir BUSA league, giving them the\nhonour of participating in the BUSA\nplate, an opportunity which had not\nhappened for a long time despite several victories in the ULU cup! They\ntherefore set out on a 2h30 bus ride\nfrom London to the obscure town of\nCheltenham to play against Gloucestershire University. A full team of eleven players showed up despite the cold,\nincluding warrior Steph, straight from\nFranck Morton, sleep deprived and\nprobably still drunk!\nThis game was rough on every level\nand the tension was palpable through-out. The Gloucestershire \u201cladies\u201d were\nmuch bigger than the IC side, and not\nhaving a brain to worry about, they did\nnot hesitate to head the ball aggres-sively. Despite this, the game started\nwell for the IC ladies, with a goal from\nPav. The ball arrived at the back of\nthe net from a very narrow crazy an-gle. She later confessed that she had\ncarefully calculated the angle of travel\nand ball velocity before shooting. IC\u2019s\nhopes were short lived however, when\nGloucestershire scored from a throw-in (really an IC one!) and left a few\nstuds into Emma\u2019s leg. In front of this\nnew threat and Emma\u2019s pain, Pav, Lily\nand Rita rushed forward. In a slightly\nconfusing way, Lily was dispossessed\nof the ball which was recuperated by\nRita. She passed it immediately to Pav\nwho deflected it to provide IC with\ntheir second goal.\nQuite a few other opportunities came\nabout, namely a goal from Rita called\noffside and shots by Chloe saved by\nthe keeper. Rita interrupted this trend\nby scoring the third IC goal of the day!\nSurrounded by Gloucestershire play-ers, she managed to free herself, like\nNemo\u2019s dad from the jellyfish.The end\nof this first half came soon after this\ncrushing IC domination, but left time\nfor a few fights, namely one including\nLaura. She was fouled by a Gloucestershire player and both of them fell, although blame was immediately placed\non Laura. This injustice was severely\nfelt by Laura who exchanged a few\nharsh words with the opposition, almost coming to hands.\nSecond half was quite violent, and\nsensitive readers should abstain from\nreading the rest of this article.\nGloucestershire called handballs on\na regular basis, even when the ball only\ntouched part of the chest or boobs.\nBeing a reasonable man, the ref did\nnot call these and got abused by the\nGloucestershire side\u2019s foul language.\nTheir second goal came from the side.\nThe defence was overwhelmed and\nwere not able to stop it. Cheryl tried\nto complain but was impeded from\ninsulting the ref and the opposition\nplayers by Yoke\u2019s authoritative finger\nshake! To ensure victory, Pav scored a\nhat trick by lobbing the keeper. In re-sponse, Gloucestershire picked up pace\nand scored a third goal 20min from the\nend, bringing the score to 4-3 in favour\nof the IC ladies. With mounting pres-sure, aggressivity accumulated, with\nmany b**** fights exploding all over the\nfield. At the same time, Emily\u2019s goal\nwas bombarded with corners. One of\nthem resulted in Kate being deliberLadies\u2019 BUSA Plate success\nately kicked by Gloucestershire player\nnumber 2 who could not handle losing\nthe ball. She was only booked by the\nref, despite deserving a red.\nAnother corner saw that same\nnumber 2 kicking the ball (and people\nin the way) meters from the goal. Pav\nthrew herself in front of her despite\nthe kicks. In this confusion, Emily\ncame to the rescue and threw herself\nonto Pav to grab the ball out of number\n2\u2019s feet. Pav was briefly crushed and\nlost her contact in the battle. She heroically continued however. Steph had\nyet another clash with the opposition\nby suggesting their player get off the\npitch after receiving a ball in the face.\nGloucestershire did not appreciate\nand harsh words were once more exchanged on both sides, with several IC\nladies having to almost restrain Steph\nfrom taking it further.\nFinally the whistle blew, giving the\nIC ladies the satisfaction of not having\ntravelled to the middle of nowhere for\nnothing. They are now on their way to\nwin the Plate!\nChloe Joyeux\nAnother chilly afternoon at the Fortress saw IC fighting for a place in the\nULU cup final. Having been granted\na walkover from UCL just a week before with a subsequent 4-0 loss in the\nfriendly we played against them, we\nweren\u2019t sure what to expect from the\nmatch.\nA nervous start from both teams saw\nslip-ups and missed opportunities at\nboth ends. Fifteen minutes in and UCL\nbroke the deadlock with a very dubious\ngoal that bobbled under Plug. Despite\ndisagreements between the two umpires and a quick free-hit by Date Rape\nout to Paedo, the goal was awarded.\nMoments later and UCL were back\nat it, lining up in front of goal from a\nfew yards out. Shipman was helpless at\nthe back and Plug had another slotted\nbetween his legs (the most action that\narea has seen in a while).\nTen minutes until halftime and the\npressure was on for IC to pull one back.\nA sublime play through the middle out\nof defence from Diana and Krusty saw\nSid competing for a 50:50 ball up in\nUCL\u2019s half. Some may say it was luck\nbut we all recognized the pure skill that\nSid exhibited against his defender and\nthe next thing UCL knew the ball was\nbouncing across at shoulder height\nin front of the goal. Queue 2\u2019s call-up\nGinger Spice, not intimidated by the\nmonumental crowd of the Men\u2019s 2s\nand Ladies 1s, he casually baseball bats\nit into the top right. Epic.\nIC began the second half strongly\nwith solid defence from Mountie,\nShipman, Date Rape and Foetus. UCL\nwas rarely in our half and all the attacking coming from IC; the pressure was\non our opponents. Some great work\nup the right side of the pitch by Paedo\nJonathan Tunnicliffe\nIC men\u2019s hockey\nin ULU Cup final\nand Foetus led to balls flying across the\ngoal but to no avail.\nTen minutes before full-time and IC\nwere becoming ever more frustrated\nwith not being able to convert. Out of\nnowhere,aquicksidelineballbyMoun-tie and Skull F*ck saw the ball aerialled\nup the left side of the pitch to Diana.\nTurning into acres of space, Diana guns\nfor the D with visions of breaking net-ting. It wasn\u2019t to be but again Ginger\nSpice\u2019s magic saw UCL picking the ball\nout the back of the goal.\nDespite continuous pressure from\nIC, the final whistle blew. With the\nscores tied, extra-time was in order.\nMore pressure from IC throughout ex-tra-time went unrewarded as the game\nheaded to penalty flicks.\nFirst up was Foetus. Oh Foetus. The\nUCL keeper read him like the Qur\u2019an\nand an unlucky near save from Plug\nput UCL ahead with a score 1-0. With\nPaedo up next there was never any\ndoubt of a goal and a stellar save from\nPlug brought it back to 1-1. A sublime\nflick from Skull F*ck and a Krusty special (middle and right, standard) led to\na 3-2 lead. Another superb save from\nPlug making it 3 out of 5 saves gave IC\nthe win to set up a face-off against the\nmedics in the final.\nThe Medicals went into their last\nBUSA league fixture of 2007-08 knowing that nothing less than a victory\nwas required if they were to remain in\nBUSA South Prem B.\nEven then the Medicals were relying\non other results to go their way needing one of Reading or UWE to lose.\nAfter last week\u2019s disappointment away\nat Reading, Cameron Sullivan aksed\nprimarily the same squad of players to\ntry and make amends against the Greyhounds with the only changes seeing\nthe hard working Anakan Navaratnam\ncome into the back row and Harry\nThompson come in at scrum-half for\nthe injured Tom Maynard. The Greyhounds arrived at Teddington with\nslightly fewer Blues peppering their\nsquad than when the sides met at Iffley\nRoad just after Christmas. However,\nthere was still plenty of experience in a\nteam lead by this year\u2019s starting Varsity\nmatch hooker, Dan Rosen.\nThe Medicals, not wanting to let an\nOxford side with little to play for into\nthe game, started the game brightly.\nWith the two packs evenly matched\nit was left to the host\u2019s backs to make\ntheir mark on the game with fly-half,\nand skipper for the day, Dan Neville\npulling the strings in midfield and the\nback three Rory Hutchinson, Huw Williams and Kevin Ilo looking dangerous\nwhen put in space. In fact right wing\nIlo was to open the Medicals\u2019 account\nfor the afternoon.\nQuick hands by centres Ben Davies and James Sharples put the flying\nwing up against his opposite man. Ilo\nwas able to beat the cover tacklers with\npace and guile to dive in under the\nposts. Neville made no mistake with\nthe conversion.\nPlaying some fine rugby the Medicals made the most of their dominant\nstart by scoring a further try. This\ntime the creative spark was provided\nby left wing Rory Hutchinson. Receiving the ball in his own half the fresh\nfaced speedster made good yards taking play up to the Oxford twenty-two.\nAfter being brought down Hutchinson\nstayed alert and was able to spot Harry\nThompson in support. Thompson using his years of experience on the wing\ncrashed his way over in the left corner.\nNeville was unable to add the extras.\nThe Hounds then clawed there\nway back into the match with a well\ntaken drop goal from fly-half Stuart\nO\u2019Flanagan who also added a penalty\nbefore half-time to reduce the Medicals\u2019 lead to only six points. At half\ntime those playing their last BUSA\ngame implored their team mates to\nkeep going for the final forty minutes.\nThe senior players words were taken\nto heart as the Medicals opened the\nsecond period reinvigorated and once\nmore on the front foot, which allowed\nthe hosts to score their best try of the\nafternoon. Xander Ancock exploited\na gap in the Greyhound\u2019s midfield\nto break through and offload to the\nsupporting James Sharples. Quick interplay between the Medicals backs\nput Dan Neville in possession who,\nshowing good vision, released the on\nrushing Kevin Ilo. Ilo held on to the\ndifficult ball and used his pace to run\nin for his second try of the afternoon.\nNeville failed with the difficult conversion attempt.\nThe Medicals were to extend their\nlead even further as all the back three\ngot themselves on the scoresheet. Fullback Huw Williams showed that despite now being one of the team\u2019s elder\nstatesmen he still had the ability and\npace to go in for his first try of the sea-son. Neville was able to add the extras.\nAs the game drew on the Medicals were\nhaving to defend while the Hounds began to gain the upper hand. The host\u2019s\ncause was not halped as Ed pickles and\nCraig Nightingale were forced off with\nminor injuries, however, replacements\nJon Fisher-Black and Jeremy BartosiakJentys more than held their own.\nThe Hounds once again started to\nplay the better rugby and replied with\ntwo trys of their own from flanker Sean\nMackenzie and centre Chris Record,\nO\u2019Flanagan converting one. With five\nminutes remaining the visitors were\nnow within a try and conversion of\npinching a victory, but the Medicals\ndefended their line well and as the final whistle blew all attention turned\nto trying to find out the Reading and\nUWE scores.\nWhen the news came through, via\nclub captain Ruairidh Crawford\u2019s\nbrother and the French Alps, that\nReading had been defeated by Oxford\nBrookes the Medicals knew they had\nmanaged to complete a, rather more\ntense and convoluted, Great Escape\nthan first hoped.\nMany thanks to Xander Ancock,\nJames Saffin, Harry Thompson and\nHuw Williams who played their last\nBUSA games for the club on Wednesday. Also, congratulations to Cameron\nfor keeping his side up and for his commitment this year despite the dissap-pointment of being unable to play due\nto injury.

Entanglement is a type of non-local correlation, or \u2018spooky action at\na distance\u2019, that occurs solely in the\nquantum arena. The aim of her work\nwas to demonstrate that entanglement\nexists between localised regions of\nspace, in the form of correlations in the\nnumbers of bosons (a type of particle)\nin those regions, and to investigate the\nconditions under which this entanglement exists.\nThis work is particularly interesting\nas entanglement is usually thought to\nexist between particles themselves or\ntheir internal degrees of freedom, but\nnot between regions of space occupied\nby bosons. Her work has applications\nin the exciting technologies of quantum computing, as measurements\non q-bits \u2013 the quantum analogue of\na bit in a normal computer \u2013 can be\nused to drive computations. Quantum techniques are thought to be the\nway forward in computing, as quantum computers should be able to solve\nproblems much faster than current\ntechnologies.\nLibby has also made significant efforts to inspire others into the field\nof physics. She has participated in\nthe teaching of undergraduates at the\nUniversity of Leeds, which includes\ncomputing and maths classes. She was\nawarded the Ogden Teaching Fellowship for Physics in recognition of her\nwork organising physics projects for\nstudents in local schools, giving talks\non quantum mechanics and and explaining to them what a life as a theoretical physicist involves.\nDr Gillian Butcher, Chair of the IOP\nWomen in Physics Group, said, \u201cIt is\nlovely to be able to reward Libby and\nhopefully give her the confidence to\ncontinue doing such wonderful work\nin both physics and outreach activities.\u201d Libby received her award of \u00a31000\nfrom Dame Mary Richardson, CEO of\nthe HSBC Education Trust.\nAs well as the award ceremony there\nwere careers talks from women physicists from a variety of careers, which\nwere both interesting and inspiring,\nand which showed the breadth of jobs\navailable in physics.\nHelen Heath from the University of\nBristol described her life working at\nCERN. She took part in one of the first\nexperiments to use solid-state silicon\ndetectors to look for charmed parti-cles. Later she worked on the design of\na calorimeter used in the ZEUS project,\nwhich investigated the structure of\nproton using electrons. Her current\nproject involves working on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN, in the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). The main goals of the\nexperiment are to discover the Higgs\nboson, to look for evidence of physics\nbeyond the standard model, such as\nsupersymmetry or extra dimensions,\nand to study aspects of heavy ion colli-sions. She is also involved with various\noutreach projects such as working with\nYear 10 girls, encouraging them into\nphysics. She also works with a project\nthat brings teachers to CERN and was\nawarded a Faculty Teaching and Learning Award.\nRebecca Barnes studied Physics\nwith Astrophysics at the University of\nLeicester and is now working in science\ncommunications at the National Space\nCentre. She had worked on setting up\nand running school programmes, such\nas the Challenger Learning Centre and\nE-Mission. The Challenger Learning Centres were set up in memory\nof Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who\ndied when the shuttle Challenger blew\nup after launch. The centre at the NSC\nis the only one outside of North America and school-children role-play a two\nhour mission involving science experi-ments, data analysis, communications\nand team working. The E-Mission\ninvolves students as an emergency response team, evacuating the island of\nMontserrat from the double threat of a\nLibby Heaney may only be in the very early stages of her career in physics, but she has already made a mark\nboth in her research and in outreach. Her prize? \u00a31000 and a significant accolade \u2013 inspiring stuff, no?\nvolcano eruption and a hurricane. Rebecca also works on outreach projects\nsuch as the Stardome, a mobile inflatable planetarium, which is taken to\nschools.\nProfessor Averill MacDonald started off teaching physics in secondary\nschools for 12 years, and then studied\npart time for an MA, followed by a\nPhD. She is currently a part-time lecturer in the Physics department at the\nUniversity of Reading. She has co-au-thored 18 school textbooks, produced\na wide range of free teaching resources\nfor schools and has pioneered science outreach through a wide range of\nprojects including the well-known \u2018Science with Coffee and Hobnobs\u2019. She has\nalso written the Guide to Science Outreach for Universities. In 1999 she was\nawarded the Bragg Medal and Prize by\nthe Institute of Physics, London for her\ncontribution to physics education and\nthe Royal Society recognised her work\nwith a Millennium Award.\nJoanna Lee, from the National Physical Laboratory, was one of the runners\nup in the competition. She gave a talk\non her work as a higher research scientist in the Nanoanalysis group. Joanna\u2019s\nresearch is focused on the fundamental issues in the quantitative analysis\nof micro- and nano- structures using\nTime-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass\nSpectrometry (ToF-SIMS). SIMS is a\npowerful technique for the analysis of\ncomplex molecules on surfaces, with\napplications in many innovative technologies such as drug delivery systems,\nbiomolecular engineering for diagnos-tics, and personal care products, such\nas hair conditioner. SIMS works by firing atoms onto the surface to be studied\nand then collecting the particles which\ncome off the surface and sorting them\nby mass. The resulting mass spectrum\nthen gives an indication of the composition and hence the structure of the\nsurface. She has worked on improving\nSIMS by investigating the use of C60\ncarbon molecules or \u201cbuckyballs\u201d instead of atoms in the original beam,\nas well as the application of SIMS to\nnon-flat samples. Joanna\u2019s other research involves simulation, modelling,\nanalytical approaches and experimentation to extend the measurement capabilities of SIMS and pave the way for\nits use in emerging technologies.\nEntering the Award\nThe 2008 Very Early Career Woman\nPhysicist of the Year Award, sponsored\nby HSBC, is judged by IOP\u2019s Women in\nPhysics Group. The award is in its second year and it was introduced to highlight the great work being undertaken\nby young female physics researchers\nall across the UK. Applications were\ninvited from women at the start of\ntheir careers in physics who have made\na contribution to the subject and also\nhave undertaken activities to support\nor encourage others in the field.\nThe prize is awarded annually to a\nwoman who is within three years of\ncompleting her undergraduate degree\nin physics and who is either working as\na physicist or is engaged in postgraduate study. To satisfy the award\u2019s entry\ncriteria, the woman must have made a\nsignificant contribution to the project\nshe is working on, undertaken activities to encourage others into physics,\nnamed referees and provided a CV.\nThe closing date for next year\u2019s\naward will be around the end of October, and further information should be\nobtained from the IOP.\nThe Institute of Physics (IOP) is a\nscientific membership organisation\ndevoted to increasing the understanding and application of physics. The IOP\nWomen in Physics Group is a group\nestablished to encourage women to\nparticipate in physics. It provides a\nforum for initiatives to advance issues\nof particular relevance to women and\nsupport to female members by encouraging professional development in in-dustry, commerce, academia, teaching\nand research.\nEx-Imperial student wins IOP award for women\n\n"

How\nfar away is it all? What do I focus on?\nDo I sacrifice image quality and depth\nof field (how much is in focus) for a\nshorter exposure time, so the guy quivering behind the camera doesn\u2019t churn\nout shaky shots, one after another?\nThe compact camera decides all that\nand more by itself. And so will a DSLR,\nif you put it in Auto mode. But as soon\nas you start to explore the semi-auto-matic and manual settings, you\u2019ll find\nout that your expensive black paperweight will do wonderful things. This\ncreative control is what makes the difference between a snap and a photo in\nFelix that makes people go \u2018wow\u2019.\nRight\u2026 I get it. So what does SLR\nmean? Geekery can be skipped. SLR\nstands for Single Lens Reflex. It means\nthat when you look through the view-finder, you\u2019re actually looking through\nthe lens. What you see is what you get.\nThe screen doesn\u2019t show anything until you\u2019ve taken a photo, but that\u2019s OK\nbecause the viewfinder gives you more\ndetail than a preview screen anyway.\nAll SLRs have interchangeable lenses.\nI\u2019ve decided! What now? Mention\nDSLR to a Currys salesman. Go on,\ntry it: a loud bell will ring, and lots of\nballoons with \u201cCanon\u201d and \u201cNikon\u201d\nprinted on them will float down from\nthe ceiling.\nCanon and Nikon have produced\nbrilliant cameras since time began,\nand have the lion\u2019s share of the consumer DSLR market. Pentax, Sony,\nand Olympus make consumer DSLRs\ntoo. All have their strengths and weak-nesses, but nowadays, they\u2019re all good.\nIn fact, the top five manufacturers\u2019\nnewest consumer DSLRs are so good,\nit doesn\u2019t matter which one you buy:\nyou\u2019ll still take great photos. But you\nmustn\u2019t choose indiscriminately; they\neach have a character of their own, and\nthere\u2019ll be one that feels right at home\nlying dreamily against your chest. Go\nto an independent camera shop, such\nas Spectrum (see below). They\u2019ll let you\nhave a grope of every camera you can\nbuy, talk about what you\u2019d like them to\ndo, and even take them onto the pavement to have a go with each one.\nThere are other categories of DSLR\non the market: \u2018prosumer\u2019 and profes-sional. As you\u2019re a student, I\u2019ll assume\nthat, like me, you can\u2019t afford a \u2018prosumer\u2019 DSLR. Remember about the\nlens: with a cheap lens, you\u2019ll get pictures just as good from putting it on a\nconsumer DSLR body as a professional\nbody. Save your pennies and buy lenses\nthat will run the bath \u2013 your photos\nwill thank you.\nTo give you an idea of what there is,\nhere\u2019s a rundown of each of the consumer DSLRs on the market.\nCanon 400D: 10 megapixels. My\nopinion: Extremely popular, reliable\ncamera. The selection of lenses is un-rivalled. However, it feels plasticky and\nugly to me.\nNikon D40, D40x: 6, 10 megapixels respectively. My opinion: Popular\ncameras, very comfy and extremely\nlight. Unfortunately, lens compatibility\n(even with Nikon lenses) is mediocre.\nTry the more expensive but brilliant\nD80 (or older D70 or D50) for full\ncompatibility.\nPentax K100D Super: 6 megapixels,\nShake Reduction. My opinion: Build\nquality is amazing \u2013 can be dropped\noff buildings. Shake Reduction is a life-saver, all the time. New Pentax lenses\naren\u2019t ubiquitous like Canon or Nikon\nlenses, but there are literally thousands\nof old, cheap Pentax lenses that fit and\ngive picture quality rivalling the most\nexpensive new ones.\nSony \u03b1 200: 10 megapixels, Shake\nReduction. My opinion: An average\nDSLR \u2013 it\u2019ll take good pictures, but it\u2019s\nnot hugely popular. Shake reduction\n(\u201cSteadyShot\u201d) is a good thing.\nOlympus e-410: 10 megapixels, Live\nView. My opinion: A good performer\nwith a slightly strange grip. It\u2019s lightweight and comfortable, nonetheless,\nand well worth considering.\nLenses. This may be a bit of a bomb-shell. You\u2019ll go and splash out on a\nbeautiful camera, take it home, and\nwonder why it\u2019s got a big hole in the\nfront. I\u2019m afraid lenses come separate-ly. This makes sense: why should they\nsupply the same lens with each camera\nif everyone\u2019s going to take pictures of\ndifferent things?\nFortunately, if you ask nicely, you\u2019ll\nbe sold a basic all-purpose lens, called\na kit lens, with the camera. Typically\nthis is an 18-55mm zoom lens. That\nmeans that it goes from wide-angle to\na little bit telephoto (zoomed in), and\nyou get the same sort of zoom range\nas on a typical compact camera. Here\u2019s\nthe good news: While all lenses cost\nquite a bit of money on their own, a kit\nlens might only add \u00a330 to the price of\nthe camera. Accept the kit lens, use the\ncamera, and after a few months, you\u2019ll\nknow what kind of lens would be best\nfor you next. It\u2019s a personal choice!\nThis is how lenses differ. A lens is\nknown by its focal length. 50mm, 18-55mm, 70-200mm. This simply means\nhow close it gets to something far away.\n200 or 300mm is good for perving (or\nnature photography), 35mm is about\nthe field of view of the human eye, and\n15mm is really wide-angle and good for\nlandscapes or fat people. Clearly, a lens\ncalled \u201918-55mm\u2019 will zoom between\n18mm and 55mm, when you turn the\nzoom ring. A lens called \u201850mm\u2019 won\u2019t\nzoom, and is thus called a \u2018prime lens\u2019.\nPrime lenses are compact and tend to\ntake beautiful, sharp pictures, but don\u2019t\nhave much flexibility. You\u2019ll just have to\nrun forwards and backwards instead.\nThe other vital statistic for lenses is\nthe maximum aperture size. Aperture\nsize is represented by an \u2018F-number\u2019.\nIn practice: a low F-number means the\ncamera can open the aperture really\nwide and let lots of light in for non-shaky photos in low light (a \u2018fast lens\u2019).\nA higher F-number means it can\u2019t let\nas much light in. Kit lenses are not fast;\nfast lenses are expensive but worth it.\nTo give you some context: most kit\nlenses will open up to about f/4, a really slow lens is f/6.3, and a really fast\nlens is f/1.7.\nThere are various special lenses\navailable, at a premium. Fisheye lenses\nare good for taking weird curvy pictures of buildings, or for giving people\nHUGE noses. Macro lenses will focus\non things really close, so you can see\ndeep into a fly\u2019s soul.\nOf course, there\u2019s quality. The difference between two seemingly identical\nlenses costing \u00a380 and \u00a32,000 will be in\nthe image quality, and the build quality too. The more expensive one will\ngive you pictures with impact, beautiful contrast and colours, and no weird\ndistortions or strange effects. It\u2019ll also\nbe made nearly entirely of metal, with\nweather seals and lovely gooey zoom\nand focus rings, and will be sex to hold.\nThe \u00a380 one will still do anyone\u2019s photography justice, though. Kit lenses fall\ninto the category of most basic, get-you-from-A-to-B lenses \u2013 apart from\nthe Pentax 18-55mm kit lens, which is\noutstanding next to the other manufacturers\u2019 kit lenses.\nCanon 400D: The most popular beginner DSLR there is\nPrice. Assuming I\u2019ve sold it to you,\nyou\u2019re itching to know if you can afford\nthis garden of delights. SLR photography is much cheaper than it used to be,\nbut it\u2019ll still cost you a month\u2019s rent to\nget started. If you go to the right plac-es, you can get a comprehensive starter\nkit \u2013 camera, kit lens, memory card,\nbag, even a basic tripod, for \u00a3400 to\n\u00a3450. For an idea, browse Warehouse\nExpress (URL below). But don\u2019t splash\nout before you\u2019ve had a feel, and support the independent shops.\nFinally. Once you\u2019re into DSLR pho-tography, there\u2019s no way out. It\u2019s fantastic fun and a great way to get noticed and published. The possibilities\nreally are endless. To give yourself an\nidea of what can be done, visit Talk\nPhotography forum \u2013 my username is\n\u2018silverJON\u2019. Happy snapping!\nGeneric lens photo used to fill white space number 2\n\n"

Of course,\nthis isn\u2019t unfamiliar \u2013 Marc Jacobs\u2019s\ncontroversial collection last September reminded us of its potential, and\nPrada even seems to have picked up\ncues from Balenciaga in the form of\ntowering gladiator sandals \u2013 but this is\nnot a woman with anything to prove.\nReinterpretation and shaping new ideas from existing ones is integral to the\ncapricious and oft-convoluted world of\nfashion, and though the influences are\nevident, the grande dame\u2019s vision is all\nher own.\nAlberta Ferretti\nClean, feminine, and sensuous. In a\nweek traditionally associated with the\nnotion that more is more, Alberta Ferretti has always been a welcome respite\nto the maelstrom around. Think of her\nshow as a detox, an holistic cleanser of\npalate and retina. A glacier-blue knee-length dress wrapped and tucked to\nperfection and a cascading black tiered,\npleated number with sequin shoulders\nstood out in an otherwise unembel-lished and pure collection relatively\ndevoid of frills, pretension, or whimsy.\nThe palette of deep, intriguingly opulent jewel tones and restrained purples\nand greens was ideal for the minimalist feel of the collection, though subtle\ndramas played out in dramatic use of\nvolume and proportion, not to mention daring experiments like a remarkable hot-pink egg-shaped satin coat\nwith a twisted collar in which the wearer\u2019s forearms and wrists plunge into\nwide pockets cut perpendicularly to its\n\u201csleeves\u201d. But that would be missing the\npoint of the collection entirely.With\nthe sun soaring above on a freshly cool\nday outside and the shadows inclining\nbenevolently in the background, it was\na collection perfect for its time and\nplace.\n(Left to right) Marni, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry Prorsum\n(Left to right) Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Alberta Ferretti\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 29 February 2008 felix\nComment\nN\not unexpectedly Matt\nthe Hat, chief critic of\nFairtrade at Imperial,\nresponded to my previous letter with another\ncompilation of well known false criticisms of Fairtrade. It\u2019s Fairtrade Fortnight right now and I am rather busy\norganizing events like our Wine Tasting next Wednesday (see www.impe-rialfairtrade.org.uk for details). That\u2019s\nwhy instead of a nice coherent text I\nreply in bullet points.\n\u2013 Let\u2019s start with a review of where\nour little discussion is right now. Matt\ndoesn\u2019t like Fairtrade and thinks free\ntrade is a better solution. I say Fairtrade does not interfere with free trade\nwhatsoever. Instead it facilitates it as a\nway to fight poverty.\n\u2013 Matt thinks I am right \u2013 but only\nfrom a consumer perspective. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t work for the rest of the\nvalue chain. Matt claims that every\ncoffee producer should have to sell\ntheir coffee for a \u201cmarket price\u201d set by\ntraders depending on the momentary\nsupply and demand. Luckily, no one is\nforced to sell their coffee through one\nof the big coffee exchanges where this\nhappens. Instead we have free trade\nwhere anyone can sell to anyone for\nany price they agree on. Starbucks, to\nname one example, buys most of their\ncoffee through long-lasting contracts,\nat twice commodity price! According\nto Matt this violates the rules of the\nfree market.\n\u2013 Matt claims Fairtrade works as a\ndonation on top of the actual price.\nWrong about Fairtrade\nYou might say this. But then you would\nconsider buying a bottle of Bonaqua\na donation to CocaCola because the\nmarket price of drinking water is set by\nthe free drinking water tap in the toilet.\nMatt is grossly wrong here. What he\nthinks is a donation is in fact a manifestation of the free market: The price\nis set by what the consumer pays.\n\u2013 One more bullet point on the free\nmarket thing. Given that you refer\nto an article published by the Adam\nSmith Institute and explain to the Felix\nreadership how a free market works, I\nassume you are familiar with the conditions required by neo \u2013 and classical-liberal theories: Perfect market information and perfect access to markets\nand credit. They are non-existant for\nmost producers in developing coun-tries. And here\u2019s some homework for\nMatt: Have a think why that might be.\n\u2013 Let\u2019s move on to Matt\u2019s primary\nworry: He thinks that the more people\nbuy Fairtrade, the more non-Fairtrade\nfarmers lose business. But the overall\ndemand doesn\u2019t decline because of\nFairtrade! Because Fairtrade is part of\nthe free market the demand for Fairtrade products will governs the rate\nof their production. That\u2019s why you do\nnot put one non-Fairtrade farmer out\nof business when you buy Fairtrade.\nInstead you give one more farmer the\nchance to sell his coffee to Fairtrade\nconditions.\n\u2013 More as a side note I would like\nto point Matt to the Wikipedia entry\non the \u201cFair Trade Debate\u201d which references a study showing that within\na community of Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade producers everyone benefits\n(due to the improved infrastructure,\ncredit facilities, etc.).\n\u2013 One criticism that Matt raises in\nhis last paragraph is that Fairtrade encourages farmers to produce a product\nfor which on the world market there is\nno demand. What he doesn\u2019t know is:\nThanks to the fair pay that Fairtrade\nproducers receive many of them have\nthe chance to diversify their production away from non-competitive crops\ntowards higher valued ones. Without\nFairtrade they would often not have\nthe capital to achieve this. Matt says\nthat he \u201cwould generally applaud\u201d\nsuch a move. I suggest he goes to the\nFairtrade Foundations offices and ap-plauds. That would certainly be better\nthan condemning an idea because he\ndoes not understand it.\n\u2013 Matt points out that he has a better solution to the problem of poverty.\nHe proposes to open the markets world\nwide. Currently, both the EU and the\nUS governments subsidize their own\nfarmers to compete with those in Africa. At the same time they force African\ncountries to not pay subsidies to their\nfarmers. I can see two ways to stop this\ninjustice. You can of course write a letter to your MP hoping that this will\nhave an effect on a political strategy\nwhich is in place to protect the British\neconomy from competition. Or you\nwalk down to your local supermarket\nand buy a range of products that facilitate the free market by giving disadvantaged people access to the world\nmarket. The first method is waiting for\nothers to act, the second one is acting.\nFairtrade opens up the free market for\npeople who otherwise would not be\nable to participate! It helps them help\nthemselves.\nI hope my hastily compiled selection\nof bullet points is sufficient to explain\nwhy Matt is wrong in his critique of\nFairtrade. To end with I would like to\ninvite Matt to a debate organized by\nthe Imperial Model United Nations\nSociety. Next Monday you will be able\nto hear a talk by Charles Abugre, Head\nof Policy of Christian Aid (who incidentally campaign for trade justice and\nFairtrade) and join a debate discussing\nwhether it should be defined a human\nright to receive a fair price that facilitates social development for your work.\nThe debate will follow the rules of UN\ncouncils so lengthy contributions like\nthis one will be forbidden.\nJonas Neubert\nFairtrade: gotta catch \u2018em all\n\u201c\nI hope my\nhastily compiled\nselection of\nbullet points\nis sufficient to\nexplain why\nMatt is wrong\nin his critique of\nFairtrade\n\u201d\n\n"

That must surely be from\nall the running around London\nyou\u2019ve been doing: following our advice here at the Arts Desk and exploring the galleries, museums and sights\nof the City. No? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t ask,\nthen\u2026\nI recently discovered the National\nTheatre thanks to my grandma. I love\nmy grandma. She is a bit eccentric,\nFrench, and she likes talking about\nhomosexuality and breasts. Well, she\nfrequents the place when she can, and\nwe decided to be spontaneous and see\na play there. Why the hell not? It was a\nfantabulous evening.\nAlistair McGowan was in the ticket\nqueue ahead of us and sat in front of\nus in the stalls. For all you Alistair\nMcGowan fans out there, Alistair has\na deep, short laugh, a good taste in\nscarves and likes jokes about opti-cians. Anyway, enough about that \u2013\nthe NT is a fantastic intuition. Arrive\nat 6, sit in the huge foyer and listen to\na jazz trio. Then at half past, waltz to\nthe canteen and have a very reasonable meal for not a lot of money.\nYummy in my Belly. At quarter to 7,\nthe student standby tickets go on sale.\nWhat a treat! \u00a310 for fantastic stalls\ntickets.\nIt was all terribly exciting \u2013 a play\nwithout dialogue, 27 cast members\nand 450 characters. The set was\nan empty, plain, grey town square.\nSuddenly, someone walked across\nthe stage in a hurry. Then another.\nAnd another one. Some characters\nstuck around for a while, but most\nwere headed for the other side of the\nstage, by one method of transportation or another. This continued for 90\nminutes.\nI absolutely loved it. It was funny,\nimaginative and lively. The variety of\ncharacters was phenomenal and the\ncostumes were equally brilliant, and\neven more astonishing was the speed\nat which the costume changes had to\ntake place! \u2018The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other\u2019 is on for a while yet\nso I really recommend it to you.\nMeanwhile, we have a feast lined\nup for you in this week\u2019s edition. Mr\nTom Roberts, Editor-in-Chief of Felix\nwas a very naughty boy last week. \u201cHe\ntook out two of my bastard articles,\u201d\nclaimed a distraught Arts Editor,\nEmily Wilson. Tut tut. Don\u2019t worry,\nwe\u2019ve put one of them back for you.\nWe have snuck in a very subtle\nMTsoc Tour plug under the guise of\na Musical Theatre Weekly. Apparently this tour is jolly good fun. I have\nheard stories of tent sex, river dunking and lemon-meringue ice cream.\nSounds like my cup of tea.\nI continue my quest for new writers.\nAll these fantastic shows we have\nreviewed have been courtesy of Felix\nArts, or rather us badgering Press\nOffices to give us tickets. If you want\nto have a go, please get in touch at\nthe usual address. If you fail to do so,\nI shall set those sailors on you. Ooo\nmatron!\nA\ns the lights dim, and the\naudience begins to buzz\nwith anticipation, I can\u2019t\nhelp but feel a little excited too. This is my first\nvisit to a circus show. I sit amazed as\nI watch little Asian boys (though I\u2019m\nconvinced they\u2019re midgets!) do back-flips, front-flips and cartwheels. Contortionists are climbing poles and\nholding their bodies in weird and wonderful positions. In the corner an obscured shape seems to be belting out\na song.\nWelcome to the enchanted world of\nVarekai! Fluorescent colours are a given and lycra-clad individuals performing extraordinary feats of athleticism is\nthe norm.\nAt one point, we had 10 men on stage,\nall decked out in red lycra, performing\nincredible feats of athleticism. Watching one flip the other on his legs in\ntime to the growing pace of the music,\nI vaguely wondered the consequences\nof bad timing. They were moving so\nfast I could barely distinguish one from\nthe other.\nThe contortionists and balancing\nacts are pretty incredible. You\u2019re always on the edge of your seat, convinced that this time she\u2019s going to fall\nor this time he\u2019s not going to be able\nto hold on long enough. But true to\nform, they always do. I kept wondering\nif it really was possible to support the\nweight of another human being with\njust one hand, let alone while dangling\noff the edge of a beam yourself! Maybe\nit was a trick of the light. Maybe there\nwere hidden supports. And maybe\nthese performers are so skilled that\nthey transcend the boundaries of normal human ability. In this mystery the\nmagic of Varekai is woven.\nThey use the Icarus story as another\nexcuse for mind-blowing displays of\nathleticism. Watching the story of the\nbetrothed unfold, you can feel her connection with him. The ensuing dance\nis both sensual and calming.\nYou can never quite decipher a lan-guage. I gleam smatterings of English\nand French. But as surely as I hear\ndefinite gibberish, I know that it\u2019s not\nabout the words. It\u2019s about the actions,\nthe music and the flurry of colours all\naround. My favourite acts were the\nmachinations of the Skywatcher and\nMagician. The slapstick humour, the\nconfounded expressions and the stooge\nin the audience all served to send the\nwhole audience into fits and giggles;\nthe humour transcends all ages.\nAmazed, awed, completely flabber-gasted...there are no words to describe\nthe way I felt, no ways to capture the\nemotions of the audience. As I take in\nthe looks of wonderment, I can barely\ncontain my own excitement. I feel like\nI\u2019m six years old again.\nCirque du Soleil is a masterpiece.\nEveryone who sees it will come out\nsmiling. How couldn\u2019t you? Even\nwatching near misses, excellent saves,\nand a stretch that might have gone a\nlittle too far, you cannot deny its excel-lence. I give Cirque two thumbs up. A\ndefinite must-see when the circus next\ncomes to town!\nDon\u2019t try this at home, kids\n\u201cOi, Steve! How did you get up there?\u201d \u201cI feel light as a feather, Dave!\u201d\nOroma Oyewole pops round the corner to see Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall\nAh! Greetings, sir! Fancy seeing you whilst swinging on some high wires in the Royal Albert Hall! Ha!\n\u201cMummy, the lady looks funny.\u201d \u201cYes, she\u2019s a circus freak, dear\u201d\n\n"

It was shocking to\nsee how people who lived as neighbours for years had suddenly turned\nagainst each other.\nBut probably the most eye-opening\nquote was that \u201cthe number of foreign\ntroops used in the evacuation of ex-pats would have been sufficient to stop\nthe genocide\u201d, and considering the role\nthe UN played, reducing its force and\nlimiting its mandate as the crisis wors-ened, this was indeed a bitter pill for\nRwanda to swallow.\nUltimately it relied on the bravery of\nthe RPF force, led by current president\nPaul Kagame, to end the violence. \u201cThe\ninternational community failed. I realised afterwards that there was more\nthat I could and should have done\u201d\nKofi Annan said somewhat late, when\nthe RPF had already done the job.\nPost-genocide, it appears that the\ncountry has moved on significantly\nand no more common mention of past\nevents takes place. Certainly, nobody\nrecognises each other as Hutu or Tutsi\non the face of things and maybe this\nis to move away from fanning nearly\nextinguished flames, but nonetheless\npeace has a firm grip inside the coun-try. This is a great development considering how recent the genocide was\nbut it could be that it is only what I saw\nsuperficially as a visitor.\nActually, to me it was almost as if\nthe genocide had been shelved away\ninto memorial sites that keep it away\nfrom public emotions but also to act as\na constant reminder for those who visit\nit. I came across a few such memorial\nsites but the two that stuck in my mind\nwere Nyamata and Murambi.\nNyamata is a village close to Kigali\nwhere 10,000 Tutsis took refuge in a\nchurch, locking themselves in using\nmere padlocks on the iron gates to escape the murderous Rwandan government forces and the Interahamwe mili-tia. However, on the 7th of April 1994,\nthe forces and militia broke in and\nmassacred the refugees with grenades,\nmachetes and rifles. It is pretty grim\nbut is smaller somewhat in comparison to the injustices seen at Murambi.\nThe story there was a grave one,\nwhen during the 1994 genocide, more\nthan 50,000 Tutsis came to find protection and security at Murambi Technical\nSchool under the instructions of the local government and bishop at the time,\nwho were knowingly sending them to\ntheir deaths. The refugees were made\nto go on for two weeks without water\nor food in order to weaken them before an invasion by Hutu government\nsoldiers and the Interahamwe militia occurred, who descended in their\nthousands to slaughter. French soldiers\nwere also based here at that time, conducting \u2018operation turquoise\u2019 and were\nunder instructions not to stop the Hutus but actually to give them safe passage into the Congo. They therefore\ndisappeared and left the Tutsis to fend\nfor themselves when the invasion oc-curred. Murambi has a few marked\nareas where it bitterly remembers this\nwhen for example a sign points out\nhow the French soldiers would be playing volleyball metres away from where\nthe mass graves now are.\nNowadays, Murambi is a memorial\nsite where they have exhumed some of\nthe bodies from the mass graves and\npreserved them using limestone to remember the horror that had gone on\nthere. The victims are frozen in time,\nlying as when killed with machete and\nblunt club strikes visible on their skulls\nand bones.\nThe head curator of the site, Mr Rusanganwa Francois, and I had a very\nlong and frank conversation about\nwhat went on. His was a very moving\nstory. During the genocide, he himself managed to flee to Burundi in the\nsouth, leaving his entire family in the\nregion and his four brothers, four sis-ters, his mother, father and uncle were\nall killed in the ensuing Murambi inci-dent. Upon returning in 1995, he went\nto look for them all and one by one\nfound out the harsh truth.\nHe called his job a \u201csad job\u201d, and was\n\u201csad about his life\u201d; he told me how\neven though he was frustrated, it was\nhis duty to educate as many people as\npossible, especially those from other\ncountries; he wanted me to know how\nhe was angry with the UN, Kofi Annan\nand the international community. He\nalso told me how angry he was with the\nFrench for supporting the oppressors\nbut wanted to convey praise for the\ncurrent government and their efforts\nto remove the Hutu-Tutsi divide and to\nbring progress to Rwanda.\nRusangawa was a simple person with\nthese few simple observations and in\nour exchange he really opened up to\nme. He kindly requested that I communicate his story and his messages\nas much as possible, and I hope I have\ndone that above.\nRwanda, with its gorgeous lush green\nlandscape has lovingly earned the nickname of \u2018the land of a thousand hills\u2019,\nbut it has one patch of darkness in its\nhistory that has the potential to cast\nan everlasting shadow on its future. It\nis vital that the world learns from this\ntragedy and its mistakes, and to do so\nit is important for people to engage\n\u201cIt is pretty grim\nbut is smaller\nsomewhat in\ncomparison to\nthe injustices\nseen at\nMurambi\u201d\nwith this topic in a constructive man-ner. Seeing the country as it is now is\npart of that process and will help all of\nus move on.\nA journalist I met on my travels told\nme how in Kibuye he had once seen\nHutus dancing with decapitated Tutsi\nheads on their heads but now saw\nmany young people being adopted by\nstrange families. In fact, he said it was\nnow commonplace for many orphans\nof the genocide to live with distant relatives or complete strangers, and this is\nthe type of positive change Rwanda has\nseen post genocide.\nPaul Kagame has been instrumental\nin achieving this upheaval in the social fabric and truly, I am in awe of his\nleadership. I was very lucky to find out\nthat he was giving a lecture at the LSE\nwhen I returned in autumn and went\nto see him there. His speech was full\nof enthusiasm and mild mannered,\nas one would expect of a humble and\ngreat leader, and sprouting from such\ngovernance I look forward to an even\nbetter and safer Rwanda in the future.\nIncidentally, The Imperial College Union Political Philosopy\nSociety is hosting its Genocide\nAwareness Week next week\nwhere speakers of international\nrepute will be attending, such as\nDr James Smith CEO of the Aegis\nTrust and founder of the Kigali\nMemorial Centre, who will be\nflying in having just met President\nGeorge Bush and Condoleeza\nRice. Don\u2019t miss out.

So, on a day when the medical\nschools had already been antagonising\neach other, IC Women\u2019s Cricket set out\nfor deep south London to play our first\nindoor game against King\u2019s College\nMedics.\nAn indoor game is simply a mini-match, played with half the regular\nnumber of players. There are two batsmen as usual, if they strike the walls it\ncounts as one run, stike the far wall\nand it is four if the ball has touched\nthe ground and six in the air.

On the re-toss, we lost and were sent to field the\nfirst innings. Kings weren\u2019t to be beaten\ntwice and out rolled their finest wom-en. Despite a great fielding effort and\nSian bowling a beautiful wicket, King\u2019s\nwere able to rack up 75 runs, and it was\nour turn to bat again. Batul and Aleeza\nbatted first.

I bought\nsome cheap shoes from H&M and they\ndon\u2019t fit me. I can\u2019t take them back as I\nripped the tags off but I can\u2019t stop thinking about the money I\u2019ve wasted. I might\nas well have ripped up the bank notes.\nHow can I get over my bad purchase?\nTheyweregreywedges\nDear Theyweregreywedges\nEveryone finds that at some point in\ntheir life, they make mistakes. Some\npeople commit genocide, some take\ndrugs, and you, my self-indulgent\nreader, chose to buy unsuitable shoes.\nGet a grip. In the history of mistakes\nyours features so small it doesn\u2019t even\nmake the Planck length. I suggest a\nliberal dose of reality; stop worrying\nabout the shoes or that annoying bit\nof hair which won\u2019t stay in place and\ntry taking notice of somebody else for\nonce. Even if it is just your equally self-obsessed best friend (she might even\nthank you for it).\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy Mc Needy\nI\u2019ve started having a recurring dream\nin which I\u2019m in a stationary shop and\ncan\u2019t choose what to buy. It started off\na couple of months ago and I laughed\nit off but then it\u2019s come back and now I\ndream it every single night. I\u2019ve started\nstaying up late at night and working\non coursework so I don\u2019t have to go to\nsleep and dream the same damn dream\nevery single fucking night\u2026\nHuggles\nDear Huggles\nSo, what actually is your problem? You\nfind shopping for stationary boring? I\nsuggest you go to Muji, all the stationary there is so beautiful it\u2019s like someone dreamt it. I think staying up late\nworking is definitely not the right way\nto tackle your problem; you\u2019re better\noff having as much sleep as possible\nto get all these dreams out of your sys-tem. Skip lectures; I can provide a hard\ncopy of this page as evidence to your\npersonal tutor of your problems and\nreason for your absences: email me on\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy Mc Needy\nMy boyfriend and I were in bed, going\nthrough the usual motions, when he\nsuggested that he might like to \u201cshove his\ncock up my arse.\n\u201d I just ignored the comment and continued as we were, and he\ndidn\u2019t mention it after that. What shall\nI do if he says it again?\nI\u2019mnotsomekindofhussy\nDear I\u2019mnotsomekindofhussy\nFirstly, it sounds like your relationship\nneeds a bit of livening up if you use\nwords like \u201cgo through the motions.\u201d\nDid you forget to take your slippers off\nagain? At a risk of sounding prudish,\nthough, there are better ways to spice\nup the love than just picking another\norifice. Try sex in the morning (unless\nyou sleep in the slippers, they\u2019ll already\nbe off, and thus provide scope for a different kind of foreplay. As for what to\nsay, I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cI\u2019m not keen on\nthat,\u201d will do the trick. Then show him\nwhat you are keen on.

The best\nway to deal with this situation is to take\nhim aside (don\u2019t get too close) and say\nthat you\u2019re worried that he isn\u2019t taking\nhis appearance seriously anymore and\nthat others have started to notice. Say\nit like you\u2019re the only one who thinks it\nso he doesn\u2019t think his mates have been\nganging up on him. Then run away\nshouting \u201cYou smell!

    "content": "a serious challenge. We were actually\nbeing blown uphill at one point. Literally* clinging to rocks by our fingertips\nto stop ourselves blowing away we\ndecided that the only way was down\nthe ridge. It was disappointing to not\ncomplete the Old Man, but safety must\ncome first. Happily there was a path\nwith a gradual descent to take us back\nto Coniston village. Visibility was still\nbad but expert navigation by Dave and\nChris kept us going in the right direc-tion. The gusts blowing across the ridge\non the way down had enough force to\ntake us off our feet, but Nathaniel apparently thought that wasn\u2019t enough of\na challenge and decided to walk with\nthe sides of his waterproof trousers\nopen, effectively having a sail attached\nto each leg. A few hundred metres lower someone dared to say \u2018I think we\u2019re\nthrough the worst of it\u2019 and although\nthe wind still howled it was not strong\nenough to unsteady us.\nBack at the lower level it was relatively calm, and just as two weeks before\nwhen we emerged from the clouds and\nsnow in the Pennines it was hard to\nbelieve what conditions had been like\nearlier. With a renewed appreciation\nfor life we arrived at the village with\nevery intention of continuing our walk\naround Coniston Water, it was barely\npast lunch after all. However, a 16th\ncentury pub with an open fire looked\ntoo inviting to pass and we went in \u2018just\nfor one\u2019. One was followed by another\nand before we knew it the afternoon\nhad passed while card games were\nplayed; outer layers dried off and one\nby one we fell asleep by the fire. I\u2019ve\nheard it said that Fellwanderers is a\n\u2018drinking club with a walking problem\u2019,\nI\u2019ve no idea where anyone would get\nsuch an idea.\nMore wandering and imbibing\nMalread Skelly chronicles the Fellwanderers\u2019 January expedition to the mountainous Lake District\nwhich gave them an excuse to do a lot of drinking and walking in more or less equal amounts\nI\n\u2019m writing this report while\nwatching \u2018A Tribute to Edmund\nHillary\u2019, and reflecting on how\nFellwanderers\u2019 experiences have\na lot in common with his. A case\nin point is the recent weekend trip to\nthe Lake District, one of the club\u2019s favourite destinations.\nIt began with fourteen of us gathered at the Union on Friday evening,\nfeeling sorry for all the other students\nwho would be spending yet another\nweekend in London. Much like Hillary\u2019s team we were a very international group, having 8.125 nationalities among fourteen people: English,\nPolish, Romanian, Hong Kong, French,\nPortuguese, German, Irish, and one-eighth of a Welsh person. Not one of\nour respective countries was spared\nfrom President Chris\u2019s insults over the\ncourse of the weekend; delivered with\naffection, of course.\nWhen the yellow minibus pulled up,\nwe crammed onboard for the inevitable six hour drive. The M6 may not\nsound like the most fun place to spend\na Friday night but mobile phone Trivial\nPursuit; fish and chips in Warwick and\nthe endless search for a good radio station made the journey pass quickly.\nWe arrived around midnight at our\nhome for the weekend: High Wray village hall. After inspecting the facilities\n(record player and ping-pong table) we\nsettled down to sleep.\nTo make the most of the daylight\nhours we woke before sunrise on Saturday. The weather looked distinctly\nunpromising \u2013 dark grey clouds and\na constant drizzle. Hellvelyn\u2019s famous\nStriding Edge had been a possibility\nbut the weather ruled that out, instead\nthe summit of Old Man of Coniston, at\na height of 803 m, was the target for the\nday. Neil from the Outdoor Club set\noff to run the route while we set a (just\nslightly) more leisurely pace, cheerful\nin spite of the showers and grey sky. As\nwe ascended, though, it became steadily windier. Sudden gusts were catching us unawares, it was getting more\nand more difficult to walk against the\nwind, and as we entered the cloud\nlayer we could hardly see the person\nnext to us. Undaunted, when we had a\nchoice of two routes, one 6 km longer\nand with a more substantial ridge walk\nthan the other, we took the more difficult option.\nAs Fellwanderers\u2019 favourite poet\nRobert Burns wrote: \u201cthe best laid\nplans gang aft agley\u201d. As we approached Weatherlam (760 m), walking in a straight line was proving to be\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard\nit said that\nFellwanderers is\na \u2018drinking club\nwith a walking\nproblem, I\u2019ve\nno idea where\nanyone would\nget that idea.\u201d\nEventually we dragged ourselves\naway from the fireside and back to\nthe village hall. The Sound of Music\nfrom the hall\u2019s record collection was\nthe accompaniment to dinner prepara-tions, followed by the Greatest Hits of\nABBA. While we waited for the food, a\nfew of us played an energetic game of\ntable tennis (apparently we hadn\u2019t got\nenough exercise during the day), which\nsomewhat interfered with the committee members\u2019 enjoyment of ABBA as\nthe running caused the needle to jump.\nNo matter, dinner was ready and the\nhungry Fellwanderers descended like\ngannets. Dave\u2019s goulash was quickly\npolished off, followed by Gareth\u2019s ba-noffee pie (a definite highlight of the\nweekend).\nPost-dinner we played poker, and\nit was no less keenly-fought for even\nthough we were not playing for money\nbut pool balls and christmas baubles.\nSome reckless betting by certain people (i.e. me) paid off once or twice\nwith large winnings but no-one could\ncompete with Judith\u2019s merciless high-stakes betting and by 11pm she had\nwon everything. That left enough time\nfor a couple of games of werewolf. The\nsoundtrack to the latter part of the\nevening was Glenn Millar, James Last\nand Andy Williams \u2013 I don\u2019t think High\nWray\u2019s record collection has been updated for a while.\nWaking up on Sunday was rather\ndistressing as Chris had chosen SOS\nby ABBA as the alarm call. However\nwe didn\u2019t expect any SOS calls that day\nas the weather was considerably im-proved, there were even some patches\nof blue sky. We drove to Ambleside to\nbegin the walk towards Dove Crag,\nagain Neil left us to run. Everyone\nwas in a good mood as we enjoyed the\nbeautiful Lakeland scenery \u2013 we did\nnot enter the cloud layer so we were\nable to enjoy the view of the surrounding hills and back to Coniston Water\nfor the whole day. From time to time\nthe wind got up, and through force of\nhabit we braced ourselves against it,\nbut today that wasn\u2019t necessary. It was\na steady ascent to High Pike although\nDave and Nathaniel still managed to\nfind places to scramble. We stopped\nthere for a biscuit and then continued\nupwards to the high point of the day at\nDove Crag (760 m).\nIt hadn\u2019t been possible to take a photograph with the Fellwanderers banner\nthe day before \u2013 we\u2019d probably have\ntaken off if we\u2019d tried, but it was unfurled at Dove Crag. It was infinitely\nmore pleasant weatherwise than the\nday before (and as a physicist I don\u2019t\nuse that term casually), but it never\npays to linger on an exposed peak for\ntoo long in January. As soon as the\nbanner was put away we moved on\nand found a sheltered spot for lunch,\nGareth cemented his reputation as the\nman who doesn\u2019t need to eat by skipping lunch for the second day in a row.\nWe enjoyed the views for a little while\nbefore descending and completing the\ncircle by walking back towards Ambleside along the valley below Red Screes.\nThere was time on the way to stop by\na pretty waterfall to play Pooh-sticks\nand alarm some pensioners by disappearing onto some rocks hidden below\nthe path. Once we had convinced Chris\nthat yes, we would have to return to\nLondon and real life we piled into the\nminibus and left the Lakes behind. So\nended the Fellwandering weekend that\nhadeverything:gorgeousscenery,great\nwalks, games, music, laughter and mild\nperil. Never fear \u2013 we shall return!\n* literally: a word used by football\nmanagers to describe something that\nisn\u2019t literally true.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come back for me won\u2019t you? I... lo...\u201d <dies>\nA lack of snow was the main problem. Trying to ski uphill wasn\u2019t really helping matters\nThe view from the Dove Crag Ridge\nOuch.

IC Radio\u2019s\nSingles\nColumn\nThe lovely people at IC Radio, limitless\nas they are in both eloquence and gen-erosity, have donated a load of single\nreviews.\nOne Republic\nStop and Stare\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nLA-based OneRepublic are the first\n\u2018rock\u2019 band to be signed to Timbaland\u2019s record label, Interscope Records/\nMosley Music Group, and is getting a\nlot of media attention in the US \u2013 especially on TV \u2013 with \u2018Stop and Stare\u2019\nfollowing their hit single \u2018Apologise\u2019\n(which also featured as a remix on\nTimbaland\u2019s album Shock Value). Although the band\u2019s been around since\n2003, it\u2019s since 2006 and after quite a\nfew modifications in the line-up, that\nOneRepublic\u2019s been gaining popular-ity, due to online exposure mainly;\nit is now definitely one of the biggest\nMyspace bands with over 20 million\nsongs played \u2013 and counting.\n\u2018Stop and Stare\u2019 features on their debut\nalbum, Dreaming Out Loud and is one\nof those mellow, bittersweet, typical\npop-rock songs, with sentimental lyrics and a simple melodic tune. It is an\nattractive track for the mainstream and\nwill probably get a lot of airplay. But all\nin all, there\u2019s not much to rave about,\nit is neither the first, last nor the best\nof its kind. The band itself, other than\nthe fact that there are three guitars as\nwell as a cello involved, is also your\naverage pop-rock band: very popular,\nthat does very well for itself and whose\nsongs will be played a lot at proms and\nin TV-series (the latter is already a true\nstatement).\nKate Agathos\nRoyworld\nMan in the machine\n\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\nWhen the common man\u2019s ears are\ngraced with the name \u2018George Pringle\u2019,\nthe first image in their mind might be\nthat of a slightly chubby man who perhaps has a moustache and is somehow\naffiliated with a tasty bag of crisps.\nIn reality, nothing could stray further\nfrom the truth, as George Pringle is\nin fact a young aspiring female artist from the heart of London. This is\nperhaps because George doesn\u2019t really\ncraft \u201ccommon\u201d music for the ordinary\nperson. From the very inception of this\nfour track EP it becomes irrefutably\nclear that this artist is completely oblivious of any current musical trends\nand has absolutely no intentions of\nconforming to instantly recognizable\ntraits of any one genre.\n\u2018SW10\u2019 starts with a child-like playground clapping noise which is then\nsupported by a distorted electronic\nunderbelly until George comes in with\na riveting spoken-word story which\nseems to have been originally written as a poem. Lyrically, the song is a\nschizophrenic journey deep into the\ndark reaches of her mind as she seems\nto mourn the loss of her childhood innocence and heavily reminisces times\ngone by. The second song \u2018Carte Postale\u2019 doesn\u2019t rely on any such sonic\nbuild-ups and instead commences\nstraight off with a simple but consistent\ndrumbeat and a lush \u2018electro-poppy\u2019\nbackdrop combined with George\u2019s poetic spoken commentary. A cherubic\nbackground sound of George singing\n\u2018change change\u2019 provides the track an\nadditional beautiful and poignant aura\nwhich makes the angst and pain she\nspeaks of all the more palpable. \u2018LCD I\nlove you..\u2019 is musically the most palatable and infectiously groovy song on the\nEP, as it seems to tread on Vive la Fete\nand Goldfrapp-esque grounds with its\ninstantlyupliftingdrumbeatandchants\nof \u2018take me out tonight..\u2019. The lyrical ingenuity on display in this EP relies on\nGeorge\u2019s uncanny ability to convey her\ncomplex introspective voyage through\nan uncompromisingly sincere account\nof aspects of her everyday life. Overall, the sense of urgency exhibited in\nPringle\u2019s music almost wholeheartedly\nconvinces you that this art is crafted\nnot so much out of choice as it is out of\na cathartic need for expression. With\nthe \u2018Poor\u2019 EP George Pringle has managed to produce a collection of songs\ninfinitely more intriguing and visceral\nthan a billion billboard-topping musi-cians. George has managed to prove\nherself to be a shiny needle in the haystack of mediocrity that seems to be\nmusic these days and rest assured her\nwords can pierce through to the inner\nreaches of your heart. Regardless of\nrecord sales, chart positions or any of\nthe meaningless irrelevance that seems\nto lurk behind music these days, I truly\nbelieve 2008 has the potential to be\n\u2018Year of the Pringle\u2019.\nUshnish Banerjee\n\u2018Man in the machine\u2019 by Royworld is\nanother of those poppy rock songs currently invading the airwaves. Produced\nby the man behind the likes of Scouting For Girls, and The Feeling, the\nsong follows a similar style, and will no\ndoubt attract the same following. However, the vocals try too hard to sound\nstriking, and ultimately end up seeming forced; all whilst the usual sprightly\npiano part flitters in the background,\ncontrasted by an occasional pounding\non the drum. All this comes together\nas a song which whilst offering nothing new, does nothing old particularly\nwell either, making a truly forgettable\nsingle.\nNat Roocroft\nSingles, singles, singles... we just love listening to M*****\nWe Are Scientists\nAfter Hours\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nBears Are Coming\nLate of the Pier\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nWe Are Scientists\u2019 new single \u2018After\nHours\u2019 is the first from new album\n'Brain Thrust Mastery', and also the\nfirst since the loss of their drummer Michael Tapper. The remaining\ntwo piece more than make up for it\nwith this assured song which draws\nstrong comparisons with Arcade Fire\nthroughout. The song maintains a high\nintensity, which is mixed with a captivating drum rhythm. Add memorable\nlyrics and a straightforward structure\ninto the mix, and the song possesses\nan anthemic quality. Their website\ndescribes the song with no fewer than\nsixteen adjectives, which seems excessive when \u2018superb\u2019 does the job.\nNat Roocroft\nIt can be easy to clump Late of the\nPier into the terribly materialistic \u201cNuRave\u201d genre, but this band from Castle\nDonington are much more than that.\nThe track starts off with pounding,\nalmost tribal drums, and you know\nyou\u2019re in for an aural assault of sorts\nfrom the outset. Vocals and synthesizers ferociously enter, creating a very\nfunky, danceable verse. It carries on\nthis way until about half way through,\nuntil we are met with a 60\u2019s-style gui-tar-led rhythm part. Following this we\nget a truly joyous, celebratory digression complete with choral singing,\nsounding not too unlike The Flaming\nLips. This is definitely something new,\nand I for one loved it since it is such a\ndeparture from the same-old same-old\nindie music we are getting so used to\nhearing at the moment. Wonderfully\nfulfilling and exciting music.\nMit Shah\nShocking Pinks\nEmily\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nShocking Pinks are a New Zealand\nband, with Nick Harte being the only\npermanent member of a continually\nvarying line-up. 4 albums in, \u201cEmily\u201d is\ntheir latest offering. It boasts a mouth-wateringly scuzzy, overdriven bass\nwhich is complemented by sparse guitars and metallophone sounds, creating a very textured atmosphere. Harte\u2019s\nvocals are dreamy, and the back-to-ba-sics approach works really well on this\nsingle. I absolutely love this song, and\nam drawn by its romantic simplicity\nand honest cries to \u201cEmily\u201d, presumably a previous lover. All in all, this is\nan intimately warm song.\nMit Shah\nI picked up \u2018Alas, I Cannot Swim\u2019 believing that I would have an easy time\nreviewing it after a friend \u2013 who\u2019s taste\nin music more often than not clashes\nwith my own \u2013 began frequently mentioning Laura Marling\u2019s name in the\nlead up to this debut. After all, negative\nreviews are so much more fun to write\nand any time the words \u201cMySpace\u201d,\n\u201cartist\u201d and \u201cyoung\u201d end up in the artist\u2019s calling card along with your typical go-to influences for female singer-songwriters (Kate Bush, PJ Harvey, Joni\nMitchell, et cetera), you just know that\nthe record will be ripe for tearing to\nshreds. So, having said that and unless\nyou have done what most readers do\nby noting the star rating and just moving on, you can probably guess how the\nrest of this article will read.\nFor the uninitiated, Laura Marling\nhails from Eversley, started playing\nguitar when she was five, was taught\nthe blues by her father, and has recent-Laura Marling\nAlas I Cannot Swim\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nly come off her first UK tour as well\nas providing support for Jaime T and\ncross-dressing folk-kingpin, Devendra Banhart. Like Adele, she has been\ngathering an underground following\nover the past year, but unlike the South\nLondon warbler who has taken the\nlimelight seemingly just off the back\nof a painfully mediocre single (but isn\u2019t\nthat video cool!), Marling deserves the\nrecognition she gets.\n\u2018Swim\u2019 consists of guitar-driven folk-pop vignettes (half of the songs don\u2019t\neven scratch the three minute mark),\nthat might initially make listeners\ndump her into the Starbucks friendly\nwasteland of Katie \u201cTerry-Wogan\u2019sho\u201d Melua and Norah \u201cSnorah\u201d Jones.\nSticking with it, however, reveals a collection of thirteen lovely tracks, most\nof which possess a slight tinge of darkness underscoring their softly lilting\nmelodies.\nThe most immediate element on the\nrecord is Marling\u2019s voice and while she\ndoes not demonstrate an awesome\nrange, her mature, slightly smoky\ntones completely conceal the fact that\nthis young lady celebrated her eighteenth birthday at the start of February!\nTracks like \u2018Old Stone\u2019 and \u2018My Manic\n& I\u2019 demonstrate such an astonishing\namount of world weariness that you\u2019d\nhave to check the cover of the album\nagain just to make sure you that no,\nyou are not listening to a Patti Smith\nrecord. The former track, in particular\nhas her contemplating the comforting\npeace that comes with solitude (\u201cTen\nthousand years and you\u2019re still on your\nown\u2026But you love it that way\u201d), while\nthe latter has her coming to terms with\na wasteful relationship (\u201cI cannot be\nyour friend/I don\u2019t believe in a fairytale\nend\u201d).\nIf the lyrical content raises this album\nabove the releases of her peers, then\nthe beautiful and organic instrumenta-tion, along with the creaking production that makes the thing sound like\nits coming out of the bowel\u2019s of an old\nboat, make it completely captivating\nand transporting. On \u2018Failure\u2019, Marling\ntackles, amongst other things, religion\n(\u201cIf He made me in his image, then he\u2019s\na failure, too\u201d), while on \u2018The Captain\nAnd The Hourglass\u2019, a driving guitar, a\nlightly played piano and urgent fiddles\nmake this the most country-flecked\nof all the tracks as Marling almost\nappears to channel Nancy Sinatra.\n\u2018Swim\u2019s most shining and uplifting mo-ment, however, comes in the form of\nthe short interlude \u2018Crawled Out Of\nThe Sea\u2019. Starting as an a capella, Marling\u2019s achingly sweet refrain is quickly\njoined by bouncy percussion, accordi-ons, fiddles, trumpets and handclaps\nin a rousing climax that also includes\nwhat sounds like a mariner\u2019s worth of\nsailors on backing vocals.\nJorge Costa\nAlbum reviews\nGeorge Pringle has rather taken to playing whack-a-badger by sitting\non them just as they burrow upwards through the earth.

    "content": "14 felix Friday 29 February 2008\nSexy art from Russia at the RA\nEmily Wilson gets all hot and sweaty at the Royal Academy... all that Matisse and Cezanne... dribble...\nP\nlugging the From Russia exhibition to you might be a\nbit futile. The RA has sold\nall online and telephone\ntickets well into March. If\nyou turn up at the door, the queue for\ntickets extends across the courtyard,\nand it\u2019ll take you at least half an hour (I\nhad a press ticket but queued so I could\ntake a companion with me).\nBut please PLEASE don\u2019t be put off\nby this because this is the art event of\nthe year. From Russia is an exciting\nmix of nineteenth century to modern\nRussian art, as well as some of the biggest names from Impressionism and\nFauvism from France during the same\nperiod. Picasso, Matisse, Rousseau,\nMonet, Van Gogh\u2026 this exhibition has\nthem all under one roof. The works\nhave been loaned out from various museums in Russia, most of them having\noriginated in the homes of nineteenth\ncentury Russian art collectors. It\u2019s rare\nthat such a large selection from overseas should be made available from on\nour doorstep. The opportunity to see it\nis well worth seizing.\nAfter you\u2019ve queued for half an\nhour, the exhibition space is painfully\ncrowded. The whole RA was absolutely crammed when I went early on\nSunday. For the first few rooms, until\nthe crowd disperses, you can hardly\nmove. And the crowds mean it\u2019s a bit\nlike a sauna, but with less nudity and\nmore art.\nThe introduction informs me that\nthe exhibition ranges from Realism and\nImpressionism, and from Suprematism\nto Constructivism (whatever they are).\nThe exhibition\u2019s focus is the interaction\nbetween Russian and French art from\nthe late nineteenth century to 1925.\nThis period in Russia was one of social upheaval and political revolution.\nConsequently I look forward to some\nexciting, revolutionary art, but this\nisn\u2019t what the curators are going for.\nThe exhibition progresses from Russia\nto France and back again, highlighting\nthe effect the latter had on the former.\nThe exhibition gets off to a good\nstart, kicking off with works originating in Russia at the beginning of the\nperiod of focus. \u201cLeo Tolstoy Barefoot\u201d\nby Ilya Repin is a treat, because it\u2019s not\nevery day you get to see Tolstoy with\nno shoes on. \u201cBlessing of the Young\nCouple Before Marriage\u201d by Pascal\nDagnan-Bouveret is a charming depiction of a young couple getting married.\nThis is the kind of traditional, folky\nsubject matter that features heavily in\nthe earlier Russian art, which can err\non the side of dull. I like the use of light\nin these Russian paintings. Some of\nthem are technically wonderful. Another common theme in this Russian\nart is the landscape. I can\u2019t be bothered\nwith the landscapes \u2013 they\u2019re all rolling\nhills and sheep. It\u2019s all very traditional\nand romanticised, in the usual Victorian-era way.\nThere is a revolutionary-ish painting hung so high, close to the ceiling,\nthat when you look up it catches the\nlight and you can\u2019t see it properly. This\nis a shame, because from a distance\nit looked like a promising piece. An\nAmerican woman speaks to me, saying\nthat if she hadn\u2019t overheard me mentioning it she would never have seen it.\nThis is careless hanging \u2013 it\u2019s like the\nRA ran out of room on the walls.\n\u201cRuins (Inner Voices)\u201d by James Tissot is a depiction of Jesus bleeding onto\nsome scrap metal, in the company of\nsome diseased beggars. It doesn\u2019t rank\nhighly on the cheeriness charts, and\nisn\u2019t very pretty either. The paintings\ndon\u2019t have proper descriptions on\nthem, possibly to force you into paying\nfor the audioguide (\u00a33, and I overheard\na lot of people complaining about it).\nThis means I couldn\u2019t understand what\nthe painting was really supposed to be\nabout, so I cannot enlighten you as to\nwhat Jesus was up to. This is an aspect\nof the exhibition I found frustrating.\n\u201cThe Murdered Tsarevich Dmitry\u201d by\nMikhail Nesterov is next to Jesus. The\nTsarevich is green and ghostly, surrounded by birch trees. He has very\nlong eyelashes. Again, I\u2019d like to know\nmore about this haemophiliac prince,\nbut the RA won\u2019t tell me (unless I pay).\nThere is a rather charming PierreAuguste Renoir: \u201cIn the Garden\u201d. The\nbackground\u2019s brush-strokes of deep\ngreens and blues are beautiful, with\nthe girl\u2019s pale striped dress standing\nout in the foreground. A less nice Renoir, \u201cPortrait of the Actress Jeanne\nSamary\u201d is next to it, and is intolerably\nnaff.\nMy companion, who also happened\nto be my mother, is a big Paul Cezanne\nfan, so was delighted to find several of\nhis paintings. There are a couple of his\nlandscapes of Mont Sainte-Victoire.\nThese are beautiful and a real treat to\nsee. My mother made small whimpering noises of lust (she told me to quote\nthat). I prefer \u201cBridge Over the Marne\nat Cretail\u201d though, as I\u2019m not a mountain person.\nNearby, \u201cIn the Bar\u201d looks like a 14\nyear old did it, not Edouard Manet.\n\u201cThe Pond at Montgeron\u201d by Monet is\nbig. It is better from a distance, but difficult to appreciate when there are so\nmany people in the way.\nRoom three is possibly the best, containing works by Van Gogh, Rousseau,\nMatisse and Picasso - the real big artistic guns of the period. \u201cNave Nave\nMoe. Sacred Spring\u201d by Paul Gaugain\nis beautiful. It shows south sea island\ngirls glumly eating fruit, with rusty red\ncolours. \u201cDoesn\u2019t do anything for me,\nthat one\u201d an old lady says beside me. I\ndisagree. Some of the other Gaugains\nare quite sickly though. He comes off\nas a bit of a pervert, painting all these\nscantily clad islanders. \u201cThe Muse Inspiring the Poet\u201d is by Rousseau, one\nof my favourite artists. The cartoonish\nmuse is rather large and the poet looks\nquite frightened, though his hands are\nbigger than his head.\nI feel a bit harsh when I say the Picasso presence here is a bit lacking. \u201cDryad\u201d is distinctively Picasso, but I don\u2019t\nlike it. The awkward rusty orange of the\nflesh doesn\u2019t sit well with me, nor does\nthe blank lack of expression of the figure\u2019s face. \u201cFarm Woman\u201d, its next door\nneighbour, is equally uninspiring.\nThe works by Matisse are far more\npleasing, but then he is perhaps my\nnumber-one-favourite-artist-of-all-time(-can-I-have-his-babies-please).\n\u201cNude (Black and Gold)\u201d is very nice\nfor a nude, which I generally don\u2019t en-joy. The golden colours are fabulous.\n\u201cDance II\u201d takes pride of place in the\nexhibition, and quite rightly so. The\ncolours are more vivid than you could\never imagine from books. And it is gi-gantic. Yet \u201cDance II\u201d is oddly simple,\nwith flat background and rough lines,\nwhile astounding and imposing.\nI have a postcard at home of \u201cThe\nRed Room\u201d so this was a treat to see.\nIt is utterly beautiful. The colours, especially the red, are gorgeous. I love\nthe simplicity. I also adore the strange\ncloud-like trees outside, the simple apples dotted about on the table and the\ntoken out-of-place onion near them\nthat you could quite easily miss. I know\nmy onions.\n\u201cThe Old Town, Cagnes\u201d by Andre\nDerain is down-to-earth in the colourful but simply-formed style that\nis prevalent in this room. It is non-descript, making me feel quite fond\nof it. \u201cSaint-Michel Bridge, Paris\u201d by\nAlbert Marquet is startlingly modern-looking \u2013 it could be an Art on the Underground poster. The simple brushstrokes to create detail are excellent.\nThe grey of the sky contrasts with the\nwhite of the bridge and the streets, to\ngive the impression of the sun glancing off it.\nBy this point the crowds have started\nto disperse and, thankfully, the exhibition cools down as you progress\nthrough it. Room four is startling. The\nwalls are a lurid turquoise blue, which\nis a bold move for the RA. It houses a\ncompletely different kind of art, much\nless to my liking I\u2019m afraid. \u201cThe Grave\nof the Commander\u201d by Alexander\nGolovin is nicely twiddly, but looks a\nbit like somebody did it in felt-tip pens.\n\u201cThe Rape of Europa\u201d by Valentin Serov is nicer than you\u2019d expect from the\ntitle. A young woman riding a big gin-gery cow - the background is a pleasant mauve colour. I particularly like the\ngirl\u2019s cheeky smile. \u201cPortrait of Fyodor\nChaliapin...\u201d by Alexander Golovin is\nhuge - imposing to the point of being\nscary, and dazzlingly detailed and in-tricate. The spots of gold paint shimmer in the light, decorating the grand\ngown of the bearded subject. The contrast between this and its neighbouring\nnude is stark (was that a pun there?).\n\u201cIda Rubinstein\u201d by Valentin Serov\nlooks like a fashion shoot, only without\nany fashions. The elegant, graceful Ida\nhas been painted so simply, with the\nbackground almost the same colour as\nher skin.\nIn the next room, \u201cDate Palm, Egypt\u201d\nby Martrios Saryan is crisp and with\nsmooth, vivid colour. It looks like the\ncover to a holiday brochure or travel\nguide, and has probably been used as\nHenri Matisse\u2019s Dance II masterpiece. I think Matisse got this all wrong. There should be more bottoms! I do like a good, firm behind\nA very orange man \u2018Bathing a Red Horse\u2019. This is how Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin saw the world.

First\nwe had the blank front page a\nfew weeks back, then I had to\nuse an old draft of an Angry Geek last\nweek because my original was unprint-ably harsh in the context of the Union\nElections (Hey ***!). To cap it off, there\nwasn\u2019t even a Felix Games section a few\nweeks ago, presumably because they\u2019d\ncovered Union President Raper IV and\nit couldn\u2019t be put in the paper. I\u2019m not\nso sure about the last one, but either\nway the elections really messed things\nup and I think we should all be glad to\nhave them behind us so that we can focus on ignoring the Union for the next\neleven months.\nLast week, for those of you that read\nit, I asked you all not to vote in the\nelections, to show that apathy can be a\nstatement, to show that the Union isn\u2019t\nA.

I want\nyou to get involved, but I want you to\nget involved Angry Geek style. Now\nthat the empty promises and unnecessary enthusiasm of the campaigns are\nover, I feel ready to make you an offer\nyou can\u2019t refuse.\nLet\u2019s face it, the real issues that students \u2013 that\u2019s you \u2013 think about are unlikely to come to light over a drunken\nHustings in the Union. The best place\nto vent your feelings is right here, be\nyou a staff member, an undergrad or an\nold and wisened postgrad. This week,\nAngry Geek challenges you: tell Felix\nwhat you care about, and you could\nwin fifty quid.\nThe premise is simple; write for\nFelix\u2019s comment section next week,\nunder a humourously-chosen pseu-donym, about something that matters\nto you. It could be funny, it could be\nharsh, it could be bitter; it can be about\nUniversity, the future, the world.

Writing this\ncolumn perhaps even moreso. Sure, I\ndon\u2019t always make sense, and nor do a\nlot of the people in this section. But at\nleast we say what we think. That\u2019s the\nkey. That\u2019s the feeling you need to tap\ninto. And while you\u2019re at it, you may as\nwell win some cash for chocolate, or\nbeer, or chocolate-flavoured beer.\nWith a pseudonym, you needn\u2019t worry about quality, coherence or polite-ness.

I was, in fact,\nthe perfect bore: knowing about a subject in detail without knowing the subject itself at all. An impressive achievement for a child of twelve.\nIn any case, the advent of the mp3\nplayer coincided rather nicely with\nlong daily bus journeys to school and,\neventually, fetching black headphones\nbecame an integral part of my look. As\nthe years rolled by, the light blue mp3\nplayer I loved so well became more\nand more prone to reorganizing its internal memory without my assistance.\nAfter the fourteenth battery charge in\ntwenty-four hours, that faithful piece\nof early 21st Century technology was\nDon\u2019t judge a book by its album cover\nrelegated to the pile at the back of\nmy desk. In its place came the nEwer,\nsLeeker iPod with the purity of design\nthat smacked gobs and took breaths\naway all over the world.\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, there has never\nbeen a device that has achieved such\nubiquity. Its instantly recognizable\nform and at-times-irritating-yet-oh-so-loveable rolling-touch-menu-se-lect-thingy have transformed it into a\nglobal icon: and rightly so.\nIn much the same way as one can\nlearn a great deal about a person from\nthe books on their shelves, one can get\na true feel for someone\u2019s character by\na quick shuffle through their iPod. I\u2019ll\nadmit that I find it a great deal more\nenjoyable to rummage through their\nactual libraries: pulling out a faded\nspine from the bottom shelf behind\nthe door, for instance, or recognizing\na familiar name from underneath the\nbed, but as you\u2019ll have gathered, \u2018keen\nreader\u2019 is a polite euphemism for \u2018social leper\u2019.\nWe all enjoy picking on each other\u2019s\ntastes, however, and a friend\u2019s iPod can\nkeep me amused for a good few min-utes. To be fair, that\u2019s one of the reasons that mine doesn\u2019t leave the snug\nenclosure formed by the great-value\nspeakers on my desk. That and the\nfact that I don\u2019t particularly want to go\ntraipsing through Central London deaf\nto the oncoming traffic. My apathy\ntowards music may have transformed\ninto a compulsive need to have it play-ing, and indeed into a tremendous\npleasure derived from it, but my tastes\nare resolutely bizarre.\nIn an attempt to explain away the\nfact that I can name more classical\ncomposers than I can current bands I\noften cite the fact that I\u2019m a keen read-er. That usually resolves the issue as\nmy interlocutor smiles hesitantly and\nslowly backs away.\nMy other defence is that I am not\nparticularly into \u2018genres\u2019 \u2013 a shockingly\nhard word to pronounce in English.\nThis is true. Rather than a specific type\nof music, I find myself enjoying individual pieces from Irish folk to German opera and from popular songs\nof the 1940s to songs my neighbour\nblasts out of his room when I get back\nfrom college. Despite this, my iPod\nonly really reflects the classical side of\nmy tastes, which is why it stays pretty\nmuch where it is. I don\u2019t need its help\nto have awkward conversations \u2013 I can\nmanage nicely on my own.\nIt does have some hugely annoying\nfeatures, however. Principally its habit\nof starting from the first album alphabetically each time I turn it on after a\nday\u2019s neglect. This isn\u2019t so bad if I remember to switch song in time, but\na solitary misguidedly-imported CD\nback in 2005 means the whole room\nrocks to an unspeakably electric ABBA\nsingle. Having a fanatically organized\niTunes can be a hindrance at times.\nHere we are. At the end of this piece\nand, coincidentally, at the end of my\nalbum of Andrea Bocelli\u2019s recordings\nof a few Verdi arias. Delightful stuff. I\u2019d\nhighly recommend it if you\u2019re writing\na light-hearted piece on music. Whatever you do, don\u2019t choose Wagner\u2019s\nWalk\u00fcre \u2013 I tried that last week, and\nI think that my computer went into\nspontaneous reboot as a consequence.\nGilead Amit\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\n\n"

Be there\nor the cat\u2019ll get you and trust me, you don\u2019t want that because Felix the Cat is one mean motherjammer\n32 felix Friday 29 February 2008\nA\nfter mourning the disappointing number of\nattractive women in my\nfirst lecture at Imperial, my next realisation\nwas the incredible mix of ethnicities.\nGrowing up in rural South Wales, it\nwas completely different to anything\nI\u2019d experienced in school, and over\nthe years I have appreciated the privilege of studying in an environment so\nvaried in culture. However, by the end\nof my first term, something had happened that made integrating with different ethnicities outside my friendship\ngroup difficult. A quick glance around\nthe lecture theatre and you could see\nobvious cliques of people with similar backgrounds developing; the same\nphenomenon can be seen in the JCR\nat lunchtime. Although it is not rare\nto see all these different ethnicities under one roof at Imperial, it has become\nuncommon to see everyone mixing\nand sharing in culture. Except for one\nnight, that is. International Night\u2026\nOK, this may come across as a little\ncheesy, but I implore the less cynically-minded among you to read on\u2026\nInternational night, also known as\n\u2018iNite\u2019, is a flagship event organised\nevery year by the Overseas Societies\nCommittee, who bring together many\ndifferent Overseas and Performing\nArts Societies. Although many large\nand well-known Imperial Clubs take\npart, it is also a great opportunity to\nwitness the talented displays of smaller societies who don\u2019t have their own\nlarge events. There are an incredible\n3500 international students from 110\ndifferent countries studying at Imperial, and iNite is a celebration of this\nethnic diversity, experienced through\na collection of colourful and exciting\nstage acts. It\u2019s a great opportunity to\nfully appreciate Imperial\u2019s multiculturalism and witness your friends\u2019 different interests and talents on stage.\nEvery year also sees a great aftershow\nparty, where performers and audience\nmembers alike get together and dance\nto a diverse range of global music. Such\na mixed crowd coming together is\nsomething you rarely get to experience\nat other parties and is often considered\none of the highlights of the night.\nIn addition, the presidents of all\nOverseas Societies at Imperial have\nvoted for proceeds to go towards what\nthey feel is the most worthy cause. This\nyear\u2019s selected charity is M\u00e9decins\nSans Fronti\u00e8res, an international humanitarian aid organization that provides emergency medical assistance to\npopulations in danger in more than 70\ncountries.\nSo, if by any chance your friends keep\ngoing on about Japanese plays or Cypriot folk dance and you\u2019re wondering\nwhat the hell they\u2019re talking about, or\nif you still haven\u2019t watched the likes of\nICU Dance Company and Funkology\nin action, come to Kensington Town\nHall on the 7th of March and embrace\nImperial\u2019s multiculturalism with me\u2026\nAnd maybe meet some attractive people at the aftershow party\u2026 Imperial has almost 3500 international students from 110 different countries\nWaterAID: washing away poverty\nOn 22nd March 2008 people across the globe will be doing something special: celebrating World\nWater Day. Victoria Sanderson wants you to join the par-tay and help raise money for WaterAid\nE\nstablished in 1992 by the\nUnited Nations General Assembly as an international\nday of observance and ac-tion. Why, you might ask?\nWell, even in the 21st century, over 1\nbillion people lack access to clean wa-ter. That\u2019s around a sixth of the world\u2019s\npopulation. Tomorrow 4,500 kids will\ndie due to unsafe drinking water.\nThough over 1/3rd of people live in\n\u2018water stressed\u2019 regions the problems\nare worse in less developed countries.\nHere the lack of clean water and basic\nsanitation is a major hurdle to progress\nand development, impacting upon\npoverty, child mortality rates, education levels and political instability.\nSuch widespread impacts have rightly\nled to the UN prioritizing water access\namongst its Millennium Development\nGoals (MDG).\nThis year, the international focus is\non sanitation. Imagine a life where you\nare forced to defecate in bags, ditches,\nor on the roads. This is the reality for\n2.6 billion people who live without access to sanitation. Poor sanitation and\nhygiene spreads disease, and is directly\nimplicated in over 1.5 million deaths\nannually. Sanitation also has wider implications \u2013 it affects the structure of\nsociety and social development. Without adequate facilities many girls are\nforced to drop out of education and\nstay at home once they reach puberty.\nThough an unpleasant thought, stop\nand take a second to think what happens to waste. Here, once the toilet is\nflushed, we need worry no longer; fil-tered, cleaned, disposed of in a hygienic manner; all is far from our eyes.\nBut what happens when there is no\ndrainage, piped water or water compa-ny? Each year, around the world, more\nthan 200 million tonnes of waste water and solid waste go uncollected and\nuntreated. It is hugely damaging to the\nenvironment, polluting natural water\nsupplies and affecting crops, leading\nto the increased spread and burden of\ndisease. Ecosystems are permanently\naltered, affecting the productivity of\nthe land and animal populations. What\nis so troubling is that all this is so easily\npreventable.\nIt is hoped that by focusing the\nworld\u2019s attention on sanitation it will\naccelerate progress towards achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goal of\nhalving the number of people without\naccess to sanitation by 2015. It is esti-the MDG be achieved.\nStudents at Imperial can get involved\nwith World Water Day by joining in\nwith a variety of events organised by\nImperial Medsin Society. All money\nraised will be going to WaterAid \u2013 an\ninternational charity which improves\naccess to safe water, sanitation, and\nhygiene education by working with\nlocal partners in 17 countries. Events\ninclude a pub quiz (3rd March, Reynolds bar, 7pm), a debate on whether\nthe Millennium Development Goals\ncan be achieved without universal access to clean water and sanitation (5th\nmated that achieving this goal will cost\n$10 billion annually. This sum is only\na third of what we spend each year on\nbottled water, or less than 1% of world\nmilitary funding (2005). The reverberations of improved sanitation will\nbe widespread. According to a study by\nthe World Health Organization every\ndollar spent on improving sanitation\ngenerates an average economic benefit of $7. Financial aid is not the only\nsolution, though.

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 29 February 2008 felix\nArts\nL\nocated on Haymarket, just\na couple of minutes\u2019 walk\nfrom Piccadilly Circus sta-tion, is the Theatre Royal,\ncurrently hosting Edward\nBond\u2019s \u201cThe Sea\u201d. The theatre is housed\nin a spectacular building, designed by\nthe renowned British architect John\nNash (the man responsible for the\nMarble Arch and the remodelling of\nBuckingham Palace). An exterior of\nsix raised pillars hides a plushly wallpapered green interior festooned with\ngold leaf, creating an imposing yet lavish location to view a performance.\nHowever, it seems slightly anachronistic for these grandiose surroundings\nto be used to house Edward Bond\u2019s tale\nwhich is, superficially at least, a simple story of the intricacies of bucolic\nexistence.\nThe plot opens with a shipwreck\ncausing the death of a much-loved\nmember of a small community; this\nis presented with the screams of seamen and the laughing presence of\nnone-more-insane local draper-come-lifeguard behind a semi-transparent\nscreen onto which the image of a\nturbulent sea is projected. Although\nthis may seem clich\u00e9d, the deafening\ncrashes of thunder juxtaposed with the\ndelirious laughter of Hatch, the draper,\nform a dramatic opening to what is a\nslightly muted storyline.\nThe audience is then introduced to\nthe populace of the village: a cast of\ncaricatures which tend to exist only in\nplays about rural communities.\nMatriarchal figure Mrs. Rafi, played\nby the impeccable Dame Eileen Atkins\n(recently star of Gosford Park and TV\u2019s\nCranford), leads the women of the village in both etiquette and morality.\nForever correcting the behaviour of\nher sidekick Mrs. Tilehouse (Marcia\nWarren), in a manner similar to that\nof Hyacinth Bucket and neighbour\nElizabeth in the \u201cclassic\u201d British sitcom\nKeeping Up Appearances.\nAlthough that comparison may seem\nderisory, there are some genuinely\namusing scenes, not least the rehearsals\nfor a local amateur dramatics produc-tion. Naturally the play is scripted and\ndirected by Mrs. Rafi who (of course)\nfeels the only appropriate choice for\nthe lead role is herself. Backed by some\ndrippy, useless younger womenfolk,\nmost notably Jilly (Emma Noakes),\nshe tries to conduct herself in the way\nshe feels that a woman of her status\nshould.\nIn a slightly predictable scene towards the end of the play she confesses\nthat she has spent her life bossing\nabout others, as this is what is expected of her as a respected woman. She,\nsomewhat egotistically, feels they need\nher. This clunky scene is transformed\ninto a poignant lament by the faultless\nAtkins.\n\u201cThe Sea\u201d, the only play designated as\na comedy by Bond, bases its humour\non the absurdities of the restrictions\nof social class and etiquette. Despite\nits being set in Edwardian Britain, it\nis clear that these issues were just as\npresent in the 1970s when the play was\nwritten, as indeed they are today.\nThe tragic nature of the main plot\nconceals this, and some may term it\nas a dark comedy. It is the descent into\ninsanity by Hatch the draper, played\nexcellently by David Haig (of \u201cFour\nWeddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cThe\nThin Blue Line\u201d fame), that provides\nsome of the biggest yet most poignant\nlaughs. On the surface, his descent is\ntriggered by the incessant whining of\nregular customers Mrs. Rafi and Mrs.\nTilehouse, who repeatedly request obscure fabrics only to reject them on\ngrounds of quality.\nA standout scene, even in an overall\nperformance of such acting quality, occurs where Hatch, his mind warped by\nboth the scolding of Mrs. Rafi and conspiracy theories of alien invasions, rips\nup several rolls of expensive fabric, effectively guaranteeing his bankruptcy.\nWithin the suffocating strict morality of the small community, some\ncharacters come through and speak\nto the audience of their fights for personal freedom. Evans, an eccentric old\nman with more than a gentle fondness\nfor alcohol talks to the survivor of the\nshipwreck, justifying his choice for a\nsolitary existence by the sea away from\nthe village\u2019s prying eyes.\nThe play ends with a discussion between these two characters and the\nsailor\u2019s widow, before the sailor (who,\nas expected, falls in love with the wid-ow) offers to take her away from the\nvillage, the constraints and the hier-archy. An abrupt end means we never\nThe fantastic Eileen Atkins and David Haig. Hatch the Draper desparately tries to sell Mrs Rafi some more of his hair.

Noble as these points are,\na slightly unoriginal and banal plotline causes a few cringes for the audi-ence. The abrupt ending mid-sentence\ncomes across not as a salient point\nabout the issues involved, but rather as\na childish attempt at originality.\nDespite these criticisms, the fantastic\nacting throughout leads \u201cThe Sea\u201d to\nbe a highly enjoyable evening out, and\na slightly more challenging view than\nthe more commercial fare available in\nmuch of the West End currently.\nThe Sea is on until the 19th April\n\n"

    "content": "16 felix Friday 29 February 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nI\nam not a portrait person. I much\nprefer my landscapes. Give me\ncows, grass, rolling hills, and\nsheds any day. Not today. I was\nnot in the mood to stand in a\nroom and to be watched by people\nsulkily staring out of their portraits at\nmy poor taste in jumpers. Maybe that\nstatement is a little self-centred but\nthat is genuinely how I felt about the\nPhotographic Portrait Prize Exhibition\nthis year. It neither inspired nor interested me\u2026\nThe Photographic Portrait Prize annually showcases the work of very talented photographers, be they amateur\nor professional. The standard of photography was mostly very high. For\nothers, I couldn\u2019t see any real talent.\nThere was an over-abundance of girls\nstanding in generic blank locations,\npouting. There was no particular emotion you could read on their faces and\nno story behind the portrait, as the\nblurb suggested. It was just a portrait,\nand certainly didn\u2019t deserve to be in\nthe National Portrait Gallery, in with a\nchance of a prize.\nThankfully, it wasn\u2019t all dull and\nhomogenous. The strange light effects present in some of the portraits\nwere rather intriguing, and when this\nis done well in black and white, it is\nreally impressive. There is a brilliant\nblack and white of Ian McKellen looking very tired, bored, and in need of a\ngood shag.\nThe best portraits, I thought, were\nthe ones in which the subject was actively doing something and not just\nposing for a camera. When we go out\narmed with our cameras, the best photos are always the ones where we have\ncaught people off their guard. These\nare always the most unusual. It was the\nsame with the PP Prize. The most characteristic faces were caught in spontaneous shots. One that particularly\ncaught my eye was the small Ukrainian\nboy during his break in a boxing class\nlooking haggard and old, despite being\nonly 11 years old.\nI was thankful that the winner of the\n\u00a312,000 prize had not just portrayed\nhis grumpy girlfriend in suburban\nLondon. Jonathan Torgovnik showed\nJoseline Ingabire, a victim of rape\nduring the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\nPhotographed with her two children,\nborn at the height of the conflict, the\nportrait explored the terrible impact\nof the atrocities of war. He used the\nphotographic medium in the best\nway possible to raise awareness of the\nplight of thousands of women abused\nin Rwanda.\nSo there were a couple of interesting\nportraits. Not enough to merit a visit\nto Trafalgar Square, however. I would\nrecommend taking a look at the rest of\nthe gallery as well. I hadn\u2019t been to the\nNPG before, for reasons stated previ-ously. I quite liked the space \u2013 wide,\nopen, and blank \u2013 as it served as a good\ncanvas for the portraits.\nI really liked the shop \u2013 this was one\nof the highlights of my visit. They sold\nsufficient quirky bits and bobs and excellent coffee-table books. I was surprised at how reasonable the prices\nwere compared to the extortionate\nprices at our local V&A \u2013 \u00a310 for a\ncrap pencil, anyone?\nOn heading to the bookshop downstairs for solace after the disappointing Portrait Prize I found a small ex-hibition: Shutting Up Shop. Despite its\ngloomy outlook on the future of Britain\u2019s independent shops, this exhibition lifted my mood considerably.\nIn 1972, photographer John Londei\nstarted taking pictures of small independent shops the length and breadth\nof Britain. These were often family-run businesses, well-established in\ntheir local communities: the butchers\nand bakers, button makers, cobblers,\nfishmongers, and chemists of our high\nstreets.\nOver a fifteen-year period, he photographed 60 shops. In 2004, when\nhe retraced his steps and revisited the\nshops he\u2019d photographed, finding only\nseven of the 60 were still in business.\nSmall thumbnails on the blurb show\nus that these shops have now been replaced by \u2018Delight Kebab\u2019 or a Marks\nand Spencer.\nProud proprietors are pictured outside their enterprises, such as Frank\nGedge, owner of a contraceptives shop\nopened in Stoke-on-Trent in 1935.\nFeast your eyes on that! An entire shop\nof condoms! Zip-up, spray-on, extra\nlarge, midget willy, armored truck\u2026\nIn fact all the portraits are as fascinating as this \u2013 the old, jumbled, friendly independent shops of 1972 show\nreal charisma along with their proud\nowners.\nMost of the shops that closed could\nnot survive when larger chains and\nsupermarkets exponentially increased\nthe competition. Why go to individual\ndirty, muddled shops when your local\nTesco stocks the same for half the price\nand half the quality?\nHave faith, however. In 1972, John\nLondei photographed a couple who\nowned a shack on the Isle of Lewis in\nthe Outer Hebrides. They sold homemade Harris Tweed. The portrait\nshows them stuck in the middle of\nnowhere with just a telephone box for\ncompany \u2026 and they are still at it.\nShutting Up Shop is a real gem, portraying people proud of what they did.\nA long way from the meaningless portraits upstairs in the PP Prize, this exhibition shows something of substance.\nSomething that is perhaps lacking in\ntoday\u2019s consumerist society.\nFortunately, the Photographic\nPortrait Prize exhibition ended on\n24th February. Shutting Up Shop\nis still on, however, until 5th May\nin the Bookshop Gallery. Admission is free.\nSuch a charming little girl with her first victim\nPerhaps the wrong writer to send to this exhibiton, Rosie Grayburn didn\u2019t like portraits and still doesn\u2019t\nA plethora of pictures of people in\nthe National Portait Gallery\n\u201cIs your sex life lacking something? Try our wonderful range of Rubber\nJonnies to put on your dongle.\u201d We need more shops like this!?\nALICE\n&\nFISH\nBY\nDAVID\nSTEWART\n\u00a9\nDAVID\nSTEWART\nCONTRACEPTIVE\nSHOP\n,\n1983\nBY\nJOHN\nLONDEI\n\u00a9\nJOHN\nLONDEI\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nForget the Oscars, they always save the best awards till last\nPromotional still from Thelma and Louise: 20 Years Earlier\nNights is Lost in Translation\nFor a filmmaker who has been screen-writing since the early 80s and directing for almost as long, My Blueberry\nNights is an awful move. Let\u2019s just get\nthat out there now, because I don\u2019t\nwant anyone getting caught up in the\nodd bits of praise I\u2019ll give it here. Although Wong Kar-Wai is probably best\nknown globally for the relatively recent\nIn the Mood for Love and 2046, he is\na successful and respected Chinese\nauteur. Sadly, in this, his first English\nlanguage film, it turns out that some\nthings just don\u2019t translate.\nFatal Error No. 1: Having Norah\nJones as the protagonist. Like so many\nbefore her, Norah hasn\u2019t seemed to\nrealise that acting and singing are not\nsimilar skills. In fact, despite having an\ninteresting voice, I don\u2019t even remember her really trying to sing, although\nI never went looking for it. Her performance here is horrible (although\nnot consistently as bad as her first\nfew scenes) and her character thinly\nwritten to become a whiney, one-dimensional bore. Given that the plot\nof the movie is her trekking across the\nUS meeting various personalities, this\ndoesn\u2019t make for a fun film.\nFatal Error No. 2: Using the bigger names in the supporting cast to\nMy Blueberry Nights may look like haute cuisine but ends up a total dog\u2019s dinner\nfill more interesting, but very minimal roles. Natalie Portman is probably the best of the bunch here, albeit\nwith a southern drawl of an accent that\nfeels like every sentence may end in\n\u201cYee-haw!\u201d. Eugh. Better that than the\nequally drippy waiter (Law) who keeps\ntrying to get in touch with drippy\ntrekker after one night of meeting her,\nor the horrendously underused Rachel\nWeisz who just shouts and cries a bit,\nalthough looks great doing it.\nF\ninally, it\u2019s over. Awards season has been and gone, and,\nstarting with Sundance and\nBerlin, the Festival season\n(which technically lasts until\nLondon in October I suppose) has tentatively begun. Sadly, as we do not live\nin either Utah or Germany, it means\nthat there is very little in the way of\nnew releases coming your way over the\nnext few weeks. Damn.\nIn the end, the Oscars did find some\nkind of redemption in their choices.\nWhile everyone else was complaining\nabout it being too predictable, I was\npersonally thrilled by the two major\nupsets of the night in the actress cat-egories, and I\u2019d prepared myself for a\nCoen sweep for the main awards. It\nalmost makes sense, I suppose, given\nthat the voters got so much stick last\nyear for giving it to over-the-hill Scorsese. There must have been part of\nthem that thought this year, \u201cIf we\u2019re\nnot careful, the Coens will stick to this\ndownturn in quality and we\u2019ll end up\nwishing we\u2019d given it to The Ladykillers\u201d . In that case, better give it to one\nof their films that has received good\ncritical responses overall in case another one never materialises. Hopefully\nScorsese comes out with a masterpiece\nnext year and shows them they should\nhave held out that little bit longer.\nGiventhe pretty widespreaddistribu-tion of awards, one of the most amusing\nthings to come out of the whole thing\nis that The Bourne Ultimatum walked\naway with the second highest number\nof awards. It\u2019s a great film, granted, especially in a year that showed a blockbuster isn\u2019t as simple to make well as\neveryone thought, but I imagine the\nAcademy wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see\nit steal the ceremony. Not that it did,\nit simply raised questions over what\nis the difference between Best Sound\nEditing and Best Sound Mixing. Oh,\nand has now paved the way for Matt\nDamon and Paul Greengrass to sign\non for a fourth installment. Quit while\nyou\u2019re ahead, guys.\nOther highlights? An all-American\nshutout from the acting categories, the\nfirst since 1964, could rank up there as\nevidence of xenophobia waning. Mind\nyou, three of them won for American\nfilms. And I\u2019m still not entirely sure\nwhy Javier Bardem was such a good\nthing, much in the same way that\nFrances McDormand\u2019s Best Actress\naward for Fargo was perhaps a slight\nexaggeration. Those Coens must really\nhave something that I don\u2019t get at all.\nAnswers on a postcard if you can explain it in less than 20 words.\nThe most ridiculous part of the\nwhole experience, however, is that\nwinners only get about 45 seconds to\nspeak before the strings kick in and\ntheir spotlight moves. Why? So they\ncan play some promotional film about\nhow great the ceremony is? To fit in\nanother $10 billion ad break? It\u2019s all a\nbit Cinderella - Go to the ball, but leave\nby midnight. And don\u2019t drink. And you\nhave to walk in glass slippers. And then\nbe asked to try on one glass slipper you\nstupidly left behind, after half your village has already tried to get into it. Better off staying at home, really. No?\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nFatal Error No. 3: Taking subtle directorial motifs and shoe-horning them\ninto every second of film until another\nslow-motion, out-of-focus, neon-lit-street shot makes you think the projector has jumped back a reel. Yes, it looks\nbeautiful and it\u2019s something a bit dif-ferent, but the sparse use of techniques\nlike this that was noticeable in Mood\nfor Love, etc, was sufficient.\nAs far as this final flaw goes, it\u2019s really\nnot such a biggie, and given the banality of the story, it may come as a relief\nto have some pretty colours to look at.\nAt times though, it seems that Kar-Wai\nmay have had a lot of trouble getting\nhis point across to his English-speaking\ncast, which raises the fish-out-of-water\nquestion that pervades international\ncollaborative cinema. Maybe he realised this as well, and decided to build\nup a portfolio of nice shots instead. Either way, this says more about cultural\ndifferences than Sofia Coppola could.\nMy Blueberry Nights \u2605\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Wong Kar-Wai\nWriter: Wong Kar-Wai\nLawrence Block\nCast: Norah Jones,\nJude Law,\nNatalie Portman\nAlex Casey\nJust to be difficult, Felix has decided\nthat it isn\u2019t completely happy with the\ndozens of awards that were doled out\nover the past two months. Given the\nless-than-positive review for No Country For Old Men (2 stars) that graced\nthese hallowed pages, it\u2019s not hard to\nimagine a general grumbling within the\noffice walls, and so in order to rectify\nthis, the Felix Academy have decided\nto dole out some of their own ditties,\nwhich after hours of painstaking cog-turning have been named the Felixes.\nAnd so without further ado, the\nnominations are...\nBest Picture\nInterview\nThe Bourne Ultimatum\nI\u2019m Not There\nThe Darjeeling Limited\n4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days\nWith none of the frequent Best Picture\ncandidates in the running, the field\nwas thrown wide open here, with the\neventual winner being: Interview.\nBest Director\nPaul Greengrass (Bourne)\nTodd Haynes (I\u2019m Not There)\nPaul Thomas Anderson (Blood)\nJulian Schnabel (Diving Bell)\nCristian Mungiu (4,3,2)\nHere it goes to Paul Thomas Anderson, robbed by the Coens of every major prize until now. Masterful storytelling that outweighed the avant-garde\nleanings of some of the other contenders in the field.\nBest Actor\nDaniel Day Lewis (Blood)\nViggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises)\nTommy Lee Jones (Valley of Elah)\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman (Savages)\nEmile Hirsch (Into The Wild)\nDamn, Day Lewis snatched another\none, but Mortensen gets a special mention for being so overlooked amongst\noverrated competitors, Johnny Depp\nand George Clooney.\nBest Actress\nSienna Miller (Interview)\nAngelina Jolie (Mighty Heart)\nMarion Cotillard (La Vie En Rose)\nJulie Christie (Away From Her)\nAnamaria Marinca (4,3,2)\nMore recognition for hitherto forgotten Marinca (4, 3, 2) and the surprisingly excellent Miller (Interview), but\nthe final winner is Marion Cotillard.\nAnother kick in the face for Julie Christie who looked like she\u2019d been belted\nround the face on Oscar night when\nthey chose the French girl.\nBest Supporting Actor\nCasey Affleck (Assassination)\nTom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton)\nHal Holbrook (Into The Wild)\nCasey Affleck, no contest. Mo show-boating, no undue sentimentality, yet\nstill a masterful portrayal of the young\nRobert Ford and his adulation for idol\nJesse James. Unlucky for Javier not to\nglimpse even a nomination. I\u2019m sure\nhe\u2019ll be crying his eyes out. With his\nOscar in one hand, and Penelope Cruz\nin the other. Dick.\nBest Supporting Actress\nTilda Swinton (Michael Clayton)\nCate Blanchett (Elizabeth)\nCatherine Keener (Into The Wild)\nDespite early indications that said\nBlanchett would walk away with it,\nTilda Swinton pips it at the last mo-ment, riding a wave of momentum\nAt the suggestion of running the technical awards here as well, cries of protest were heard and so the coverage for\nthis year must stop now. Further office\nfavourites seem to lie with The Darjeeling Limited for Best Soundtrack\n(especially after someone has been\nplaying the Juno one on loop so much\nthat overkill isn\u2019t sufficient) and Best\nDrama with a Country House and Ridiculous Dunkirk Tracking Scene goes\nto Atonement. It had to get something.\nThis is Britain after all...\n22 felix Friday 29 February 2008\n\n"

Does it represent your views?\nOver the coming weeks Imperial College Union\u2019s (ICU) Higher Education\nFunding policy will be finalised, dictating the Union\u2019s governmental lobbying strategy on behalf of its students.\nThe policy is being reformulated after\nUnion Council decided that the previous policy \u201cin favour of free education\nfunded entirely by the taxpayer [was]\nunrealistic.\u201d As a consequence, Council called for a wide-ranging survey of\nthe student body to be carried out to\ndetermine what students wanted. The\nsurvey was carried out this term and,\nfollowing analysis, a finalised new policy is under discussion.\nHowever, criticism has been levelled\nat the survey and its contents accusing it of bias and for being confusing,\nbadly designed, and \u201cpoorly thought\nout.\u201d The survey has also come under\nfire for questions that were not asked\nand sections of the student body that\nwere completely ignored (such as international students).\nIn response, Felix carried out its own\nsmaller survey to ask students face-to-face about this important issue. The\nresults appear to conflict, with 52% of\nour 54 student sample answering \u201cyes\u201d\nwhen asked: \u201cDo you think Higher\nEducation should be free?\u201d whereas\nonly 25%-30% of ~440 students gave\nanswers that appeared to indicate support of free education in the HE Survey. This disparity may be partially due\nto the manner in which the question\nwas posed (Felix\u2019s questions were far\nmore direct than the official survey),\nor our small statistical sample; nevertheless the results pose the question\nof whether the Union\u2019s Survey is truly\nrepresentative of Imperial students\u2019\nviews.\nAnswers from the Union\u2019s Survey\nare being used to formulate its latest\nHigher Education Funding policy. Policies democratically mandate the Union\nand Sabbatical Officers to lobby government and other institutions to fight\nfor students on the issues that concern\nthem. The previous ICU policy was to\ncampaign for free education and the\nabolition of top-up fees. The latest policy intends to combine the statistical\nanalysis of students\u2019 multiple-choice\nreactions to various statements regarding funding (strongly agree, agree,\nneutral, disagree or strongly disagree)\nwith further comments added by individuals in the relevant section of the\nquestionnaire.\nThe current draft of the new Funding policy resolves to oppose targets\nset by the Government to increase the\nnumber of students entering Higher\nEducation; to support Top-Up fees\ncapped at \u00a33,000; to oppose the mar-ketisation of Higher Education; to\noppose a Graduate Tax; to support\ninitiatives aimed at establishing a credible funding model based on the cost of\nteaching and value of the degree course\nto society and the economy; and to defend universities\u2019 rights to determine\ntheir own bursary packages.\nCriticism has been levelled at the\nsurvey from many directions but regardless of the survey\u2019s quality this is\nthe only measure of student opinion\nthat exists for the Union beyond the\n30-40 people that turn up to Council\nand the Representation and Welfare\nBoard (RWB; made up of the welfare\nand department reps) which are responsible for this issue. Therefore it\nis the results of this survey that will\ndictate the Higher Education Funding policy of ICU, and thus represent\nthe views of IC students\u2019 at a national\nlevel.\nTo make your views known, turn\nup to RWB on 10th March or\nCouncil on 17th March. Alternatively, contact Felix on news.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk or contact\nDeputy President (Education\n& Welfare) Kirsty Patterson on\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk.\nAndrew Somerville\n& Tom Roberts\nSilwood Park\u2019s green glowing greenhouse\nThe following beliefs are paraphrased from the Union\u2019s draft of its\nnew Higher Education Funding policy. Students are encouraged to\ndiscuss the points below and contact the DPEW, Kirsty Patterson, if\nthey think they should be changed or wish to comment on any of\nthem. Imperial College Union believes:\nThe \u00a33,000 top-up fees cap should remain and it will oppose any targets to increase that figure and that the current funding model is the\nfairest\nThe government\u2019s target of ensuring 50% of School Leavers go onto\nHigher Education is detrimental to students and the entire country\nVocational training should not be offered at university but on the job\n(apart from exceptions such as medicine/dentistry)\nThat education is not free and that all taxpayers should not bear the\nburden of educational funding\nHigher education is a privilege not available to all and therefore students should be expected to make a contribution to the cost of their\neducation\nIf students did not contribute to the cost of their education drop out\nrates would increase and resources would be invested in students\nwho will not benefit from a university education\nA market in higher education would discourage students from socioeconomic background to apply to better universities\nGraduate tax is unfair as students from Imperial would pay more for\ntheir education than students with less worthwhile degrees\nThat not all graduates continue into high paying jobs and that those\nwho enter academia/research/the public sector should pay back less\nmoney than graduates who earn more money\nTuition fees paid by students should go directly to the institution at\nwhich they are studying\nStudents from low income backgrounds should receive financial aid\nfrom the government\nThere should be fewer, better-funded places in science, engineer-ing, maths, english, humanities, languages and arts and that funding\nshould be allocated according to the cost of running the courses\nInstitutions should have autonomy over the bursaries they give students but must meet a minimum national standard\nKey points from the Union\u2019s draft\nHigher Education Funding policy\nLeft, the greenhouse containing the contamination. Right, the no-go area sectioned off with bamboo sticks.\nThe make-shift warning notice reads: \u201cRadioactive contamination present between canes. 6.12.07\u201d\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nStudents at Imperial College\u2019s Silwood\nPark campus were alarmed by the\npresence of a sign inside a greenhouse\nwhich had \u201cradioactive contamination\npresent between canes. 6.12.07\u201d written on it. Pictures sent to Felix show\nthe warning notice next to some dead\nplants bordered by bamboo canes.\nThe students were worried about the\ngreenhouse\u2019s proximity to the campus\ngym and feared that the contamination\nmay have been linked to the nuclear reactor housed at Silwood Park.\nThe contamination was actually the\nresult of a plant uptake experiment\ninvolving the radioactive isotope Caesium-137 conducted by students four\nyears ago. The greenhouse was closed\nafter the experiment had finished but\nrecent College plans to re-open it led\nto the contamination being discovered\nafter necessary routine investigations\nwere conducted.\nThe discovery was made in December, hence the creation of the warning\nsign and the date marked on it, by a\nprofessional health physics company\nemployed by College. Felix contacted\nCollege Communications about the\ncontamination, although we were unable to talk directly to people from\nSilwood Park itself, who said it \u201cis of\na very low level and there has never\nbeen a risk to human health or the\nenvironment.\u201d\nHopefully the students won\u2019t have\nto wait decades for the Caesium-137\nsample to decay since the health physics company is working to analyse and\nremove the contamination by the end\nof April. The Environmental Agency\nhas also been made aware of the situation and is satisfied with the procedures so far.\nSo, next time you\u2019re in Silwood Park\nand your forearms suddenly double in\nsize, your chest expands popping the\nbuttons on your shirt and your teeth go\noff in all directions, it\u2019s probably something that\u2019s been slipped in your drink\nrather than nuclear contamination.\nThe government will review the Top-Up Fees cap in 2009. ICU\u2019s revised\nHE Funding policy supports the \u00a33,000 cap but opposes an increase\n\n"

I was in my own\nworld, busy trying to shrug off idiotic\nvisions my mind kept conjuring of wild\ngangs with machetes, running around\nto the sound of jungle drums. Being\nthe product of popular culture from\nBritain this was proving a difficult task,\nespecially travelling as I was, alone and\nwith manifold luggage.\nI felt a pang of genuine fear as this\novernight open-window coach journey\nfrom the Ugandan capital Kampala\ncame to a halt, after many hours, in\na dusty open patch of land in Kigali.\nThroughout the journey, the TV onboard was playing a Celine Dion DVD\non infinite repeat and as I got ready to\nalight, I remember trying to force the\ninfuriating Titanic theme tune out of\nmy head. French and Swahili were the\nlanguages of choice here and there was\na slim chance that a shared enthusiasm\nfor Celine could act as a trans-lingual\nicebreaker.\nAnyway, the fear was in expectation\nof being taken advantage of, of being\nhassled and harassed as one would expect in other big cities, namely Mombasa or Nairobi, but what I got was the\nopposite.

My\npride was hurt.\nAfter forcing myself upon the closest taxi man, I made my way to a hotel\nand then to a swish modern shopping\nmall in the centre of town. Gradually\ngetting acquainted to the surroundings\nand the exchange rate, I realised that\nKigali was not a cheap place. Actually\nRwanda was not a cheap place. In fact,\nRwanda was nothing I or you or most\npeople would assume.\nOkay let\u2019s be honest. We have all\nbeen thinking about the genocide\nsince I mentioned Rwanda and it was\ncertainly all that I had been thinking\nabout during my initial days there, but\nhaving visited it, I want to impress on\nyou how much more there is to Rwanda than just that.\nIn the brief week and a half I spent\nthere I started at the village of Kinigi\nand its Silverback Gorillas, the same\nfamily group that Dian Fossey herself\nstudied as depicted by the \u2018Gorillas in\nthe Mist\u2019 film, before venturing into\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo. I\nthen re-entered Rwanda in the south\nand travelled back up to Kigali, in the\nprocess touching upon most of the\nsmall country and its major towns and\ncities.\nA quick overview of what I got up\nto would include seeing chimpanzees\nand troops of up to five hundred Colobus monkeys in the dense, hilly, misty\njungles of Nyungwe Forest National\nPark; seeing fruit bats the size of men\nin Kibuye; trekking the stunning chain\nof Virunga volcanoes; visiting the engrossing National Museum in the\nuniversity town Butare; and of course\nenjoying the sights and sounds of the\ncapital Kigali.\nSet on a series of hills and valleys,\nKigali is perhaps my favourite city in\nEast Africa after Kampala. It is clean,\nbeautiful and possesses a great mix\nof bustle and sophistication, being a\nshining example of how Rwanda as a\ncountry is becoming more safe and de-28 felix Friday 29 February 2008\nbearing on society and was a monumental event in recent history, hence it\nis important to try and understand this\nphenomenon.\nTo do so, the best place to start is the\nKigali Memorial Centre. Set up by the\nAegis Trust, it is located on a quiet hill\noverlooking the centre of Kigali and is\norganised into a few dimly lit corridors\nthat the audience can walk though,\ntaking the history in.\nThese corridors detail the background of the genocide; of how the\nintroduction of ID cards under Belgian\nrule led to previous socio-economic\nmeasures becoming ethnicities, i.e.\nhow originally someone with ownership of more than ten cows was known\nas a Tutsi and less than ten cows Hutu,\nbecame known as Hutu or Tutsi due to\ntheir height, width of nose and eyes.\nThe Belgian rule went on to purposefully regard this newly-defined race\nof Tutsis as superior warriors, giving\nthem the most powerful positions in\nsociety, effectively sowing the seeds of\nresentment in pursuit of a divide and\nrule strategy. The result of this process\nthe whole world saw when it culminated in the 1994 genocide, where mostly\nTutsis were massacred by Hutu militias leaving piles of inanimate corpses\nlittering the Rwandan streets. This,\ncombined with the inaction from the\ninternational community and the UN,\namounted to more than one million\ndeaths and countless physical and psychological injuries that still persist.\nAs I walked through the Kigali MeMy team of chimpanzee trackers in South Rwanda\nveloped. It offers pleasant walks along\nits main boulevards and avenues, giving great views of the exciting suburbs\nand the lush evergreen, hilly farmlands\nbeyond. I personally really enjoyed the\nviews it offered at night where distant\nhills would fool me into thinking that\nstreetlamps were stars; and I also loved\nthe food, taking delight in one of the\ntastiest Indian meals ever at the \u2018Indian\nKhazana\u2019 restaurant and great pizza at\n\u2018New Cactus\u2019.\nFinally, one should not leave Kigali\nwithout having visiting the actual \u2018Hotel Rwanda\u2019 where heroic hotelier Paul\nRusesabagina acted infamously to save\nmany innocent lives. It was hard to\nimagine what most of us have seen in\nthe film happening there now, amongst\nsuch serenity, which brings us nicely\nback to the topic we had just purposely\noverlooked - the genocide.\nAlthough it is no good to compart-mentalise Rwanda solely into the\ngenocide box, it obviously had a huge\n\u201cNobody could\ncare less that I\nwas there, not\neven the taxi\ndrivers!

Or maybe this is just fictitious propaganda to justify the pricetag?\nT\nhese days, you\u2019re unlikely\nto find me wandering\naround College without\na lump of black hanging\nover my shoulder.\nA digital SLR camera, or DSLR, is\n\u2018one of them big black ones\u2019. They\u2019re the\nweapon of choice for everyone from\nkeen students to paparazzi, reporters\nto motor racing photographers. They\nare the key to good photography, and\ngive you status, a badge of office, as\nsomeone who can Take Photos. They\ncome in all shapes and flavours, and\nif you\u2019ve ever been tempted by their\nhunky looks, there\u2019s no better time to\nget involved.\nWhy should I care? Compact, or\n\u2018point-and-shoot\u2019 cameras, are designed to sell. They slip into your pocket and take party snaps. If you\u2019re lucky,\nonly most of your photos are blurry,\ndark, or all orange. Your ugly friends\nwill appreciate the blur and your pallid CompSci friends might like the tan,\nbut if you want them to come out nice-ly, you\u2019ll have to rethink things.\nOK, so I\u2019m being harsh. But even\nwhen your shiny silver camera is advertised as being fantastic, and has\n128 advanced scene modes including\n16 porn modes and Endless Creative\nPossibilities\u2122, you can still only expect\nreliably sharp photos in bright, low-contrast environments, and they might\nnot look quite like you remembered.\nSo what does a DSLR do? It gives you\nIMAGE QUALITY, and, more impor-tantly, FLEXIBILITY.\nImage quality? Know how a film\ncamera works? It\u2019s got a load of optical\ngubbins that shines your picture onto\nthe film in the back of the camera, and\nthen the film slides along for your next\nshot. Guess what: a digital camera is\nnearly exactly the same. It\u2019s just got a\nchip where the film would be. The size\nof this chip, or \u2018sensor\u2019, sets compacts\nand DSLRs apart. A compact camera\u2019s\nsensor is about as big as a tooth, and a\nDSLR\u2019s is as big as a big stamp. Each\npixel, while still tiny, is much bigger\nand is much more sensitive to pretty\nthings like light and colour. Result: better photos, in lower light, with better\ncolours.\nThat\u2019s only part of the story. The image quality isn\u2019t so much about the sensor at all. Quality is really in the LENS.\nIt MAKES how sharp your shots are,\nand how good your colours are. The\nsmall plastic affair in a compact camera\ncan\u2019t really keep up, and there\u2019s only so\nmuch you can enlarge a photo before\nit looks all soft and rubbish. The most\nbasic DSLR lens destroys it, and suddenly pictures have attitude, a punch,\nthat you never thought possible.\nThis is essential. Megapixels: bol-locks! A compact camera with a zillion\nmegapixels is a fraud; if the lens can\nonly produce a picture with 3 megapixels of detail, as is typical, having an\n8-megapixel sensor is a waste. Still, 3\nmegapixels go a long way. It\u2019ll make a\nlovely 6\u201dx4\u201d photo, or even a respectable A4 enlargement if you don\u2019t study it\nwith a magnifying glass. My DSLR has\nonly a 6-megapixel sensor, but because\nof DSLR lens quality, I get to use all 6\nmegapixels. Even then, the difference\nbetween 6 and 10 megapixels is very\nsmall (it makes photos only 1.3 times\nbigger) and so really very few people\nneed lots of megapixels. Ever.\nFlexibility? If all the quality is in the\nlens, then surely the camera doesn\u2019t\nmake so much difference? Right. That\u2019s\nwhy DSLRs are a little bit like electric\nwhisks. Press the little round button,\nand the lens pops off! Why? So you\ncan get another lens out and put it on\nthe camera, of course. Your other lens\nmight be able to zoom in so far you can\nwatch your neighbour getting changed,\nor it could be able to take amazing\nclose-ups of fleas jumping between\nsugar crystals, or it might be as big as\na dinner plate so it can take good pictures in low light. A creative photographer might change lenses as often as a\ngolfer changes clubs, as the need takes\nthem, or they might not. Soon enough,\nthough, you\u2019ll be wanting to buy yourself a plethora of lenses for a plethora\nof occasions. Long ones, fat ones, it\u2019s\nwhat a DSLR is all about. Generally\nspeaking, any camera can use any lens\nby the same manufacturer, or a lens\nmade by a third party and dedicated to\nyour make of camera.\nAny camera usually does an awful lot\nof thinking before taking a photo. It has\nto consider lots of things and if it gets\nthem wrong, the photo will be rubbish.\nHow bright is the scene? Which bit of\nGeneric lens photo used to fill whitespace number 1\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFriday 29 February 2008 felix\nScience\nL\nack of sleep can increase\na child\u2019s risk of becoming\nobese, according to research\nscientists at the Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of\nPublic Health, Baltimore. The inves-tigation, known as a meta-analysis,\nwhich led to this conclusion was published in the February edition of Obesity, the official journal of The Obesity\nSociety.\nLed by Youfa Wang, the scientists\nreviewed the epidemiological data of\n17 published papers, 11 of which were\nused for statistical analysis. A significant association was found between\nsleep deprivation and obesity in children from the ages of 3-15. The definite reason for this is not yet fully un-derstood, though a couple of proposals\nhave been made by the research group.\nIt could be that the lack of sleep results\nin the child being more tired during\nwaking hours and hence less active, resulting in a reduced amount of energy\nbeing used. It could also simply be that\nthe child is awake for a longer period\nof time and therefore has more opportunities to eat; thereby taking in an\nincreased number of calories, over the\nrecommended daily allowance.\nThere is some variation in the advice\nof how much sleep a child needs. The\nresearch group used the recommendations that children under five require\nat least 11 hours per day, children between the age of five and ten require at\nleast ten hours per day, with children\nover ten requiring nine hours or more.\nThey found that those not meeting\nthese targets (falling at least two hours\nbelow the recommended amount)\nwere at an enormous 92% higher risk\nof suffering from the disease compared\nwith those that slept for longer. Furthermore, the risk of a child becoming\nobese was found to fall by 9% with each\nadditional hour of sleep.\nWang and his colleagues have considered the possibility that the association has a behavioural basis as opposed\nto a biological one, with physical performance having more of an influence\nthan internal biochemical processes.\nThis possibility is given plausibility,\ngiven that the link was significantly\nhigher in boys than girls. It has been\nsuggested that the ways in which the\ndifferent sexes spend their late additional waking hours could be what\nis contributing to the problem, with\nboys stereotypically playing computer\ngames and hence not being very active\nwhereas girls are expected to spend\nmore time socialising and generally be\nmore energetic. It must be noted that\nthis suggestion has only been hinted at\nby Wang and does not have any strong\nscientific backing as yet.\nBiology, however, must not be completely ruled out. Certain hormones\nhave in fact been shown to play a role\nin the process. Lack of sleep has been\nassociated with lower levels of both\nleptin and ghrelin, two hormones that\ninfluence appetite. A drop in leptin\nspecifically has been shown in the past\nto cause an increase in hunger.\nThe number of children suffering\nfrom obesity is swiftly increasing, leading to the threat of a global obesity cri-sis. This is especially true in the United\nStates where there has been a 3.3% increase in the number of children who\nare clinically overweight, over only a\nfive year period. The obesity epidemic\nis also a problem in the UK where 1 in\n10 six year olds suffer from the ailment\nand are consequently at risk of some\nmajor health problems, such as high\nblood pressure and Type II diabetes,\nconcurrent with the disease. Wang\nmade clear that a \u201cdesirable sleep behaviour may be an important low cost\nmeans for preventing childhood obesity and should be considered in future\nintervention studies.\u201d\nThe Hopkins study also noted that\nit is not only sleep duration that is important but also sleep quality, with the\nlead author of the paper commenting\nthat with regards to obesity risk it \u201cis\nanother important area where future\nresearch is needed.\u201d\nAvoid obesity: get some sleep!
