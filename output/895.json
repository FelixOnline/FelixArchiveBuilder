    "content": "Health Centre\nThis stall is concerned with the services\nthat the Health Centre has to offer. There\nwill be a representative present who can\nadvise students on many matters\nincluding family planning, abortion,\nsexually transmitted diseases and many\nothers including:\nTesting for HIV\nWhen the body is infected with AIDS, it\nreacts by producing antibodies which can\nbe detected in the blood. If a test\nproduces a positive result, the person is\nsaid to be antibody positive, i.e. HIV\nPositive. However, a negative result does\nnot necessarily mean that a person has\nnot got the virus. Antibodies take, on\naverage, 2-3 months to develop, so if you\nthink you may have contracted AIDS\nover the last few months it may be too\nearly for them to show up on the test.\nThe decision about whether or not to\nhave the 'AIDS Test' needs careful\nthought. Just having the test, whatever\nthe result, can affect your chance of\ngetting life assurance. If you feel that you\nwould like to have a test, for peace of\nmind, you can discuss it with the\nrepresentative from the Health Centre.\nThe Smear Test\nCervical Cancer kills 2,000 women every\nyear in the UK, with the vast majority\nnever having had a cervical smear test.\nThe disease is however, nearly always\npreventable, which is why it is so\nimportant that any woman who has ever\nhad sexual intercourse should have a cervical smear test.\nThe earlier you start having sexual\nintercourse, the greater the risk of\ndeveloping cervical cancer. Using a barrier method of contraception, like a condom or diaphragm, every time you\nhave sex will help to protect the cervix\nfrom possible infection by viruses, and\nmay thus reduce the risk.\nCancer of the cervix can be prevented\nif changes in the cells which precede it\nare treated. A cervical smear test will\ndetermine whether the cells are normal\nor not and if the smear is 'abnormal'\nfurther investigation will take place. It is\nvery important that women have regular\nsmear tests every three to five years\u2014so\nif you would like to find out more about\nhaving a cervical smear test the\nrepresentative from the Health Centre\nwill be able to advise.\nNightline\nNightline was formed twenty years ago\nby students at Imperial to provide a confidential listening and information\nservice for students. Today we cover\nmost London Colleges and Polytechnics\nwith our volunteers being recruited from\nall these Institutions.\nThe service that we provide every\nnight of term from 6pm to 8am is two-fold; firstly we will listen in a non-judgemental and non-directive manner\nproviding you with a chance to sort out\nhow you feel or what you want to do\nwhen faced with a difficult situation;\nsecondly, and of equal importance, is our\ninformation service on anything from\nWhat's On in London or train times to\ncontraception issues or late night\nchemists.\nCall us any night of term on 071-436\n5561 (the number is on your Union Card)\nor, if you want to help then see us at the\nfair.\nAlcohol\nWhat's wrong with having a drink now\nand then?\n-Probably nothing, if that's what it is\u2014\nhaving a drink now and then.\nThere are many reasons why we drink.\nMost people say they drink to enjoy\nthemselves and to help them relax with\nfamily or friends..Others say* they drink\nbecause there's nothing better to do, or\nthey're depressed. It could be anything.\nDrinking is all about being sociable, but\nit depends on how much and why you\ndrink. If you don't go over the limit then\nyou probably can be more lively and\nfriendly. But it's obvious, usually at a pub\nor party, who's had too much to drink\nbecause they really aren't worth talking\nto! They either make total idiots of\nthemselves or end up in a fight.\nIf you want to enjoy drinking you need\nto be aware of when you've had enough?\nCounting your alcohol 'units' is a good\nway to watch your drinking habits. Find\nout more about alcohol and the limits at\nthe Health Fair. There is also a computer\nanalysis game on alcohol which, with\nyour unit control score, will tell you what\naffect your drinking is having on your\nbody and your pocket.\nIMPEtlAL\nCOLLEGE^ Healthy Lifestyles\nTuesday 26 Stress Relaxatio\n'Scoring'\n\u2022 l2 pm SCR\n7-1 l pm Lounge\nWednesday 27 Welfare Quiz 8-10pm Lounge Bar\nThursday 28 Health Fair\nStress Relaxatio\n12-2pm JCR\n\u00bb 5-6pm SCR\nFriday 1 Health Fair 12-2pm JCR\nGiving up Smokhg 3-4 pm SCR\nStress\nDo you suffer from any of the following\nsymptoms?\n1.

The Health Fair has a stall completely devoted to stress, come\nalong and talk to an expert or to one of\nthe stress relaxation sessions that have\nbeen organised.\nSmoking\nThere is no magic way of giving up\nsmoking. People find their own ways to\ngive up, but many ex-smokers, bot ji heavy and light smokers have found this\ngeneral advice helpful.\n1. Prepare yourself. Think about when\nand where you usually have a cigarette.\nOnce you've stopped smoking, these\ntimes and places are going to be the\ndanger spots, so work out how you are\ngoing to deal with them.\n2. Pick a day: Set a target day for giving\nup. Make it a day when you will not be\nunder much stress.\n3. Stop. Give up and don't smoke any\ncigarettes. Take one day at a time. Every\nday without a cigarette is a success.\nIf you want to pick a day to give up\nsoon, March 13th is 'National No Smoking\nDay' and sponsor forms to give up\nsmoking on that day are available in the\nUnion Office. All money raised will go to\nRag.\nNine out of ten ex-smokers gave up\nentirely on their own. But if you've tried\nbefore and found it very difficult you\nmight find one of these aids helpful:\nNicotine Chewing Gum (available on\nprescription only) other chewing gums\nand tablets, acupuncture or hypnosis, you\ncould also come along to the Giving Up\nSmoking Seminar on Friday.\nHealthy Eating\nA brief guide to healthy eating:\n\u2022Cut down on fat, sugar and salt\n\u2022 Eat more fibre-rich foods\n\u2022 Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables\n\u2022 Get plenty of variety in what you eat\nBut how do you know if your diet is\nreally healthy and how do you set about\nchanging your diet. This stall has\ninformation and advice to help you\nimprove what you eat. There will be\ndisplays showing the nutritional content\nof popular foods and food available in\nCollege, and also free recipe leaflets.\nExercise\nWhy bother exercising?\n\u2022Exercise helps you feel good in body\nand mind\n\u2022It's good fun\n\u2022It helps you feel energetic\n\u2022It helps you relax\n\u2022 It helps you stay slim\n\u2022It keeps you supple\n\u2022It helps strengthen your muscles and\njoints j,. \u2022It helps your heart work more\nefficiently, improves your circulation and\nhelps protect against heart disease\n\u2022It gets easier the more you do\nThese are just some of the reasons for\nexercising.

The philosophy is to\n^courage students to look after\nim selves but not to preach to them.\nEvents organised this week are lively and\nvaried.\nThe week kicks off with a stress\nrelaxation session today. Although not\ntraditionally regarded as a health hazard,\nstress can be a contributory factor to\nmany forms of illness. The session will\nhelp to counter stress by showing\ndifferent relaxation techniques.\nThe Contagious Theatre Company will be\ncoming to the Union this evening to\npresent 'Scoring'. Contagious have\nperformed at many sites as varied as Hull\nUniversity, Wolverhampton Polytechnic\nand Pentonville Prison. The Independent\npraised 'Scoring', stating that \" The laughter of the audience is like a great\nriver breaking its banks\". Scoring is a one\nand a half hour charge through the blood\nstream that blasts alcohol and drug abuse\nto insignificance with a buzz that is\nunforgettable. It carries no Government\nHealth Warning, has no ill side effects\nand is completely non- addictive.\nThe main event of the week is the\nHealth Fair which will be situated in the\nJCR. There will be a variety of stalls\nadvertising healthy activities and services.\nMore details of this are given inside. All visitors to the fair will be given a \"goodies bag\" containing a range of\nhealthy products courtesy of Flora and\nMates, amongst others. The Health Fair is\non Thursday and Friday from 12-2 pm.\nTry to get along to the Welfare Weekit's educational, it's fun, it's free!\nScoring\nScoring is a one and half hour charge through the blood\nt f~>e am that blasts alcohol and drug abuse to insignificance -|V/ ith a buzz that is un forget able. Scoring carries no\nGovernment Health Warning, has no ill side-effects and is\ncompletely non - addictive.\nThe show is based on five characters and begins at The\nBench which is the last piece of furniture at the exit of a well - known rehabilitation unit. It is a place where highly\ndramatic lifetime decisions are made to drop out or'to\nremain with the programme. From this point the characters\nare introduced through flashbacks to reveal their interwoven\nhistories. Subject matter is dealt with using dramatic\nsequences, but also dance and music to a background of\ntape/slide effects.\nOur research is based on information, including case studies,\nfrom the Campaign Against Drug Abuse, Therapeutic\nI Communities, The Police, Terrence Higgins Trust and other\nagencies that Contagious has dealt with previously.\nThe project combines a high level of entertainment with\n, essential information that approaches the subject with hope,\nI optimism and humour. Scoring represents an excellent night\nout in contagious style.\nDesigned to respond to the concerns of young people on this\nissue, the show attacks notions of fashion ability and\nglamor is ation of alcohol and drug abuse.\nI Scoring does-not take the judgemental view, but offers\naccurate and supportive information so that young people can\nmake responsible choices about lifestyles and behaviour.\nit\nTuesday26 th Feb\npresent\nI'.n ion Lounge\nTickets \u00a31.00\nAvailable from\nId Office r Doors open 7.30pm ROAR!
