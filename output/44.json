    "content": "FELIX PROFILE JOHNS. HARDING\nAlthough President of the H.C.3.; nd\nSecretary last year, John Harding is also well known as a leading member of the Dramatic Society amongst whom he is more readily known as \" Willy\" after his celebrated performance. But the Society' s recent choice of play, \"The Jealous Wife\", was hardly the opportunity for its cast to enjoy the fun and games expected in an eighteenth Century Comedy, and John, as the dissolute and\nleisure d fop Lord Trinket, was not given full employment in his parting appearance for the\nSociety. Willy is a difficult person to analyse beyond the first observation that an artistic bent( in a. creative not precious sense) is a greater element in his character than is plain force. He keeps in mind many fluent ideas and\naccurate comments on events, but he is reluctant to thrust them forward too quickly in public. One is therefore surprised a this success in the\nR.C.S. Union, as well as in our entertainment world. On occasions these two interests suit each other's demands well, but on others we find that his speeches at receptions are more serious than suit their function. These perhaps lack rehearsal, though rehearsal alone did not produce the acting of Willy in \"Off the Record\". He\nhas truly produced such effectively timed and\ncomplete characters on our stage that we have\noverlooked the concentration and work involved, and we have begun to assume that he should mould himself to a foreign nerveless character at all times. Kr esher s will have met him at receptions, and some Chemists will have known him as the demonstrator who put out their earlier experimental fires; but even these, together with his appearance at Union meetings, and the facts of\nhis life do not add up to the whole Harding. Commonsense he may have gained from being tossed\naround in wartime evacuation, and from taking Mat ric at a Co-Ed. school. Success in obtaining a Royal Scholarship came after two years in a school of boys only, and he came to the R.C.S. Chemistry Department in1948 at the age of\nseventeen, a year earlier than he expected. He\nthus missed his turn as Head Boy at Schools here\nis the link that has lead to his being Head Boy\nof the R.C.S., and also to his profession of\ninterest in industrial administration now that the spell of research is coming to an end.\nHe admits with defensible cheer that his abrupt change from school to I.C \u00ab left him with social commitments at home ( Ilford) including production of a concert party, that together with Finals in the second year left him effectively a Brown Bag gera tI.C. for so long. He\neventually passed from a mild interest in the Rifle Club via a second in the seconds in Finals to research and the Dramatic Society. He has maintained his interest in singing and\nsailing, and must be rare in hawing read all but one of the books on Show in his considerable bookshelf. His predecessor as President of R.C.S., Brian Pur slow, is the essential link between his career in the R.C.S. Union and in College entertainments.\" Certificate X\" and the R.C.S. Smoking Concert at which it was presented last year were their productions. John was also concerned with David Greenfield and Bernard Latter in their attempts to build up an I.C. Revue. John has now to work on his thesis, and has\ngiven up dramatics. This is his third postgraduate year, and he hopes that his research on go me extremely organic sulphur compounds,\nwith their unpleasant chemical and social problems, will ao on be completed. It is an odd\ntruth that for all his Union interests, John manages to parcel his time so well that he may\nmost surely be contacted in the laboratory. This is quite a reputation to maintain. The Play Notices in\" Phoenix\" are the best summary of Willy' s success. Following his first appearance in \"The Ascent ofF.6\", came the part that gave him his nickname in\" Off the Record\", and which he considers his favourite individual character. In\" Thunder Rock\" came his greatest part, which he chooses as his favourite dramatic opportunity, and then the American businessman in \"Summer Day's Dream\" at Cheltenham.\" Phoenix\" had these things to say of two\nof them:\n\" ' Thunder Rock' was a redoubtable success... the acting was ef a uniform excellence that held the audience in tingling silence through the Producer's daring dramatic pauses. Charleston, the escapist light housekeeper, was admirably played by John Harding, whose .\ncontrolled and restrained portrayal of any inward struggle with \u00abci\u00abU* lent unity and conviction to the play.\" J f\" Off the Record\"' Phoenix' says: A great deal of our enjoyment\" flowed from the part of Flag Lieutenant the Hon. Willy Aught on Formby, R.N., exquisitely underplayed by that \"dam' fool\" John Harding. He balanced himself with willow ly grace on his sword, he swayed\ngently to starboard when he would move to port, he searched his breast pocket for the massive volume of\" Burke\", and he heard of miracles on\nthe telephone with vacuous in comprehension.

C.had a strong team it was\nthought U.C. would be ira strong position to c ha]ler ge, however the winning margin was even greater than last year. I.C. scored41 points to King's7 C, whilst U.C. came third with73. The low to taj of points was due in the main to the fine running of the last two men in the team; Woods and Hu x ford, who came 1 3 th. and 1 4 th. Since the' first three of the team run for the Universit h they are expected to do well, and hopes were fulfilled when the fina i placings were Robertson2 nd., Pain4t h.,and Bailey6 th. It bodes well for the future of the Club that four of the team we refreshers. R.C.S. caused a minor surprise by beating Guilds1920 to win the inter college champi or ship w,hich is held in conjunction with the U.I. Champ ion ship. Several Miners were stirred out of their subterranean tunnel* by the enthusiasm of their captain, James, and the Mines fielded a team.\nLack of training told, but in spite of this aer all s nt effort was made.\nClimbing r LAKE DISTRICT MEET.\nThe I.C. ii..C. Xe&s meet w:.s held at Butt.er mere in a hut, the journey to which was traversed on\nf jot in virgin snow on a very dci.rk e vp ning. On the first day a precedent was set for late arrival when as a\" training\" walk three en thus i ants walked over Lh'andre th and the Gables to Scafell F ike. The return journey v. as completed slowly in wintry::. on light over Black Sail Pass and\noni.i th Gup.\nn, ach day someone would\" get up at T\"a.m. to make\nbreakfast and so quite early parties of3 or4 would>\nset off in all directions. The climbs were mostly high up and so covered in snow and ice. Consequent^ as much hill walking was done as rock climbing. New Year's Eve was celebrated in the usual way,\nbut next day there was as light hangover. This was\npurged by an ascent of White less Pike. As the sum.iit was approached the wind became stronger, the rain turned to snow and the party entered the clouds. Under these conditions it was decided on an immediate descent but six masochists continued along the ridge to Grass moor where the summit was found only with difficulty and nearly minus one pair of bags. The next day broke without a cloud in the sky. Parties set off by different routes with Gable\nas the goal. On the summit a wonderful view was\nbeheld of snow covered hills across these a( Arran and Ji. Ireland perhaps). A large party went to find\" a piece of vert io ali ty\" and having round it progressed up it ratner sio wi y, not \u2022\nregaining the summit until9 p.m. On their way\nflown they were met by a rescue party. However,\nthey didn't need rescuing' and the walker who was\nto be rescued was not found he had got himself down it transpired so everyone, returned whence\nthey came.\nOn the last evening the assistance of the Fire Brigade was needed. In a usually quiet valley this caused some local excitement and a few yokels came to See the fun, only to find that it was a smouldering beam beneath the fireplace and easily extinguished when the fireplace had been smashed to pieces. Long before the last morning had dawned most of\nus were on the way home with thoughts once more\nslipping into the regular grooves of term time. Squash ON TOUR\nOur first match, against Cardiff University, proved rather a disappointment after the long and arduous drive down from London; without F. Kenyon, our N p.l string, and with A.

The trip to Torquay provided us with an\nexcellent interlude at the.. lan or House r\"ot el, where we were complimented by a\" local\" for averaging7 skittles; we feel that we could never have enjoyed ourselves so much at this hotel, had we known what was in store for us\nat the i..:.o.A. at Torquay. The muffled( and sometimes not so muffled; oh ras es that floated out thru' bedroom doors the next morning were,, we hope, drowned by the object that caused their utterance; at b:3o in the morning we were awoken at tent i ute intervals; by a drumstick being struck on our doors and a large gong, alternately; Hughes, you Tjlapohe.u er!

Martin the b left us, and we motored on to Sx mouth to defeat the Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club by 3-2; the evening, as a whole, proved very disappointing to finish up with, but we\nwere justifiably feeling pleased and tired, and returned to London to enjoy the festivities of Christmas.

    "content": "fF LIX PHOENIX AUTUMN TERM ,1952\nWe all feel a touch of pity for faded gentility, for those unfortunates who are forced, in the evening of their lives, to live in circumstances far removed from those of their heyday. When the same situation applies to a magazine, founded sixty seven years ago in the days of Progress and\nOptimism by a literary scallywag, and growing respectable with age (as did the scallywag himself in those broad traditions which turn the filth of Chaucer and Boccaccio into\" classics'' when the original freshness of their exe res c en ces has been glazed and hallowed by\" time}-, we are indeed sorrowful. Not that I would ever suggest that Wells or Phoenix is, or has been, filthy; iI mean\nrather that it is foolish to hold the 'magazine in undue veneration simply because it was started by one who later became recognised as a Great Writer. But even the veneration may turn to anger anger at being rooked for1/6. What little there is, is good: but the dull, clogging f actuality of the Review section overpowers any literary content Phoenix may have. Mess rs Goss and Cohen have handled the Sport and\nSocial Club sections effectively the former having been admirably, outspoken though over profuse of exclamation marks, and Mr. Cohen maki nga chunk of unreadable fact barely readable, a creditable result with auch unpromising material. That four:; departing professors should simultaneously require\" profiling\" was tough luck on\nthe Editor, bound as he was to do his duty. The\nfour resulting accounts are valuable in that they represent the sort of lives the best of us may\nhope to lead; but they are not literature. In the circumstances, the Photographic Exhibition account might have been cuta little, to make the Review less bulky, though it was well done. The\nsame applies to the Dramatic Criticism, a rapier sharp analysis presented with a bludgeon of typical Wearnesque prose. In the field of original literary composition, the very bones ef Phe a nix, it% a jg a shock to find Selby Angus in temporary( we hope) retirement. The resulting gap was partly filled by a disjointed though amusing story by Vere Atkinson in t style so typically student like that it often parodied itself. Bute good deal of gap still gaped. Equally self conscious in style, an\nenon j nous article on Judo came off very well, better,. than the opening o eu vre, a piece of frippery about Rectors. A descriptive incident about mountaineering by\" J ad\" gave me the impression that trie * rite r was reliving a vivid experience; but I was unable to share it with him in spite of subtle, but over copious, detail. Phoenix suffers from high costs, from.. the\nobligation to print a, lot of routine fact, from student apathy, perhaps even from the presence of FELIX, which exhausts the literary capacity of a number pf potential contributors. It is subject to extraordinary delays, like that which made the issue under review appear at the end of term instead of at the beginning, to lose in consequence the major part of a valuable\" fresher\" market.

In the right spirit for an X 'mas presentation was George Colraan 's 'The Jealous Wife', pre sen ted by the Dram Soc. on four consecutive nights. By some obscure criterion,, the opening 'Mines'\nnight was pronounced to be \"above the usual stan' dard*; it is definitely true, however, that the dialogue could actually. be heard at times. The\nthird night produced an unexpected change, as the leading' lady, Julian Stern, was indisposed. The\nstand in Jean Osborne carried on very well, with occasional aid from SHW's best falsetto through the wings. The production was very well planned and executed, and all the characters were well interpreted Special mention must be made of the polished Lar'y Free love and the foppish Lord Trinket t( Guess who?\nJohn Harding'.). The costumes were true to the 18\n1 8 th century atmosphere^ arid T the st^ g j*ma rag\"e \u00a5enT\nwas excellent.' The man in charge, Harry Pakei\",\"\nonce made an impromptu appearance on the stage obviously< t back room boy who wants to get ahead li is how business.) In plays of this nature, a little overacting is always welcome and there were some scenes wh i oh^' delightfully bordered on the fare ical. The dial o gue did not call for any finesse and there w was\nnot much on the stage. The humour may appears low to an audience used to the machine gun wisecracking of Bob Hope and Groucho Marx, but it must be\nremembered that the play WaS j written at a time vr tien people had far more leisure. There is no\ndoubt whatever that the Dram Soc made the best use of material at their disposal. They took a chance on a risky revival and were successful entirely due to their. own merit. Well done, boys'.\nRAO JIM BAND\nI.Q.

    "content": "4 FELJX\nLETTERS TO At this time of year Iso end more time than I would wish in rendering student^' technical texts into English, so I must object to the ideas expressed by\" A.R.B.\" in\" Viewpoint\" in your issue of Dec. l? th, if only in self defence. I have\n\u2022 little e nou eh time for correcting inadvertent errors: I have none whatever for deliberate ones\nof the kind put forward by\" A.R.B.\" With apparently characteristic modesty,\n\"A.R.B.\" couples his own name with that of G.B. S.( putting his own first) as are former of our spelling. He does not seem to realise that Shaw's spelling was an idiosyncrasy tolerated by most people in one of the foremost wits of the age. If the citizens had wished to adopt this spelling they would have done so already. When \"A.R.B.\" attains Shaw's standard of wit, and exhibits Shaw's mastery of English, he will be able to get away with Shaw's spelling. Then, and not before. It is absurd for\" A.R.B.\" to assert that millions of people have helped to develop the English language, and then name only two of them.\nMany persons would be hard out to it to name more\nthan twenty such developers. And there can be little doubt that the popular Journalist has atleast as much influence as\" li it e hall in the development( so to call it) of the English language at the present time. Incidentally, does\n\"A.R.3.\" include\" W.S.C.\" among his providers of\" Ministerial platitudes and evasions\"? Further on, \"A.R.B.\" tells us that he occasionally misses out\" redundant\" vowels. I can assure him that there is a much more numerous comp any that always misses out what it thinks to be superfluous consonants. I spend too much of my\ntime in restoring the second\" m\" to \"accommodate\",\nin the texts referred to above; this particular error appears also in the advertisements in your issue of Dec. 1 2 th. Even more time is spent in altering sentences to read singular or plural throughout: duplicity of this kind in provided by\" A.R.B.\" at the end of his third paragraph. The answer to\" A.R.B.\".' s final question must\nbe, I fear, \"Yes, you are\", if only because it is not clear in which direction\" A.R.B.\" has taken his s teo. His spelling inclines occasionally to!r. Shaw, but his use of\" frustrate\",\" differentiate\",\" reactionary\" and\" redundant\" shows that love of the overworked long word which marks so\nmany of our popular journalists. It is usually agreed that the object of most\nwritten work is to persuade the reader to acc eot the statements of the writer. To do this, the text must conform to the usual standards( not necessarily the grammar-book standards) of grammar,\nspelling and punctuation. If it does not, the reader will be irritated, and if he is irritated he will not be persuaded. So that the writer who\nuses fancy spelling and punctuation goes some way\nto defeat his own proper object, which is the persuasion and conviction of his readers. Yours faithfully\" File pusher turned Pen pusher\" A.R.B. replies: Apart from personal remarks,\" F.T.P'\" s argument is not very convincing. My article was written to justify my practise of writing\" cant, dont, wouldnt, and isnt\" in serious prose. To dismiss these expressions as\" deliberate mistakes\" is to beg the whole issue.

It: nay once have been of Medieval design but it t as demolished during the war. The present building i a a' veil built, in oder n structure, excellently proportioned, and therefore a delight to gaze upon, being generally oi an outstandingly attractive appearance. Its warmth and friendliness contrast vividly with the surrounding filth and gloom of New Cross. Your article was correct on one point howe ver, our women do resemble the building in the above respects. Xo u should therefore, air Editor, be much more\ncareful to ensure that your data has been proved by sound and constant observation. It is asad reflection upon the standard of accuracy maintained by this country' s future scientists.\" i ours Sincerely, Ardent Followers of Le Corbusier.'\"* In case your scientific minds are unable to a pn re cia te the connection, we feel bound to give the following explanation. Both Le. Corbusier( the great French modern architect), and ourselves feel that the most important things in life are\"\" air, light, sun, foliage, space, science(?), liberty, intimacy, isolation and beauty.\" Sir, As you say, Sir, in your Editorial in a recent \u2022 issue, the General Studies Lectures rare a great boon to us, but there is a danger that, like T.V., they will demand little conscious effort from the students. However, they area means of stirring up a large proportion of our college undergraduate population that was never possible by the small numbers involved in a Touchstone weekend, and in the practical numbers that can attend Dinner in Hall to advantage. lw oui a suggest that, lu rt ner changes are made\nin our student habits aimed at making undergraduates constantly aware of the irresponsible status in future society, and I can think of no\nmore appropriate measure than the apparently retrograde step of introducing undergraduate gowns, and requiring these to be worn at all lectures. The cost of simple gowns would be well repaid in the saving of wear on clothes, and the appearance of the college at Commemoration and other assemblies would be vastly improved. A gown Is an excellent pen wiper. It is also a protection against lecture theatre draughts, and, against the light rain of the seasons. Yours etc,3H.. POLITICAL SOCIETY REPORT. Reviewing the activities during the past term of the\nPolitical Society and its constituent groups one realizes \u2022that students do not give this important society sufficient support. The real aim of the Pol.S oc, of which all students are members, is to interest and inform students in the vi\u00abws of the political parties. The society started the term with high hopes and a full program le, but lack of support caused a number of discussions\nto be cancelled. The first item on the Pol.S oc, programs\nwas the annual Freshers tea held in conjunction with the lit. and Deb. Soc.\nThe following day the Conservative Group held their A.G.M. where they elected officers for this session, drafted\na constitution, and arranged to hold a series of discussions.\nDue to lack of support only one was held. This was on\n\"The future of the Labour Party'.' The number present was\nless tn an half a dozen even though open to all who wished to attend.\nThe Socialist group fared slightly better, holding three\nmeetings. The first of them, was addressed by Gordon\nSchaffer on \"German Rearmament'.' As he had visited Germany\nseveral times in the past few years he could talk from\npractical knowledge. On November 7th the \"Problem of Kenya\"\nwas discussed s this was led by a Kenya student so that first hand knowledge was again available. The Liberal li ro up, the smallest., did not hold any\nmeetings during the term. A joint meeting at I.C. with the\nU.L.

The natural History3 oc. held their usual party.. t the end of last tern. The highlight was an\n' oratorio presented by the Rex Dadd Philharmonic Orchestra and the II.II. Choral Society. Father Christmas, thinly disguised as Dr. Murray, distributed prizes ranging from wet kipper to a potato and a lump\nof sugar. Otherwise, we have little news to offer. It is rather late for us to herald the arrival of Professor P. i..3.ii lack ett, who \u00bba \u00bb appointed at t ne end of last term to head the x hy sics Department in place of Sir G.P. Thomson, who is now Master of Corpus Christ l. Cambridge. Mr. J.C. Match ies on has been appointed to the Chair of Lining, and Professor A. J.3. Pip p ard has taken over from Professor Will is Jackson for another three year term as Dean of Guilds. A rather hastily collected I.C. debating \"team\nwas defeated on the second day of term in the first round of the 'J. L. Debating Tournament. Drawn at home to Westminster College, I.C. proposed\" that conscience is an unmitigated nuisance\" and although i the team appeared fully convinced by their own\narguments, the result was a win for Westminster by\n64 to55 debating points. On Friday Jan.16 th the I.C. Conservative Group\nheld a debate with the Royal Holloway College Conservative Society on the motion that \"The Women of today are more masculine than those of yesterday, and\nthe Men are more feminine.\" A lively discussion was\nheld on the comparison between the two sexes in such things as choosing hats and coats, and the clothes worn by them in history: men having perms today: such women a sEo ede oia: the lack of women in Parliament in spite of the efforts of Mrs Pankhurst: and womens1 rug ger and soccer teams in Lancashire. The motion was defeated4 For and 6 Against with1 abstention. The debate was followed by an expedition to the Strand Theatre to see \"The River Line\" which was a great success. On Saturday, the ter psi chore an year began with an Informal Dance run by R.C.S. Union. The organisers are to be congratulated upon giving a VB ry enjoyable evening and upon decorating the Gym in a novel( and inexpensive) fashion. BE A DEVIL COME TO THE CARNIVAL FRIDAY IJ \u2122 FEE195} At aD OUt the same time the lamps which illuminate the imposing steps leading from Prince Consort Road\nto the statue of the late Prince Consort were\nsubjected to an even more repellant attack. They\nwere coated with pieces of perforated paper, each one\nle li cat ely coloured, so that a dignified and charging/ ict or ian terrace became a pan to mine piece, garish and vulgar. Again, one of these papers( and Heaven 'mows who was low enough to procure such material) was marked with a figure29. Speculation is rife. Whispers of Mau Mau and\nthe K lu Klux Klan.^ re common, but Authority believes bhat the Red Menace is more likely to be o..t the bottom\nof things. Members of R.C.S. Union have different ideas. CARNIVAL SUCCESS.\nThis year's Guilds1 Carnival\" fiesta\" was\nmuch less like Bok-Bok, or an Eton iv all game, than previous affairs. The decoration scheme was\nambitious, and mightily successful in the Gym,\nwhere the essential purpose of making familiar places look freshly different was achieved best. The downstairs decoration ideas also deserve men-. tion, particularly the detail of turning the Refectory doors into bookcases, out t ne overall effect was incomplete for lack of more materials and curtains; and lack of assistance. In fact, as is too usual, the whole affair appeared to be\nunderconstruction by a total of twenty people, and the volunteer party to clear it up numbered\nless than half that. However, perhaps the organizers of Carnivals have begun tC learn the. lesson that they can rely only on their immediate friends. The judging of the costumes dragged on too long, and everybody had different ideas from the harassed judges. After the lesson of hired cabarets of the past two years, Guilds produced a better amateur show, largely their own, that was received with attention and applause. If their subjects, of student contribution, were excursions near the old and hoary, atleast they were done with wit and\npresented with a light air. The Spanish dancers who topped the bill had already limbered up early \u2022in the evening, but were still much the Anglo Saxons that most of them were - until they got warmed up again. They were worth every minute that their soloist, Miss Rosalind Philips, was on\nthe floor. The President of Guilds neatly evaded the demands for a Calypso, throughout the evening.

They were a model to those who\nclam our to some release of spirit, in arag. So Professor Powell has been prevented from doing at on r of German Universities. Well, well, well'. Watch your passports. It has been suggested that there should be a Woman's Column in FELIX. What about it. ICWA? We\ncan't write it, but you can.

JtJHCH TIME GENERAL STUDIES LECTURES. **TA correspondent,\" Rufus\", writes:\" First one must decide whether or not these lectures are good in principle,' and secondly whether, if they are, the practice is equally good. Perhaps: some people's lives are such cultural deserts that it is permissible to play all hell with college hours,\n( against the wishes of a majority of students) In order to bring them to some realization, however dim,\nof their place in the universe. And perhaps, this being admitted, cultural! z ation will be achieved by a succession of lectures which are fashionable, even\nwhen trivial, and non controversial, even when\nsuperficial. I really cannot say, but speaking personally I have given up going to the lunchtime lectures. when they invite Edward Glover or John Piper Is hall change my mind again,\" FELIX plans to enquire into suu a ent opinion on\nthis matter.

VIEWPOINT' 'We won't have a formal meeting, just a talk among friends, and we'll get through the business in hand much quicker.\" This is a common enough\nsentiment in the college today, and it is equally common for these meetings to take two hours or more, and end with the business still not done.\nWith most members of the college having less than no time to spare, it is surprising that those who convene these meetings do not attempt to run them in a businesslike manner. Even those who do set up to go about their business in the proper fashion. often fail miserably, either through the inability of the chairman or the lack of cooperation of the members.\nThe job of the chairman is far from easy and\nneeds much practice before it can be performed reasonably well. Allowing for the in experience which is only natural and expected in most\nchairmen of the college societies, is it too much\nto expect them to get aqa a in ted with the elementary procedure for conducting a meeting? How many of them have read Sir Walter Citrine' s book on \"The Art of Chairmanship\"? It is only a small book; the time taken to read it would be\nnegligible compared to the time saved at meetings when conducted on the lines suggested. If it is too much trouble to read a book( and the one quoted is only one of many on the subject), then insisting that only one person speaks at a time would save most of the time wasted at meetings. Only recently a member of one general meeting was making a very sound\nstatement on the matter in hand when he was\nin t erupted by the secretary speaking to someone\nacross the room - about a dance at one of the womens colleges'. An admirable subject to talk about at a more suitable time, but how discouraging for those who want to further the activities of our particular clubs or societies. It is obvious from the above example that we cannot put all of the blame on the chairman. for' ime wasting at meetings. Cooperation on the p \u00a3rt of all members of clubs and societies in s]ea king to the chair, and not having a talk with o]. es neighbour would help the chairman and help o Tir selves. Appreciation of the other fellow's point or view is only possible by listening to his arguments. Tfie obvious advantages of your own ideas can only illustrated in comparison to the others and\ns lich a comparison is impossible without knowledge\nop\" the other persons view. Many people blame their lack of support for vL riou s college activities on shortage of time. Cf ten this is only an excuse, but it is possible that the numbers in all our clubs and societies ay increase if we was tt a little less of th embers' time in badly run meetings.. Signal man.
