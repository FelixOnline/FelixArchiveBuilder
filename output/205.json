    "content": "2 FELIX LETS GET\nIT STRAIGHT!\nTYE ON THE HALLS\nI am getting rather tired of the\ncontinual drum-banging of the\nCameronians from Tizard. Hall.\nThe theme of several recent articles in Felix seems to be that the\nera of Imperial College as a Residential College has arrived and\nthat the Students' Unions have\noutlived their purpose. Furthermore, it is suggested that the social life of the College should be\ntailor-made to suit the whims and\nfancies of the residents.\nMay I suggest, Sir, that before\nthese fanatics become transported\nby their hot air to their Castles\nin Spain, we consider the facts of\nthe' situation.\nFirst some figures on the numbers of residents are shown\nbelow:\nThis article was originaly a letter\u2014however it is strong\nenough to merit art cle status and\nnow\u2014the facts.\nThe figures in the last column are\ncalculated on the basic of 20%\nof residents being post-graduates.\nAt the moment between 15 and\n30% of students in any Hall are\npost-graduate students.\nSecondly, residence is normally\nfor one year. Only 25% of the\ncompliment of any Hall can be\nin their second year of residence.\nThirdly, demand for rooms far\nexceeds supply. The demand for\nplaces was determined by the\nstudent surveys of-1959-60. It was\nSession\nStudent\nPopulation\nNumber in\nResidence\n% in\nResidence\n% of\nUndergraduates in\nResidence\n1963/64 2,985 615 20.3 26.8\n1966/67 3,600 735 20.4 25*\n1973/74 4,700 1,200\nor\n1,400\n25.5\n29.8\n39\n45.5\nfound that 76% of undergraduates and 49% of post-graduates\nwanted a room in Hall. There is\nno reason why these figures should\nhave changed substantially in 4\nyears; if anything they will have\nincreased because the standard of\naccommodation in Hall has increased and rents for flats and\nrooms in London continue to go\nup by leaps and bounds.\nUNFAIR\nThese figures show that Imperial College is not fast becoming a residential college, so that\nany attempt to make the social\nlife of the college revolve around\nthat of the residents will be un-fair. Activities of clubs and societies must be open to all stud-ents, whether they are residents\nor not. The Union must be run\non the basis that all students are\nequal, whether they live1 in Hall\nor not. In this connection we\nmust remember that the location\nof the Halls on the campus is in-ci dental. Should we treat them\ndifferently because they are here\nin South Kensington and not in\nActon or Battersea? I think not.\nUNION CENTRE\nI believe, Sir, that the Students'\nUnion should be the centre of\nCollege Social Life. Any attempt\nto make the Halls t ne social\ncentre of the College should be\navoided. May I quote .two examples from other colleges?\nFirst, at Sheffield, the Union is\nmore or less controlled by the\nresidents to the d is ike of the non-residents. Secondly, Bedford College has about 300 women out\nof 900 in four Halls. The Union\nconsists of one common room\nwhich reverts to the occupants of\nReid Hall in the evening. When\nthe College closes at 5 o 'clock,\nthe nonresidents have nowhere to\ngo. The refectories are not open\nto them; even the library is clos'\ned.\nThe Union executive of two\nyears ago fought hard to bring\nthe'bottom lounges and bar in\nSouthside under Union control,\nso that these facilities were open\nto all members of the Union.\nHow wise they were! Just think\nwhat the situation would be if\nthese areas were controlled by the\n'door-locking' mentality of some\nHall committees above.\nMINORITY INTERESTS\nI am not complaining about\nHalls organizing their own activities. They can cater for minority interests (e.g. the Tizard\nBrass Rubbers), but I do not see\nthe need for societies which have\nexactly the same purpose as imperial College Union societies\n(e.g. The Tizard Hall Folk Song\nClub).\nOne favourite argument for\nthe existence of Hall Soc.e ties is\nthat it will increase participation.\nIt seems to me that the level of\nparticipation is no greater than\nthat of the constituent College\nUnions. For example, the Tizard\nButtery Hour usually only attracts 20-30 out of 120.\n(Cont. next column)\nAN OPEN The idea that having an account with a nation-wide ban* like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank\nTHE GO AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

That the Carnival\nSupplement \"reeks of Bishop\nfrom start to finish\", as 'Anti-yog's so charmingly puts it,\nmay be true; but to blame Mr.\nBishop for this is hardly log-ical.\nMr. Bishop was asked ta write an. article covering\nless than one tenth of the entire Supplement. In 4his article, he described ti publicity stunt in a manner that\nadmirably befits a publicity\nstunt. Due to the susceptibility of others, who possess\nno style of writing of their\nown, Yogi's influence was unfortunately carried to other\npages. But this is the fault of\nthe Editor\u2014surely not Mr,\nBishop!\n'Anityog' desires \"a bit less\nYog\". Well, may I say just\nthis. Mr. Bishop was again\nasked to produce a Carnival Record, which he did. In\norder to sell the Record outside College, he had to spend\na week creating his own publicity around South Kensington and elsewhere because the\nadvertising of the Carnival was\njust not a de qua' e. \"Abit less\nYog\" and there would have\nbeen a heck of. a lot less Carnival since there are people\naround who do nothing for society except criticise the efforts\nof others.\n1 sincerely hope that this\ndoes not include 'Antiyog'.\nYours faithfully,\nM.C.

Of course\nthe Union Is dying\u2014we all\nknow this, and to emphasise\nthis moribund slate of the\nUnion, Felix's columns have\ncarried numerous appraisals of\nsituation. However, I feel that\nmany of these have been irresponsibly written, but I consider the latest article to be a serious and honest attempt to\nanalyse the problem with\nwhich the Union is faced. Further, I feel that it is the truest\nrepresentation of the situation\nthat we have had to date. It\nis certainly powerful and courageous comment to argue that\nthe Union is without leaders\u2014\nbut how true this is\\ This is\nsurely the root of all the\napathy about which we hear\n155551 CENTRAL ELECTRICITY Ijjfyjjl GENERATING BOARD HAVE YOU DECIDED ON YOUR CAREER YET?

The average student,\nand I speak as one, is just not\nencouraged to participate\nactively in Union affairs.\nEvery so often he will be told,\nby his so called leaders, that\nhe fv part of the inert mass\nwhich constitutes th? Union,\nand this Union is likely to\nchange in character unless he\ndoes something about it. I object to being called apathetic\neven if I am, and this sort of\nverbal onslaught is not going\nto entice me to seek immediate membership of clubs and\nsocieties, in fact I shall remain\nas apathetic as ever. Surely it\nis up to the Union officers Jo\ntake the initiative here\u2014after\nall, that is why we have elected\nthem as our leaders. My impression of Council is that it\nis an autocratic hierarchy consisting a set of privileged beings who are particularly anxious to preserve\nthis image. It is a case of\n\"them\" and \"us\", and we are\npoles apart and do not seem\nto be getting any nearer. Before the average student can\nbe encouraged to take an interest in the Union those in\ncharge must sell themselves;\ninstead of this they seem content to strangle both themselves and the Union with infernal red tape. The average\nstudent must be made to feel\nimportant and that he is\nwanted, and is a valuable\nmember of the Union. This\ncan be done with \"inspired\"\nleadership. I feel certain that\nif people are persuaded enough\nthey will support almost any\nactivity. To ensure better response the tendency to restrict\ncertain activities to the favoured few must not be allowed to continue. At present\n\"Mr. Average\" is treated by\nhis leaders with inexcusable\nand almost contemptible in-difference. Until the student\nbody as a whole is treated with\nthe respect it deserves, then\nthere is no hope for the Union.\nIn conclusion, let me make\none point clear\u2014/ do not\nblame Watson, Massey or any\nof the others for the fact that\nthey do not exhibit powers of\nleadership. They are just not\ngiven a chance under the present system. One must respect\nthem for their unselfish attention to the never ending committee work, but as things\nstand now, only a rebel can\nsucceed.\nYours,\nS.G.( an average student who is told\nthat he is apathetic.)

    "content": "FELIX5 THE GODBOTHERERS - A SURVEY R.C's Sorting from the top are the Roman Catholics. They practice at\nthe University chaplaincy, and have a representative on the Union\nof Catholic students: one of the few members of I.C. with speaking\nrights on the N.U.S. Iheir organisation does not appear to extend\nmuch bei ow University level, although proposals are underway for\na College Chaplain, and college Mass. Many of them seem to be\nquite happy with the present situation: after all, they say, the\npriests are the Church and the students must go to them. Also, as\nthe President elect of the Catholic society pointed out, we are now\nliving in a post-ChrisJan era, so what can Catholics do in Che\nCollege? It is to be presumed, therefore, that few converts are made.\nThey are an extremely rigid and the Communist, but this\nsociety, genuinely believing that\nit is not their job to do philanthropic work outside the College,\na though there is talk of super-v sing L.C.C. homework classes.\nThis rather twisted stern-minded-ness undoubtedly stems from\ntheir exceptional y severe serfdom under an extremely Conservative hierarchy. It would be\ntempting to enlarge on the\nsimilarities between the Jesuit\ncomparison highlights the nature\nof their organisation. The\nFrest's ruling must never be\nqi'est'one d( Contracept'on is not\nsett'ed yet, thank God!) and any\nideas that might be supposed to\nfilter upwards from a com par it iv ely fertile College Catholic\nsociety must either be stifled\nvigorously, or stored in some\nlittle \"Kafka-Esque\" room to be\nsampled in many years time.\nThen the College Catholics are\nvirtually forbidden to have joint\ndiscussions on vital topics such\nas the Litany and the Bible with\nother college Christians, although\nthe iron-curtain has been lifted\na little, and joint Bible study\ngroups may be initiated next\nterm.\nANGLICANS\nNext in the scale come the\nAnglicans, represented, if not exactly run, by Father Ivor. It is\ndifficult to evaluate the exact\nnature of his influence over the\nsociety : he seems to be most\npeople's friend and confessor,\nand is a vital secular influence\nwith significant monastic con-nec t ions. Thus the Anglicans, in\nspite of their comparatively\nsevere Church laws, are able to\nbring in excellent speakers on a variety of topics : comment is\nnot restricted.\nCharacteristic of the Anglicans\nis their enthusiastic work outside\nthe college. This is possible be-SteelI S PROGRESS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY One of a line of one-ton vacuum induction melting furnaces. This\nis among the many new techniques of modern steel production.\nSTEEL is now undergoing a revolution in manufacturing methods, in the developments\nnew types of products, in new techniques of application. The recently introduced low\ncost pneumatic steelmaking processes and the invention of continuous casting are but\ntwo examples of this new look in Steel.\nSteel is one of Britain's key industries and the basis of our whole economy. Its technical\nproblems are challenging, its management situations complex, its insistence on quality\ncontinuous.

The feat of\ncollecting for the land rover must make the Carnival organisers green with envy : they gO\nabout their work quietly and\nwithout any gloss, and seem to\nachieve wonders.\nIt is regret able, therefore, that\nin t elect u ally the Anglicans appear to be rather woolly. Most\narguments seem to end in beautifully simple statements of faith :\none wonders if this extends as\nfar as the faith of the Archbishop\nof Canterbury when he states\nthat he expects to meet the Pope\nin heaven. The dangers that the\nCollege Anglicans have to guard\nagainst, therefore, is the spread\nof this complacency; a few\nAnglicans in this College, by\ntheir well drilled Public school\napproach, are doing much to\nharm the image of their excellent\nsociety.\nFELLOW TRAVELLERS\nThe offshoots from the Anglicans are the S. C.M. and the\nChristian Union. Many hard\nwords are spoken about these\ntwo organisations : Father Ivor\nprefers his Anglicans to come to\nSt. Augustines to be Christians,\nwhile the C.U. are way beyond\nthe pale. They are, in fact,\nrather erudite discussion groups\nthe S. C.M. tending to do some\nwork outside the college, the\nC.U. virtually nothing. Actually\nt^eC. U. is a calvin'stic offshoot\nfrom the S. C.M., with a constitution forbidding them to take\npart in other religious organ-is at ions. They are fundamental-is ts, believing that the whole\nBible is nothing less than the inspired word of God. They tn ink and talk, therefore, in a very\nlow-church contact.\nMETHODISTS\nLastly the Methodists, a very\nfriendly organisation, befitting\nthe nature of t nei rden om. nat.on.\nEmphasis on this established\nChurcn is s.ight; they only have\ntn ree communions a term, to\nwhich, inc.dent ally, all Christians\nare invited, although only\nMethodist partake. I hey also\nhave a few open meetings which\nseem to parallel much of the\ndiscussion of the S. C.M., although they are ve fy careful not\nto overlap ,and therefore in any\nway be identified with tn is organisation.\nROY ELLIS\nThis article would hardly be\ncompleted without mention of\nRoy Ellis, for he, more than\nanybody else, has crusaded to\nmake Christianity respectable in\nthe College. He has formed a committee from all the Christians\nin the college with the new sheet \"Contact\" as its emblem. By his\ninfluence, he hopes to avoid\nfurther undignified letters to\nFelix, acting, partly at the public relations man for the Christian\nsocieties. It is to be hoped that\nhe finds a worthy successor.\n\n"

Four years ago the same thing happened.\nThis year the N.U.S. question did net arise, (although it mi gut have\ndone), and next year it may well do again, but it cannot be long\nbefore we will in fact join; it is e nevi table that we should, as it\nwas that women should eventually be allowed into the Oxford\nUnion. Of the many arguments for joining none can concern this\npaper more than the annual N.U.S. \u2014organised conference of the\nstudent press.\nEach year a competition is held for the best student newspaper\u2014\nthis year it was won by Oxford's Cherwell. Our own Sennet was\nplaced third. The competition, however, is but the focus to four\ndays of discussion, lectures, criticism, and advice by leading prof-fess ional journalists. Our own advertising agency. Educational Publicity, is deeply involved, and the whole conference received National\nattention. A recent article in the New Statesman discussed student\njournalism in some detail. Imperial College and Felix were not\nmentioned. They never are.\nEach paper is criticised and editors and staff are invited to question and meet informally with Fleet Street professionals. Since the\nconference was started, more and more interest has been shown by\nthe Press, by advertisers, by professionals and by the Universities\nand Colleges themselves. While others learn from experience and\nhighly qualified sources, FELI X continues in an amateurish and\nclumsy way. We cannot improve because we do not know how.\nThe only advice we get is from ignorant and irritating outsiders. We\ncan only copy without knowing why\u2014to progress we must be told\nwhy.\nTo our cry add that of the Dramatic Society, excluded from a festival of drama which receives wide national publicity, also the\nDebating Society excluded from the Observer Mace competition and\nothers who would benefit from N.U.S. organised functions:\nWe do not get the opportunities we deserve, or the publicity we\nneed, because a few Union minded hot heads would have us remain\n\"a princely cloister\". By competing with the best and learning from\nthe best this College can achieve much that it lacks.\nWE AND THEY Are you on friend iy terms with more than one member of the\nStaff? Have you ever entertained your Tutor at Hall dinner or in\nthe bar? Has any member of the staff showed an interest in you as\na person? If the answer is yes, thrice yes, then you are the except-ion, for staff relations are, at this College, virtually non-existent.\nThe Chemical Engineering Department is perhaps best endowed\nin this field with a pattern of personal and x a demi c tutors leading\nnever to marriage, but often to hall dinner. In other departments the\nsituation is worse and many students feel contact with the academic\nstaff to be nil.\nIn the Union there seems to be an extraordinary attitude of \"we\"\nand \"they\"; with \"we\" to defenceless students, and \"they.\" the\nmonstrous megalomaniac authorities. The administrative staff feel\nthat relations are worse than for many years. One gentleman said\ntentatively that people in the Union tended to follow and be influenced by the small core at the top : another was very much more\nspecific, but the import was the same.\nAlthough Felix has hinted at feuds in the past, Dave Watson\ncategorically denied any such possibility in an article in these pages\nlast term. He talked of \"so much rubbish\" and said \"I wouldnt\nknow it existed\". All quiet on the Union front. Then at Council he\npublicly flays Dr. Cameron, warden of Tizard Hall, knowing full\nwell that the proceedings are to be reported. His lack of tact is\nalarming. If this happens on the surface, we can but guess at what\nis behind the scenes.\nTo talk of the diffuseness and the sheer size of the College provides half an excuse, but the remaining half is really no excuse at\nall, rather a reason.

    "content": "MODS ROCK\nUNION HOPS A number of I.C. students\nhave been attacked without provocation at recent Union Hops\nby certain under si rables. The\nfirst instance was at the Carnival\nHop when five strangely clad,\ndirty-finger nailed louts set upon\nthree students, inflicting a black-eye and a bleeding nose before\nthey could be forcibly ejected.\nTwo weeks later ten similarly attired \"gentlemen\" appeared in\nthe Union Bar where they caused undesirable disturbance and\nannoyance by throwing beer\nabout and by other unruly an-tics. They then proceeded upstairs to one of the dance floors.\nAs a precaution against a repeat performance of the previous\nfortnight a formidable group of\nI.C. muscle men was mustered in\nthe vicinity of the intruders. The\nlatter, perceiving greater opposition perhaps, than they had\nbargained for, commenced to\nwander from one part of the\nbuilding to another in an endeavour to shake off their body-guard, but were unsuccessful.\nEventually, as they passed near\nthe North East of the Union,\nthey were forced into the street.\nDuring the ensuing scuffle, how-ever, they produced heavy spanners which they evidently would\nnot have been very slow to use\nbut fortunately the door was\nclosed on them before any injury more serious than a black-eye had been sustained.\nExtensive safeguards are planned for future Hops to prevent\nare occur en ce and police will be\non hand.\nFRESHER S ISSUE Will societies who wish to in-c 'ude material in the first Felix\nof next term (appearing on\nFreshers Day) let the Editor\nhave it on or before Friday 25th.

The necessity for such a system\nhas arisen out of repeated complaints from the mews residents and\nat least one threatened injunction on Southside.\nEARLY STAGES\nAlthough the whole idea is still in its very early stages, it is\nthought it will not be long before the plan will, in some form, come\ninto operation. Most wardens favour the idea, but emphasise that\nit should be run by the students. At least one warden feels that\nwere the duty officers system tightened up there would be no need\nfor any extra action. There is some talk of a \"Disciplinary Patrol\"\nto be made up of two or three sub wardens, but there are, however,\nmany objections to this, not least of all from the sub-wardens them-selves.\nNOISE PREVENTION\nThe system would operate by\nhaving someone, be he duty of fic er, disciplinary patrolman, or\nprot cor, in and around the precincts in order to stop noise and\nquell disturbances after dark.\nHis powers are not yet defined,\nbut would involve name taking, possible fining,, suspension, rustic-ation, or expulsion, at the discretion of a disciplinary commit-tee. In most cases he would,\nhowever, merely caution, and\nonly on predictable nights of\nheavy disturbance would the\n\"proctors\" be out in force.\nPOLYTHENE DUSTBINS\nIt has for a long time been felt\naround the halls, that some form\nof discipline other than expulsion\nis required. With the increase in\nresidential numbers and the severe threats facing the Southside\nhalls as a result, it is clear something must be done. A proctor i al system operated by students\nwould seem to be the most\nsatisfactory, although other\nsolutions may exist. Mr. Watson\nfavours taking the problem to a Union Meeting for further dis-cus sion. Mr. GraVette's view is\nthat it could all be solved by\nequipping the mews with polythene dustbins. It will not be as\ns. mp le as that, but some light\nform of control now, cou id very\nwell prevent t ne imposition of\ns s riou a restrict.ons at some later\ndate.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nft-Exam Blues ?\nBanish them with a book !\nOver 10,000 to choose from !\nft\nOpen 11.0\u20145.0 p.m. and\nuntil 7.0 p.m. on Tuesday\nand Thursday\nWANTED\u2014Staff for next\nyear's Felix\u2014many positions\nvacant.

They do not make any attempt, it seems, to take\nadvantage of any in teil i gent spirit of enquiry that we, as scientists,\nmust have: furthermore, they have mishandled recent situations\nwhich ,with a bit of thought, could have gone their way. Hysterical\nletters have brought out the worst of their into le rence, and they\nhave probably lost all the respect that years of hard work had given\nthem.\nThis survey intends, by describing these societies, to uncover a fragment of the many influences and ideas that make the College\nChristians tick, and to possibly shed some light on their intentions,\nand the ob s lac 'es they face in the College. |\" Page 51\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3( From p.2. col. 4)\nAt the moment we have a satisfactory equilibrium between\nthe Students' Unions and the\nHalis of Residence. The Unions\nare content to allow the situation\nto evolve its own solution. However, two wardens are trying to\nforce a change. I feel tn at this\nis very dangerous. These two\nwardens want to model their\nHalls on what they like to think\nis the 'Oxbridge system'\u2014to me\nit seems more similar to the\nPublic School House System,\nwith the 'house-masters' in loco\nparent is. LIBERTY ATTACKED\nMake no mistake about it, the\ntraditional liberty of the Imperial College Halls is under attack.\nTne wardens have the advantage because Student Committees\nchange every year. Remember\nthe 'Visitors out by 12.00', 'No\nunaccompanied lady visitors',\netc. Unless the Hall Committees\nstand firm these and other rules\nwill soon some into force.\nI seem, Sir, to have strayed\nfrom the primary point so may\nI once more say that I am convinced that the best place for\nall. student activities is under the\na us pic ies of the Union, and I feel that a strong Central Union\nis essential for t ne wellbeing of\nGORDON\nLOWE S The ideal Shop for\nSPORTS CLOTHES\nand\nEQUIPMENT\nGood Discounts for all\nI.C. Members\n173-174 SLOANE\nSTREET, S.W.1 BEL 8484-5-6\nFAME SOUGHT as\nIt was the last gathering of the gallant band, before they were\nenunciated for the final session by twenty fresh shining faces, and\nthey all seemed to realise it. A last innings, a final chance to establish ones claim to immortality they feverishly racked their minds for\nsome good stirring material. Havard was sober, Schroter wore a jacket, Edwards appeared conspiratorial, and Ellis more worried\nthan usual. It was as though they had awoken to their responsibilities\nat the eleventh hour.\nNO HEROES\nBut glory isn't to be ache i ved in the opening stages of any battle,\nand they could relax at first while Watson-Massey reported on day\nto day affairs. Paintings for South Side, lockers for Beit, chairs for\nthe top long es, repairs, barmen, duty officers. Not the stuff of which\nheroes are made, and at any rate rather bad ground to fidget on, for\nno-one outside the inner magic circle really understood the finances\nof the Union, and they knew it by now. But Parkinson did offer one\nsmall opening, \u00a320 to repair damage to the quadrangle after Carnival. Immediately afterwards no-one saw fit to comment on a letter\nof credit for \u00a32000 from the Finance department. Watson-Massey\nrolled on unchecked\u2014the top refectory is to be re-opened for quick\ncheap self-service meals: the Union has 9,000 sq. ft. to play with on\nCentral Site (any ideas?); two students are wanted for a sub sidi sed visit to Germany\u2014and eventually rolled to a halt.\nover the ground, and appropriately enough it was the Mods\nwho came under fire next\u2014the\n420 or so who attend each Union\nhop. These it was claimed were\ngetting out of hand since the\nbeat groups became so popular.\nThere had been several unpleasant incidents, and we were attracting far too many un desire able people. Also the Union was\novercrowded. Griffiths, the\nChairman of Entertainments,\nwas apparently the only Mod on\nCouncil. We couldnt have our\ncake and eat it, he said, po.n ting to the massive profit from hops.\nNo-one had suspected Havard of\nmod dish tend an cie s but he.p indeed came to the hard pressed\nGriffiths from that quarter, as he\nopened his mouth and put his\nchelsea boot squarely in it. \"The\ngirls at these functions are too\nyoung\" he announced in senior-i al tones\u2014after which who could\ntake the matter seriously?\nCarnival next\u2014Schroter woke\nup. Why was it held in May just\nbefore the exams? Why not\nmove some of the events to\nNovember? This had something\nto do with Morpliy Day\u2014he\nseemed to suggest that the oarsmen could collect money from\nspectators on the tow-path as\nthey went by. But what was good\nfor Schroter was also good for\nEllis, and there were fifty weeks\nleft in the year. He suggested\nFebruary. The game became\npopular, and voices piped up\nfor October, December and all\nthe others. It didn't seem to matter much when it was moved to,\nas long as moved it was. Nor\ndid it seem to matter what the\norganisers felt, in spite of Watson's plaintive plea. Eventually\nreason spoke up in the form of\nJim Marshall\u2014the question\nshould be held over for much\nwider soundings : And held over\nit was.\nRIGGED ELECTIONS\nEdwards Iept in where even\nSchroter would fear to tread,\nwith a legations that the Carnival\nQueen contest had been rigged.\nThe only ICWArian who had\nentered had won, and there had\nbeen many suspicious last minute\nalterations in the judging system.\nHowever, it seemed that Council\nhad also been fixed by ICWA,\nfor almost at once there was a motion on the floor \"that Mr.\nEdwards be heard no longer\"\nCarried. Exit Mr. Edwards.\nSTATUS SYMBOL\nBack to Watson to report the\noutcome of meeting of the Halls\nof Residence held to draft new\nregulations for the Halls., The\ngeneral result of this was a significant transfer of responsibility from the hall committee\nto the warden, who could now\nact \"summarily and independent-ly\" whenever he wished. It wasnt\nclear what role the Hall committee had any longer apart from\ngiving advice which might or\nCOUNCIL MEETS\nmight not be taken. The main\ninspiration for these changes had\nbeen Dr. Cameron, who had\nalso been behind the earlier attempt to bring in the \"Hp.m. closing\" and \"no unaccompanied\nwomen\" rules. He had described\nthe Hall committees rights as\n\"a mere status symbol\", and had\nalso argued for a section on\nmoral conduct and a statement\nthat the warden was \"in loco\nparent is\". He had nt succeeded in\nthis, but would undoubtedly return to the theme year after\nyear, and if he got his way Hail\nwould be transformed into something more like a convent. According to Watson, Cameron was\none of the most slippery people\nhe had ever come across. \"Witli\nhis students he is all sweetness\nand goodness and light, but behind the closed doors of the\nHalls of Residence Committee\none sees a different side alto-get her\". Council talked about\nthe Doctor at length, and the\nmain hope was that he now\nseemed to have sufficient rope\nwith which to hang himself.\nWHAT TO DO\nMiss Burns (\"keeper of the\nforms\" to the Halls) came under\nvery heavy fire. It was alleged\nthat she was extremely un help ful, abrupt, ill mannered and\ncalculating ly rude to students\"\nOnce this subject was breached\nwith a motion tabled by \u2022\nChrist Tye, a deluge of complaints\nand protests were released from\nother members. Watson was\nclearly at a loss as to what to do.\nEventually Tye agreed to withdraw his motion so that \"inform-al representations\" could be\nmade. Can the leopard change\nits spots?\nTOO YOUNG\nLike a gang of Rockers at\nBrighton the stirrers moved\nAND SO TO WLNE\nThis sort of thing cou id have\ngone on all night, and indeed\nWatson looked a little bored at\ntimes. But it had clean y been ex-pec ted, for at a given signal Massey d.s appeared behind tae scenes\nand was soon observed setting\nout some glasses on a side table,\nthis worked like a charm. When\neveryone was sufficiency distracted Watson turned to what was\nprobably the most important\nitem of business for the evening,\nand asked Council to set up a committee to look into the\nUnions capital commitments for\nBeit, South Side and Central\nSite. Of all the cheek, this was to\nconsist of Watson\u2014Massey and\nanyone else they should care to\nco-opt. But duty to the Union\nwas one thing and duty to ones\npalate another, and all was\nagreed without murmur as even\nthoughts of glory were firmly set\naside in a mass exercise in self-denial.\nH.D.D.

After\nnoting that Freddie (but not the\nDreamers) used dd Spice liber-ally, they asked Kenny Ball\nabout his new disc 'Hey Dolly'.\nHe was glad to see Louis Armstrong top the Beatles in the\nStates, and he signed some\nCarnival Records with a Kenny\nBall point pen. 20% of the Hollies came up from the dressing\nroom. \"How are y 'getting on\nwith that Spanish bit\" asked his\nmate, and they signed on t ne dotted cover; likewise Billy J.

It\nseems strange that this was not\ndone.\nCroquet\nPerhaps lack of publicity was\nt'e lost cause of a Princes\nGardens dweller's comment on\nthe Fete day crowd : \"But they\nare all students.

Swinging a pickaxe at an old car or emptying buckets of water over Watson are fun for the young, but\nthe older element have outgrown\nthis behaviour.

It seems a pity that\nstandards of taste have to descend to the almost criminal\n(Brighton) level before hot sales\nresult.\nBig success of Carnival was the\nraffle.

Dave, who first gained his\nI.C. colours back in 1957 as an\nundergraduate, was forced to\njump off a shortened run-up\nowing to the proximity of the\nlong jump pit at the Ifley Road\ntrack. Even so his winning jump\nof 47' 10J was a personal best\nan d also a new college record.\nDave only won with this jump\nbecause of a very sporting gesture by Axell who came second\nby on iy\\\". An unqualified by-stand er, who was acting as takeoff judge, declared Dave's leap\nto be a no-jump but Axell, who\nwas also watching, disagreed and\nafter anxious high-level consultation the mark was declared\nvalid.\nDave Smith : Gold medal winner\nat Oxford\nFrank Kobson writes\nSPORT STARVED ?\nThe fixtures situation for I.C. sports club could change\ndrastically when we become a S.I.S.T.E.R. and may no longer\nbe eligible to compete in U.L. leagues. This point was stressed\nat a recent A.C.C. meeting by\npresident Dave Watson.\nMost affected by this would\nbe the soccer club who have\nabout a dozen league matches\n}lus cup matches for each of the\nj even or so teams. For the lower\nteams this can be as much as\n50% of the fixtures. Norman\nPrice, club captain, is very condoled about this situation which\nwill take a great deal of high\nlevel diplomacy to be clarified.\nOne advantage, however, will\nbe that we may then profit from\nthe F. A.'s coaching scheme and\nthis should be a great stimulus\nto the team. Particularly we\nshould have a great chance in\nthe B.U.S. F. champs.\u2014if we are\neligible that is? This is, in fact,\none of the major questions to be\nthrashed out.\nThe other big clubs would not\nbe in such ad espa rate position\nsince they have many inter-I.C. games. One club with problems\nwould be the Sailing Club who\ndepend on the Welsh Harp Club\nHouse which is owned by U.L. All this means that we will\nhave to think hard about the\nfuture, possibly sounding out\nother U.L. colleges with a view\nto forming independant \"London\nColleges Leagues\" as at present\nhappens with Cross Country.\nAND NOW...\nThe diversity of the sporting\nactivities recognized by the college continues to grow. This\nyear has heralded the birth of\nthe Ten Pin Bowling Club and\njust recently the Water Skiing\nClub.\nHowever, whereas bowling alleys are comparatively easy \"to\ncome by in the heart of London,\nit is not so simple to find a good\nstretch of skiing water and the\nskiing club have so far had to\ntravel to Lowestoft for their first\nouting.\nThe morning was mainly\ntaken up with land instruction,\nbut several runs were made in\nthe afternoon with varying success. ATHLETES\nMOP UP\nI.C. have done surprisingly\nwell this season. U.C., Q.M. C.,L.S. E.,R.A. F. Cranwell, Goldsmiths and Bedford and County\nA.C., have all been beaten.\nKings, with their' best team for\nmany years, just beat us by 3\npoints.\nDuring the season we ha v^ had three regular members of\nthe U.L., team: Dave Smith\n(triple jump), Derek Wade (long\njump) and Leon Hall (hig n jump). This tends to emphasize\nour superiority in field events,\nwhile our performances on t ne track have been not ning to shout\nabout.\nThere have been a few notable track performances, how-ever. Joe Fitzsimmons won a fine 880 years for U.L., against\nthe A.A.A., and Roch Basson has\ntaken his 440 yards time down\nto 51.6 seconds. With more good\ncompetition he should improve\nthis.\nLEON HALL\nAlso jumping for London at\nOxford was Leon Hall (Physics\n1) who won a silver medal in t ne high jump. After clearing 5'11\"\nLeon, in a gallant bid to worry\nt ne leader, went straight on to\nattempt 6' 1\"\u2014a personal best.\nBut he was unsuccessful; only\nfailing to clear it by the narrowest of margins, and Campbell\n(ranked 6 in G.B.) went on to\nwin at 6' 34/'.\nIn recent weeks Leon has\njumped against some of the top\njumpers in the country and tel.s us he is looking forward to some\nslightly closer competition in the\nnear future. This should push\nhim over another inch or two in\nwhich case he will be a strong\ncontender for the A.A.A. Junior\nchampionship in August.\nCRICKET\nC.E.M., collapsed from 120-3\nto 138 all out so lost to I.C., who\nhad made all out in the first\nround of the U.L., Cup. In the\nsecond round they beat Battersea despite losing four quick\nwickets when they had only\nseven runs to get.\nTENNIS\nI.C. had a bye in the first\nround of the U.L. Cup. They\nplayed Northampton College in\nthe second round on Friday. (Re-sul t in Late News).\n***\nFELIX STAFF\nSports Editor next year will\nbe Frank Hobson, Elec. Eng. He\nwas this year's Cross Country\nSecretary. Applications for the\npost of Sports Reporter will be\ngratefully received.\nCaving Club\nDOWN GAPING GILL\nLate in March, I.C. Caving\ndub spent two days underground in the famous Gaping\nGill Caverns of Ingleborough in\nYorkshire. Ten o'c. ock Saturday\nmorning found seven well-dre s sed cavers walking across three\nmiles of snow-swept limestone\nplateau to the cave entrances;\nt ne most prominent being the\ntwenty-foot square shaft\u2014down\nwhich Fell Beck plunges 360 feet\nto the floor of the Ma.\\i\\ Chamber below. Four of the party then\ndescended Bar Pot via various\nsqueezes and a110 foot ladder,\ncarrying wit n them spare clothes\nsleeping bags, food and cooking\ngear for the underground camp.\nThis was set up 300 feet underground in the large dry Sand\nCavern.\nMeanwhile, the other three\ntook only 120 feet of rope and\na bse i led down the six p.t che s of\nt ne nearby Disappointment Pot.\nBase Camp established, the remaining six cavers brought t. ie\nrest of the kit, descended Bar\nPot and met the others in Sand\nCavern at five o'c. ock. Shortly\nafterwards, the party of three arrived ha v mg traversed a quarter\nmile long, flat-out crawl\u2014the\nconnection from the bottom of\nDisappointment Pot.\nTnen everyone enjoyed a quick meal and six hours' sleep\nbefore two parties went exploring other parts of the four miles\nof cave passages. The highlight\nfor everyone was a visit to t ne Main Chamber, roughly the size\nof St. Paul's Cathedral with the\nhighest waterfall in Britain falling through the hole in the roof.\nOne party visited East Passage\nto photograph the beautiful\nformations\u2014t ne only ones in the\nSystem. The second party traversed the long, low, wet, muddy,\napt.y named Amphibian passage\nto visit the Master Cave and\nterminal sump.\nTnree in the afternoon saw\neveryone back in Sand Cavern\npacKing the kit ready for the\narduous climb back up Bar Pot,\nbut it was another two hours before everyone was out of the\ncave, all agreeing that it had\nbeen a most successful weekend.\nHOCKEY: A DUTCH CUP\nOur hockey team were lucky\nenough to tour Holland during\nthe Easter Vac, and enjoy bot n genial hospitality and active\nsport. During our stay we were\nentertained by the Dutch Students in Groningen whence we\nvisited much of Holland. We\ncommenced our visit by playing\nfour matches, winning one,\ndrawing one and losing two. Later we travelled to Epe to play in\na tournament and it was here\nthat our team spirit and hockey\nability came to t ne fore,, playing\nsix games, winning three of\nthem and drawing three. Our\nperformance won us the Cup for\nthe tournament which had a truly international flavour. The\ntour was a great success, being a mixture of good sport and\nsplendid entertainment and we\nlook forward to welcoming the\nDutch Students next year by way\nof repayment.\n\n"
