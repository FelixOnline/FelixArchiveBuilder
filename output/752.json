    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 31st19867 Imperial College's Adopted\nPrisoner - Ivan Starovoit\nThe Group has adopted a Ukranian, I.Y. Starovoit, who was\nimprisoned for practising his\nreligion. He was gao led for five\nyears in a 'labour colony of strict\nregime', on the charge of\n'Infringement of rights and\npersons under the appearance of\nperforming religious ceremonies'.\nIvan Starovoit was gao led because\nhe is a Jehovah's Witness.\nLittle more is known about this\ncase as the Soviet authorities are\nnot too forthcoming with\ninformation, however the general\nstate of religious persecution\nwithin the USSR is known. The\nimprisonment of believers is under\na confusing variety of laws: for\nnot registering a congregation, or\ndisrupting the social order by\nholding a procession, etc. The list\nof religions involved ranges from\nthe Russian Orthodox Church to\nBuddhists. The Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostalists are\nparticularly caught in a trap as it\nis effectively illegal to practise\ntheir religion. In order to worship\ntogether they must register their\ncongregation, however such\nregistration is never granted to\nthese groups and they must\ntherefore break the rule to\nworship.\nPlease help us to secure the\nrelease of Ivan Starovoit by\njoining in the Group's activities.\nAt the very least try to write a short polite letter to the Soviet\nDepartment of Internal Affairs in\nthe Donetsk region expressing\nconcern about his case. Four\nguidelines on writing letters to\nforeign governments are,\n1 Never be rude or offensive.\n2 Never advance any political\nviews. Remeber you are writing\non humanitarian grounds.\n3 Stress that your concern is only\nfor the prisoners basic human\nrights; write as if you believe the\ngovernment is open to reason.\n4 Write in simple clear English\nunless you are fluent in Russian\n(or whatever other language is\nappropriate to a particular case).\nLetters should be addressed to;\nUkrainskaya SSR\ng.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday October 31st19862 Careers Fair\nMany students, particularly\nfinalists, will have attended ther\nCareers Fair earlier this week.\nThis year the event was held over\ntwo days, and the number of\ncompanies attending considerably\nincreased. It was a story of \"more\nof the same\", however; the\nadditional companies were\nrecruiting for the same sort of\nvacancies. To look at the jobs on\noffer this week, and that is all that\na large number of students are\ngoing to do, there is a very limited\nrange of careers receiving any\npublicity.\nA \"small group of students\"\norganised a leaflet appeal asking\nstudents to consider the\nimplications of a career with\nmilitary connections. At one stage\nthey were asked to leave the fair\nby representatives of the Industrial\nSociety. The paper publicity may\nnot have carried the name of any\nICU Society, but I for one would\nlike to be associated with its\nsentiments. Too many IC students\nstill follow the particularly\nmoronic practise of picking the\ncareer which fits the salary they\nwould like to aim for. This view\nmay seem facile, but I have seen\ntoo many friends drifting into\naccountancy jobs after three years\nof being bled of all imagination\nand enthusiasm. This week's protest was an at tem t to make\nthose hoping to continue in\nScience and Engineering think a little more fully through the\nconsequences of a decision which\nthey may have to live with until\nthe grave. IC may never have\nbeen full of idealistic students\nobsessed with pacifist\nphilosophies, but I find the\nmental lit y of some of the\noccupants of this \"centre of\nexcellence\" very disturbing.\nAnother Apology\nSeveral members of FELIX\nstaff have pointed out to me that\nI am frequently abusive to\nstudents who wish to use the\noffice facilities. Though I am\nnever at my most pleasant on\nWednesdays and Thursdays, I appreciate that my rather pushy\nbehaviour can be taken the wrong\nway, and I sincerely apologise if I have offended anyone.\nCredits\nThanks to the following for\ntheir help and support; Mark\nCottle, particularly for\ncoordinating the Human Rights\nWeek section, Bill Goodwin, Chris\nEdwards, Judith Hackney, Pippa\nSalmon, Chris Martin, Kamala\nSen, Nigel Whitfield, Mole, David\nWiliams, Liz Holford, Simon\nLewis, Jim Clayden, David Burns,\nJane Spiegel, Jane Bowie, Prof\nAsh, Mrs Ash, Grenville Manuel,\nSteve Nuttall, Rose Atkins, Laura\nDain Tony Spencer, David Rowe,\nChristine Taig, Jackie Peirce and\nDavid Colley.\nSecurity\nProblem\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon, SW7 2BB( Tel 01 589 5111 ext 3515).\nEditor, David Jones.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday October 24th198611 \"But how are we going to get people\nto come and see a play about\nNuclear Power?\" asks Em (Maggie\nFord). \"We'll give it a silly name!\"\nanswers Dee (Cordelion Ditton).\nHence The Day The Sheep Turned\nPink\" Drill Hall Arts Centre), a brave attempt at dealing with a very\ncontroversial subject with humour,\nhumanity and common sense.\nTwo reporters, Em and Dee, are\ntrying to find out the truth about\nnuclear power by decoding all the\njargon and talking to the people that\nthe new power stations affect. They\nin turn are going to write a play from\nthe material that they have\nresearched and so we are given the\nplay-within-a play format again,\nbut here it is an excellent way of\nincorporating serious debate with\nfull-blown comedy sketches.\nThe majority of the arguments\ncentre around the Dounreay station\nin Scotland where the writer,\nCordelios Ditton, did much of her\nresearch. Every angle is covered;\nfrom the local villagers' complaint\nthat they cannot challenge the safety\nof the station because they are\ncontinually beaten back by scientific\nlanguage and technological\nlanguage that they do not\nunderstand and so cannot argue\nShadow Syndicate production\n\"Between the Devil and the Deep\nBlue Sea\" was one of the most\nsuccessful productions at this year's Edinburgh Festival. It can now be\nseen at the Gate Theatre, Notting\nHill until November 15th and is well\nworth seeking out as it is a hugely\nenjoyable combination of action,\ndrama and jazz to send the feet\ntapping and eyes watering at the\nsame time.\nThe Shadow Syndicates\nproductions are always full of\noriginal theatrical tricks and effects,\nmy favourite is the gun shot in slow\nmotion! \"Between the Devil and the\nDeep Blue Sea\" is a great\nproduction by very talented\ncompany and as Notting Hill is not\nvery far away there are no excuses\nfor not going to see it!\nagainst, to the straightforward\neconomic reasons for using Nuclear\nPower stations rather then coal\npowered ones.\nThere is a scene of immense\npower when a mother, who lives\nnear Dounreay, describes simply the\ndeath of her son from leukaemia,\nand how the disease might have\nbeen caused by the radioactivity in\nthe area. However it is not an anti-nuclear play, the end message seems\nto be that the arguments are far too\ncomplex for anybody to be simply\n'for' or 'against'. At times the debate\nis a little too drawn out but there are\nsome wickedly original sketches\ninvolving radioactive limpets and\npink sheep etc to break it up.\nIt is a play that is not just meant\nfor entertainment, it is intelligent\nand thought provoking, which is\nmore than can be said for most of\nthe current West End productions.\nEven _if you do not want to see a show there, the Drill Hall Arts\nCentre at 16 Cheniers St., (close to\nULU) is well worth seeking out as it\nhas a cosy bar and an excellent,\nreasonably priced, restaurant\nunderneath.which is open until late.\nUZ HOLFORD\nAt last. A play with some relevance\nto the cloistered world of science.\nHugh Whitemore's 'Breaking the\nCode' relates the life story of Alan\nTuring : mathematical genius;\nEnigma code breaker and pioneer in\nartificial intelligence. For all these\nachievements the Turing story is not\na happy one. His non conformity\n(he was a homosexual) led\nultimately to confrontation with the\nauthorities of austere 50's Britain\nand suicide\u2014a sad fate for such a brilliant and clear thinking man. His\nlife can be read in \"Alan Turing:\nThe Enigma\" by Hodges, the book\nin which this play is based.\nBack to the play. The story is\nunfolded in clever yet elaborate\n'flashback and flash forward' style,\nconcentrating on three parts of\nTuring's life\u2014childhood, the\nEnigma years, the later scandals.\nThe fundamental conflict, that of\ngenius and man, is quickly revealed\nto be the main theme and the\nflashback device makes sure the\nsense of impending tragedy never\nleaves. It is probable this complex\nnarrative method is the only one\nthat can avoid the dryness of\n'biography'.\nAmongst all this the important\nstuff of the play, the Turing\ncharacter, is pieced together. The\ntreatment is sympathetic and careful\nif erring on the side of simplification\n(for the audience's sake probably)\nand the relationships between\nTuring and the other characters are\nwell-established and interesting.\nThe lead role is taken by Derek\nJacobi who gives a typically\naccomplished performance, equally\nconvincing as the tortured man and\nthe mathematician avidly\nexplaining Russell's paradox. (The I Claudius stammer returns also as\nthe Alan Turing stammer).\nIsobel Dean plays Turing's mother, at times verging on the\n'actress y' in emotional passages but\notherwise engaging as Turing's contact with prosaic reality. Michael\nGough and Joanna David as\nEnigma colleagues are both good,\nalthough it is really Jacobi's play.\nAs might be expected from the\nnames involved, this production has\nthe quality to succeed although it is\nnot the greatest theatre to be seen at\npresent. To me it remains the oddity\nI fancied it might be when I first read\nof it. Hopefully, however, it will be\nseen and talked about and stimulate\nsome thought for misunderstood\nintellectuals like Turing. We have\nseen in the past how the implicit\nglamour of theatre and cinema has\nthe power to do this.\nMcNeil\nMuchos Desporados Kentish Town is\na riotous ly amusing look at the\ncontrast between the dope smoking\npoverty of Kentish Town and the\ncocaine sniffing snobbishness of the\nnicer parts of Willesden Green.\nCollins, Sylvester and Rosco are\nthe three 'black' brothers stuck in\nThatcher's rut t. No job and no\nmoney...the only alternative can be\nto get stoned; until that is, the idea of\ndoing a job on the coke pushers in\nWillesden formulates. All three\ncharacters are well played.\nThe scene shifts to upper-class\nYuppyland to find an intense,\nparanoid coke dealer and his dumb\nSloane girlfriend delivering the\n'charlie'. The 'brothers' invasion,\naccompanied by dark glasses and\nbaseball bats, interferes with the\nbusiness being undertaken.\nHowever, after a few heated\nmoments followed by nearby sirens,\nthey leave with the loot, but not\nbefore 'a few lines for the road...'.\nMuchos Desporados Kentish Town is\njust over one hour of witty, fast,\nnon-farcical entertainment. If you\ndon't catch it tomorrow night,\nwatch out for its transfer.\nSimon Lewis.\n\n"

He was arrested on\n25 February 1981 and detained\nfor interrogation at Karadagh\nSecurity Headquarters. His\ncorpse was subsequently\nhanded back to his family\nbadly marked by torture.\npart of government suppression\nof dissent. In most cases political\ndetainees are at greatest risk in\nthe period immediately after\narrest. Such detainees have\nbroken down and signed false\nconfessions. The victims have\nincluded mothers and children\ntortured in front of each other,\nmutilated and killed.\nThere are no circumstances\nunder which these abuses are\nacceptable or legally permissible.\nTorture violates the rule of law:\nit directly contradicts the\nfundamental principle that\ncitizens should be subject only to\nprescribed penalties for proven\noffences. Torture, instead, is\ncalculated assault. Nothing denies\nour common humanity more\nthan the purposeful infliction of\ntotally unjustifiable pain and\nhumiliation on a defenceless\nprisoner. It is to be condemned\nabsolutely.\nWhat is Being Done ?\nAs part of its worldwide\nhuman rights campaign, Amnesty\nInternatonal opposes the torture\nof all prisoners, without\nreservation. It concentrates first\non getting the facts. Once it\nbecomes clear that torture and\nill-treatment are being inflicted\non prisoners, the organisation's members begin appealing to the\nrelevant authorities to guarantee\nthe safety of detainees. In urgent\ncases an international network of\nvolunteers can be alerted.\nSecuring proper medical\ntreatment for torture victims is\nalso part of the campaign, with\nteams of Amnesty doctors\nworking to help refugees and\nothers needing mental and\nphysical rehabilitation. The\npostcards, telegrams and parcels\nare getting through. Torture has\nbeen stopped in specific cases;\ninternational and domestic\npressures have brought about\nchanges in laws and procedures\nin various countries; considerable\nprogress has been made in the\nmedical treatment and\nrehabilitation of victims. Much\nmore needs to be done\n(Extracted from Amnesty\nInternational Campaign Against\nTorture)\nP.M. Bfrkett\nThe Toasting Table' an Iranian torture method in which the\nvictim is literally grilled.\nstill forms an instrument of\noppression.\nHuman rights is an even\nbroader term than most people\nthink. Shelter, clean water, and a fair chance to earn a living are\nhuman rights too. When aid is\ngiven to a country it must be\ndistributed fairly and it must\nconsist of sensible assistance\naimed at making that country\nstable and prosperous in the long-term. Any government in a developed country which considers\nsub sidi sed weapons sales as 'aid',\nor attempts to appear\ncompassionate by dumping some\ngrain on a third world country\nand not caring where it goes is a government contributing to\nhuman rights abuse.\nGren Manuel\n'When the first two\nhundred letters came the\nguards gave me back my\nclothes. Then the next two\nhundred letters came and\nthe prison director came\nto see me. When the next\npile of letters arrived the\ndirector got in touch with\nhis superior. The letters\nkept coming and coming:\nthree thousand of them.\nThe President was\ninformed. The letters kept\narriving and the President\ncalled the prison and told\nthem to let me go.'\nYou CAN LAU&H Now SMITH, BUT\nJUST WAIT TILL\nTHE FOREIGN AID\nARRIVES, AND\nWE CAN AFFORD\nSOME REAL RATS1\n.\n\n"

    "content": "Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday October 24th1986 South Africa and Peace\nUGM'S AND UNION POLICY\nAt Tuesday'sU GM, the 'Barclays\nBank' motion will surface once\nmore. Many people complain that\n\"external\" issues like boycotting\ninstitutions with South African\ninterests, or, for instance,\nsupporting the Peace Movement,\nare irrelevant to the student body\nand should be left out of UGM'S.I disagree, for several reasons. If an\nissue is important to an individual\nUnion Member, then they have the\nright to bring it to a general meeting\nto ask for the support of other\nstudents. If support is given, then\nthe considerable resources of the\nUnion can be called upon to assist in\ncampaigning or educating on that\nissue. Contrary to popular belief,\nbeing a student of Imperial College\ndoes not exclude you from the\nHuman Race so why should \"wider\nissues\" cease to affect you? Voicing\na collective opinion does not\nimmediately make the Union a Party Political Organisation; but a collective voice can carry a lot more\nweight than an individual one. It is a shame if the Union's \"apolitical\"\nstance makes us afraid to talk about\nanything other than beer \"prices and\nstanding orders and beware\u2014\nnarrow minded scientists/engineers\nare going out of fashion.\nOn a practical point; as President\nof a Union like this I am often called\nupon to make a decision or state an\nopinion on an issue of \"wider\"\nimportance. If the Union has no\npolicy on the issue\u2014more than\nlikely under the circumstances\u2014\nthen I have no option but to act on\nmy conscience. You may not agree\nwith me; but having been voted in, I shall continue to do so until policy\ntells me otherwise. That's democracy....\nLESBIANS AND GAY MEN\n\"Imperial would still appear to be\nhearing a pile of shit as far as lesbian\nand gay liberation goes...\".\nI quote from Stuart Beeston's report to the General Council of the\nUniversity of London Union (Stuart\nis a member of the ULC executive\nand a sabbatical at University\nCollege). To a large extent I would\nagree with him . Imperial has no gay\nsociety and anyone hoping to form\none might expect considerable\nresistance, even harassment.\nThe attitude towards lesbians and\ngay men in most Student Unions is\nsupportive and relaxed; This makes\nlife a whole lot easier for gay\nstudents, many of whom have found\n'coming out' at home impossible.\nUnfortunately this can't be said of\nImperial College where 'homo-sexual' is too often seen as an insult,\na dirty word.\nThere isn'ta magic solution, a way of changing the atmosphere\novernight; but something can be\ndone. Stuart Beeston will be coming\nto the Union sometime during the\nnext fortnight\u2014if anyone, gay,\nstraight, or somewhere in between,\nwould like to talk him about \"gay\nliberation\" or forming a gay society,\ncome and see me and I 'll fix up a date for him to come over.\nHUNT THE SABBATICAL\nI gather people have been\ncomplaining that the sabbaticals are\n'never there' in the office when they\ncome to see us. Well unfortunately\nwe do have up to a dozen college\ncommittees to go to each week, plus\nall kinds of informal meetings and\nvisits. The best thing to do, if you\nwant to see one of us specifically, is\nto ring 3500first to make sure we are\nthere. Hopefully things will calm\ndown a bit towards the end of\nNovember.\nANTI\u2014POVERTY ACTION\nYou've probably read about this\nelsewhere\u2014a1% self-tax scheme (\u00a36\nper term) paid by standing order to\nThird World First, an organisation\nwhich raises awareness of the\nreasons behind Third World\npoverty whilst at the same time\nfunding \"grass roots\" aid projects.\nIf you want to join, or learn more\nabout, the scheme, forms and\nleaflets are available in the Union\nOffice (or ask me and I 'll talk for\nhours!)\nWell that's more than enough\nfrom me. Have fun, especially if\nyou're going to the Halloween party\nin the Union lounge tonight.\nChristine\nColley Wobbles\nBack again with yet another warble.\nThis is just a final warning to those\nof you who have been allocated\nparking permits, but haven't collected them: Do so by Wednesday\n5th November, otherwise they will be\ngiven away. Also on the parking\npermit front, will all those in the\nSouthside parking area please\nreturn their permits to me, so I can\nexchange them for the correct discs.\nTa!\nAs there is aUG M looming on\nthe horizon, it is once again time for\nthe Exec, and hopefully all their\nunions as well as members, to begin\nworrying about attendances. There\nis one thing at the forefront of the\nQuorum question that really pee's me off and that is, all of you who are\nmembers of a club or society rely\nupon the Union in one way or\nanother. However hardly any of you\ndeem it necessary to come along to\nthe Union's decision making body.\nThis attitude, should in my opinion\nany way, be rewarded with a lack of\nattention imposed on the\nclub/society by the Union i.e. no\nmoney allocated. So the overall gist\nis that if you as club members or\nsociety members can't be bothered\nto support the hand that feeds you,\nwhy should it feed you? Come on\nboys and girls, how about a bit more\nresponsibility and attend of your\nown accord, as us passing motions\nmeans nothing really.\nNow we move onto motions, this\nweek we have appearing a motion\non Barclays Bank, and no others of\nthe moment. However if you\napproach the U GM Chairman\nHugh Southey with a motion, he has\nthe power to deem it an emergency\nmotion. (All motions must be in by a week in advance of the U. G.M. unless decreed emergency). Any\nassistance required in formulating\nyour motion can be obtained from\nHugh or me. And remember you\ndon't have to have been here a long\ntime, or be part of a group to put\nforward a motion.\nDIC\nIC UGM\n1.00pm, Tuesday\nNovember 4th in the Great\nHall.\nYour chance to take part in the running of\nyour Union.

As we only broadcast to\nstudent halls we can provide a service that's especially tailored for\nstudents. This year, IC Radio has\ntaken several steps to make sure that\nits listeners get what they want. One\nsimple way to make sure you hear\nwhat you want is to phone in\nrequests, which are usually played\nwithin five minutes or so. To phone\nus from Southside or Linstead, the\nnumber is 89, whereas it's72 \u20143440\nfrom Evelyn Gardens or just 3440\nfrom College. Our recently started\nCollege Events Guide means that\nyou'll always be in touch with what\nthere is to do, and well keep you in\ntouch with last minute changes. Our\nall-time student top 50 gives us some\nidea of what students want to hear,\nbut one of the great things about IC\nRadio is our variety of specialist\nmusic shows. Here are the details of\nour current regular shows:\n(Give some a listen and tell us what\nyou think. We might even come and\nask you)\nSundays\n12pm; 'Vintage Years'\u2014Chris\n'Slim Jim' Evans, including Golden\nOldies.\n7pm; 'The Funk Show'\u2014presented by Ed Cartwright and Captain\nScarlet.

Weirdos?\nHi-tech Wizards? We certainly have\nsome of these types, but many of us\nare actually ordinary students with\nno delusions of grand ure, no knob-twiddling compulsion, merely a good ear for music. If you want to\ntry something different but can't picture yourself as a DJ, then think\nagain! Come along and meet some\nof our number in our studio next to\nthe Southside shop. Most of our\npresenters go on the air after only 3\nhours training. Most importantly, if\nyou favour a style of music not\ncurrently played by IC Radio then\ncome on down.\nWe would warmly welcome\nanyone who'd like to help us with\nour news department, our technical\nconstruction maintenance, or our\nrecord company liaison, our\nforthcoming listener survey.Just call\non us this Wednesday (5th) at 6.30,\nor at anytime we're on the air.\nFreedom Fight\nIn Britain we have the valuable, if\nprecarious, freedom to say almost\nwhatever we like about anyone,\neven about those in power;\nelsewhere thousands of people are\nimprisoned purely for their\nopinions.\nThe Amnesty International group\nenables students who are aware how\nprecious and vulnerable this\nfreedom is, and who feel morally\nobliged by their privilege to exercise\nit on behalf of others from whom it\nand all other freedoms have been\ntaken away. The only weapon which\nthe group uses to combat\nrepression, torture or murder is the\nweight of public opinion, expressed\nin well-informed and courteous\nletters to those who practise these\nabuses. At present two cases are in\nhand: one concerning a prisoner\nalready found to satisfy the\ninternational organisation's conditions of non-violence and\npolitical balance (a condition\nimposed on the relative numbers of\nprisoners selected from different\nregions) and consequently\n'adopted', and a second still under\ninvestigation.\nOther activities of the group\ninclude the 'urgent action' scheme\n(letters or telegrams for prisoners in\nimminent danger); fund-raising and\npublicity.\nIn connection with the twenty-fifth anniversary of Amnesty\nInternational which occurs this\nyear, the group has taken part in the\nnational door-to-door collection\nand is contributing to special\ncampaigns in Yugoslavia, Chile and\nSouth Africa.\nThe group meets every Tuesday\nat 5.30 in the Brown Committee\nRoom on the third floor of the\nUnion Building.\nFirkin Run\nLast Monday 17 people drove\naround London on the infamous\nFirkin run to raise money for the\nFerret and Firkin Pub to give a children's school a firework display\non November 5th.

The\nsecond meeting was spoilt slightly\nbecause the Gales BBB had not been\nfined at the brewery and was\nun drinkable. For further meetings\nwe hope to have more beer than we\nhave in the past few years.\nOn Friday 17th, members of the\nsociety visited the \"Pig's Ear\" Beer\nFestival at Bethnal Green. We were\nable to try many real ales, mainly\nfrom the South and Wales, all in\nexcellent condition.

So there may not be a lot in your Barclays high ter rate\ndeposit account right now, and the\nArthur Andersen and Co. starting\nsalary is undeniably attractive, but\nreally it would appear to me to be\nselling your soul way beyond the call\nof duty.\nAnyway having decided that I didn't want to work for British\nNuclear Fuels, or any of the\nnumerous GEc in pani es, I decided to find something else to do\nwith my time.

As\nRector's wife, one has a rare\nopportunity to Invent-A Job.\nI lie. There was an inherited post:\nheading up the Women's Club. It is\none of the few vertical structures in\nthe College, embracing academic\nand administrative staff,\npostgraduate students, all wives and\nundergraduate associates. Still an\ninfant, it was formed last year from\nthe former Wives' Club and seeks\nmembers committed to the idea that\nmore people need to talk to each\nother. Our next event is a \"Welcome\nWorkshop\" on Wednesday\nNovember 12th from 11.00am to\n3.30pm at 170 Queensgate.\nDesigned for new arrivals\u2014staff,\npostgraduates and wives\u2014a morning session will cover making\nthe most out of living in London,\nhow to get involved quickly in local\nlife, finding a suitable roof, dentist,\nschool After lunch, workshops\nled by postgraduates will swap ideas\non ways to live on a shoestring\u2014but\nvibrantly. Our aim is that everyone\nwill do a lot of talking in small\ngroups and go away with at least one\nphone number of a potential friend.\nWe hope to encourage people to do\nfurther research so that we may\nbreak into print to produce our own\nTried and Tested Guide to Life in\nSouth Kensington before next year.\nThe committee is providing a lot of\nhome cooking for the lunch, so if\nyou're new, do come.\nOur next big event will be a children's fair, with games devised\nby IC wizards to use science in the\npursuit of fun. It can only work with\nall that imagination, in ovation, wit\nand skill that staff, students and\ntechnicians share, so do start\nscheming and dreaming up games\nnow.\nIn the summer, July 12th to be\nexact, we are joining forces with the\nRoyal College of Art to help\ncelebrate a150 th anniversary. Hand\nin hand with our eminent and\nexciting neighbours\u2014all the\nMuseums, the Royal College of\nMusic, Organists, the Royal Festival\nBallet, the French Institute, the\nGoethe Institute, the Royal\nGeographical Society and the\nAlbert Hall, we shall host a fabulous\nparty. Did anyone every say IC was\na dull mono tech? The Women's Club is also\ninterested in improving the\ncommunal areas in student houses,\nin supporting the nursery and in\ncreating a club centre somewhere in\ncollege where people can drop in to\noffer ideas, help, problems and be\nsure of a coffee and no VDU's. Come join us. We need you.\nThus ende th the commercial. As I said, my own role has yet to be\ninvented. It starts by listening, then\nbubbling away on the back burner.\nSome elements in the Brew may be:\nencouraging all endeavours in the\narts, making 170 a centre for an\nextended IC and \"Albertland\"\nfamily, making industrial employers\nmore aware of student expectations,\nsetting up with the Careers Office\nvideo mock interview practice\nsessions with feedback from invited\nemployers, attracting more women\nto IC to improve the quality of life\nfor everyone. On really energetic\ndays I'd like to help raise the money\nfor a purpose-built nursery and for a faculty club that would be a place\nfor staff, alumni and postgraduates\nto use as a clubhouse and invite\nguests from industry, the City and\nthe Government. The brilliance and\nthe talent at IC is indisputable; yet a stir or two might not be amiss.\nClare Ash\nWomen's Consciousness\nWIST (WOMEN IN SCIENCE\nAND TECHNOLOGY) is a society\nrun by women students for women\nstudents. We are primarily a social\ngroup, although we are and always\nhave been ardent campaigners for\nwomen's rights. You may have\nheard a lot about us already\u2014some\nof it true, a lot of it not. We like to\nthink of ourselves as a group that\ncan encourage women's consciousness among all students. We can\noffer mutual support and a refuge\nfrom our male dominated\nen vi rome nt. So come along to the\ncommon room with a difference\u2014\nThe Senior Common Room (above\nthe Snack Bar) every Tuesday at\n12.30, and meet with us to make use\nof the friendship and support that\nwe can offer each other.\nJANE BOWIE\nPRESIDENT WIST\nWilliams and WIST\nMrs Shirley Williams, the President\nof the SDP, addressed a meeting of\nWomen in Science and Technology\n(WIST) on Tuesday. The main\ntheme of her talk was the changing\nrole of women in society, and in\nparticular the role that she saw for\nwomen in scientific subjects. Mrs\nWilliams felt that it was up to\nwomen to raise questions about the\nimpact of science upon society. She\ncited examples of 'prestige' projects\nin Third World countries where, for\nexample, huge hydro-electric\nschemes are created, with a consequent loss and erosion of land\nneeded to produce food, and\nwarned that \"We cannot afford\nscientifically illiterate students of\nhumanities and humanistic ally illiterate students of science\".\nOn the subject of women as\nleaders, Mrs Williams noted that\nsuccessful women leaders have had\nmany of the same qualities as men in\nthe same positions\u2014toughness,\nruthlessness, logic and aggression\u2014\nand proclaimed that \"women can be\njust as good as men are.\" Although\nshe admitted that women in power\noften had masculine qualities, Mrs\nWilliams suggested that a gentler,\nfeminine approach to problems\nwould produce better results in the\nlong term and gave as an example\nthe manner in which Germany was\ntreated after the Second World War,\ncontrasting it, with the treatment\nafter the First, and the subsequent\nrise of Hitler. Still on the subject of\nwomen in positions of power, Mrs\nWilliams did not feel that\nsegregation, for example by the\ncreation of a Women's Minister,\nwould help. Rather, this would lead\nto patron is ation and help to keep\nwomen out of key positions. It\nwould, she suggested, be far better\nto enforce equality by a system of\nmonitoring to ensure fair practice,\nor the imposition of Contract\nCompliance, whereby a company\ncannot win a contract unless it\nproves that it treats everyone\nequally.\nAsked by FELIX if she thought\nthat the lack of women in science\nand technology was due to the\nstandard of teaching and the\nshortage of science teachers, she\nreplied that teachers were\nludicrously badly paid, and that a10% pay increase in real terms,\ntogether with conversion courses,\nwas needed to attract people back in\nto teaching. Though she felt that coeducation was in principle a good\nthing, Mrs Williams expressed the\nview that it also reduced the number\nof women taking science subjects, as\nthey were encouraged towards the\nmore 'traditional' areas. She also\nfelt that the creation of the new\nTechnical Colleges would empty the\nschools of scientists and make the\nproblem worse.\nFELIX asked Mrs Williams for\nher opinion of the new\nUnemployment Benefit question-n aire, which may disqualify those,\nsuch as students, who are unable to\ntravel to find work. She asserted\nthat this was \"An attempt to reduce\nthe number of unemployed before\nthe next election\" and said that the\nSDP would provide a 'basic benefit'\nfor students studying after the age of\n16, with removal of fees for part\ntime students.\nQuestioned about the possibility\nof student loans, Mrs Williams\nstated that the SDP believed them to\nbe necessary only in the case where\nthe parental contribution is not\nmade, and that they would have to\nbe provided at low interest rates.\nThe SDP has, she said, no plans to\nreplace grants by loans, and would\nlike to remove the need for a parental contribution, though she\nadmitted that this could not be done\nvery quickly. The first priority of\nMrs Williams' party is to increase all\nhigher education by 50%, giving\nequal emphasis to both humanities\nand science, rather than boosting\nscience at the expense of humanities.\nNigel Whitfield\n\n"

Security Chief Geoff\nReeves was called in to examine the\ncase with an electronic 'sniff er'. The\ndevice clicked rapidly suggesting\nthat the case may contain explosive.\nBy 12.03 thirty local Police and the\nBomb Squad had arrived and the\nMines, Electrical Engineering, Civil\nEngineering and Mechanical\nEngineering buildings were\nevacuated.

The motion recieved\nunanimous support, and the Union\nwill now take steps to ensure that\nstudents are not press uri sed into\ncarrying out dissections, particularly on live animals.\nThe council is concerned that\nmany experiments are either\nunnecessary or are used to\ndemonstrate known fact. They\npoint out that the computer models\nand video equipment, such as\nBradford University's Videograph,\nare cheaper and more effective than\nanimal experimentation.\nA Students' Charter, originally\ndrafted by Leeds University, is being\nadopted by a number of student\nunions in an attempt to ensure that\nstudents are not disciplined for\nrefusing to experiment on animals.\nIn the past students have been\npenal is ed, and in some cases refused\ntheir degrees, for exercising rights of\nconscience. It is hoped that the\nmove will achieve a huge reduction\nin the number of an it nal experiments performed in London's colleges.\nThe GU C agreed to oppose a proposed fifty percent cut in\nfunding for London's central\nuniversity, and condemned the\nsupport given by the Committee of\nVice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) for student loans, on the\ngrounds that they would prejudice\nstudents from low income brackets.\n- The Public Order Bill, currently\nunder discussion in the House of\nLords, was criticised as being a breech of democratic freedom. The\nBill, which is also being opposed by\nthe National Council for Civil\nLiberties, gives the Police the power\nto stop any march which is\nconsidered to be a 'serious\ndisruption of the life of the\ncommunity'.\nAlso criticised was the\nGovernment's plan to include a freedom of speech clause in the\nEducation Bill.

Not\nonly that, it was the first point ever\ngained by any IC team against Kent\nUniversity in the U AU Tournament. Kent inflicted IC 1st IX's biggest defeat of last season, by 6-0,\nand this almost completely new IC\nteam was determined not to let Kent\ndominate the game with their\noverall strength and size, as they had\nlast year.\nKent started well, but as soon as\nthe ball reached the defensive area,\nKent were stopped by a solid IC\ntackle. IC slowly began to find their\nway, and 20 minutes into the game,\nNigel Collier popped up to put IC\ninto the lead. IC's defence made sure\nthat the score remained 1-0 at half\ntime to the home team.\nKent started the second half in\ndetermined mood, and laid siege on\nthe IC goal, IC should have killed\nthe game on the break, but\nAlessandro Lunghi and then Dave\nLynne both missed presentable\nchances. The referee's decision not\nto penal is e off sides. provided an\nexciting ending to the game. With\n10 minutes to go, a Kent forward\nbroke, clearly offside, and finished\nwell. IC defence did well to keep the\nfinal Kent onslaught at bay but,\nwith 2 minutes to go, complete\ntragedy struck as a goal mouth scramble was ended when Laurence\nCovill fell to the ground with a suspected broken leg. This could\nprove costly in the games to come\nfor IC, and I wish \"Lol\" a speedy\nrecovery.\nTeam: A Allen, M. Bradley, P. Ewart,\nP. Dyson, L Covill, B. Wood, B. Mason, P. Olden, A.

Well taken goals by\nMark Woodgate and Chris Gordon\nfo med a base on which Paul Savage\nwas to provide the icing as on the\ncake with a spectacular diving\nheader shortly before the end. As\nusual for the thirds the emphasis\nwas on sound teamwork rather than\nindividual brilliance. With\nperformances like this based on\nsolid defence, dynamic midfield and\nslightly more clinical finishing.the\nteam has much to look forward to\nthis season.\nTeam: F. Batstone, K. Graves, M.

The first game\nagainst Kent in the UAU, Imperial\ndropped their first point in 4 games.\nBad umpiring and a wet pitch led to\nscrappy, bad-tempered game. Kent\nopened the scoring but the equalise r was well picked up by Paul\nSkipworth. Thursday saw Brunei in\nthe Middlesex cup.

Even\nthough it was the first race of the\nyear, the league has become more\ncompetitive while being more\nfriendly than last year. With a few\nlucky races, the IC 1st team won the\nsecond place position out of about\n14 teams. The team comprised of\nKate Finch, Ivor Gitlbe, Keith\nAdeney, Mike Johnston and Mark\nSchmidt. All performed well on the\nfast wet difficult course. The Ski\nClub's next race is November 30 for\nwhich we will need lots of help,\nespecially ladies with racing or good\nskiing abilities. A lot is taking place,\nso please come along to sign up. Just\nask for Clare, Mike or, Mark\nSchmidt.

The IC team started well -but even Brimelow's tactical\nexcellence couldn't make up for the\nteam's lack of boat speed and they\nwere narrowly beaten by a more\nexperienced team. This was typical\nof the weekend; although the team\nstarted well they lacked the final\npunch needed for success at this\nlevel. Nevertheless they finished\n11th and all three IC boats qualified\nfor the Gnurns Trophy.

    "content": "A Personal View - by The\nRector\nIt is not easy to find a consensus\nfor what makes for a good life.\nShould one look for serenity, a life of calm contemplation? Or\nshould one seek happiness in\nbeing fully stretched? Should one\ncontribute to the next generation?\nOr delegate that activity to others?\nShould one try to puzzle out\nultimate questions of our being?\nOr cheerfully admit that we shall\nnever know?\nThere are no answers to such\nquestions\u2014which is of course no\nreason why one should not ask\nthem. Yet there are some\nimperatives of our being which we\ncan declare with no introspection.\nWe know that torturing a child is\na terrible wrong. No one needs to\ntell us. The act offends the very\nessence of our being, that aspect\nof our perceptions which is at the\nbase of our humanity. And yet it\nhappens; individuals are tortured,\nimprisoned without charge,\nsometimes for decades and\nmurdered. It happens, in many\nparts of the world; it happens on\na large scale.\nIt is easy to say that those who\nperpetrate the crimes must be\nsick\u2014and so no doubt they are.\nBut the chain of responsibility can\nbe long. Those who initiate the\nactions are remote from the scene\nof the crimes; those who carry\nthem out, may convince\nthemselves\u2014and they may indeed\nbe right \u2014that protest would turn\nthe individual or his family into\nvictims. Those who initiate the\nactions may have no need and\nindeed no desire to remember.\nThis is why a blazing light\nilluminating the crimes can be so\nremarkably effective. It forces the\nperpetrators to remember. That\nwhich can otherwise be buried in\na dark recess of the mind can no\nlonger be controlled. The thing\nbecomes known to family, friends,\nacquaintances, to the public at\nlarge, but above all to the\nperpetrator himself. To focus this\nlight of knowledge and of\nself\u2014knowledge is the primary\nrole of the Human Rights\nMovement.\nIt is a task which has been\nperformed with brilliant success\nby Amnesty International.\nAmnesty has succeeded, over a quarter of a century in retaining\nits integrity, rarely challenged even\nby those responsible for the crimes\nit is exposing, rarely\nchallenged\u2014never successfully.\nAmnesty International has\nshown how one can fight\u2014and\nwin using as weapons nothing\nmore than information carefully\nsought, and relentlessly exposed.\nThey deserve our fullest support\nduring the Human Rights\nweek\u2014and beyond.\nProfessor Eric Ash\nThe Reality of Torture\n\"I felt a shock of burning heat\nspread all over my body ...I cried\nout in terrible pain ...my whole\nbody trembled because of the high\nelectric charge streaming through\nit\". Like countless other victims\nunder differing political systems,\nhe had simply been taken into\ncustody by government agents\nwithout any pretence of legality.\nDespite a universal ban on\ntorture proclaimed by the United\nNations, the practice - ordered or\ncondoned by governments -persists. Allegations of the\ntorture and ill-treatment of\nprisoners have come from more\nthan 90 countries since the start\nof the decade: in many electric\nshocks, sexual assaults, severe\nbeatings and mock executions\nhave become routine. In certain\ncountries doctors take part in\ninterrogations while the state and\ncourts shield the torturers.\nWhy Oppose Torture?\nEvery act of torture is a violation of human dignity and\ninternational law. As such it is\nprohibited under the\nconstitutions of many nations, is\nan offence under the criminal law\nand contravenes key international\ntreaties that protect human\nrights.\nApologists for torture often\nargue that it is justified in the\ndefence of society and innocent\nlives. The truth is that this\nargue ment does not fit the facts.\nTorture is commonly inflicted as\nEmpty Vessels Make Least Noise\nHow many people are killed each\nyear by repressive regimes\u2014 one\nthousand, ten thousand? The\nnumber is tiny compared with the\nnumber dying of hunger. Fifteen\nmillion children die every year\nfrom malnutrition and easily\npreventable disease such as that\ncaused by poor sanitation\u2014\nthat's one every two seconds.\nMexico's debt crisis of 1982\ncaused a30% drop in wages in\nreal terms, a colossal increase in\nmass poverty. So surely fighting\nhunger should be the priority, not\nindulging ourselves with fighting\nfor philosophical luxuries such as\n'freedom'.\nBut both issues are inextricably\nlinked. The most obvious way to\nreduce political opposition is to\ngive the population something else\nto think about, and nothing\nconcentrates the mind so much as\na daily battle for survival.\nMeasures such as this are easy to\ntarget, for example, if any area is\npressing for self-government then\ndivert aid away from it, and if the\nfarmers are protesting then raise\ntaxes to a very high level. A breadwinner struggling to support\na family won't join a trade union,\nor attend a protest meeting\nbecause they don't have the time\nor have too much to lose if those\nin power decide to take sanctions\nagainst them. Hunger has many\nadvantages over less imaginative\nforms of political control: it\ndoesn't need paying and equipping\nlike an army and punitive taxes\nraise money. Also it doesn't make\nsuch an obvious story for the\nforeign press which likes photos of\nbodies, tanks and weapons on the\nfront page, not a body which has\ndied from a vim s caught from\ndrinking polluted river water. In\nEthiopia, for example, the\ngovernment has attempted to keep\naid away from rebel areas.\nYet the way that the aid system\nworks is an open invitation to a threatened country to use this type\nof tactic. Firstly, the way the\ndeveloped world operates ensures\nthat the rest of the world is kept\ngenerally poor, so that a huge\nnumber of people all over the\nworld are vulnerable to even small\nreductions in income. Secondly\nthere is a move away from\nmultilateral aid (eg through the\nWorld Bank) and towards\nbilateral, government to\ngovernment, aid due to the\nincreased political influence this\ngives. At their worst bilateral\ndeals consist of free military\nhardware, which provide excellent\nplaythings for the armed forces,\nincreasing their ability to inflict\npain and suffering on the\npopulation and strengthening their\npolitical position. But as argued\nabove, even when the assistance\nconsists of grain or cheap loans it\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 31st19861025 Years of the Battle for\nHuman Rights\nTwenty five years ago a British\nlawyer, Peter Benenson,\nencountered the case of two\nstudents in Portugal who had\nbeen imprisoned for drinking a toast to freedom. His first\nreaction was to protest\nindignantly to the Portuguese\nEmbassy, however he realised\nthat his efforts alone would be\nlost. During the 50's Benenson\nhad witnessed a number of\npolitical trials as an observer and\nalso as a defence counsel, and\nwas familiar with the problems.\nPeter Benenson's genius was in\nrealising the power of public\nopinion and organised\ncampaigning. He wrote an article\nin The Observer called \"The\nForgotten Prisoners\" in which he\ndrew attention to the large\nnumber of people around the\nworld imprisoned for their\nbeliefs. The article also launched\na campaign called \"Appeal for\nAmnesty 1961\" whose object was\nto obtain an Amnesty for all\nPolitical and Religous prisoners\nheld for their views alone -prisoners of conscience. Part of\nthe campaign was the founding\nof an office in London to gather\ninformation about such prisoners\nand to publicise individual cases.\nThe appeal attracted\nconsiderable support from\naround the world and from it\ngrew the organisation Amnesty\nInternational. The founders\ndemonstrated considerable\nforesight in laying down\nguidelines for the development\nof Amnesty. They realised that it\nhad to avoid becoming a political\ntool of any one country or party\nfor its campaigns to maintain\ntheir influence. Hence all funding\ncomes entirely from subscriptions\nand donations and Amnesty\nremains very much a volunteer\norganisation. An International\nCouncil scrupulously controls\npolicy decisions and lays down\nguidelines for funding. In\naddition Amnesty enjoys special\nstatus with the United Nations\nand many other multi-nation\nbodies.\nSince its inception Amnesty\nInternational has stuck very\nclosely to its original aims and\nthis policy has taken it to the\nforefront of the Human Rights\nmovement. The testaments of\nmany released prisoners are a measure of the concern its letter\nwriting campaigns can generate\nin even the most despotic\ngovernments. Its mandate is\nbased on the civil and political\nrights set down in the United\nNations Declaration of Human\nRights of 1948 and on the UN 'Declaration of Protection of all\nPersons from Torture and other\nCruel Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment' of\n1975. It seeks:\nThe release of people detained\nanywhere, regardless of race,\ncolour, wealth, politics or\nreligion, on the basis of their\nbeliefs, provided they have\nnot used violence.\nFair and prompt trials for\nall political prisoners.\nThe abolition of torture and\ndegrading treatment of any\nprisoners, including abolition\nof the death penalty.\nAmnesty does not oppose or\nsupport any government, nor\ndoes it confine its attention to\ngovernments alone as there are\nmany private and opposition\ngroups who use inhuman\nmethods. Amnesty is concerned,\nnow and in the future, with\npeople as people.\nHuman Rights - A Challenge\nIt is very difficult to find things\nto care about. Every day we are\npresented in the media with\nimages, factual and fictional,\nwhich are tailored to titillate our\nemotions. Sex, scandal and death\nmake 'good' news and 'good'\nsoap. There are also a large\nnumber of good causes around\ncompeting for our charity -competing also with the daily\nbarrage of advertising exhorting\nus to spend out on ourselves. So\nwhy should you give a damn\nabout Human Rights Week, its\nall just the \"trendy lefties\" again\nisn't it? - Wrong.\nHuman Rights are not a political issue. Quite simply if\nyou are not repulsed by some of\nthe treatment dealt to innocent\nand defenceless people, because\nthey are not conforming to the\nwishes of the powers that be,\nSIMMS'\nii mii ii(|i\"\"\"\" U Castlereagh interrogation\ncentre in Belfast, one of\nthe subjects of an\nAmnesty Report on torture\nin 1971 and a reminder\nthat rights abuses can\ncreep close to home\nthen you are sick. Human Rights\nWeek is an attempt to publicise\nthe true nature of the abuse of\nhuman beings for the sake of\npower in a disturbingly large part\nof the world today.\nThe organisation Amnesty\nInternational has a special place\nin the defence of basic Human\nRights. It is uniquely\nindependent. When I first\nencountered Amnesty I was\nstruck both by the indisputable\njustice of its cause and by the\ncommitment shown by its\nworkers. In fact for a largely\nvoluntary organisation it\ndemonstrates a remarkable\ndegree of ef fec ien cy and\nprofessionalism. Here I believe is\nsomething I can care about.\nHuman Rights Week is not a purely Amnesty event. I must\nemphasise that there will be\nparticipation from groups\nconcerned about rights abuse as\npart of their own fields of\ninterest, and that they are not\nnecessarily part of any Amnesty\ncampaign. However as this year\nmarks the 25th anniversary of the\noriginal Amnesty appeal it seems\nfitting to highlight the work of\nAmnesty International.\nThere are another set of\nreasons behind this supplement.\nAs with most things at Imperial\nthis event is being organised by a small group of people who have\nmanaged to drum up the energy\nto care about something. I find it\ndistressing, in an institution full\nof supposedly highly intelligent\npeople, that the number of\nstudents who are really bothered\nby moral issues is very small.\nThere is of course IC Rag, but let\nus examine the motivation behind\nthis worthy cause a little closer.\nRag is a release from the stress of\nwork, an excuse to act like a looney and have fun in a good\ncause. Sure keeping the totals\nclimbing is a great idea but for\nmost people that is a status\nThe effectiveness ot\nAmnesty letter\nwriting campaigns\nhas demonstrated\nthe power of mass\nopinion\nsymbol to show how good they\nare at 'raking it in'. Money is not\nenough to solve the world's problems, each and every one of\nus has to care about the\nimportant issues facing humanity.\nThe effectiveness of Amnesty\nletter writing campaigns has\ndemonstrated the power of mass\nopinion. You must show that you\ncare or accept accusations of\napathy, ignorance or\ncomplacency. All that is asked\nfor is an intelligent attitude to\npublic debate and perhaps the\nwriting of a letter. If there is any\nstudent here who cannot attempt\nany of those I pity them.\nThanks are due to: The Rector,\nProf Ash for sparing his time so\ngraciously; Amnesty International\nfor material and assistance;\nSimon Bosher for organising the\ntimetable of events; Event\norganisers; Dave Jones for\nallowing production of this\nsupplement; The contributors for\ntheir work; and you in the\nanticipation that you will read\nthis...\nMark Cottle\n\n"
