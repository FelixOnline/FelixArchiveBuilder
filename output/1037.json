    "content": "TWENTY-TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 0 TH1995 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY TIM ST. CLAIR Bayley' s last words? Dear Felix,\nI am extremely sad that fellow students regard members of\nImperial's Conservative Society\nas having \"inherent prejudices\".\nNothing could be further from\nthe truth! Our range of political\nopinions are voiced at our many\ndebates! You will rarely find two\nof our members agreeing on all\nissues!\nWe do not toe the Party line\nin all cases, and have fundamental\ndisagreements with some poli-cie s. The society is a hot-bed of\npolitical activity and Ian Bayley\ndoes not reflect the opinions of\nevery member! In committee we\noften say you are wrong and tell\nhim why. The events over the last\nfew weeks have certainly shown\nthat Consoc is now open for\nbusiness!\nGeoff Boon\nWhat a relief for everyone.\nDear Felix,\nI must respond to Mr.\n\"Name retained. Exactly\" of\nFelix 1036 who called my \"reactionary\" despite agreeing with my\nWWW article about Rupert\nMurdoch. Most people who have\nactually read my article would\nsee Felix's column-filler as \"melo-dramatic\" and my article was no\nmore \"defamatory\" or \"libellous\"\nthan anything (s) he (the letter\nwriter) has written about me.\nI have in fact consulted aPG law student friend of mine from\nCity University about my article\nand he has assured me that there\nis no possibility of legal action.\nNor will ICU withdraw my article from our Web site since it at\nleast is \"politically neutral\".\nIf my society is to be the\nonly forum for political debate I can live with it. That is one of the\nimportant roles that political parties play. It is for Felix to decide\nwhether it wants to provide the\nforum that so many IC students\nneed. My experience is that it\ndoesn't want to. Felix made no\nattempt to cover the issues of the\nNUS campaign last year and concerned itself only with campaign\nfunding and with guessing the\noutcome. Lunchtime debates\nwere the medium of discussion,\nnot Felix, and so it continues wi h our society.\nI wrote my reply to Felix\nbecause I always respond when\nmy society is wrongly attacked. It\nwas Felix that was responsible for\nputting me in that position and it\nis you, Mr. \"Name retained\" that\nis responsible for this reply if you\nreally think that it counts as\n\"publicity\". I hope this will be an\nend to the matter and that I won't need to clarify the obvious\nagain.\nIan Bayley\nConservative Chairman\nA small point: IC Union set\nup pro- and anti-NUS campaign\ngroups in order to give the voters\nthe information they would\nneed. All IC media (including\nFelix) were required to be impartial on the NUS debate, and thus\ncould not run commentary\nwhich might be construed as\nattempting to influence the outcome of the referendum.\nBy the way, congratulations\non your promotion from a humble student society to\nWestminster party politics....\nEnts repents Dear Felix,\nHaving read your editorial\nlast week about Ents, its music\npolicy and people's views about it\n(including mine!), I hope I can\nanswer some of the valid points\nraised.\nFirstly, the music. Obviously\nthis is all a matter of personal\ntaste, but I have to agree that in\nthe past we haven't exactly accomodate da huge variety of tastes,\nand I'm sure I'm not the only one\nwho quickly loses interest in\nrepetitive 4/4 beats. So, to try\nand balance that this year we've\nchanged our approach to Friday\nnights, by putting on \"specialist\"\nnights to cover those areas we\nmay have previously neglected,\nsuch as indie, funk, soul and hip-hop, and mainstream student\n\"classics\". The hope is that these\nwill attract the people who normally dismiss the music as\n\"crap\". (Dates are on the year-planner, and will be advertised\nwell in advance.)\nSecondly, it's easy to com-plain, but not make a contrib u tion. The choice of music may\nnot appeal, but to a certain\nextent, that's as much a fault of\nthe people who aren't involved as\nit is down to the DJs.\nUnfortunately, if that's how you\nwant to see it, most of the current Ents DJs want to play dance\nmusic - which makes it hard to\nplay a huge variety of music. So,\nif you're a fan of music that does-n't get played too much, why not\ncome to an Ents meeting at l pm on a Tuesday in the Union Office\nand have your say?\nObviously, I want the events\nwe stage within our limited budget to appeal to as many people\nas possible - not just a minority\nwho argue about BPMs and\nremixes. Also, I'd like people to\ncome to the Union for \"events\"\nnot just for a bar extension. Not\neveryone may like what we do,\nbut at least we are trying to do\nsomething - can everyone who\ncomplains say the same ?\nFinally to anyone who does\ngenuinely assess the value of the\nUnion on an individual DJ's musical taste, can I suggest that\nthey open their eyes and see the\nreally important things the Union\ndoes, but never gets credit for?\nCheers for letting me have a say.\nMark.\nEvents & Marketing Manager.\nYou're welcome, Mark. But\nlet me get this straight - incessant dance every Wednesday\n(which is free), and every other\nkind of music on Friday nights\n(which, presumably, we'd have\nto pay for)? Does this really\nredress the balance?\nAt risk of being one of the\ndo-nothing complainers, I'd rather see themed evenings both\ndays. (Besides, there's no-one in\nthe Felix office on Friday nights\nanyway...)\nDear Editor,\nHaving read your editorial in\nlast weeks Felix, I would like to\npoint out a few things, as I get\nthe impression you don't exactly\nknow what you're talking about.\nWith the massive variety of\npeople at Imperial comes a massive variety of musical taste\n(unfortunately). However, on an\naverage Wednesday night, a lot of\nthe people who come and dance\nin the Ents lounge are pissed-up\nmembers of the various sports\nclubs around college, and all most\nof them want to hear is \"the tackiest of dance music\" and we\nalways get people asking for\nParklife. I would like to know if\nyou have any ideas as to what\ntype of music we could play to\nplease everybody. When we are\nDJing we receive requests for\nevery type of music you could\nimagine, and then some more,\nand there is no way we can play\nall of them. I cannot, and will not\nspeak for the other DJs, but I will\ntry and play to the crowd, if\nsomeone requests a song, I will\nplay it if I think the rest of the\npeople will like it. Quite often I will not play it, because everybody except the person who\nasked for it will very probably go\nto the bar and not come back.\nThe amount of abuse we receive\nfor not playing Oasis, for exam-ple, when everybody is dancing\naway (quite happily) to \"dance\nmusic\" you would not believe.\nI 've had the needle taken off the\nrecord I 've been playing, been\nspat at, people have bared their\n\n"

The decor is fantastic, with the occasional china pig or chicken amongst the oak pan-el ling. Entering the Shack, you move through a well fitted bar and down into the moodily lit\nseating area. It could almost be\nNew Orleans (or possibly even\nChicago).\nThe bar is well stocked and\nserves a wide range of cocktails -there's a Happy Hour for those\nfew alcoholics amongst us. We were already well\noiled, however I may return later for a Margherita or two.\nA large sign on the wall bears the motif\n\"Bone Appetit\" - indeed if you come here you\nwould do well to try the ribs. My companion did\n- the ribs were not \"spare\", but succulent baby\nribs, with a fantastic barbeque sauce. This sauce\nplays havoc with your eating manners - be prepared for the useful plastic bib. They came with\nlovely fried potatoes and a kind of coleslaw, both\nup to the standard of the main offering.\n\"be prepared\nfor the useful\nplastic bib\"\nWhile my companion was \"ribbed\", I had\nchosen the chicken BUT, which was spot on.\nEverything was crisp and fresh, the sandwich as\nworthy as the Harrods club sandwich - sadly no\nlonger available.\nAfter such a great main course, we turned\nquickly to desert. My companion chose the hot\npecan pie, which turned out to be\nfantastic while I plumped for the\nkey lime pie, which was unfortunately nothing more than a lemon\ntart, although it was light and deliriously sharp.\nThe Rib Shack is the perfect restaurant\nfor a party, or perhaps just a social lunch.

Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh\ndear.\nYou know, whenever I go to review films, I have to stop myself from writing the review in\nmy head before I get there, to avoid letting my\nprejudices affect my appreciation of the movie.\nBut my pre-view review was right in this\ncase; in fact, I'd go so far as to say it was generous. The poop sheet quoted the director as\nhoping that people would leave the theatre\nthinking, \"What a good story\", rather than\n\"What great special effects\" or \"What great\nfight scenes\". I left the theatre thinking, \"That's an hour and forty minutes of my life down the\ntoilet\".\nThe only way I can possibly justify such a waste of my time is by writing this and telling\nyou to avoid this film at all costs. It wasn't just\nbad, it was baa ad it went beyond mere awful,\nway past utterly dreadful, and (hyperbole be\ndamned) disappeared over the horizon of the\ntruly terrible.\nThe story was pathetic and puerile, the\ncharacters were one-dimensional, and what\ndialogue existed was so clich ed it was comedic.\nAs mindless entertainment, this was a perfect\ntranslation of the arcade game. As a film, how-ever, it stank.\nIn the end, the only nearly redeeming features of the film were the fight scenes and special effects and, stunning though they were,\nthey weren't enough to make sitting through\nthe rest worthwhile.

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 0 TH1995 NEWS\nJenkin Harks back to Thatcher\n\" We' ve got to be on our mettle in the months ahead\" BY ANDY SINHARAY\nOne of the yo L ingest members of the Parliamentary\nConservative Party, Mr Bernard\nJenkin, spoke for an hour to an\nImperial College Consoc meeting\non 'The Changing Face of\nConservatism', reflecting particularly on 20th century history.\nOne of his few comments on the\npresent political situation was\nthat: \"We've got to be on our\nmettle in the months and years\nahead\".\nHaving just shared a taxi to\nImperial College with Margaret\nBeckett, former deputy leader of\nthe Labour Party, Mr Jenkin\nreminded his audience of the\nWinter of Discontent and economic collapse in the 1970s. The\n_MP for North Colchester was 20\nwhen Margaret Thatcher was\nelected, \"[when] Trotskis and\nCommunists were in the main-stream\". He went on to mention\nthe UK's \u00a32bn loan from the\nInternational Monetary Fund and\ncited the circumstances of the\nday as the reasons for the election\nBernard Jenkin, MP, addressed the Conservative Society on Wednesday Photo: Andy Sinharay\nof Mrs Thatcher. He also spoke\nof his and the Conservative\nParty's position with regard to\nEurope and how the end of the\ncold war also brought about an\nend to Europe's stability, citing\nthe war in the former Yugoslavia\nas a prime example.\nBut the talk wasn't all policy:\nMr. Jenkin gave an anecdote of\nhis taxi journey to South\nKensington with Labour's Margaret Beckett, who went to 'a very posh restaurant' with a 'jour-na list from the Sun'. This youthful Member of Parliament surpassed himself in the entertainment role, as one attend ee suggested that Mr Jenkin's impression of Enoch Powell would even\nhave put Rory Bremner to shame.\nWillis Displinary to be Re-run\nBY ALEX FEAKES\ncontinued from page 1\n'unhappy' with the outcome of\nMonday's disciplinary meeting,\nand was visibly incensed shortly\nafter its conclusion. Informed\nsources suggest that his punishment includes suspension of\nImperial College Union membership and a \u00a3100 fine.\nOthers have insisted that\nthis is not the case and that the\nforwarding of a motion of no confidence to the next Council\nmeeting was Mr Willis' greatest\nreprimand. It appears that the\nfollowing morning Mr Willis\nlodged an appeal against the\nCommittee's decision.\nAt Tuesday evening's Executive Committee meeting,\nthe matter was discussed and\ntechnical points were raised over\nthe of the previous day's pro-cee dings. The disciplinary needed\nto have at least six members present to be quo rate, but there\nwere only five present.\nSubsequently Mr Willis received\nword that he could request a rerun of the Disciplinary hearing\nwith different members on the\npanel, or that he could go ahead\nwith his original appeal.\nThe forceful reaction of the\nCommittee goes against the\napparent exoneration of Mr\nWillis by College Security, who\nnoted the Rag Chair's 'commend-able actions' on hearing of the\nfresher's condition.\nConcern has been expressed\nthat College's anxiety over drinking issues influenced the\nExecutive Committee decision,\nwith further questions being\nraised by the non-appearance at\nthe disciplinary meeting of the\nbiochemistry fresher at the centre of the affair.\nSpeaking to Felix, Imperial\nCollege Union President, Sarah\nWhite, refused to comment on\nthe substance of the\nCommittee's decision, or the\nlater Executive Committee\nmeeting. She did say that the\nhearing's decision had been unanimous, and that the outcome was\n'felt to be appropriate'. She said\nthat Willis knew in advance that\nthe meeting would be in quo rate, and he had not objected.\nResponding to the threat of a vote of no-confidence in the\nExecutive, mooted by one of Mr\nWillis's supporters, Ms White\nsaid that she had 'heard nothing\nof it' and pointed out that similar\nmeasures against ' previous\nPresidents had never come to\nanything.\n\n"

They were camp\nand jaunty -1 hated Erasure. Upon receipt of this\nalbum I was rubbing my hands in figurative anticipatory glee of being very, very nasty about it and\nwas already furiously jotting down derogatory\nphrases.\nImagine then, if you will, my horror on listening to it when I discovered that I actually liked\nit.

Perhaps The\nCamp Music Lover or Erasure's No. I Groupie?music ed.)\nAmongst many highlights, the track to listen\nfor is the ten minute epic, 'Fingers and Thumbs',\nin which Vince's swirling soundscapes are simultaneously married to and ridiculed by one of the\ncatchiest tunes of the year.\nThere seems to be something here for every-one, from the pure... erm... Erasure-ness of 'Love\nthe way you do so' to the scarify proficient ambience of 'Rock me gent iy'. This is the album every\nfan has been waiting for - the one with which they\ncan approach their sceptical cronies shouting,\n'Ah! See! Erasure really are immortal gods!\"\n(Let's just calm down here, please - music ed.)\nIf this album had been released five years ago\nit would have set the pop standard for the\ndecade. However, it wasn't so it hasn't and I fear\nthat like my friends, Erasure's audience has\ngrown up and are now listening to losers' music,\nalso known as Britpop\u2122, depending on the drugs\nthey took at the start of the nineties. So perhaps\nthis is an album you might not want to buy but\ncertainly it's one to shoplift (not if you're a law-abiding citizen - music ed.j or to tape off your\nmate's girlfriend's mum. (8)\n\n"

Peru\nwas home of the Incas\nuntil the Conqistadors\nslaughtered them all. I know that sounds harsh,\nbut what the\nSpaniards did\nover there\nrivals some J of the \\\nBritish i| colonial\natrocities.\nAnyway, we arrived in Lima airport\nand the ride into the city showed us a capital that is dirty, grey, smoggy and\nalmost perpetually overcast (sounds\nlike Sheffield?) - indeed it is said that\nafter the Spanish conquered the\nIncas, they asked them where would\nbe a good place to build their\ncapital.The Incas, in revenge, pointed\nthem to where Lima is now, a place\nthat gets nine months of fog a year. I don't know if this is true, but if it is,\nthen it is apt revenge.\nDepressed by the place and worried by\ntales of crime, we immediately caught an\novernight bus to Pern's second city,\nAfequipa.This city is in the western Peruvian\nAndes and lies at an altitude of 1600m already higher than Ben Nevis and yet over\n61XXX.X) people live here. It was from this base\nthat we visited Colca Canyon, supposedly the\nworld's deepest. Standing at the lip of the\nany oh^ the bottom vic^ Flkm away was\nscarcely visible, however, it was not the bottom\nthat we were there to see but the great condors\nthat soar on the morning thermals in search of\nprey. They glide past you with an effortless\ngrace, seemingly as curious about you as you're\nabout them, and their true dimensions only\nbecome apparent when their shadow passes\nover you and their wingspan covers seven feet.\nOn the walk back to the village we were\ntreated to the sight of the nearby (but\nfortunately not too nearby) volcano,\n'Sabancaya', erupting. The Andes, a^ geologically young chain of mountains are\n\" V still active and volcanoes are to be\nfound from Ecuador down to\nChile.

If you regularly\nbuy books you should. In case you don't know this ancient agreement merely takes\nthe form of a cartel whereby retailers agree\nto charge their customers exactly the same\nprice for a 'net' book (generally a book\nwhose price is printed on the cover). Very\nrecently a few major publishers (Penguin\namongst them) withdrew themselves from\nthe agreement, thus offering book shops the\nopportunity to sell their publications at a reduced price (a freedom most other retailers have always enjoyed).\nIt was the mighty and blustering Dillons\nwho attempted to force the issue of discounting books during the early 90's, but at\nthe time were fended off with sharp pointy\nsticks by the combined muscle of the powerful publishers and the BA. Dillons'\nattempt to demolish the cartel was centred\naround rather clumsy promotions involving\nwhat were technically 'not-net' books anyway (you can charge what you want for a non-net book). Pressure from supermarkets\n(who now sell books, you may have noticed)\nand the few dissenting publishers who have\n\"you will not\nfind this or any\nother book\nshop selling Dr\nStephenson's Mathematical\nModels for\nScience\nStudents at half\nprice\nbetter deals to the customer. Unless smaller\nindependent shops form a buying 'collective'\nthey will be unable to match the discounts\noffered by the likes of WH Smith, and may\ngo out of business. Alternatively we may see\nthe high street giants throttling each other in\na desperate attempt to undercut the other's latest offer.\nAny discount promotions you see on the\nhigh street leading up to Christmas are likely\nto be based around a limited range of titles -bestsellers, 'seasonal' books, and so on.\nBecause academic text books lie outside this\nfield of battle you will not find me or any\nother book shop selling Dr Stephenson's Mathematical Models for Science Students at\nhalf price. My main concern is to provide the\nbest, most efficient, effective service to the\nstudents and staff of this college. On books as\nwell as items of stationery I certainly aim to\ncharge to lowest prices anywhere. Indeed, if\nyou buy a text book or an item of stationary\nand subsequently find you could have purchased it cheaper elsewhere we will happily\nrefund the difference.\nSo, what discount we will be able to offer\non Penguin's top selling paperbacks, for\n'de-netted' will surely now bring the whole\nthing to a head.\nOf course, booksellers can only offer discounts which are able to be soaked up by the\nmargins they negotiate from each individual\npublisher. The big chains, with their\nimmense buying power, are likely to offer\ninstance, remains to be seen. The situation\nwill, I expect, evolve quite dramatically over\nthe next year. I will be monitoring the situation carefully - we have to be competitive,\nand this involves supplying the best service'we\npossibly can. So, please continue to use your\nbookstore - it is being run for your benefit.\n\n"

FIVE\nFirst amongst equals?\nIt would not be presumptuous\nto suggest that amongst the\nmany factors considered by a sixth former in choosing a University the most important is the academic strength\nof relative institutions.\nHow would such decisions\nbe made though if all\ninstitutions were equal?\nNo this isn'ta hypothetical\nquestion on a Marxist sociology\npaper but an idea that is\ncurrently being given serious\nconsideration by the\nCommittee of Vice\nChancellor's and Principal's( CVCP). Not content with\nassisting the Government in\nshepherding reluctant underachieves into institutions of\ndubious quality, they now\napparently believe that many\nuniversities enjoy unfair\nadvantage over others because\nof unavailing considerations\nsuch as location, extra\ncurricular opportunities and\nsocial life. Instead, the CVC P argue prospective student's should only base decisions on\nquality - levelling the playing\nfield means sixth former s will\nmake more reasoned decisions.\nMoreover, institutions which\ncurrently codify the\neducational underclass will\nenjoy a greater slice of the very\nlimited cash cake.\nAre all universities\nequal? The CVCP likes\nto think so, as Nooman\nHaque explains.\nMaintaining standards\nrequires recruiting and keeping\nthe best staff and ensuring all\nimportant research facilities are\nmodern accessible and\navailable. To equalise equality\ntherefore would require a redistribution of these\nresources through legislation.\nOne may laugh at images of\nremoval men wheeling away\nexpensive PET scanning\nequipment from Cambridge to\nthe Luton College of further\nand continuing adult education\n(established as a university in\n1994, of course), where\npresumably bright student's who are naturally attracted by\nglass, concrete and a student\nunion housed in a Portacabin,\nwould relish in the new\nUtopian education system. It\nmay bring a chuckle to read the\noratorical EC-like directive\nwhich would banish all\nirrelevant factors from the\ndecision making process.\nHowever the architects of\nthis ambitious plan have\ndisplayed deeply flawed logic\nand an inability to appreciate\nwhat university life is all about.\nThat is not funny.\nThere are implications here\nfor university funding. If the\nnext government introduces\neither a loan system to cover\nmaintenance or a top up loan to\ncover fees, then student's will\ndemand value. The quality an\nindividual enjoys is embedded\nin the overall quality of the\nphysical environment of the\ninstitution. The existence of\nskill enhancement and pure\nenjoyment through extra\ncurricular activity is central to\nthe lives of many students.\nA culture of enforced\negalitarianism removes\naspiration and achievement and\nthus harms standards sending\nthem spiralling downwards. It\nis by any definition a Marxist\nsolution and will promote\nconflict between the\ninstitutions and the CVC P which will be deleterious to\ncampus life.\nUniversity should not only\nbe a time for gaining formal\nqualifications, but in addition a time for self reflection and\nprofessional development.\nSuch immeasurable benefits\nare dependent on stimulating\nand free learning environments\nwhich will always differ from\none university to another. The\nfailure of the CVC P to realise\nthis merely underlines their\ndetachment from the real\nworld and strengthens the\nargument for reform in their\nranks.\n\n"

Things came together in the\nsecond half, thanks to some\nsound defence by Freddy and\npositive forward play from the\ntwin brothers Karsten and\nCantona-contemporary Michelle.\nBoth goals came from Digger,\nand apologies are extended to\nPauli for a smart kick in the\nhead and 5+ stitches\nIC WOMEN'S ISTS: The football\nseason got off to a great start for\nIC's womens teams. The level of\nplay was high, though our navigational skills were somewhat\nlower. After misreading platform\nnumbers at Waterloo, changing\ninto kit at Surbiton High Street,\nand running to meet our opposition in Cobham; we were all\nexhausted\nYet this was not not at all\nreflected in play.\nOur first goal was scored by\nChristine within seconds of the\nfirst whistle. Not five minutes\nlater, our dynamic striker\nKendra booted a beautiful l ball\ninto the back of the net. After\nhalf-time the score was doubled\nwhen centre-back Steph got\nbored and decided to run past\nStGeorge's \"Diabolical Defence\"\nand score for fun; this was followed by a further goal from\nKendra.\nUCL were shocked to find\nour new Norweigan weapon and\nAmerican Ace who between\nthem scored four goals. The\nmatch started well with a goal in\nthe first five minutes. But all too\nsoon they were up 2-1, when\n\"that fast girl\" took a run at the\ndefence. While UCL celebrated\nIC kicked in more goals, putting\nus way ahead - UCL had no\nhope of catching us. The other\ntwo goals were scored by the\nCanadian Crusader and Green\nCrusader.\nIC 1 STS: The game lasted 90\nminutes but unfortunately the\nIC Men's1st didn't;a makeshift\nteam consisting of several pie-eaters from the seconds surprisingly took control from the start\nwith Roddy Herreis kicking\nevery h ting that came near him.\nThis was rewarded when, after\nfine work by Pierre on the left,\nRoddy slotted the ball into the\nsprout bag. However, lack of fitness showed, with UCL equal is ing on the stroke of half-time\nafter Phil Siverns and Roddy\nfailed to clear, having been distracted by a passing pie van.\nThe second half saw IC\nretake the lead with Mark lobbing the keeper following a punt\nup field from Tony. After this,\nIC had the lion's share of the\nplay with commanding performances from Richie and Crispin\non the right, and Tony and\nMatteo solid in defence.\nIt was at this point that\nDixon was thought to have \"run\nfor the ball\", but this has since\nbeen discounted as a vicious\nrumour. Unfortunately IC were\nunable to extend their lead and\nthe inevitable UCL equalise r came within three minutes to\ngo. Not a bad result for the fat\nboys though, and the season\nlooks promising if we can only\nkeep Dixon away from\nMacDonalds....\nIC 4TH S: IC fourth's campaign\nstarted with a good performance\naway at UCL. Although goalless,\nthe match swung from end to\nend producing great excitement\nfor the spectator.\nChances were missed by\nboth sides and perhaps the IC's captain, Morgan Hill, can count\nhimself unluckiest after hitting\nthe woodwork twice. Solid performances also by the defence,\nnotably Jez and Michael in the\ncentre, and Stuart in goal. The\nmidfield was dominated by\nSteph who instigated many of\nIC's better moves.\nnetball1 STS: It was a new look team\nand everyone was apprehensive\nas to how the match would go.\nLast year the UCL team got\nthrought o the last eight in the\nBUSA tournament so we knew\nwe had our work cut out.\nThe first quarter went really\nwell; the defence were exceptional, for sci ng UCL shooters to\nmiss shots and make mistakes\nleaving the quarter-time score at\n6-4 to UCL\nIn the second quarter the\nattack tried to work the ball\naround the but the UCL defence\nwere quick and intercepted the\nweaker passes to give a halftime\nscore of 14-8 to UCL.\nWe changed our attack at\nhalf-time to accommodate some\nfresh legs which improved the\npassing in the gameplay, but we\nwere denied the end goals.\nEveryone worked extremely\nhard but couldn't seem to cut\ndown UCL's lead to leave the\nfinal score 33-13.\nWe were tired but quite\nhappy, as last season UCL beat\nus 76-16.\n2NDS: After the first team had\nstolen 11 players from the squad\nand left the seconds with only\nseven, we didn't expect too\nmuch. However, after borrowing\na star defender from UC things\nlooked more hopeful, and when\nJuliette scored the opener, we\nbegan to take control.\nTwo more goals before halftime from Helen and Shami put\nsmiles on our faces, the only\ndanger being that we would run\nout of breath before the end.\nThe half-time breather helped,\nand five (that's five) more goals\nfrom Juliette in the second half\nas well as Shami's second, left\nthe score line looking\nrespectable!\n\n"

The exhibition comprises\ncostumes, models and masks from the original\nseries and its spin-offs. Among the\ncostumes are the\nstarfleet duty\nuniforms as worn\nby the cast. There\nare also models of\nthe various ships,\ncommunicating\ndevices, t ric orders, phase rs and\nKlingon knives,\ndisplayed behind\nglass for the safety\nof the 20th century visitors. Perhaps the most\nimpressive exhibit is the full-size bridge of the\nU.S.S. Enterprise, but unfortunately the prime\nseat is reserved for Captain Kirk only.\nThere are short videos to watch, dedicated\nto each series, namely Star Trek, Next\nGeneration and Deep Space 9. However, the\nVoyager appears to be experiencing some\ntechnical difficulties with its transporter, as no\nexhibits have beamed down from the latest\nStar Trek Starship.\nInsight gets spaced with Stu Clark and Naomi Norman Throughout the exhibition there are\ncomparisons made between the ideas and\nconcepts used in Star Trek and the way\nmodem technology has mirrored them. It also\nbecomes apparent that Star Trek was\npioneering in the way that it addressed the\nsocial issues of the time.\nGabriel Allen, one of the staff and occasional\nacting captain said that the exhibition is \"Not\nnecessarily aimed at Trekkies,\" but was staged\nto prompt, \"Greater understanding of science\nand technology.\"\nVisitors to the exhibition expressed their\nsurprise at the simplicity of the costumes and\nthe relatively small size of the bridge.\nHowever, everyone appeared to\nemerge from\nthe exhibition\nhaving enjoyed\nit. For die hard\nTrekkies there\nis an opportunity to\npurchase all\nmanner of\nmemorabilia,\nranging from\nvideos to models, and more unusually ties,\nphone cards and actual outfits. For those\ninterested in the stars, Mr. Sulu, alias George\nTakei, and Mr. Spock, alias Leonard Nimoy\nwill be beaming down to the Science Museum\nin the near future (dates yet to be confirmed).\nThe exhibition runs until 25th February\n1996 and entrance, free to students of Imperial\nCollege, is via a ticket which reads \"admit\nhumans only\"!\nlife a gg sj!^:, JJ||\n' ' \u2022 i,;\"!.,L Sunspots# Astrologer Patric Walker died last week at\nthe age of 64.

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 20TH1995 NEWS\nNew Directors at\nHealth Centre\nBY JEREMY CLARKE\nIC Health Centre now has\ntwo new directors to replace Dr\nRaanan Gillon, who has just\nretired after 13 years as head of\nthe service. Dr Gillon has been\nsucceeded by Dr Irene Weinreb\n(as Director of Clinical Services)\nand Dr Alan Swan (as Director of\nOccupational Health).\nDr Gillon has left the directorship in order to take up a position as in the Humanities depart-ment, though he will remain a GP at the Health Centre two\ndays a week. Dr Gillon is the\nnew Professor of Science Ethics,\nsetting up a new centre that will\nanalysis e the ethical considerations in medical and scientific\nresearch. Speaking to Felix, Dr\nGillon said that he was keen to\nconsider the many questions that\nscientific research posed rather\nthan 'crusade a specific cause'.\nHe explained that there\nwere a variety of areas that he\nwanted to look at, including\nresearch funding and intellectual\ncopyright.\nMove Confirmed\nIt has been confirmed that\nthe Centre itself will be fully\nrelocated (Felix 1034) by the\nbeginning of next Summer. With\ntheir present site in 14 Princes'\nGardens becoming available for\nredevelopment, the question has\nyet to be answered as to whether\nthe accommodation, for which\nthe Health Centre's present site\nhas been earmarked, will be\nmade available for IC students.\nThe Director of Estates, Mr\nIan Caldwell, has told Felix that\nthe building work will commence\nduring Easter 1996, and that it\nshould be completed by the following June. The Health Centre\nwill then be relocated to the east\nend of Southside to what is\npresently the Conference Suite.\nAccording to Estates the lack of\nconference facilities will not have\na significant impact. Mr Caldwell\nmaintains that they are 'not cost\neffective' and it would not be\nworth bringing them 'up-to-date'\ngiven their infrequent use.\nThe site in Southside will be\npurpose-built, and will have larger and improved facilities.\nPresently, wheelchair access is\ninadequate, and it is also hoped\nthat the larger site will help the\nHealth Centre staff to communicate more effectively and provide\na better service for students and\nother patients.\nPhoto:William Lorenz\nDr Irene Weinreb is the new Director of Clinical Services\nDr Weinreb said that the\nstudents would feel 'more part of\nthe services' the centre being\ncloser to halls. She also stressed\nthat funding for the project has\nalready been set aside as part of\nthe Tomlinson Report for the\nimprovement of health services\nin the area. In order to supplement its growing practice, the\nHealth Centre hopes to appoint a new GP next year following the\ncompletion of the move.\nDr Weinreb was disappointed only in that the view of a garden would be lost, but generally\nshe felt that the relocation of the\nHealth Centre is of benefit to all\nconcerned, especially the\npatients.\nNews in brief\nBY ANDY SINHARAY AND NICK ADAMS\nHizb-ut-Tahrir Still Active\nThe fundamentalist Islamic\ngroup Hizb-ut-Tahrir have once\nagain been distributing leaflets\naround Imperial College. The lit-era ture, entitled \"Mediaeval\nWitch-hunt against Islam In\nBritish Universities\", has been\nfound in various departments,\nand other copies have been found\naffixed to notice boards around\nthe campus. It is not clear\nwhether IC Students or outside\nactivists are responsible for the\nrecent distribution.\nIn a related incident London\nGuildhall University was recently\nclosed down completely for an\nafternoon, on the advice of the\npolice. This was in response to a demonstration organised by the\nIslamic organisation against\nGuildhall's Student Union.\n2-way Channel Swim\nDuring the summer a second year\nmaths student from IC swam\nfrom England to France and back\nagain. Nick Adams completed\nthe 42 mile swim (the equivalent\nof 2710 lengths of a standard\npool) in an impressive 27 hours\nand 28 minutes.\nThe Channel swim, acknowledged as the ultimate in the sport\nof long distance swimming, started at 9am on Sunday June 23rd from Shakespeare Beach, Dover.\nNick swam alongside a support\nboat whose crew were kept busy\nfeeding and encouraging the\nswimmer. Feeding took place\nevery half hour and consisted of\nhot chocolate and and a carbohydrate drink, vital to prolong\nendurance. Jellyfish, strong currents and the occasional ferry had\nto be contended with.\nCalais was reached before\nsunset, and after standing on the\nbeach for a few seconds the long\nswim home through the night\nbegan, finishing at 12.28 pm on\nJune 24th. The swim will gain\nrecognition in the Guinness Book\nof Records as Nick is the\nyoungest person to swim the\nchannel in both directions.\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 simon baker Two tiling s last week led me to dunk about\nImperial College Catering. Firstly, a visit to\nLinstead Hall, which reminded me of the meals\nthat I endured there in my first year, and secondly the letter in Felix from the catering staff.\nThere is clearly something badly wrong with this\ndepartment. This may sound about as topical as\nthe German surrender, but this is precisely the\nreason why the issue needs airing. For as long as\nanyone can remember, huge losses have been\ngenerated by the M DH and SCR, completely obliterating the success of\nSouthside Bar, QT snack\nbar and Southside Shop\n(mind you, anywhere with\nprices that makes Fortnum\nand Mason look like Kwik\nSave couldn't fail to score).\nSince they operate as a near\nmonopoly supplier, this is\nunacceptable. The respective profits and losses are\nnot hard to understand. The sandwiches in the\nJCR are fairly good, and I challenge anyone to\nfind a better pint at such a price than Southside\nprovides. Where things seem to go horribly\nwrong are in the production of hot meals and\nthe like. For \u00a33.00, the inmates of Linstead Hall\nare given, on weekdays, a semi-choice between\ntwo desperate creations that have clearly been\nkept hot since lunchtime. Vegetarians are provided with such imaginative dishes as pea and\npotato curry with, to give the necessary culinary\nbreadth, peas and potatoes. In other words, it is\ncheaper and healthier to eat in McDonalds than\nin hall. Such blatant profiteering or appa ling management - the real reason - is totally unacceptable. The seemingly obvious solution is to\nopen up the main catering department (SCR,\nMDH) to tender, allowing third parties to force\nthe incumbents to improve or lose out to a more\nefficient organisation. John Foster can't blame all\nI shall not dwell on\nthe England-Norway\ngame, since football is\nnot my area of expertise, which gives me\nsomething in common\nwith Terry Venables.\nhis department's shortcomings on his staff,\nunless they leave work each day with huge sacks\nstuffed full off ivers from the tills. Losses on this\nscale are due to sloppy management and insulation from the competitive pressures of the real\nworld. College Catering exists in its current\nform because the powers that be think it should,\nnot because the customers like it that way, all\nvery reminiscent of the old public utilities.\nProviding decent meals profitably at a competitive price to 10,000 students and staff in one of\nthe most expensive areas of the country should\nnot be impossible.lt seems\nto have been a pretty lean\nweek for news both in and\nbeyond College. I shall not\ndwell on the EnglandNorway game, since football is not my area of expertise, which gives me something in common with\nTerry Venables. 'Rag Man\nAwash with Free Spirit'\nfilled me with disbelief. I remember a time when\nmales involved in this organisation were as rare\nas laughs at the launch of a Rag Mag. More noises about Felix's impartiality surfaced, and\nseemed al it de confused. Political neutrality does\nnot mean an absence of all politics. There is no\nchance of Felix ever becoming either the Daily\nStar or the Daily Mirror, and the idea that the\nnews pages will be turned 'into an arena for\npolitical mudslinging' is ludicrous. Even if the\neditor wanted to do so, which of course she\ndoesn't, it would be impossible to produce that\nmuch politically biased material in such an apolitical place as IC. By the way, my trip to\nl instead coincided with their Bar Initiation\nnight. I can assure everyone that, having witnessed their pathetic attempts to down pints\n(managed by only a handful), the prospect of\nmuch drink-related trouble from this year's fresher s is minimal.\nspaces: this week\nbarbican 0171 588 0923\nec2. tube; barbican,\nthe art of african textiles, tradition and lure x national gallery 0171 839 3321\ntrafalgar square,\ntube: charing x next door to:\nnational portrait gallery\nuntil nov 19\nJohn ko bal photographic port r air1995 royal academy 0171 439 7438\npiccadilly. tube; piccadilly circus\nuntil jan 21\nafrica: the art of a continent\nserpentine 0171 402 6075\nkensington gardens; walk it\nuntil nov 5\nsix con tempor y african artists\ntate 0171 8878000\nmillbank. tube; pimlico\nuntil nov 17\nlife patterns\nICA 0171 930 3647\ncharing cross tube; the mall\ngary hume\ndesign muse m01714036933 tower hill tube; butlers wharf\nuntil apr 10\npaul smith: true brit\n\n"

THREE\n'High Spirits' Lead to Vandalism\n\u00a320,000 Damage to\nCollege Already this Term BY JEREMY CLARKE\nAn estimate of \u00a320,000 has been\nput on the damage caused by the\nnumerous acts of vandalism\nwhich have already occurred\nacross the college campus this\nterm.\nWhile some reports say that\ntakings from various College\ndrinking establishments have fallen with respect to previous years,\nstudents appear to have kept\nthemselves occupied by other\nmeans.\nIn particular, the car park\nbarrier on Watt's Way has been\ndamaged at least three times in\nas many weeks: being missing\nmore often than present. Even\nwith a security camera pointing\ndirectly on the barrier area, Felix\nstill managed to stage the reconstruction pictured above.\nThe barrier controls the traffic in and out of the area surrounding Southside and Linstead\nhalls of residence, enabling\nImperial College security staff\nto monitor the much over-sub-scribe d parking spaces.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Ian\nCaldwell, Director of Estates,\nadmitted that an \"unfortunate\namount of damage\" has occurred.\nHe attributed much of this to\n'high spirits' in the student population. Mr Caldwell stressed that\nthe cost of the damage would be\nin the region of \u00a310,000\u00a320,000.\nHe further insisted that\nfuture replacements for some of\nthe damaged property would\nhopefully be of a more 'robust'\nnature, in an attempt to limit\nthe effects of any possible further attacks.\nSecurity sources in the past\nhave criticised the original Watts\nWay parking barrier as being far\ntoo flimsy for its designated pur-pose.\nPhoto:William Lorenz\nFelix reconstruction: the parking barrier at Watts\nWay has been particularly subject to vandalism.\nCouncil Capers Carry On\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nA total rerun of the recent\nImperial College Union Council\nelections will be proposed at an\nemergency meeting of the body,\nscheduled for next Friday.\nThe motion is being put forward by the Union's Executive\nCommittee following complaints\nthat the recent voting procedures\nwere unconstitutional.\nThe proposal does not cover\nthe election of Eric Allsop,\nCouncil Chair, even though he\nwas proposed by Matt\nCrompton, Deputy President\nFinance & Services, a move\nwhich is accepted as unlawful. It\nis being suggested that the Union\nmust have a Council Chair, a post\nwhich also carries the job of\nExecutive Chair, and that too\nmany difficulties would result in\nthe position being vacant for a fortnight.\nIf the emergency meeting of\nCouncil does accept the Exec's motion of voiding the previous\nelections, all ordinary member\nposts will become vacant for the\ntwo weeks between papers going\nup advertising the positions and\nthe subsequent elections. The\nlack of papers being posted was\nthe main basis for the argument\nthat the previous elections were\nunfair.\nSome students who wished\nto become ordinary members\nwere affronted that the elections\nhad taken place without their\nknowledge, and that therefore\nCouncil was not representative of\nthe ordinary members of\nImperial College.\nImperial College Union\nPresident, Sarah White, is being\ncriticised for the conduct of the\nelections and does personally\naccept some responsibility for the\npresent disarray saying: \"I suppose you could say that it was my\nfault.\"\nShe insists though, that the\npreparation of the elections was\nthe responsibility of the three\nSabbatical Officers during vaca-tion, and that of the whole of the\nExecutive Committee during\nterm time. It is hoped that the\nadditions to the Constitution,\nwhich recent events have shown\nto be needed, will be ready for\nthe full Council meeting in three\nweeks time.\nThe present Union\nConstitution, which was passed\njust before Christmas of last year,\ndoes not clearly state the manner\nin which ordinary member elections should proceed.\nThe forthcoming elections\nwill all be conducted under the\nSingle Transferable Voting system with ballot papers issued for\neach separate post.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 2 0 TH OCTOBER 1 9 9 5 . SEVEN\n\u2022<yy-,\n:l come to Imperial :ge. the ne x\\ three\nor four years shou it j^ b^ar nong the most\ninteresting and enjoyable in your life, provided\nyou make the most of the opportunities\navailable at College. This letter aims to give\nyou some ideas for your own self-development.\nYou can probably recall one of the\nsignificant steps in your life when you entered\nthe sixth form or went to sixth form college.\nComing to College is an even more significant\nstep. You have more freedom, more\nindependence and more opportunities to do\nyour own thing and to succeed or fail. If you do\nnot make some mistakes you will not have\nlearnt anything, learning from one's own\nmistakes is an important part of experience. But\ndon't waste time reinventing everything - build\non the experience of others - take advice (it's usually free) - ignore some of it, test it out,\naccept or reject it.\nYou have already demonstrated some\nplanning ability by passing A levels - or their\nequivalent - sufficiently well to be at College.\nHow are you going to plan the next three, four\nor six years? And I'm not talking just about your\nacademic studies, I'm talking about the rest of\nyour life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this term?\nMaking friends is normally high on most\npeople's list. How? Join clubs and societies,\nattend meetings, take up a new sport, develop\nan new interest - any of these are likely to bring\nyou into contact with like-minded students.\nAnd there's always the bar to prop up whilst\nseeking inspiration (but don't lean on it too\nheavily - Sub-Ed).\nBy the end of the summer term in your\nfirst year you are feeling the financial pressures\n- in other words you're broke! So how about\nearning some good money in the long vacation.\nIf you leave job hunting until the vac starts you\nmay be too late. All the interesting and lucrative\njobs have been filled already and you will be\nlucky if the local council wants some grass\ncutting or the garden centre needs a dirty pair\nof hands. It's well worthwhile doing some\npreliminary job hunting between Christmas and\nEaster. Call in at the IC Careers Service (Room\n310, Sherfield Building) where you will find\ninformation about Vacation training, write to\nemployers with your CV, call in to some local\nshops and hotels and see who's advertising in\nlocal press.\nVac jobs can be most informative. Ideally\nthey give you the chance to try out some type\nof work or future employer in which you are\ninterested. They give you experience in job\nhunting, letter writing and interviews, as well as\na real insight into what it's like to work for a particular type of employer. Some even pay you\nquite well. Jobs abroad are popular and early\napplications are essential. Start by visiting the\nIC Careers Service which has a good range of\nreference books and addresses.\nAt the start of the second year you raise\nyour sights higher. Now is the time to test your\nskills in organising something - a social evening\nfor your department, looking after the finances\nof a society or fixtures secretary of your team.\n\"That sounds too much like hard work\" I hear\nyou say. Yes, it does take some effort on your\npart but generally speaking the more effort you\nput into something the more enjoyment you\nwill get out of it.\nCommittee work is excellent preparation\nfor life after College. You learn to set agendas,\nrun meetings, agree actions, persuade other\nstudents to do things, work within budgets and\nend up with a successful event - a party, a visit,\na play or a newspaper. (Think how much effort\nwent into producing this edition of Felix) (don't remind me - Sub-Ed.)\nYou should start thinking seriously about\nyour future career before the end of the second\nyear. Even if you haven'ta clue what you want\nto do, that's no excuse for delaying finding out\nabout the possibilities. You are surrounded with\nsources of information - friends, family, tutors,\ncareer advisers, libraries. Start looking. It may\nbe a long process but so is life, so it is worth\nspending more time thinking about your career\nthan planning your next weekend or holiday.\nThe IC Careers Service is a good starting\nplace. Pop in and speak to the information staff.\nFind out about \"PROSPECT (HE)\" - our\ncomputer careers guidance system - and all the\ninformation booklets and reference files. Have a look at some of the videos, attend some\nseminars on careers, get yourself sorted out.\nThe Milkround is in the spring term of your\nfinal year. This is when employers visit\ncampuses to interview applicants or invite you\nto their London Offices.\nChristmas vacation courses are a popular\nway of finding out about careers such as\nmarketing but only a few major recruiters run\nthem and they are normally over-subscribed\nmany times.\nI'm telling you because you need to start\nplanning your life now, don't just drift through\nCollege and emerge with a degree and nothing\nelse. Of course a degree is important and must\nbe your first priority, but not your only priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy yourself.\n\"career\" - your job, or lack\nof it, when you leave IC.\nHandy for paying off that\ngreat big student loan the\ngovernment kindly gave you\n(not that I'm bitter or any-thing).\n\"a GOOD job\" - a Get Out\nOf Debt job. Temping or\nsome other unsatisfying but\npays-the-bills type job.\n\"vac\" - not a hoover, or the\nhome of the pope, but\nVacation, i.e. all that lovely\nfree time in August when\nyou go to Majorca to get a suntan.\n\"vac job\" - what you get\nwhen you can't afford the\nClub 18-30 holiday,\n\"develop an interest\" -...spend hours drinking with\nvarying groups of 'friends'.\n\"Committee work\" - the\nskill of delegating all work to\nsomeone else, passing the\nbuck and staying awake in\nmeetings.\n\" PROSPECT\" the computer careers guidance s ys tem, more scientific than\nthe Evening Standard's job\npage and a dart.\n\"The Milkround\" - this is\nNOT related to Unigate,\nbut is a useful way of getting\nin touch with companies.\n\n"
