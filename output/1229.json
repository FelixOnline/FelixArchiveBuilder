    "content": "college news\nULU Elections\nOn top of our own Union elections, the candidates for the\ntop posts at the University of\nLondon Union have been\nannounced, including one of\nthis year's ICU sabbaticals.\nStudents at educational\ninstitutions across the capital,\nincluding Imperial, will vote\nonline next month to decide\nwho will run the Union in the\ncoming year.\nStanding for the only contested position, that of\nPresident, are Charlotte\nDawkins of Q MUL and Chris\nPiper from Kings College.\nRob Davenport, this year's Deputy President for Clubs &\nSocieties at our Union, is\nstanding for election as ULU's Vice President for Sports. Also\nnominated are Claire Wren of\nUCL, standing for the position\nof Vice President for Finance &\nSocieties, and James MacColl,\nalso of UCL, standing for Vice\nPresident for Welfare &\nStudent Affairs.\nThere are some concerns\nabout the election, as it\nappears that voters will not\nhave the option of voting for a 'New Election' candidate,\nmeaning that those standing\nfor uncontested positions are\nalmost assured of winning\ntheir respective polls. Voters\nwill also be unable to spoil\ntheir online ballot 'papers'.\nAll UL U members, except\nthe Returning Officer and\nincluding the candidates\nthemselves, are entitled to\nvote in the election, provided\nthat they have registered for aUL U card. These can be\nobtained from Union Reception\nin Beit Quad, or from the ULU\nreception in Malet Street.\nPasswords providing access to\nthe online voting site will be\ndistributed within the next\ntwo weeks.\nULU successfully piloted its\nonline voting scheme last year,\nand this year's ULU sabbaticals were the first people in\nthe UK to be elected to public\npositions by an electronic poll.\nThe launch of the first stage\nof ULU's electronic voting\nprocess on 4 March is due to\nbe attended by Robin Cook MP\nLeader of the House of\nCommons, who is a supporter\nof introducing similar technology to future parliamentary\nballots following the small\nturnout at the 2001 General\nElection. This year's local elections will give the electorate\nthe option of voting electronically for the first time.\nMore information about the\nULU elections is available at\nwww.ul u. lon.ac.uk.\nJohn S Issue 1229\n22 February2002 Acting Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: Alex Coby\nReporter: John Stratford\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Vacant\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nComic: J With Thanks To:\nJoe, Dave, Bobby\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper:\nISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nNurses at Wye? News In Brief\nPreliminary negotiations are\nunderway between the\nauthorities at Wye and the\nNHS to provide accommodation for nurses on campus.\nThe current plan involves the\nletting of one or two buildings\nto the NHS for this purpose,\nand giving the nurses full\naccess to the bars and sports\nfacilities.\nThe Union have been\ninvolved at every stage of\nthese negotiations, and will\ncontinue to be consulted as\nthey progress. Felix has been\nassured that this deal, if it\nhappens, will be to the benefit of both the Union as a whole and the students at\nWye, and the on-going consultation should make sure\nthat this continues to be the\ncase.\nWye is already accommodating 55 cadets from the\nPolice Training academy in\nAshford. It is not thought that\nany further such ventures are\nbeing planned, as the Provost\nof Wye recently announced\nhis intention to see student\nnumbers there rise by ten percent a year for each of the\nnext five years.\nIn other news from Wye,\nFelix has learnt that College is\nin the process of disposing of\nanother of the residences\nthere - Coldharbour House - in\norder to raise funds. It is not\nyet known how this, combined with the increase in letting accommodation to non-students, will affect the\nProvost's planned increases in\nstudent numbers.\nAlex\nNUS Referendum Date Set\nA date has now been set for\nthe referendum on Imperial\nCollege Union's affiliation to\nthe National Union of\nStudents. The poll will take\nplace on 14 and 15 March in all\ndepartments. The referendum\nwill require a turnout of 15%\n(around 1800 students) in\norder for it to be valid.\nCampaining from both the\n'Yes' and 'No' camps is expected to begin in earnest after the\nimminent sabbatical elections.\nBo' Selecta\nBoanerges, one of the mascots\nof City and Guilds College,\nfeatured recently on local radio\nstation BBC London following\nits appearance at a dinner\nheld at the official City residence of the Lord Mayor of\nLondon to thank all of those\nwho entered the Lord Mayor's Show in November.\nBo', which reaches the age\nof 100 this year, took part in\nthe annual Veteran Car Club\nRun from London to Brighton\nin the same month, in which\nthe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes\nrode in the vintage car to personally deliver a message from\nthe Lord Mayor to the Mayor of\nBrighton and Hove. The event\nat Mansion House was an\nopportunity for Bo' to deliver a reply.\nOne of the presenters, resident architect Prof. Maxwell\nHutchinson, had infuriated the\nengineers by calling City and\nGuilds College an institution\nof \"typists,\" during his commentary of the show.\nJohn S "

    "content": "2Q J election interviews\nCandidate Interviews\n>#\u00bba \u00abj ty Pre^wM n^ MMlT & Societies)\nWhy do you want to do this\njob?\nI have been involved with Clubs\nand Societies since my first year\nand I think it would be a great\nopportunity to get stuck in, be\nresponsible and make a differ-en ce. What experience do you have?\nI'm approachable and a natural\nproblem solver. In particular, I have been Treasurer of the\nLadies' Football so have an\nunderstanding of the paperwork and processes involved. I have also become increasingly\ninvolved in the Union itself and\nfeel that the experience I 've\ngained can be of use to others.\nWhat's the best thing about\nClubs and societies at\nImperial?\nFor me, I think the best thing is\nthe fact that they exist because\nof volunteers. They're not doing\nit because they have to, but\nbecause they want to, and a lot\nof enthusiasm and enjoyment\ncomes with that.\nWhat's the single biggest thing\nthat you would change?\nI really want to increase the\nlinks between the campuses. I think there are a lot of people\nwho do similar things at Wye\nand Silwood, for example, who\ncould learn a lot from the clubs\nat South Ken, and vice versa.\nWhat about the differences in\nfunding between clubs?\nThere are many considerations\nthat need to be taken into\naccount when comparing clubs,\nthe primary one of which is\nwhat is actually being funded.\nFor instance, the Yacht Club\nmay require a new boat that\nmay cost several thousand\npounds, but without that fund-ing, the club couldn't exist.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nI am interested enough and\ndedicated enough to do the job,\nand I think I 'll do a good job at\nthat!\n.11 ^mm&:\nj: v:;:;:;:.];.^i IS\ni Deputy Presidemr(BaMcMion & Welfare)\nWhy do you want this job?\nI 've done a lot of positions in the\neducation structure and I 've\noften felt that they're under\nsupported.\nWhat experience do you have?\nI started off as a year rep in the\nfirst year, then I was a department rep in the second year\nand I am currently the\nAcademic Affairs Officer for\nRCSU\nWhat's the best thing about\nthe Union's Education and\nWelfare policy?\nI think the best thing is quite a lot of the volunteers who actually do the posts, some of the\nyears... the enthusiasm of the\npeople involved, and I really\nwant to use that.\nAnd the worst thing?\nIt's quite bureaucratic, too official. If someone came into your\noffice and makes a homo ph o bic/racist/sexist comment,\nhow would you react?\nI would probably let it pass,\nand assess the situation, and\nfind out what their problem is.\nDo you think that political\ncampaigning is part of your\njob?\nI would see that as something\nthat falls between my job and\nthat of the President. I think\nthat if either of us think that it's an issue, we would discuss it\ntogether, and then both decide\njointly how to go about it. I think a lot of people vote for a particular president on that,\nbased on their manifesto.\nHow will you judge your success? I want people to talk more, and\nknow who to turn to if they\nneed to.\nWhat makes you the best can-did at e?I'm the only one. I 've got experience of the academic structure,\nI 've been there and I 've done\nthat.\nStanding for All Posts\nRON means Re-Open\nNominations. If RON wins in\nany post, then new candidates\nwill be requested and another\nelection will take place.\nWhy should we vote RON?\nRON is there for those who feel\nthe real candidates wouldn't do\na good job. You can ask for new\npeople to stand for our post.\nWhat experience do the Ateam have?\nHannibal is a Colonel and what\nbetter leader can you think of?\nHe'd make a fine President.\nI'm sure BA would be a pretty\nscary DP(F&S) and wouldn't let\nanyone spend any money that\nthey weren't supposed to. I'm sure Face is charming enough\nto help everyone with their\nclubs and societies and\nMurdoch can help everyone\nwith their educational and welfare needs. The candidate for\nthe Felix Editor is Amy Allen\nwho is actually a journalist in\nthe series, so I'm sure she d fit in\nfine into that role.\nDoes RON ever want the elections to end?\nRON wants the elections to continue until there's someone suitable in each post, rather than\nthe students just thinking that\nthey've got to vote for this person or the other because someone told them to, or because\nnobody else is standing. The\nreason for RON is to make sure\npeople are voted in for the right\nreasons.\nWhere there's doubt about a candidate's ability to do the job\nit gives a chance for a second\ntry.\nWhy should I vote for you?\nBecause you might not think\nthat the candidates are any\ngood.\nMany thanks to David Roberts for interviewing the candidates and to David Francis for his transcription skill z "

I think I have\nthe experience as RCSU\nPresident; I 've sat on the com-mitte es, I 've gone through the\nprocesses, I think I know what\nI'm doing.\nWhat experience do you have?\nAs RCSU President, I 've pulled\nthe RCSU out of the quagmire it\nwas in, and I know the Union\nstaff, as well as its structures.\nWhat's the best thing about\nthe way the Union is being\nrun?\nThe permanent staff have a very efficient way of doing\nthings, and services are delivered when they're supposed to.\nAnd the worst thing\nThe bureaucracy. It's as simple\nas that.\nWhat would you change?\nI would stop debate on the constitution and the way we do\nthings. I want people to focus\non what they're doing, and\nfocus on their jobs.\nDo you think the President\nshould be a figurehead or an\nadministrator?\nBoth. It's a necessary figure-head; it gives the Union something to revolve around.\nAt the end of your year, how\nwould you judge your success?\nIf people were still talking about\nthe constitution in twelve\nmonths time, I would have\nfailed. If other people haven't done their jobs, again, the same\nthing. Also, if the services\nhaven't been improved one iota,\nI would have failed also.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nMy outlook. Because I want to\ncut bureaucracy, because I want to make things better, I want the services to improve.\nI 've done it with the RCSU, and\nI can do it again.

I now have the skills and\nexperience to be able to\nrealise what has begun.\nWhat's the best thing about\nthe way the Union is being\nrun?\nIt is democratic, and that is\nimportant, and we still listen\nto our students. A case in\npoint would be the faculties;\nthere were many disagreements to start off with, but\nnow, after mass consultation,\nwe have reached a consensus,\nembodied through the constitution passed at the last council. What's the single biggest\nthing you'd like to change?\nWe have a huge number of volunteers who run our clubs and\nsocieties, and participate in a lot of our activities, and I want\nto try and ensure that we\ncarry on recruiting good quality students, train them, and\nput in place a reward system\nthat acknowledges what\nthey've done for us.\nIn a year's time, how would\nyou judge your success?\nIf I 've accomplished the things\nI set out to do in my manifesto\nand if the students feel that\nthey've been served better by\nthe Union, then I 'll be happy.\nIn particular, I would like to\nhelp students find accommodation after they leave halls,\nand I would also like major\nimprovements to be made in\nthe induction of Freshers.\nWhat makes you the\nstrongest candidate?\nI think I have the skills and\nexperience necessary, I understand how to do the job, and I intend to apply what I 've\nlearnt.\nKpfisidenf \u2022 * * \u00bb\nWhy do you want to be Union\nPresident?\nBecause I think, with my\nbreadth of experience of a large\nrange of different Union activities over four years, that I'm the\nbest qualified candidate in\nCollege at the moment.\nWhat experience do you have?\nI 've seen the administrative\nside of the Union by sitting on\nCouncil for a couple of years.\nI 've had real hands on, nitty-gritty experience administering\ntwo Summer Balls now, and I 've\nalso been involved on the clubs\nand societies side; involved\nmainly with the Medics' drama\nsociety.\nWhat's the best thing about\nthe way the Union is being\nrun?\nIt's not getting worse.\nWhat's the single biggest\nthing you'd like to change?\nI'd like to include new people,\nby getting them to run the ser v ices. I'm not about re-designing\nthe Union from the ground up.\nAt the end of your year, how\nwould you judge your success? Turnout in that year's election is\na very good indicator of how\ninvolved people feel and how\nconnected people feel with\nwhat the Union's actually\ndoing.\nWould you want the President\nto be a figurehead?\nDefinitely. It is the figurehead to\nthe outside world. That's how I ran the Summer Ball and that's how I 'll run the Union.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nWith the obvious exception of\nthe president incumbent, I have\nthe best idea of how the Union\nruns on a day-to-day basis, but\nalso over a large amount of\ntime. With respect to the current President, I am still stu-dent; I go out and hear what\npeople moan and groan about.\n\n"

    "content": "manifestoes election ^ ^ 1 5\nCandidate Manifestoes\nFelix Edm\nIt is difficult for me to write a manifesto, since the issues of\nFelix that I have edited this year\nare far better evidence of how I like to work than anything I can\nwrite here. While I do intend to\nmake significant changes to the\nlayout and design next year, I think that the experience I have\ngained over the last year will\nmostly benefit the administration of Felix, which in turn will\nbenefit the students. I have a good knowledge of how the\nUnion and College work, which\nwill help me negotiate the politics of both, and thus write better news. I understand how to\nget more money out of corporate advertisers, which means I will be able to lower the cost of\nadvertising for clubs and societies within the Union.\nMore specifically I intend to\nexpand on the success of\nCoffee Break, which seem to be\nthe most popular pages, and so\ngive yet more room to fun\nthings to do during lectures. I want to have a greater connection with Phoenix, thus getting\nmore art and culture into Felix\non a regular basis, and I will\ncontinue trying to get more students from non-central campuses involved in both content\nand news. I also plan to make\nthe diary larger, as it seems to\nbe gaining popularity, filling it\nwith more that is useful, as well\nas more that is silly.\nFinally, I think that a second\nyear would allow me to do\nthings that I have not have had\nthe capacity to do up until now,\nthus making Felix more entertaining to read and more fun to\nwrite.\nFelix Editor\nThroughout my two years at\nImperial, I have been a regular\ncontributor to Felix. This year, I spend 15-20 hours per week\nworking as music editor, and I also have overall responsibility\nfor the new clubbing section. I have written and edited various\nother articles and dealt with\nadvertisers.\nI present shows on IC Radio\nfor six hours each week, I am a member of IC Symphony\nOrchestra and I have also been\nheavily involved in several RAG\nevents this year.\nI will continue to run Felix as\na newspaper, but I will include\nmore national and international\nnews, and more sport. College\nnews will remain on the front\npage, and I will extend the popular Coffee Break section. The\ndiary section will become a useful guide to the week, featuring\ndetailed listings and previews.\nI will put College news on the\nFelix website as it breaks, so\nthat you don't have to wait until\nFriday to find out about important developments. I will also\nput full, uncut versions of inter-views, reviews and letters on\nthe site.\nI will make Felix more professional, both in appearance and\nas an organization in general.\nMore news and features relating to Wye, Silwood and the\nmedic campuses are needed,\nand I hope to get more students\nfrom these campuses involved\nwith Felix.\nI am committed, experienced,\nreliable, well organized and\nenthusiastic. Felix is a good\nnewspaper this year, but I will\nmake it better.\nFelix Editor\nYoud be forgiven for thinking\nImperial College is the most\ndull place on Earth. Actually,\nthere's a lot of stuff going on -and there's a free magazine\nyou can look in to find out\nabout it all. That's the theory.\nWhat went wrong?\nFelix ought to be the face\nand the voice of Imperial\nCollege. It ought to be something we pick up on a Friday\nbecause it's interesting, entertaining and relevant. But\ninstead we have pages of waffle about nothing. Articles that\nare as much fun as the lectures\nsome people read them in.\nSerialised stories that it physically hurts to read.\nThere's plenty going on at\nImperial, and so much to do in\nLondon - so why does a flick\nthrough Felix at the moment\nmake me think I'm stuck on a particularly uninteresting\nisland?\nI will turn Felix into a magazine you'll actually want to\nread. Articles you'll find inter-e sting. News you care about.\nAnd not just about Imperial\nCollege - about London, and\nlife. We'll have an expanded,\ninformative, useful, non-grid-based diary. More information\non the huge number of clubs\nand societies at Imperial, special events, things happening\nat the union, and things happening in London. The Felix\nwebsite will also be improved\nand kept up to date.\nI will make Felix more like\nThe Times, Time Out and FHM and less like the Silverlmk\nTrain Timetable (Autumn 1998)\nand Littlesby Parish Magazine.\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nClinic\nWalking With Thee\nOut this Monday on Domino records\nThe career of this Liverpudlian four-piece, formed in 1997, has developed\nstrangely. Having released arguably their\nbest material on a series of early EPs,\nacquired a good live reputation and fallen out with their fan base for re-releasing\nThe Second Line to coincide with a Levi's advertisement, Clinic have not always\nbeen successful or widely accepted. This\nalbum forces me to ask questions and\nleaves me confused.\nOpening with the subdued and sombre\nHarmony, the Clinic boys offer up a dark\nelectro-sean ce. Welcome is a drone-based psychobilly number, where Clinic\nlive up to all those Velvet Underground\nreferences. Nonetheless, the track\nbecomes prophetically ironic as A de Blackburn remarks \"How could you disintegrate form?\" just as it becomes apparent that the album itself lacks structure\nand direction.\nTitle track and forthcoming single\nWalking With Thee (aka Nuns) is evidently the most effective song, with its\nfairground swirl and monkey organ grind\nproviding a fitting backdrop for a defiant\nvocal. However, this becomes the pivotal\npoint of the album - afterwards, deja vu\nsets in and it all goes downhill.\nWalking With Thee leaves me with a strange taste in my mouth. Is there anything particularly good here? The band\nhave tried to progress - the album has a distinctly developed cabaret feel, for\nexample - but instead of moving forward,\nthey have only stepped sideways. Clinic\nburned with vitality and urgency once,\nmaking this album even more disappointing and hard to bear.\nChris\nTwo Day Rule\nWhen You're Ready\nOut this Monday on Sugarshack records\nTwo Day Rule are a feisty Bristolian boy-girl punk combo. Comprising of Neil\nMurray (lead vocals/guitar), Andrea\nKenny, (who vies with Murray for top\nbilling), Craig Smith (bass) and Matt\nWoolman (drums), they've built up a small racket of enthusiasm for their\naccomplished punk sensibilities and\ncrazy live sets.\nTheir debut album begins with the\nmildly likeable Odds and Ends and No\nDoubt, which have me merely nodding\nwith appreciation and do not bode\nextremely well for the rest of the songs.\nEager anticipation leads me to the recent\nsingle Had A Good Thing, which is\nalmost indescribable despite being an\nimpressive track. It's acerbic lyrics, such\nas \"I want to get into your pants\", stand\nout from the wall of sound. Space is more\nreflective, with a thr ashier feel. The cymbal and maracas provide an interesting\nbackground for the centre piece Andrea's vocals.\nThe bluesy jazz-funk fusion on Johnny\nAnd Loretta is the first real sign of originality. This track is the clear winner on\nan album packed with peaks and\ntroughs. Better Off Now is a sixties-style\nnumber with more of the jazz and less of\nthe funk. The juxtaposition of this with\nthe trashier I 'll Be Just Fine, reminiscent\nof Bis in their heyday, works well.\nHighlight number two is Sympathetic,\nfull of guitar noodling and the vocal spirit of Blink 182's Tom De Longe - pop-punk\nat it's very best. The excellent eighties\npastiche Too Good To Be True rounds off\na real album of two halves - the second\nby far outshining the first.\nSajini\nVarious\nFabricLive 02\nOut now on Fabric records\nDance compilations are always difficult\nthings to judge, since they are often as\nmuch about record label politics as about\nthe music. With this is mind, FabricLive\n02, mixed by Ali B( pic above), promises\nto be a true reflection of a FabricLive set,\nrather than a load of \"anthems\" lumped\ntogether in one convenient package.\nSo, how does it compare? Purists will\nargue that FabricLive 02 lacks the rough\nedges of a live set - that it is too polished.\nThey may even argue that it misses out\non the whole atmosphere of Fabric itself.\nThat aside, the album delivers a great\nselection of professionally mixed tracks,\nput together into a structured set that\ntakes you from a quirky and com par it ive ly subdued start to a bass-heavy climax.\nIt does exactly what you'd want it to do.\nEssentially, the key to success for this\nCD will lie in its track list. lis' The Next\nLevel, currently providing the soundtrack\nto a major advertising campaign, is sure\nto generate interest in FabricLive 02.\nTo most people, the fact that the album\nwas mixed by FabricLive resident All B won't mean a thing. But only someone\nwho truly understands the FabricLive\nexperience can convey that sublime mix\nof bass and beats to an audience who\nmay not yet have experienced it.\nApart from turning off your lights and\nfilling your bedroom with a hundred people and vast quantities of smoke, this is\nabout as close as you can get to\nFabricLive without actually being there.\nPatrick\nFor a chance to win a copy of\nFabricLive 02, turn to page 25.\n\n"

    "content": "back talk\nCondom-nation?\nDear person who wrote last\nweek's Inkwell,\nIf obtaining condoms is\nembarrassing to you then are\nyou really mature enough to\nbe using them? The offering of\nfree condoms has to be controlled for various reasons but\nthe first of them is the law. It\nis illegal to encourage underage sex in any way and as it is\npossible for U16s to use the\nhealth centre, a form with date of birth details must be\nused. Secondly, I have used\nthe service for 4 years and\nhave never found it embarrassing, just a useful service.\nIs society so repressed we\ncan't admit the need for safe\nsex? Finally some religious\ngroups oppose the idea of\ncontraception and therefore\non display to-be-taken condoms could cause these people offence which stops the\nhealth centre being for all.\nI do hope however that you\ndon't find using condoms as\nembarrassing as you seem to\nfind obtaining them.\nYours,\nJolyon Thompson, Aero\nDear Editor,\nInkwell has a point (Condom\nBureaucracy - Felix 8 February\n2002) so to speak. Here at the\nHealth Centre we would dearly love to leave buckets of condoms lying around for eager\nstudents to carry away.\nIndeed, we did give 2500 condoms to ICSU to distribute\nduring Freshers' Week, hopefully promoting safe sex.\nUnfortunately, such gestures\nof largesse are constrained\nby... The Health Authority. It is\nKensington, Chelsea and\nWestminster Health Authority\nwho give the condoms to local\npractices to distribute free to\ntheir patients and we get our\nshare. Although this is more\nthan other local practices,\nbecause there is recognition\nthat we serve a student population, it is not enough for students to take as many as they\nwant. This is why we have to\nlimit the number that are\ngiven to each individual.\nFurthermore, in order to\nqualify for this supply of condoms we have to provide statistics to the Health Authority\non the gender and ages of\nthose who request them. The\nsimplest, most economic and\nefficient way of doing this is\nto enter the data on to\npatients' records and then\nsearch for it. Hence the\nrequest forms. The request\nforms do provide confidentiality for students or would it be\nless embarrassing to stand at\nthe Reception desk asking for\n\"6 naturelle please\".\nI am dismayed, yet strangely\nimpressed, by Inkwell's claim\nto be responsible for Britain's high rate of unwanted pregnancies. A more appropriate\nassessment would be to\nexamine the unwanted pregnancy rate at Imperial College\ncompared to other universi-ties, particularly those which\ndo not offer free condoms.\nThis is reassuringly low, presumably either because\nInkwell is active elsewhere or,\nmore likely, because the\nmajority of students think that\nfilling in a form is a small price\nto pay for condoms.\nYours faithfully,\nIrene Weinreb\nNUS\nDear Felix,\nPresident Ganesh gave the\nreason in his letter to Felix for\nholding a referendum that lots\nof fresher s asked for NUS\ncards this year. If this is the\nreason can I ask why there\nhasn't been a referendum\nbefore??\nIn the two years I spent in\nhalls as fresher then re-app\nmany people queried why\nImperial was not in the NUS.\nThe reason for asking the\nquestions was not because\nNUS colleges provide cheaper\nbeer or food, or that NUS\nmembership would ensure a better union. I would like to\nguess that most wanted\nImperial to join the NUS so\nthey could have a NUS card\nand get discounts at HMV and\nthe cinema.\nSo, why should Imperial join\nthe NUS?\nPolitically it would be a bonus: it is a well known\nsecret that whoever becomes\npresident of the NUS mysteriously ends up working at\nWestminster within a few\nyears. Also colleges have to\ndeclare a political allegiance\nupon entry. However Imperial\nhas been apolitical ever since\nthe events of the sixties when\npolitical factions of the college\ncreated havoc. Only last year\nthe Felix editor was brought in\nfront of the council for his\npolitical views within Felix.\nOn an administration level it\nwould give the Union extra\nclout on certain issues\ndeemed important such as\nfees etc. But would help on\nexternal issues be exchanged\nfor a devolution of internal\npowers to the NUS??\nOn the catering side being\npart of the NUS cartel would\nhelp to ensure the procurement of cheap beer and food.\nHowever such cartels exist\nwithin college including\nstrong links with breweries\nbuilt up over the years: Has\nanyone else noticed that the\nprices for alcohol and hot food\nin Southside and the Union\nare cheaper than UL U and\nmost of the other London NUS\nunions? If we were to enter\nthe NUS cartel what would\nhappen to the selection of real\nales for instance - would the\nprices increase and the choice\ndiminish? However it might\nenable people to acquire\nStella on the South Ken cam-pus.\nThen we move onto the\ncost. To join the NUS requires\na yearly joining fee running\ninto tens of thousands. Given\nthe current financial situation\nof the Union I would be interested to see where this money\nis to come from. Perhaps from\nimproving the efficiency of the\ncentral administration? I doubt it. Last year the club\nfunding was cut severely,\nwith arts clubs being hit as\nwell as sports teams (if anyone can suggest how to fit 17\nrugby players into a minibus\nplus kit without exceeding the\nweight limit please tell me).\nThe summer ball is nearly\nscrapped due to lack of fund-ing: yet the Union can afford\nthe membership - how?\nAt this point I would like to\npoint out that I have no\ngrudges with the NUS: at\nsixth form I helped usher the\ncollege union into the NUS.\nOnly there the fee was considerably smaller and did not\naffect the student activities. I also agree that IC students\nare discriminated upon by\nhigh street retailers because\nwe do not have NUS cards.\nSurely that should be what\nthe college should be campaigning for.\nIn placing the opportunity\nto get NUS cards certain people in the Union are dangling\na huge carrot in front of the\nstudents they represent.\nHowever, four years at\nImperial have taught me that\nwherever a carrot is dangled,\na dirty great big stick is not\ntoo far away.\nRegards,\nSimon Child (Phys IV)\n\n"

    "content": "26 film review\nEditorial\n\"Lord Of The Macarena\"\nThe first editorial of term and my excuse is that I saw The\nFellowship Of The Chicken Wing last week. The acting is definitely not up to scratch, but really, who cares. The scenery, the\nmonsters, the special-effects. One of the greatest action movies\never made and if you have not seen it, then see it, because it is\nworth a butcher's on the big screen.\nThe two sequels, The Return Of Burger King and The Two\nZingers, will fail in having the same impact as the Fellowship.\nThe Fellowship has set the landmark and I think there will\ninevitably be a backlash from the critics. In any case, I cannot\nwait to see the next one.\nOne aspect of the Lord Of The Chicken Wings I find fascinating is the way political forces have tried to extract their ideology from it. I read earlier this week that the book is held in enormous esteem by Italian fascists, for instance. Apparently, no\nself-respecting fascist's library is complete without a copy of\nMein Kampf alongside The Lord Of The Chicken Wings. Then I read that leftist hippies in the 1960s saw it as an essential part\nof their reading. But that many people see it as a metaphor for\nthe allied victory in World War II. So what do we read into it? Is\nit just 'entertainment'? The values represented in movies have\nshaped our own personal morality for decades. They affect the\nway we see the world. Should we care? Perhaps.\nMore importantly, I was down the Union for Cheesy Wotsits\nlast week when the crap DJ decides to play Macarena. Then, to\nmy horror, several people actually started 'doing the Macarena'.\nNow at some point they had to learn how to do the dance - and\nthat's what I'm worried about. Did they have Macarena les-sons? How did they learn it so well, that by the time they were\nge schlo shed, in the Union, at lam in the morning, they could\n'go through the motions', so precisely? So much effort, just to\nlook like a twit?\nOne final rant. The J CR shop. I happened to be in there the\nother day when the manager turns up, dapper ed up like a King.\nArmani suit, gold cuff-links, flashy watch, the works. Why?\nBecause IC students are still willing to spend money in that rip-off merchant. Fair enough, sit down in the JCR if you want, but\ndon't encourage them by spending money in the shop.\nOscar Nominations for the\n74th Academy Awards 2001\nIt takes twelve people twenty hours to make each of them and\non 24th March they will be handed out to this year's most high-ly-regarded achievers in Hollywood.\nThe Oscars initially derived their name when Academy libra r ian, Margaret Herrick, claimed that the statuettes looked like\nher uncle, Oscar. How she came to this conclusion is still a mys-te ry, since the statuette has no facial features, except for a nose.\nMargaret Herrick. What a muppet.\nThis year everyone is looking to the Fellowship Of The Ring to\nstorm the show with its 13 nominations. Its rivals include A Beautiful Mind (8 nominations), Gosford Park (6 nominations),\nand Amelie (5 nominations). If I was a betting man (which I am)\nI would put my house (or my parents' house) on the Fellowship\nto take this year's Oscars to the proverbial cleaners.\nSo what else should we look out for? Best supporting\nactor/actress? No. They've already lost out to the best\nactor/actress by default. Never got the point of that award.\nWhat we should look out for is Willard Smith's nomination for\nAli. It was a great performance and I think he is clear favourite.\nAlso look out'for the British interest. There are about a half\ndozen nominations for Brits, although they are not famous\nenough for us to know precisely which ones they are.\nThe Oscar ceremony represents the American movie industry\ngiving itself a huge self-congratulatory pat on the back. This\nyear with movies like Ali, Memento, and the Fellowship Of The\nRings, I think it has just about deserved it. Some interesting\nOscar facts:\n\u2022 Walt Disney holds the record for the most individual nominations and awards: 64 nominations and 26 awards\n\u2022 Only two women have ever been nominated for directing: Jane\nCampion in 1993 for The Piano, and Lina Wertmuller in 1976\nfor Seven Beauties\n\u2022 The Academy is made up of about 5,700 voting members. They\nall vote to determine the final winners\n\u2022 The 1928 Oscars took fifteen minutes to hand out the awards.\nThe 2000 Oscars took 249 minutes. Legendary presenter Bob\nHope once said that the Oscars were 2hrs worth of entertainment crammed into four hours. Darius\n\n"

I think, due to the\nexperience I 've got, that I 'll be\nbetter than the other candidates and that I 'll improve Felix.\nWhat's the best thing about\nFelix at the moment?\nI like the diary, and I like the\ncrossword. [Why?] Because the\nreaders like the diary and the\ncrossword and that's my job.\nWhat's the single biggest\nchange you want to make?\nI'd like to make Felix look more\ninteresting, and be more interesting by giving writers more\npower to do what they want.\nWhat magazines/newspapers\nwould you like Felix to emu-late?\nIn a perfect world, and if money\nwere no object, Id like it to look\nlike Empire and have the content of a broadsheet. I want it to\nhave a feel slightly more like\nTimeOut. I enjoy, the diary and\nthe review sections. I think\nother people do too - they read\nthe second half much more than\nthe first. I have a duty to the\npeople who read it, and as such\nI want to do whatever people\nlike. Some people said they\nliked the colour front covers last\nyear - from a financial point of\nview, that's impossible, but\nmaybe we need to make it feel\nmore like a magazine. If I did\nget it again, I'd spend a lot of\nnext term doing surveys to find\nout what people want.\nHow would you judge your\nsuccess?\nIf people came up to me at the\nend of next year and said it was\nbetter than the year before, then\nI'd think I had done a good job.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nI don't think anyone can appreciate how much effort goes into\nFelix unless they've tried to do it\nthemselves. I also think that\nFelix should be fun for both the\nreaders and the people who put\nit out each week - I'm a club\npresident as well as an Editor.\nFelix Editor \u00bb\nWhy do you want to do this\njob?\nFirst, I think I would enjoy doing\nthe job. I already enjoy working\nfor Felix - I do lots of work for\nthem at the moment as Music\nEditor. The most important reason is because I'm certain I could do a very good job.\nWhat experiences have you\nhad that you think would make you good at this job?\nObviously the experience that\nI 've had in Felix doing music - I think that's quite similar to the\njob of Editor. I also do quite a lot\nwith IC Radio. I think all of this\nshows that I work well as part\nof the team. I'm a team player\nand I can get along with people\nvery well and motivate them\nwell too.\nWhat's the best thing about\nFelix at the moment?\nI think I'd probably say the\nCollege news. It tells us what's going on in College and the\nUnion, which is probably the\nmam purpose of Felix.\nSo what's the single biggest\nchange you would make?\nIt's important we include more\nnational and international news\nand sport. I also think we need\nto make more use of the Felix\nwebsite - we could use it to put\nnews up as it happens with\nmore detail. Finally I think we\nneed to make it more professional. So, what magazines/newspapers do you want to emulate?\nCambridge Student, which I 've\nread a lot of - it's fantastic. If we\ncan aim for some of the standards that they set, then that'd be good.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nI have two years' experience at\nFelix. I know quite a lot of the\nthings I'd need to know as\nEditor. I 'll run it more professionally - I 'll try to run it proper-ly. I'm very well organised and\nbasically I'm certain I can make\nFelix a better publication.\n*F* nx Editor 1\nWhy do you want to be Felix\nEditor?\nBecause I think I can do it.\nWhat experience do you have?\nI edited my hall magazine last\nyear and I generally do a bit of\nwriting on websites.\nSo what's the biggest single\nchange you'd like to make?\nI would introduce more articles\nthat are of interest, really.\nAbout? What kind of thing?\nNews? College?\nThings generally about life.\nLast year and previous years\nthere have been articles on\nthings that were important -financial matters, sexual\nhealth. Those don't get covered\nin Felix at the moment as far as\nI'm aware. There aren't enough\narticles that are entertaining.\nThere's a lot of waf fly semi-opinionated articles, but nothing offering a concrete opinion.\nWhat magazines/newspapers\nwould you like to see Felix\nemulate?\nI want to see it more like Time\nOut, The Times and FHM. How would you judge your\nown success?\nWhether people say to me that\nthey've enjoyed reading Felix.\nHow would students get to\nwrite for Felix?\nWell, I'd give everyone a chance\nat least for Felix. I want to welcome people submitting articles and I would hope to\ninclude more rather than less of\nthem but of course students\nwill very lazily write a lot of\nrubbish so I 'll have to exercise\nsome kind of quality control and\njust not publish articles that are\njust waffle.\nWhy are you the strongest\ncandidate?\nIntriguing question. I don't know what I would say, it\ndepends on what the other\nguys have got really, and I don't know whether they have... it.\nJust the will to succeed.\n\n"

    "content": "election special\nHow To Vote: A Quick Guide\nOn the following pages, all the election\ncandidates present their manifestoes,\nand have been interviewed by Felix.\nFirst, David Francis - Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare) and Returning\nOfficer - introduces the system by\nwhich you will vote next week.\nThe posters are up, the manifestoes have\nbeen submitted, the candidates have\nbeen grilled by an over-enthusiastic Felix\nreporter and paraded in front of a television camera so that the whole JCR can\nsee what they have to say. You know\nwhich the departments the candidates\nare from, you've heard what they've contributed towards the union over the last\nfew years and you've been stunned by\narcane titles for clubs and societies that\nyou never even knew existed. You've\nnearly sus sed the candidates out.\nNow you're looking. Looking for reasons\neither to vote for, or, indeed, like the\nmajority of voters, to not vote, for a particular candidate. You have an impression\nin your mind. You know what they look\nlike. You know what they sound like. You\nknow the rash generalisations you've\nmade about them, either good or bad,\nthat you wish you hadn't. You've spoken\nto people in your hall, in your clubs, to\nthat girl your mate pulled last Wednesday\nnight. You've even spoken to your departmental representatives, as they're likely\nto actually have bumped into some of the\ncandidates, at some stage. So now what?\nNow you have to vote.\nSounds easy, huh? Sounds like this article is going to patron is e you beyond com-pre hens ion? I wish it was that simple.\nFirst things first. You vote with a swipe\ncard. Not a Union card, or an Activities\ncard, or aUL U card or indeed a NUS card.\nA swipe card. The thing that lets you into\nthe computer room, but you can never be\nbothered to dig it out of your wallet and\nso there it sits. You also need to be in the\nright place at the right time. You cannot\nvote at any ballot box you turn up at. You\nmust vote in your own department. If you\nturn up elsewhere, you will be informed of\nwhere you should be voting and politely\ntold to head in that direction. There will\nbe no exceptions.\nOnce there, between the hours of 10am and 5pm on both Thursday 28th February\nand Friday 1st March, you will be presented with five bits of paper: One for\neach of the sabbatical positions. On each\npiece of paper, which will be colour coordinated for your benefit, there will be a list of candidates standing for each pos i tion. There will also be RON (Re-open\nnomination). For instance, for the position\nof President, there will be, in alphabetical\norder, Stuart Davies, Sen Ganesh, Idris\nHarding and RON.\nYou will then be required to vote by the\nSingle Transferable Vote system. In a nut-shell, your first choice gets one mil vote,\nand if they don't win, your other preferences are reflected. You put a'1' next to\nthe candidate you want to win. You put a'2' next to the person you would class as\nyour second choice and so on. If you put a'1' next to RON, all other numbers will be\nignored. If you only like one candidate,\nand there are more than 2 candidates\nstanding, put \"2\" next to RON. You see\nhow this is working? Lovely.\nSo there we go. No ticks, no crosses, no\nripped ballot papers and no silly pictures\nnext to candidate's names. So get out\nthere and VOTE VOTE VOTE. Ishra!\nYou could say that a large group of\nindividuals is an\nimpossible concept;\nalternatively you could\nwork for one.\nMarakon Associates offers\npenultimate year students\nthe opportunity to participate\nin our eight week\nLondon summer internship\nprogramme.\nPlease apply by CV and\ncovering letter to:\nEmma Sorsky\nuk recruiting@ mar akon. com\nYlarakon Associates\nstrategic management consultants\nApplications to be recieved\nby 1st March 2002\nYour time starts now www.mar akon. com\n\n"

The biggest day\nthus far in my footballing\ncareer was a tough semi-final\naway to fourth placed LSE\n6th s, a team that had comprehensively beaten us 6-2 in the\nleague. The preparations had\nbegun the night before, a car-bo hydrate full pasta meal and\nonly 4 pints of Guinness, taking\nit easy. Arriving in the quad\nand catching the train to\nBerrylands was quieter than\nusual, the customer y bickering\nand banter reduced to a minimum as everyone concentrated\non the task in hand.\nThe game kicked off on time\nand we saw the teams were\nequally matched. The referee\nhowever was a little different,\nhe booked Seb, our keeper, for\nmarking the six yard box (official FA rules do not list it as a book able offence) although he\nwas fully justified in warning\nMike immediately afterwards\nfor telling everyone that \"the ref\nhasn't got a clue.\" Still, no mat-ter. The first half was tight -they had a couple of half\nchances and Dave and Luis\nwent close for us. A constructive team talk and feedback\nfrom our supporter Neem confirmed that we were playing\nwell.\nThe second half commenced\nwith IC dominating, Dan and\nDoug ruling the midfield with\nSwiss efficiency and an iron\nbelly. Then it came, Dave\nchased a lost cause and aero-bati call y managed to keep it\non, the ball falling to Doug\nYacht Club\nLast Friday eight yacht club\nmembers squeezed themselves and all their kit into two\nvery small cars and set off to\nPortsmouth for a weekend of\ncruising. Once we had arrived\nin Port Solent Marina and\nfound the boat we paid a visit\nto the bar for some food, a few\ndrinks and to discuss the plans\nfor the weekend.\nWhen we got up on Saturday\nmorning there was little wind\nbut not a cloud in the sky and\nwe set off early to make the\nmost of the day. Our original\nplan was to sail round the Isle\nof Wight clockwise but it was\nquickly obvious that we would\nnot have enough wind to do\nthis. Instead we sailed the\nother way to Yarmouth, on the\nnortheast side of the island.\nAfter a perfect day sailing\nunder blue skies we arrived in\nYarmouth just after dark and\nheaded straight for the showers and the bar. Several hours\nlater the trip back to the boat\nvia dinghy was a little more\nchallenging and one person\nluckily escaped a swim thanks\nto his rucksack!\nSunday was even calmer\nthan the previous day and after\na morning of sailing very slowly up the Solent we had no\nchoice but to motor the rest of\nthe way. Having stopped for\nlunch at Wootton Creek we\nmotored back to Portsmouth to\nhand back the boat.\nIf anyone is interested in\nfinding out more, our meetings\nare at 6pm on Mondays in\nSouthside, or have a look at the\nwebsite on:\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/yacht\nwhose incisive pass released\nChris to shoot across the keeper and through the legs of\nAnand (offside but he realised\nand let it go). Goal! A rather\nnarked LSE team restarted\nquickly and their striker finished a goal easily, all square\nagain. Not to be put off, we\ncame back at them controlling\nthe game, several chances fell\nto our attack but nothing came\nof them, the clock ticked by,\nthen out of nothing Chris beat\ntheir defence and Goal! After\nfour minutes of panicky\ndefending LSE were stupidly\nallowed back, a long ball found\ntheir striker who finished neat-ly. Was this destined to go to\nextra time? Not if we had anything to do with it. IC again\npushed everything into attack,\noccasionally leaving us a little\nexposed but Mike and Alex\nreunited at the back covered\neverything. A hopeful long ball\nfrom Rob lead to a silly foul on\nChris about 30 yards out. There\nwas only one man who was\ngoing to take it. Gaetan\nstepped up and with one\nswoosh of his magical left foot\nstuck it into the top corner. We\nwent mental. This time the\ndefence was resolute, nothing\nshall pass. A superb final 10\nminutes of blocks, tackles,\nclearances and timely interceptions by the whole team (Doug\nheading off the line) means\nthat for the first time in their\nhistory the Imperial College\n6th team are off to Motspur\nPark on the 9th of March for the\ncup final.

    "content": "LIVE: Delta + Kidd Dynamo\n+ Serafin @ The Monarch\nThis evening was a showcase for some of the new talent trying\nto find their way into the music business.\nFirst up were Serafin (pic above), a four-piece from London\nwho certainly rocked the venue. They went absolutely mad on\nstage, despite seeming nervous at first, and played all-out, getting the crowd's feet tapping almost immediately.\nSerafin flit between dark, melancholy rock (Day By Day) and\nquiet, melodic musings (Ordinarily Me) without a flinch. Their\nvery special brand of indie-rock is bound to take them a long\nway - here's hoping they get snapped up quickly and make the\nbig time.\nNext on stage were Kidd Dynamo, from Belfast, looking quite\nintimidated by the size of the crowd. \"This is our first gig in\nLondon\" admitted lead man Colin, before the band launched\ninto some of the best emo I 've heard in a long time.\nKidd Dynamo's aim should be to retain the naive charm that\nso many new bands lose after working hard to make it big.\nTheir lyrics, together with Colin's sweeter-than-sugar voice and\nthe ringing, beautifully harmon is ed guitars make Kidd Dynamo\nsomething very special to look out for in the near future.\nDelta were the headline act, and by this time we were expecting great things, considering how good their support had been.\nUnfortunately, we were disappointed.\nTheir better tracks were medium to good, but their worse\ntracks were just not worth listening to. They were everything\nthat was bad about mid-nineties britpop, mixed with some of\nthe subtle, smooth melodies of today's indie revolution.\nThe disappointment of the crowd was reflected by the number of people who vacated the room in favour of mingling with\nthe two support acts downstairs in the bar.\nmusic reviews\nINTERVIEW with Vex Red\nFelix probed the minds of angst y indie-me taller s Vex Red on\ntheir dimly-lit, slightly dingy tour bus, somewhere in W l.[ See right for a review of their latest single Can't Smile.]\nFELIX: So what bands do you think are good at the moment\nthen?\nNICK: Well, we saw a band supporting The Cooper Temple\nClause the other day in Portsmouth - Biffy Clyro, or something?\nYou know, I haven't been to a gig where I 've been blown away\nby a band in ages, and then suddenly there's this band, and\nthey come on, and they start with the quietest kind of music\nand then launch into the heaviest kind of music and I was\nblown away. They were wicked.\nKEITH: Yeah, I think I read on a website we're playing with\nthem...\nYou read about yourselves on a website? Which one of you\nposts as Vex Red on the official noticeboard?\nKEITH: Normally me.\nAren't there about three girls who post repeatedly on there?\nKEITH: Yeah, I 'll put a message up, and half an hour later there'll\nbe thirty messages and they're all from the same girls. Spencer,\nthe guy who does the website, made himself this hood ie that\nsaid \"Vex Red Webmaster\" on it.\nNICK: Yeah, he wore it at a gig, and he was like, \"I'm famous for\nfifteen minutes!\"\nWhich festivals are you playing this year?\nNICK: Apparently we've got Glastonbury. Apparently. And probably Reading and Leeds as well.\nHave you got a favourite?\nNICK and KEITH (together): Glasto, definitely.\nWhat's the best set you've seen there?\nNICK: Um, I don't think we see many bands when we go - we\nget caned in our tents and can't move.\nCan you tell us about the album?\nKEITH: It's fairly eclectic. If you've only heard the singles, it'll be\na bit of a surprise.\nNICK: It's definitely a mix - there are a lot of quiet songs on\nthere as well. Someone described us as the \"Spiritualized of nu-metal\", which was quite cool.\nKEITH: Yeah, and I read that Terry looks like Daniel Johns out of\nSilverchair - he's got the same hair and piercings and every-thing. But if you say that to Terry, he'll say he had them first.\nMaybe Daniel Johns bases himself on Terry. So, tell us about\nthe pot plant episode.\nNICK: Oh yeah, everyone knows about that! Ant nearly got\narrested! The tour bus broke down and we had to go to a bus\ndepot to get it fixed. Ant stole this pot plant and he named it\nFrank. It was about three feet high, and we just had it on the\nbus. We got to customs and they wouldn't let us through. They\nwouldn't tell us why, and then suddenly about six police cars\ndrove up and surrounded the bus, and they were like, \"we\nbelieve you have something that doesn't belong to you on the\nbus\". Ant was really good about it and gave it back, but I still\ncan't believe they called the police about a pot plant.\nJess Sajini\n\n"

I have seen how the\nUnion is run from various different levels.\nIf elected, I will aim to\nimprove the standard of the\nUnion's services to meet the\nneeds of the students on all\nsites.\nDeputy PresideWflf^Mie * Services)\nJustin Rodger - Who is that you\nmay think? Let me introduce\nmyself, this year I am standing\nfor DP(F&S).I am a final year\nphysics student, member of\nbar staff and a union treasurer.\nWhy I am standing? Well, in\nmy opinion it's the best way\nanyone could spend a year of\ntheir university life and I think\nmore people should stand.\nIf elected some issues I would like to pursue:\nAfter much construction\nwork, the union building needs\na face lift to remove years of\ndirt & grime and restore the\nbuilding to. its former glory,\nsufficiently so to warrant exterior illumination. Provide online\nminibus booking and guides\nfor people who run the union.\nInternally, union resources\nsuch as room usage should be\nefficient and encourage sabbaticals to participate in club\nactivities as members.\nConcerning current issues, of\ncourse I would support the\nstudent body decision on the\nN.U.S. referendum.\nWhat makes me suitable for\nthis position is my attitude and\nexperience. The resources of\nthe union should be efficiently\nused and should offer maximum benefit to greatest number and as DP(F&S)I would\nplay a major role in this. I 've\nspent years in the bar on both\nsides, I 've helped run the\nfinances of clubs as a treasurer\nand union officer and would\nlike to take a more active role\nin union life. Why should you\nvote for me? Simple, because\nyou think I would do the best\njob.\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\n\u2022 \u2022 > *4\n\u2022 rmA The union has seen many large\nchanges this year. I believe that\nthe new exec need to be able to\nspot teething problems in the\nnew structure, and react to\nthem before they become large\nissues. I believe that I am able\nto do this. The DP F&S role is\nsplit into two parts, and a competent DP F&S needs to have\nexperience in both those roles.\nDuring my year out I worked as\na Team Leader. My team and I were responsible, in part, for\nreacting to people's difficulties\nwithin the work place; both recommending more training\nwhere necessary and changing\nprotocols around the office if\nrequired. I believe that this is\nvaluable experience for the\nServices part of the role.\nOutside term time, I work for a financial temp agency, which\nmeans that I have spent time in\nmany of the large financial companies in this country and\naround the world. I believe this\nis valuable for the post.\nIf I am elected, then there are\nseveral things that I would aim\nto improve. For example, at the\nmoment students can provide\nfeedback to the union, by filling\nin a form, which is handed to\nthe bar staff. On several occasions I have heard people complain that either no-one has got\nback to them, or are not happy\nwith what they have heard. I also think that the day-to-day\nrole of the sabbaticals is not\nvery well understood by the\nstudent body. Several people\nthat I 've spoken to don't know\nwhat as abb is, let alone what\ntheir jobs are and how us and\nthe union benefit from them.\n\n"

(Page 25)\nCouncil Makes A Decision\nThe Union is half-way to a new constitution this week after the draft survived its\nfirst reading in Tuesday's unconventional\nmeeting of Council.\nThe meeting kicked off with a record\nturn-out as members of IndianSoc tried to\ntake issue with the President's handling\nof fire regulations at their 'East meets\nWest' event. Council decided not to entertain the complaint, however, requesting\nthat they should present their argument\nmore formally at a later date.\nThe remainder of the meeting was consumed by the approval and amendment\nof a draft constitution, the creation of\nwhich has so far taken up the majority of\nCouncil sessions this year. It has been\nbeen necessary due to the change to faculties by College, which must now be\nreflected in the Union's own structure.\nRecent Councils have also been\nplagued by low attendance of its mem-be rs. The number of attending members\nmust exceed the Council's quorum for the\nmeeting to be valid - half of the members\nin this case - but a count is only required\nAndy Heeps (for it is he...)\nshould someone call for the quorum to be\nchecked. As a result, members last night\nspent much of their time referring to \"the\nQ word\" when discussing the qu or a to be\nset by the new constitution. The draft\nitself passed reasonably uneventfully,\nwith no major upheavals.\nThe final item on the agenda was the\nmatter of Council Chair. Sam Sharpe, who\nhad been chairing meetings for the past\nyear since the end of his tenure as Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), resigned at\nthe last meeting due to the conflicting\ndemands of his Union duties and degree\ncourse. Andy Heeps, former Union\nPresident and College celebrity, had\nacted in Mr Sharpe's place for Tuesday's meeting and was confirmed as Council\nChair by a vote before the meeting closed.\nThis meeting marks a particularly\nfavourable part of the nascent const it u tion's journey to implementation.\nCouncil's work was completed before the\nimposed guillotine - essentially an\nenforced end to discussion at a specific\ntime - which was certainly a contrast\nwith previous meetings.\nUnless there is any strong opposition at\nits next reading in Union Council, the constitution will pass to College's Council\nand, subject to its approval, should take\neffect on the 1st August 2002.

    "content": "club active\nWar On Water\nLast year at Henley, what was\neffectively Imperial College's third eight drew Isis (Oxford's second eight) in the first round\nof the Temple. The race was\nexpected to be a complete\nwalkover for Isis, but in fact it\nwas very close, with our crew\nleading for three-quarters of\nthe race, only losing in the\ndying stages. We also usually\nrace either Oxford or\nCambridge about a week\nbefore to head off the river race.\nLast year Queen's Tower I beat\nCambridge and IC I beat\nGoldie (Cambridge's second\nboat). At the weekend we were\nasked by Oxford to race their\nnewly announced crews on the\nTideway. This is obviously\nmuch earlier than usual; consequently we are still in the\nendurance phase of our training and only moved into eights\nlast Tuesday.\nThe first race of the day was\nbetween Isis and IC II. Despite\nour complete lack of conditioning for a high rate blast,\nImperial College II were\nextremely quick off the start,\nrating 48 for the first few\nstrokes and staying well above\n40 for the first two minutes.\nThis obviously unsettled Isis\nand we moved out to a three-quarters of a length lead, and\nstretched this so that only the\ncanvasses were overlapping.\nWe needed a big push to break\nclear at this point but the Isis\ncox steered across into us,\nignoring the somewhat weak\ncommands from the umpire (an\nOxford coach). We came out of\nthe resultant clash much worse\noff than them, losing our lead.\nWe should really have stopped\nat this point and requested a restart as our rhythm had been\nunsettled, and Isis began to\nrow through us, taking advantage of the umpire allowing\nthem to keep us out of the\nstream. The final result: They\nwon by a length.\nThis pattern was repeated in\nthe second piece, with us\nagain leading them off the\nstart, not quite being able to\nbreak clear and then clashing,\ndisrupting our pattern. In addition the bend was in their\nfavour so they came through to\nwin by half a length.\nIn the big race between\nImperial College I, a very\nnewly formed crew lacking\nfour of the Olympic gold medal-lists we had last year, and\nOxford we again had high\nhopes of victory. Once again\nwe were much quicker off the\nstart and built up a lead, only\nto have this eroded as their\ncohesion and conditioning\nmeant that they were able to\nkeep at a higher rate, rowing\nthrough the crew to win both\npieces narrowly.\nDespite losing, both crews\ngained experience from the\nracing and we know that in\nMarch we will be much quick-er. This weekend sees the\nentire squad racing at the\nHead of the Trent in\nNottingham, an event we are\ntreating as training m preparation for the Eights Head of the\nRiver on the 23rd of March.\nHot Shots\nOn Saturday 9th February the\nfirst inter-collegiate rifle\nmatch for many years took\nplace at the Stock Exchange\nRifle Club (SERC). Teams from\nKings College, Imperial\nCollege and the rest of the\nUniversity of London Colleges\ncompeted over a course of two\n10-bull targets. The one IC\nteam that completed was\ncomposed of Ben Chowdhary,\nAndrew Eldridge, Phil Golds\nand finally Tim Aplin, who\nwas taking part in his first\nmatch for IC. The journey to\nthe SERC was very scenic,\nsince we unintentionally\npassed by many of the tourist\nattractions in Central London.\nAt the SERC we quickly got\nour rifles and equipment set\nup, and then waited for\nAndrew to arrive. Tim was\nfirst to shoot and did well considering this was his first\nmatch. Andrew did eventually\narrive and shot third after Phil\n'Where's My Bolt?' Golds. Ben\nwas last on the firing point\nand like most of the shooters\nthat day shot slightly below\npar. Indeed, throughout the\nday there was an unbelievable amount of cross-shooting\nand double firing; Phil being\nthe only culprit from IC. The\nfinal results were close, but\nthe U LUA Team just beat the\nIC Team scoring 768 (ex. 800)\nto IC's760. Third were Kings'\nA Team with 751, fourth U LUB Team with703 and fifth\nwere Kings' B Team with 657.\nWell done to everyone who\nshot, we'll get them next time!\nFor anyone who wants to give\nshooting a try, the Rifle and\nPistol Club meets every\nWednesday and Saturday at\n12:30 in the Rifle Range, which\ncan be found in the Sports\nCentre on Prince's Gardens.\nBen Chowclhary\nWednesdays Ik Fridays\n\u2022 imperial\n*\u2022\u2022 college\nunion\nBARS\nBcir now open ol 5pm UUednesday\n\u00a31 a pint\n(& sing your hearts out)\nFridays chilled sounds\n5-9pm& loads more seating\n\n"

Both\ncatering services need to\nimprove in quality and reduce\nin price. The installation of a cash machine in the main\nbuilding, the introduction of\ncard sales and the increased\nuse of the Great Hall for live\nperformances can only\nenhance the Union.\nInvestigating College's health\nprovisions, both mental and\nphysical, and developing their\nprovisions for students with\nspecial needs will help to make\na lot of students better off. I will work to ensure the retention and quality of all departmental and site libraries.\nOutside College, I will campaign on student debt,\nincrease the number of companies that give student discounts to IC students and continue the attempts to allow the\nUnion to issue student LT\ncards.\nI will cut Union bureaucracy.\nI will remove pointless forms,\ncut the number of administrative hoops that club chairs\nhave to jump through and stop\ndebate on the Union const it u tion. I will get people who run\nthe Union to focus on their jobs\ninstead of their CV's. The Union is meant to be an\nopen and democratic organ is a tion, responding to the needs\nof all students. I will ensure\nthat it is. After all, if it is not\nworking constantly to improve\nthings for each and every stu-dent, whatever campus they\nattend, it is not doing its job.\nPresident\nChanges in government funding and the \"London Factor\"\nhave led to increasing pressures\nfor students. My goal is to build\non the advice and support services and put student hardship\nhigh on the agenda.\nThe changes in College structure have transformed the academic and administrative\nmake-up of College. The Union\nhas to ensure education\nremains a priority and that we\ncontinue to be a world leader in\nteaching and research.\nOne of the biggest challenges\nfacing the Union is how we help\nand support students at the\nmany campuses. I will dedicate\ngreater resources to integrating\nthe sites, improve communication and ensure that decisions\nare taken where they are most\neffective.\nI believe the Union must\nexpand clubs, societies and student activities, and support the\nmany volunteers that help the\nUnion. Additionally I would\nensure the Union plays a greater role in helping students\nfind affordable accommodation.\nThe Union must continue to provide value-for-money services\nand develop long-term plans to\nmeet the needs of the students.\nAs President this year, I have\ngained the experience and\nskills necessary to achieve my\ngoals. The Union has achieved a lot, but there is more to do. We\nmust build on the successes\nand improve services. I will\nmake sure that the Union continues to take the initiative, is\naccountable to the students it\nrepresents and provides practical and tangible benefits for all.\nPresident\nI don't want to change the\nstructure of the union - too\nmuch time has been wasted on\nthis in recent years. What the\nconstitution says has no effect\non what is served in the bars,\nhow much the shop charges for\na paper clip or whether the\nhockey team wins or loses.\nThe union needs a time of sta-bil it y, good management,\nfocussing on what students\nwant. I will concentrate on\nbuilding up the Wednesday and\nFriday entertainment programmes to compete with other\nLondon unions. Together with\nthe permanent staff I will\nencourage and make it easier\nfor students to get involved\nwith running all union services.\nThe structures for this already\nexist; I don't anticipate any\nmajor policy changes, just a change in emphasis and publicity to put you in control.\nThe only structural issue for\nthe union this year is its failure\nto recognise that IC is a multi-campus institution. As a medic\nno longer based at South Ken I have an accurate perspective\non this problem. ICU needs\npresence at the major London\ncampuses as a minimum.\nI have the experience from\nrunning last year's summer ball\nto transform how the union runs\nwithout changing regulations,\navoiding protracted debate. I managed to revolution is e the\nsummer ball last year, turning it\nfrom a failing institution in danger of extinction into an event\ncommanding a20k subsidy\nfrom college. As union president I will endeavor to complete\na similar feat.\n\n"

Why me?\nI am the Club captain, and\nformer treasurer of the Ladies\nFootball Club. This has given\nme an insight into most\naspects of finance, and organisation of a club, as well as\ngiving me the opportunity to\nmeet and work with people\nfrom other clubs and societies\nat IC and other Universities. I have also participated in several ICU events. My wider\nresponsibilities include being\nthe ACC Women's Officer, and\nbeing part of the sub-editing\nteam of London Student.\nThe DPCS job should be\ndirected by C&S members\nthemselves. My objectives\nwould be to get viewpoints\nand feedback from ICU members in order to rightly represent them at union, college,\nand university level.\nBeing an initial contact\npoint for individual enquiries\nand problems is another\nimportant aspect of the job.\nI would also like to promote\ninter-campus links, by encouraging events with club and\nsociety counterparts at South\nKen, Wye and Silwood.\nI think Clubs and Societies\nare the best bit of IC.

During this time I have seen how the representation system is plagued by\nbureaucracy, apathy and little\ncommunication, this needs to\nchange!\nAccomodation: Many students are trapped; dod gy landlords exploit students year in,\nyear out. I would work to introduce a system where the\nimpressed or disgruntled can\nwrite about the good and bad\nlandlords/properties. Through\nthis others will know how best\nto deal with the usual suspects.\nPeer Support: I will work to\nget a \"buddies\" scheme or sim-i lar, organised by students, running in every department.\nWhere schemes already exist I will work with those running\nthem already and do my best to\nsupport them, and find out how\nthey can be made even better.\nSupporting other Academic\nReps: My aim will be to\nincrease the visibility of, equip\nand support everyone who is\nthere to help you with any academic or welfare problem. With\nthis, everyone should know\nwho can help them and their\nproblems should be dealt with\nswiftly.\nMy door will always be open\nand I will make a real effort to\nlet people know I exist and am\nthere to chat about any problem\nthey may have, and then deal\nwith it.\nStanding for All Posts\n\"Ifyc\nSmit\nu have a problem, if no one\n:an help and if you can find\n., maybe you can hire the\nmi.\"\nat's exactly what RON (Re-i Nominations) has done\nyear for the New Election\nj a ign!

We need a Felix editor, so\nwhat better candidate than the\nnewspaper reporter Amy Allen? OK, so we all know that\nshe's not a proper A Team mem-ber, but then the Felix editor\nisn'ta proper Sabbatical...\nThe A Team's election\npledges include replacing the\nentire minibus fleet with the\ncool black vans seen in the\nseries.

I 've worked with all the\nsabbaticals, and I 'll enjoy the\njob and the challenges.\nWhat experience do you have?\nLast year I was SCC chair, this\nyear I'm OSC chair. I 've worked\nwith the clubs and societies,\nI 've worked with their finances.\nAlso, I 've organised two big\nevents. I 've organised \"East\nmeets West\" last year. I was in\ncharge of organising\nInternational Night this year, so\nI was in charge of two big budgets there and I think that will\ngive me an advantage going\ninto the job.\nWhat's the single biggest\nchange?\nI would like to introduce debit\ncards use at the Union - not\nmany people carry cash any\nmore. I'd probably start just\nwith catering and, if I can, move\nit to bars.\nHow would you judge your\nown success at the year's end?\nI want to improve on the services that we offer. This can only\nbe done by getting people to\ncome in and give their say on\nhow the services are provided\nand what they want to see at\nthe bars and catering.\nSome clubs get \u00a350 per head,\nwhile some get only \u00a31. What\ndo you think of this?\nOne thing I would like to do is to\nlook at policies so every club\nand society are on the same\nplaying field and get an even\nchance.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nSimply because of my experience with the Union. I 've been\nworking closely with the Union\nthrough the SCC and OSC, I 've\ngot to know the staff and the\nsabbaticals this year. I 've got a good understanding of what my\njob would be.\nDepuf^Pfesident (finance & Services)\nWhy do you want to do this\njob?\nAs the current sabbaticals\nagree, spending a year at the\nend of your degree is a great\nway to spend a year. You get to\nsee a whole different side to\nCollege life than you might do\notherwise.\nWhat experience do you have\nthat qualifies you?\nI think I spend too much time in\nthe Union drinking and working\nin the bar so I 've had some feedback on how the bars have\nbeen doing for the past couple\nof years. I 've also been working\nwith the radio station as their\ntreasurer and Media Group junior treasurer.\nWhat's the worst thing about\nthe Union?\nSometimes people get too\ninvolved with Union politics\nand get very pedantic - The\nUnion - it's for students.\nSome clubs get \u00a350 per head,\nwhile some get only \u00a31. Is that\nfair?\nSome of those clubs who get\nmore funding can provide\nbroader services like IC Radio\nand STOIC. They go beyond\ntheir members.\nBut what about, say, gliding or\nunderwater clubs?\nThose clubs are quite specialist\nand their members are really\nenthusiastic about what they\ndo. I'm a member of Gliding\nClub and clubs like that should\ndefinitely be allowed the funding they get.\nWhat standards would you set\nyourself?\nI think putting money in to promote and encourage students\nto use the Union would be\ngreat. Improvements in bar takings and an increase in finance\nlevels are important.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nI'm in it to provide what I think\nthe students want and need\nfrom my post. If you agree, you\nshould vote for me.\nDeputy Present fF mk n ce& Services)\nWhy do you want to do this\njob?\nI think I can, is the main reason.\nWhat experience do you have?\nI have very little Union experience, but I 've got plenty of experience in the financial field\nthrough working for various\nagencies out of term-time.\nWhat's the best thing about\nUnion Services?\nThey all seem extremely re li able, but I 've only used them on\nthe South Ken campus.\nAlthough I 've been to Wye and\nSilwood I haven't investigated\nthe facilities out there, or at\nMary's or Charing Cross.\nWhat's the worst thing?\nThe communication. We need to\nintroduce a reliable and well-advertised method for the students to tell us what they want.\nAlright, there are forms avail-able, but they break down and\nvery few people know about\nthem.\nDo you think the inequality\nbetween funding for clubs is\nfair?\nIt depends on what you mean\nby fair. A sports society will\nneed transport to get to their\ngames and I believe that the\ninternational group have a fairly\nlarge contingency which they\ncan turn to. Whereas the sports\nsocieties need entry fees, kits\nand so on. I would be interested\nin sponsorship for the kit particularly. How would you judge success? If people like me, and people\nsay that I 've been a good\nDP(F&S) then I 've done a good\njob. I suppose I could also say\nthe profits, but that doesn't include services and the Union\nisn'ta profit-making organ is a tion. Profit should be regarded\nas a bonus.\nWhat makes you the strongest\ncandidate?\nI would say I am the strongest\ncandidate because of the\nresearch I 've done.\n\n"

Under their U Napproved Rules Of\nEngagement, the soldiers then\nopened fire for a period of\napproximately one minute,\nduring which time over 100\nrounds were fired.\nOne man was killed in the\nincident, while two others suffered minor injuries. The\nwoman - on her way to hospital at the time - delivered a baby in a nearby house some\nhours later. The paras involved\nwere taken off patrol, in accordance with MoD policy, while\ntwo - the corporal leading the\nsection and one other man -flew home on Tuesday.\nSpeaking for the Ministry of\nDefence, a spokesman insisted\nthat the men had at all times\nacted in accordance with Army\npolicy, adding, \"When you're\nunder fire from an unknown\ndirection, it's really a very\nscary thing. You make very\nsure that you establish where\nthe shots are coming from\nbefore you do an th mg else,\notherwise if you stick your\nhead up it's likely to get shot\noff.\" He added that \"the shots\nfired must have come from the\ndirection of [the victims' car].\nThey may well have got caught\nin an unlucky crossfire.\"\nA full joint investigation by\nthe Royal Military Police and\nAfghan security forces is currently underway.\nBush In Korea\nGeorge Bush this week visited\nSouth Korea as part of a tour\nover the next fortnight of the\nPacific Rim countries of Asia.\nThe visit was expected to\ncause controversy, however,\nbecause of his remarks earlier\non this year in his State Of The\nUnion address. At the time, the\nUS president - referring the\nUS-led efforts to control global\nterrorism he refers to as a \"war\" - described North Korea,\nalong with Iraq and Iran, as\nrepresenting an \"axis of evil\"\nfrom which the \"forces of ter-r or is m... gam support and sustenance for their wicked\ndeeds.\"\nHowever, many in North and\nSouth Korea are worried that\nBush's remarks may hinder or\neven damage attempts at\nreunification. Korea was split\ninto two countries following\nthe Korean War in the last century - regarded by many as the\nfirst real (successful) test of the\nnascent United Nations. This\nyear the richer, capitalist South\nplays co-host to the FIFA\nWorld Cup with Japan, and\nnative pundits and businesses\nare hoping the event will promote Korean values, culture\nand standing to the world.\nJoe\nKnowledge is of two kinds.\nWe know a subject ourselves,\nor we know where we can find information upon it.

The combination of a throbbing bass line,\na snappy but memorably dark guitar riff and Terry's melancholy\nlilt makes this single well worth having.\nBflBBB Jess\nHEFNER The Hefner Brain\nAnother quirky mixture of drum machines, modules and indie\ncrooning is coming your way, and if you like Hefner already,\nthen you know exactly what to expect. Worryingly though, most\nof the tracks sound uncannily like theme tunes from kids' TV\nprogrammes. I think the makers of Fireman Sam should sue.\nBBOQD Derek\nSIMIAN - Mr Crow\nSimian, who released their excellent first LP Chemistry Is\nWhat We Are last year, bring us more of their psychedelic pop\nexperiments. The two incarnations of Mr Crow - radio edit and\nalbum version - are both very catchy. Then, on the five other\ntracks, all previously unreleased, Simian's exciting brainwaves\nare particularly interesting as their sweet melodies contrast\nwith a background of electronica. On the whole, they produce a unique, innovative sound.\naaaa o Frangois\nCOMPETITION\nThis week, we're giving away a copy of the highly recommended compilation album FabricLive 02, mixed by A liB( see\nreview, page 23).\nQUESTION: Name the two resident DJs at FabricLive.\nEmail your answer, along with your name, year and depart-ment, to music.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 28 February.\nOUT THIS WEEK The following are due for release on Monday 25 February:\nALBUMS CLINIC - Walking With Thee\nJEWEL This Way\nMONTELL JORDAN - Montell Jordan\nTWO DAY RULE - When You're Ready\nSINGLES\nBRANCACCIO & AISHER - It's Gonna Be (A Lovely Day)\nCAPITOL K Pillow\nTETRA SPLENDOUR - Pollen Fever\n...and also the Hefner, Simian, White Stripes, Gorillaz and\nMiss Black America singles (all reviewed below)\nWHITE STRIPES - Fell In Love With A Girl\nWhat energy! This is definitive rock music. In less than two\nminutes, Meg and Jack White deliver a powerful song without\nsuperficial production, and the result is really exciting. The two\nother tracks on the CD are just as dynamic and energetic as the\nfirst. This is bound to be successful.\naaaa Frangois\nGORILLAZ - Tomorrow Comes Today\nSo the album's customary slow track finally gets released as\na single. Tomorrow Comes Today is a chilled out song with a cool harmonica bit, but it feels a little too much like Blur. Not\nthat there's anything wrong with Blur - I just expected more.\nThere's nothing special here, although there's nothing dire\neither. It might grow on me, but Damon's moaning voice will\nprobably just piss me off.\nBBQOO Oscar\nMISS BLACK AMERICA Infinite Chinese Box\nSystematic guitars, dynamic power chords and block rocking\nbeats begin your ten minute affair with the indescribably all ur ing, truly seductive Infinite Chinese Box. \"Short but sweet\" is a good description for one of the best singles of the year so far.\nThe B sides are equally promising. The tale of the dysfunction-al, self-destructing relationship has rarely been so eloquently\nexpressed via musica than on Scarface, and the bluesy, expressive Pub Rock Coma features punk sounds reminiscent of\nJimmy Eat World and vocals in the style of Hundred Reasons.\nBBBBO Sajini\nTELE POP MUSIK Breathe\nSqueaky electronic beats backed with inoffensive sonar\nswirls. That's probably the most tactful way to describe this\nattractively packaged single. Even the randomly scattered\nlyrics are un salvageable, unimaginative drivel. You can't dance\nto this - the best that one can muster is a slight nod of the head\nin time. But it isn't chilling music either, as the dither y beat\nbecomes more and more irritating as you listen.\nBOOOD Sajini\n\n"

    "content": "talk union\nHarvard, MIT or Imperial?\nA Note by Sen Ganesh, Union President\nOne of the key issues that has come to the\nfore recently is the number of applications\nto Imperial. Some of you may have read in\nthe press and media that there has been a worrying trend in a reduction of applications for university science courses. Some\nof this has in part been attributed to an\nincreasing mistrust in science. This has\nalso been compounded in recent years by\nthe Foot and Mouth crisis and the British\nBeef fiasco.\nFewer and fewer students are studying\nscience and maths at A Level and applying for science and engineering subjects.\nImperial College, being a specialist institution focusing on science, technology\nand medicine will face the brunt of it. In\neffect the market for good students is\nshrinking and the competition between\nthe top Universities will get ever more\nfierce.\nSo what is College going to do to combat this? Firstly the College must maintain itself as a world leader in teaching\nand research. We are a world-class institution with great resources and some of\nthe most talented students to be found\nanywhere. Whatever the College does to\naddress these problems, it is important\nthat we must not compromise our position as a leading institute and lower stan-dards. .\nOne of the key strategies as outlined by\nthe Rector in his recent talk, is to improve\nthe image of Imperial College. Whilst the\nCollege is well known is scientific circles\nit is not as renowned as the Harvards or\nthe MITs of the world. Improving the\nimage will attract help attract the best\nstudents and staff to maintain our high\nstandards.\nAnother short-term effect might be an\nincrease in the proportion of international\nstudents. There is still a large number of\nhigh calibre international students who\nwant to study in the UK but this in itself is\nnot a long-term solution. There are other\nways in which the College can address\nthis problem. The College has a well-developed programme of promoting science to the younger generation in the\nhope of attracting more people towards\nscience.\nWhatever happens there is going to be\na change in the culture of the College - we\nare entering a new age of competition\nand modernisation to establish our status\nas a world-class institute.\nImperial College Great Hall Friday8 th March SOO S8pm Carl Orff' s darr mna E>ur an a Sandstrom - ( j lori a^ ee th ov cn Hallelujah Chorus0 \u00bb<ic ott Malting of the Drum Imperial College Union Choir Hatch end HighSchool Chamber Choir Imperial College Symphony Orchestra Tickets E7 / \u00a3 3 . 5 0 students.
