    "content": "22\nIN THE GALLERIES\nSENSATION\nARTS 28 November 1997\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nS ENSATION, the most spoken\nabout and controversial exhibition of the Fall, presents\nthe works (of Art ???) of young\nBritish artists (YBAs) from the\nCharles Saatchi collection.\nWhat is the aim of the ex hi bi tion? - Contemporary art is always\ndebatable and the whole event\ncomes down to a few very philosophical questions; What is Art?\nWhat are its limits, if any? What is\nan artist?\nThe display falls aside any yet\ngiven definition. We are at the\nantipodes of Gautier's reflections,\nof the Theory of 'L 'Art pour l 'Art'.\nBeauty and refinement have definitely been brutally torn away from\nthe notion, even deliberately 'spat\nupon'.\n\"SENSATION is an attempt to\ndefine a generation\" - Not mine\nthank you !\nHere, Art becomes brutality,\nvulgarity, violence, corruption, per-vers it y. This exhibition is that of the\nanti-aesthetic.\nSENSATIONAL it is, in that it is\na SENSATIONAL display of the\ndecadence of British culture. It certainly reveals something about\nBritish society. England prides itself\nwith having the freedom of organising such an event but it constitutes\nyet another blow in her ever weakening aura.\nSeeing the crowds pressing\nround the entrance, at the till to\nbuy the catalogue and posters,\nmainly reflects this nation'sp eo ple's voyeurism, avidity for sensation and scandal. This should not\nbe surprising , considering the\noverall mediocre quality of the\nBritish media, even whose most\nreputable titles have more than a strong propensity to fall into sensationalism. A small mention at the entrance\nwarns that \"there are works of art in\nthis display which some visitors\nmay consider offensive\", and a caption asks parents to exercise their\nown judgement in bringing along\ntheir children, which did not prevent couples to contemplate sculptures of hanging men, with severed\nheads and genitals, in the most\nbloody way, with their five year old\ndaughter.\nDamien Hirst is probably the\nkey artist of the exhibition which\nfeatures his formaldehyde-pre-served animals, including such\nworks as \"This Little Piggy Went To\nThe Market, This Little Piggy Stayed\nAt Home\" - a pig sliced into two,\neach part placed into two parallel\ntanks of water and formaldehyde,\nwhich are driven by a mechanism\nso that they separate on a track :\nthe animal's innards are progressively revealed as one side slowly\nmoves forward.\nThe visitor can also walk in\nbetween 12 tanks of 'pickled'\nsliced cow - \"Comfort Gained From\nThe Acceptance That The Inherent\nLies In Everything\".\n\"A1000 years\", supposedly\n\"rehearsing the life-cycle and monstrous spectacle of death\" is Hirst's most repulsive display : a huge\nglass cube is home to thousands of\nflies, which are bom there, feed\nfrom a dead cow's head - a big\nlarge piece of raw flesh -, mate and\neventually die through (yet another\nmorbid invention) the \"insect-o cuter\". Needless to mention the\nstrong odour emanating from it and\nits incredible bacteria breeding\ncapacity...\nOne also finds one of Hirst's spin painting - wonderfully boring -entitled \"Beautiful Kiss My Fucking\nAss\", whose translation into another language is truly unthinkable.\nWhy is therefore 'acceptable' in\nEnglish ?\nThis exhibit is in fact part of a gallery, whose admission is prohibited to under 18s, with strict ID\ncontrol. Two particularly unhealthy\ndisplays stick out : James Rielly's \"Random Acts of Kindness\" is indecent as much in its association with\nthe work, or even more, as in the\nnumerous little panels showing a pedophile and his victims in many\ndifferent situations. Particularly in\ntoday's context, with all the dramatic events we hear of everyday,\nit is ut mostly shameful.\nJake and Dinos Chapman's \"Zygotic Acceleration, Biogenetic,\nDe-sublimated, Libidinal Model\nEnlarged *1000\" is a ring of\nSiamese mannequins, whose heads\nare attached to one another by\nvaginas. Their noses have become\npenises and their lips anuses, with\nparticular research carried out into\nshapes and sizes and let's say\n'interaction'. Out of what kind of\nhuman brains can such ideas be\nborn ??? It is at this point that the\noffence of claiming to be \"defining\na generation\" takes its maximum\nproportions.\nAmongst other exhibits, one\ncan find Marcus Harvey's \"Myra\",\nan enormous painting based on a police photo of Myra Hindley, convicted for the horrific murder of\nchildren, in the mid 60s, serving a prison sentence for life.\nGlobally, this exhibition\nexplores the taboos of sex, evil,\ndeath, drugs and the human body\nin no constructive way, very crudely and with a great deal of per vers i ty, aiming to shock for the sake of\nshocking and 'de-ennobles' such\nan institut in s as the Royal Academy\nof Arts.\nDanuta Pieter\nNEW MEDIA CENTRE\nInstitute of Contemporary Arts\nH ave you ever fancied\nexpressing your digital creativity? The Institute of\nContemporary Arts lives up to it's name with the launch of a new\nmedia centre as it enters it's50 th year. This is a joint venture with Sun\nmicrosystems which has contributed two million pounds to\nestablish the centre.\nAs technology continues to\nadvance, it's impact on society and\nculture is becoming more evident.\nThis centre should allow genres and\ntechnologies to meet and collaborate leading to the transformation\nof existing art forms and the emergence of new ones.\nThe centre consists of several\npowerful computer stations running a new development named\nJava. This is a 'language' which\nenables computers and networks\nto interact across the Internet irrespective of make or location. So\nthe public will be able to access\nthese facilities, many of which can\nbe run on the average PC.\nSo, what can you do with this\nnew artifice?\nCREATE. Animations, audiovisual packages, it will even be possible to produce aCD. or film over\nthe website.\nMartin Lambert, director of\nmarketing and technology at Sun\ncompared this project to the early\nmovie Industry in the I890's, where cameras were available but\npeople were unsure how best to\nuse them.\nSun will therefore be providing\nsponsorship for a resident artist,\nwho will explore the boundaries\nbetween science and art using the\nvarious programmes.\nSome examples of electronic\nartwork were exhibited at the\nopening of the centre. Richard\nBrown's Alembic was a combination of animated 3-D visuals with\nsound; A representation of the ele-ment s, earth, fire, air and water,\nwhich reacted to surrounding\nmovements. The contorted pinkish\ncolumn in the centre of the darkened room became oddly relaxing\nwith the addition of the synthesised, ambient sounds.\nThe introduction of the centre\nalso provides a welcome digital\nexhibiting space which will be\nviewed across the globe.\nComputer workstations are currently available for public use at the\nICA in the cafe area between 12.00\nand 18.00. The rest of the centre\nwill remain exclusive while it\nbecomes established.\nComputer experts from Sun will\nbe on-hand to give advice on how\nto operate programmes and how to\nmake the most of the technology.\nYou can also enter the website:\nhttp://www.new media centre. com/\nThis includes the ICA archive and a chance to review the latest digital\nartwork.\nDemelza &.

    "content": "10 FEATURE 28th November 1997\nIMPOSSIBLE MINDS\nMWLMlil\nProf Aleksander with\nMAGNUS, his neural network software.\n|T: First of all, what's the book\nabout?\nIA: Ohhh... you'll have to buy the\nbook to find out! It's really about trying to\nunderstand what consciousness is from a mechanistic point of view. It's a very controversial subject, that, because you have\nphilosophers who will tell you there's no\nsuch thing as mechanistic point of view\non consciousness. Then you have neurobiologists who actually measure levels of\nconsciousness in the brain, they know\nroughly what the different elements of\nconsciousness are, so where engineers\ncome in (I'm an engineer, obviously), is\nto try and model what neuro-biologists\nhave. What I 've tried to do in the book is\nto explain in layman's terms what it is\nthat you're likely to find in the brain when\nyou're looking for consciousness, in\nterms of very, very simple ideas about\nneural networks. I 've also brought in a lot\nof the philosophy of consciousness\nwhich tells us why it is that people are so\nsensitive about the topic, so the book is\na kind of primer on consciousness, if you\nlike.\nJT: So, what is consciousness?\nIA: Well, one of the dangers is trying\nto define it too closely. It's a lot of things.\nThat's what causes all the trouble. You\nstart off with the ability to perceive. Our\nbrains reconstruct a world; what we see\nwith our eyes, what happens at the back\nof the eyeball, is a jumble of signals.\nFirstly, what the brain does is reconstruct\nthat; it gives us the feeling that we live in\na coherent world, so there's a sort of perceptual aspect of consciousness, or visual awareness, if you like. Now, there are\na whole lot of things associated with that,\nwithout which we wouldn't have a great\ndeal of consciousness, but it's not only to\ndo with vision: it's to do with all the other\nsenses as well.\nWith human beings, it's a lot to do\nwith being able to talk about our con-s cio us ness, being able to describe what's in our heads...\nconsciousness.\nThen you have the relationship\nbetween the things that are in our heads\nand our unconscious, which is also a part. You find out in the book that all\nthese various aspects of consciousness\nare listed. Consciousness is everything\nwe can think of. Everything we do; it has\nto do with our consciousness.\nJT: Do you have any detractors - are\nyou every seen as mad scientist?\nIA: I certainly have detractors, but I'm not sure I'm seen as a mad scientist. I think some detractors ask the question\n'Consciousness is everything we can think of.\"\nJT: Like Descartes?\nIA: Yes, well, I think you've got to be\ncareful with Descartes. Language comes\nin to it with humans, but that doesn't mean that animals that don't have language aren't conscious in some way or\nanother.\nThere's[ also] the ability to know\nwhere we've been, to know where we are\nnow, and the ability to plan into the\nfuture. These are all things that are going\non in our heads, and they're all part of\n\"What the blazes is an engineer doing in\nthis business? Engineers are supposed to\nfix washing machines. Why is he getting\nmixed up with consciousness?\". Well, the\nanswer is pretty straight forward; one\nthing engineers, particularly electrical\nengineers, learn to handle are very complex systems. Now, the brain is a complex system, and in fact the kind of\nmodels that neuro-biologists come up\nwith are really at times simple-minded.\nThey're not stupid, but they just don't "

    "content": "2 NEWS 28 November 1997\nDisappearing Departments\nBY MATTHEW BENNETT\nThe Geology and Earth Resources\nEngineering departments are living on borrowed time following\nthe announcement that they will\ncease to exist on 31 December\n1997. To ease the pain of parting,\nilm is being offered for the\nrefurbishment of the crumbling\nRoyal School of Mines building.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of\nImperial College, announced the\ncreation of a new 'school' within\nthe Royal School of Mines (RSM)\nwhich will merge the Imperial\nCollege Centre for Environmental\nTechnology (ICCET) together with\nthe loss making Geology and ERE\ndepartments. ICCET may not disappear completely, with the possibility that they may continue to\nexist as a Centre within the new\nschool being created.\nIn a lengthy statement Sir\nOxburgh explained how these\nmergers would enable cross disciplinary groups to be set up more\neasily in order to \"exploit the growing scientific and practical opportunities for work on the environment\nin its broadest sense\". He commented that the boundaries\nbetween disciplines are not set in\nstone but merely points that \"at\nsome particular time may have\nappeared as an activity minima\nbetween them.\"\nThe Rector expressed his belief\nthat the new school would \"provide\nboth a unique opportunity to tackle\nsome of the major problems confronting society in the next cent u ry.\" The new venture is to be\nnamed after TH Huxley and partly\nfunded by a \u00a31 million bequest\nfrom Mungo Park, an RSM student\nbetween 1897-1900.\nThe last structural change in the\nRSM, the 1994 modification of\nERE's title, provoked opposition\nfrom academic staff who felt that\nthey had not been properly con-sul ted. Professor Rees Rawlings,\ncurrent Dean of RSM, has trumpeted the high morale of his staff\nemphasising that \"the staff of the\ntwo departments concerned are\nlooking forward to the future after a period of some uncertainty.\"\nIn an attempt to calm student\napprehension over the loss of\ndepartmental identity Prof Rawlings\ninsisted that \"the merger will not\naffect the students on undergraduate or masters courses, as these\ncourses will continue in their present form.\" He also added that a full range of courses would continue to be offered.\nThe new school is due to be\nestablished on 1 January 1998, with\nthe fast rising Professor John\nBeddington as director.\nBUSA Single Entry Friday Night Fracas\nBYMARIA IOANNOU\nImperial College Union is to\nmake a decision at next week's Council Meeting as to whether\nImperial College School of\nMedicine Union (ICSMU) should\ncontinue to enter their own\nteams, separate to IC, to compete in the British Universities\nSports Association (BUSA)\nChampionships.\nICU President, Eric Allsop, has\nbeen mandated by the Union\nExecutive to write a paper for ICU\nCouncil on the issue. When questioned by Felix, Mr Allsop said \"This\npaper will comprise of three parts.\nThe first part will outline the facts\nThe re vitali sed Ante Gallery in\nthe Sherfield Building opened\nthis Monday with the first of a series of exhibitions entitled\n\"Art Lab Project\" curate d by\nChelsea College of Art graduate\njean in e Tulkins. This series is\nan attempt from the artist's part to push new ideas. Ms\nTulkins described this as \"an\nexciting, challenging and\nunusual opportunity for the\nartists, who have responded\nenthusiastically to this in vita tion.\" She added that \"people\nshould not come here with an\nexpectation to fully understand,\nbut to come with an open\nmind.\" The gallery is still undergoing refurbishment, but the\nexhibition is currently on dis-play. Photo: Aliki Ceorgakopoulou\nand background. The second part\nwill contain my opinions on the\nmatter and the paper will finish\nwith a motion for a single-entry.\"\nThis proposal will not have the support of ICMSU. The Sports and\nClubs Representative of St Mary's, Katy Sheehan, said \"If ICU Council\nvote for single-entry, 1 think it is\nunreasonable. The medics have\nproved themselves to be strong\nenough to put an entry in that warrants an entry.\" She added \"The\nmedical schools have a long-stand-ing tradition and reputation, and\nwe very much want a separate\nBUSA entry.\" \"People don't want\nto play for IC, IC has always been\nthe opposition.\"\nBY TONY OFORI\nOn Friday 14 November an ex-Royal School of Mines student\nwas punched in the face resulting\nin a painful injury. A brief scuffle\nalso occurred involving the Union\nstewards as he was thrown out\nof the Union Building.\nEarlier that night the ex-stu-dent, who cannot be named, had\nbeen at the 1 13th annual RSMA\ndinner attended by the Dean of\nRSM where he had consumed\nalcohol. According to eyewitness\naccounts he had come with a friend, also an ex-miner. After the\ndinner he and his friend went to\nthe Union Bar where they drank\nsome more, and according to\nthose present, started to become\n'a bit of a nuisance'. Felix was also\ntold that whilst in the Union bar\nthe first ex-student chatted with a female student who was with her\nboyfriend. The boyfriend did not\ntake too kindly to the friendly mannerisms of this person: a witness\nsaid that her inter lo cut or was \"a little too friendly with his hands\".\nIt is believed an exchange of\nwords followed, during which the\nboyfriend grabbed the other man\nand got him into a headlock before\npunching him in the face. An eyewitness said the punch resulted in\nthe skin on the bridge of the nose\nsplitting leaving the bone exposed,\nand added that there was a lot of\nblood. After delivering the blow the\nboyfriend, realising that his actions\nmay have incited RSM students\npresent in the bar, left the\npremises.\nAll the stewards, except those\nat the gate, were called to the\nscene. It was the stewards' belief\nthat the ex-student was the\naggressor, so under Union policy\nhe had to leave. He and his friend\nwere led outside and marched out\nof Beit Quad. At the gate he began\nto get aggressive, angered at what\nhe thought was unfair treatment.\nStewards reported that both he\nand his friend threw several punches at them. After security was\ncalled the situation was diffused\nwithout any further intervention.\nMark Home, ICU's events man ag er, told Felix that the incident is\ncurrently undergoing investigation\nby the licensees of the Union bar.\n\n"

However 1 feel\nit was probably worth the wait as it\nis probably only now that computers have the power to do justice to\na film of this stature. The game isn't based on the story-line or characters from the film, but is set in the\nsame futuristic, dark, post apocalyptic world. The atmosphere created by the director in the film has\nbeen acclaimed and 1 think that the\ngame has done an excellent job of\nmimicking this.\nIt's an adventure or rather a detective style game. A bit like\nUnder a Killing Moon, or the very\nancient Mean Streets. In fact it\nbares a great resemblance to\nMean Streets indeed; the way you\ncollect clues, move about the city\nin you flying car and the little bit of\naction thrown in. This action 1 mentioned is shooting enemies or suspects in a sort of mouse controlled\nVirtua Cop style walk-through sce-na rio. The graphics however are\nvery advanced. Their quality is\nalmost film like yet unlike the interactive movie style game you have\ncomplete control of your character,\nRay McCoy. His movements are\nvery realistic and you would think it\nhad all been filmed but no it is\ncomputer generated.\nThe story is that you are, like\nDeckard (Harrison Ford) was\nbefore you, a Blade Runner, given\nthe task of hunting down rogue\nreplicants. There is a fairly gruesome cut-scene of a crime (animal\nmurder!) and that's where your\ninvestigation starts. That scene and\nwith other numerous gory movie\nse que nci es the game has been\nhonoured with a15 certificate. The\ngore is effective and this is a good\nthing as although it isn't done to\nover effect, like ultra gory games, it\nis a refreshingly moody, dark and\nsinister game.\nIt quickly becomes apparent\nthat replicants have or are playing a major part in the crime and the plot\nunfolds from there. As it was, I barely scratched the surface of this\nmassive game, contained on 4 cd-roms.

    "content": "28th November 1997 FEATURE 1 1\nIMPOSSIBLE MINDS\nIC's guru of mechanical brains, Igor Aleksander, talks to\nJon Trout about his book. Robots and mad scientists.\nhave the sophistication that an engineer\ncan add. That's why I'm in this business.\nJT: How did you get started?\nIA: I'd been working on neural nets\nfor the best part of thirty years. Now,\nneural nets are models of the brain. The\nbrain is a very different thing from a conventional computer; the way it learns, the\nway it has its own way of doing things.\nMy background has really been in com-put ers, so I 've been puzzled by the d if ference. The more you work with neural\nnets, the more you're looking for sophisticated behaviour in the nets, and eventually you hit upon consciousness. I believe that we have an artificial consciousness program in my laboratory in\nElectrical Engineering.\nthe actual consciousness have a loc a tion?\nIA: [general hilarity] Magnus is a virtual machine so whatever happens in it is\nsomething that takes place in the com-put er. Now, Magnus itself is not con-s cio us, but it's a tool that enables you to\nstudy consciousness. Now, the confusion\ncomes in here because you could put\nMagnus-like machinery into a robot. I would argue that, at that point, the robot,\nin a very artificial way, becomes con-s cio us. It may become aware of the\nworld it lives in, it may be able to have a natural-language conversation with a human being, so it's got its own con-s cio us ness. However, because the\nrobot's made of silicon and mechanical\n'I believe that we have an artificial\nconsciousness program in my\nlaboratory.\"\nJT: Is there any way of measuring or\nquant ising the level of consciousness\nor intelligence?\nIA: You've got to be very very careful\nabout the relationship between intelligence and consciousness. I actually find\nintelligence a much harder concept to\nthink about. Obviously, you must be conscious in order to be intelligent, but the\nway you measure models of consciousness is just to ask them.\nJT: Tell me about Magnus; what is\nit?\nIA: Magnus is a piece of software\nwhich you can download from the\nInternet. It's a neural network system\nthat enables us to do the kind of experiments that appear in the book. It's a development system; if you're interested\nin artificial consciousness its a tool that\nwill allow you to do research in that area.\nI find it extraordinarily useful as it runs on\nmy PC, so 1 can do research anywhere.\nIt's like a Mechano kit for putting together models that are a bit like the modules\nof the brain. We can put them together\nand test whether our ideas of how the\nbrain works are right or wrong.\nJT: Is there just a spark and some\nsort of essence comes into being? Does\nparts and so on, that's still a very artificial\nsort of consciousness. So there's many\nforms of consciousness. That of a human\nbeing and that of a robot are completely\ndifferent. But if the robot behaves in such\na way that requires its actions to be\nunderpinned by a form of consciousness\nthen you have your answer.\nJT: Why is human consciousness so\ndifferent?\nIA: It is very closely related to what\nyou're made of, because that determines\nyour needs, aspirations and what you do\nin the world. Consciousness grows\naccording to these needs. Now, the\nrobots, if they are conscious at all, will be\nconscious of their own difference from\nhuman beings. If one were to have a conversation with a human being, and the\nhuman said \"Well, when are you lot going\nto take over the world?\", the robot\nshould come back and say \"Don't be stu-pid, I have no need to take over the\nworld, that's a human ambition.\"\nJT: Hopefully! I know this is science\nfiction, but how far are we from developing androids such as Star Trek's Data?\nIA: In the book I 've used forty years,\nbecause that's actually a very very long\ntime in the development of technology. I think that by that time we will have entities that humans will accept as conscious\nbut they won't be quite as interesting as\nwe see in science fiction, having rather\ndefined roles without their own personal-i ties. In the old days some people would\nhave seen the Internet connected PC as a thinking machine.\nJT: Do you think there's an ethical\nquestion?\nIA: People say there is, but I think it's a mistaken link between consciousness\nand ethical questions. At the moment we\nhave ethical questions which arise with all\nentities in the world which we know to be\nconscious, not necessarily because\nthey're conscious, but because they're\nalive. I know that a robot can survive any\nconscious thing on earth so discussions\nof its life come down to questions of\nhuman investment. You might think of\n\"do I kill a conscious machine\" in the\nsame terms as do 1 want to destroy an\naeroplane or some such. Does a robot\nhave a desire to maintain it's existence?\nWell, no, not necessarily - it depends on\nit's purpose. It may be much happier to\nend it's existence if it thinks it's purpose\nhas been fulfilled - and\nthat's where science\nfiction comes in. The\nmachine may not be\nhappy, whereas the\noperator may feel that\nit's job has been done,\nand that's what happened with HAL and all\nthose fictional robots.\nBut in reality, the\nrelationship is much\nmore like that between\na conventional computer and it's software.\nAt present, the computer will defend\nagainst someone coming along and wanting\nto destroy it's memory or a virus - and\nit's much more like that with artificial\nintelligence. Once a machine receives an\norder in it's programming to defend a part of itself, then it will defend it. It's simply a question of which sections you\ndecide need defending.\nIgor Aleksander will be signing copies of\n\"Impossible at\nVVaterstone's Bookshop.

I have had a look at these in the past, and without exception, they have all been\ncompletely useless; packed with\nthe most banal and obvious points\nthere could be. Each of these\nbooks also had a selection of clearly made-up anecdotes to fill up\nsome more pages. 'The Successful\nExecutive' sticks rigidly to this presumably successful formula and\ncontains seventy-two sections \"in\nwhich the author shares the\nsecrets of his own success\". So,\nwhat are Nigel Linacre's 'pearls of\nwisdom' ? Well, let me give you a few of his finest thoughts:\n\"2.2 Have bits and pieces\nhandy \" - he suggests placing stationery and documents where they\ncan be found later.\n\"2.3 Use your diary\" - that's it.\n\"3.4 Organise your time\" - with\nthe following ridiculously contrived\nmnemonic: \"Priorities, Organise to\nachieve them, Execute the necessary tasks, Think about what you\nhave achieved and Recharge\nYourself.\" It truly is poetry.\n\"5.10 Avoid being ineffective\" -sitting at your desk doing nothing\nis unproductive. Revolutionary!\nI admit that these are probably\nthe worst points made and that\nsome of the other sections could\nbe of some use, but these are few\nand far between and are still not\nuseful. The book is full of either\nrepetition, or incompetent advice,\nas shown above. I can not see how\nany potential executives here\ncould benefit from this book in any\npossible way. If you are going to\nbe a successful executive you\nshould not need to be told what to\ndo with pens and pencils and you\nshould not be forced to waste \u00a3 10\nand your valuable time in buying\nand reading this book.\nD Chiron\nPublisher: Century Business\nBooks\nPrice: \u00a3 9 . 9 9\n\n"

    "content": "28 November 1997 MUSIC 15\nCLUBSCENE - THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE\nH ere's a big clich e, and I'm going to get it out of the\nway right now (decide for\nyourselves whether or not I'm being sincere). Meeting Spencer\nKinsey (aka Gemini) was actually\none of the most pleasant and fulfilling experiences I 've had in the\nmusical aspect of my life. Some of\nhis ideas and beliefs inspired me\nand made me think about subjects\noutside of music; and music outside of house.\nBorn in Chicago, Spencer\nKinsey moved to LA at a young age\nand returned to Chicago (and a brand new musical vibe called\nhouse) when he was 16. Due to his\ndefinition of this music, he\ndoes appreciate LA for\ninspiring and influencing\nhim. \"I look at house as an\nextension of rhythms that\nhave been around for thousands of years. That's all it\nreally is.\" This is how he justifies David Bowie's Let's Dance as being a house\nrecord before house music ever\nwas.\nSpencer Kinsey took his pseudonym from his starsign. Having\nreleased music under his real\nname, he decided that the people\nof Chicago who knew him were not\ngiving him honest or constructive\nfeedback. To get their real op in ions, he decided to invent a secret\nidentity for himself.\nA scan through Gemini's lengthy back-catalogue indicates\nthat he has been releasing material\nfor only four years. If you consider\nthe fact that today he can produce\nthree consistently excellent albums\nin as many months then you'll\nunderstand why 1 use the word\nonly. In fact he believes that he has\nbeen creating music for a lot longer\nthrough his DJing skills. \"1 would\ntake one record, and another\nrecord, and mix them together and\nfind myself actually making a song.\nAnd it was like, oh wow!\"\nDJing has actually changed\nthrough time according to Gemini.\n\"It used to be just playing records,\nthen it went into just mixing, and\nnow it's into making music.\" Thus\nwas born Gemini's theory of evo lu tion!\nGemini is one of a few artists\nwho can bridge the gap that has\nformed between house and tech-no. His records appeal to a wide\naudience of electronic listeners and\nappear in the sets of some of the\nworld's most respected DJs. As a DJ he himself has played at some of\nthe world's most prestigious\nevents. None of this appears to\nhave gone to his head, however.\nThe way he acts and talks suggests\n'Look what happened to Frankie\nKnuckles. He left Chicago.' And it's like look what happened to him.\nNothing much really! He just did\nthe same thing he's always been\ndoing.\" Maybe this could be a lesson to some of us who think that\ngood drum 'n' bass originates solely from within this country.\nGemini is a prolific artist,\nreleasing over twenty records in his\ncareer. He doesn't limit himself to\none label either, arguing that he\nfound the Chicago record houses a little too claustrophobic for him,\nrun by people who were, in his\nopinion, limiting his music to certain people and not realising that\nmoves\nwords by: al;ck\nGemini, He v seA a childish innocence, even an ignorance from his perspective to the\nimpact of his creations.\nWhen I tell him how much I like\na certain track from his last album,\nhe smiles and says \"cool\" as if in\nsurprise. When 1 ask him at the\nbeginning of the interview what he\ndoes, for the benefit of any listeners who are unaware of him, he\nshrugs and says very matter-of-fact ly,\"I just make some music.\"\nTry telling 300,000 crazy, loved-up\nc lubbers at the 1995 Love Parade\nthat the guy playing to them just\nmakes some music!\nGemini claims that his music is\ninspired, in part, by his surroundings and environment on a global\nscale. \"Everything I see, hear, feel;\nit's just all a part of the music to\nme. 1 put it all into my music.\" I was struck by his attitude that good\nhouse music doesn't necessarily\ncome from Chicago. \"I don't think\nit's where you're at; it's what\nyou're doing. Some people say\nthey could reach a wider audience\nwith a little more effort. \"When I do\nmusic I want it to be heard. I don't want to be shuffled under a rug\nsomewhere.\"\nInfluences in his life include\npersonalities from all walks of life\n(Aristotle, Robert de Niro, Miles\nDavis, Thomas Edison to name but\na few). He believes that they are all\npeople \"who have pushed things to\nanother level within themselves.\"\nThis is the message that he says he\nis trying to put across in his music\ntoday.\nGemini's message to any young\nDJs or producers hoping to make it\nin the music industry is simply,\n\"Always compete with yourself.\"\nHe doesn't see the point in being\ninfluenced by something else to the\npoint of copying that sound. \"Look\nat everything else...as influences\nand things that you like. But when\nyou sit down to make music just\ncompete With yourself.\"\nGemini was a thoughtful inter-view ee, carefully considering his\nanswers throughout. His sense of\nhumour was carefree and infectious. His child-like aspect may not\nsuit the high-octane lifestyle of\nLondon, but surely it is this that\nallows him to imagine and conceive\nmusical collages that can whisk you\ninto a sense of complete freedom\nand lightness.\nAt the end of the day, Gemini\ntaught me (in his own quiet and\nindirect way) that ultimately\nwe are all into music and\nthat everything else we\nplaster all over and label it\nwith is necessary but superficial and should be treated\nas such.\nYou can hear the full\nGemini interview and some\nof his music on the Electric\nCafe on the Network on IC Radio\nthis Sunday night from midnight\nuntil 2am. Gemini has three albums that\nare currently available:\nImagine a Nation (Relief Records)\nIn and Out of Fog and Lights\n(Peacefrog)\nIn Neutral (Distance)\nThe Electric Cafe, in as s so sia tion with p hutu re trax is giving\naway three copies of Gemini's new\nalbum In Neutral.

    "content": "28 November 1997 COLUMNS\nThere are few shared experiences at Imperial. Lectures and\ntutorials pass by some of our num-ber. As for the opposite sex, need\nI say more? However, one thing\nunites us all. The false alarm. Who\ncan have failed to be repeatedly\ninconvenienced by the fire alarm\ngoing off without good reason.\nUnder normal circumstances this\nwould be in the 'dog bites man'\nclass of news worthiness, but of\nlate there seems to have been a distinct increase. Southside had\nthree in one evening recently.\nChemistry, my own department,\nhas more fire alarms in a week\nthan could reasonably be expected\nin a decade. Needless to say, they\nalways occur at the most inopportune moment, causing tremendous disruption, annoyance and,\nat this time of year, hypothermia.\nIt is amazing how many people in\nCollege still bother with evacuations, given that they are occur-ring, sometimes, on a daily basis.\nWhy is the system so unreliable?\nLack of money? Sloppy main te nance? In my own case, the last\nfalse alarm was caused by the lat-ter, but generally it is difficult to\nsay. There is no shortage of\nmoney; fire systems, like office\nrefurbishments, are deemed\nessential expenditure, so the\nmoney can always be found.

Sadly, as\nwith so many\nthings here, it will\ntake a major in ci dent, where casualties stem from\nignorance of the\nalarm or its failure\nto go off at all, to\nchange things.

    "content": "MORE LETTERS 28 November 1997\n\u00a9STAR LETTER\u00a9\nDear Felix,\nRecently, 1 have noticed that\nthe less politically-motivated members of our college have been\nre cie ving a very bad press. I am\nwriting this letter to redress the balance and take an opportunity to\nspeak out for the lazy and un opinionated majority.\nWe at the Society of Apathetic\nDossers (a.k.a. SlobSoc) make up\none of the largest student organisations on the campus, yet our inactivity always seems to go unrecognised. For many years we have\nbeen campaigning vociferously for\nthe right to remain silent, and our\nexistence is founded on the belief\nthat no-one should be afraid to\nexercise their democratic right to\nindifference. We have over 1000\nmembers, and the depth of their\nsupport and solidarity for our principles is shown eloquently by the\nfact that only three of them have\never turned up to any of our meet-in gs. Over recent months we have\nbecome increasingly annoyed by\nthe Union, who seem to have been\nconstantly bullying us into forming\nopinions about who to vote for.\nThe Union hacks are always bothering us with their silly election cam-pa ign s, and it has taken four rounds\nof elections for them to get the\nmessage that we just DO NOT GIVE\nA TOSS! Last week we once again\nsie zed the opp or unity to sit back\nand not get noticed, and this time\nthe silly idiots finally got what they\ndeserved. It is about time we let\nsomeone competent like the\nMedics or Sherfield do the job, or\nbetter still avoid the hassle of having a Union in the first place by\nclosing it down and getting it converted into something useful like\nconference facilities. Do they not\nrealise that they're just creating\nextra work for themselves? I 've\neven heard that there are some\npeople at the Union running clubs\nand sco ie ties who don't even get\npaid for it! Are they complete\nmorons or something? They're the\nkind of people who think that the\nright way to deal with something is\nto keep pestering important college\nofficials about it. But this just causes lots of u necessary aggravation\non both sides. We believe that the\nproper way to air your grievances is\nto spend a couple of hours moaning and w hinging about them with\nyour mates in the pub, and then\nforget it. That way, you can be\nseen to care about something without having to take the trouble of\nactually do anything about it, and\neveryone will be a lot less stressed.\nAs for our stance on tuition\nfees, we wholeheartedly believe\nthat they're not e ally that bad. I would even consider pawning my\nPlaystation to get a place at IC,\nbecasue it has such a great atmosphere and is full of the most wonderful people. To prove this point,\nwe went on a march to Trafalgar\nSquare with placards saying 'WE\nDON'T REALLY MIND THAT MUCH\nABOUT TUITION FESS' and 'TONY\nBLAIR IS OK'. No-one really\nnoticed us, so I think we can claim\nto have had much more success\nthan the protestors.\nIf you wouldn't like to get up off\nyour arse and get involved with\nanything, don't bother coming to\nour next meeting, where we will be\ndiscussing how best to avoid making A decision about when to have\nthe next meeting. 1 doubt anyone'll\nturn up anyway.\nYours sincerely,\nColin Dale,Physics 3,\nChairman, SAD.\nonly when one sees first-hand the\nenvironmental and social damage\nthat unethical investment causes\nthat you see an over-powering case\nfor an ethical investment policy.\nCompanies that pollute the environment, such as the oil industry,\nneed money and to carry out their\ndirty deeds, some of this money\ncomes from investments by financial organisations. Oppressive\nregimes that torture and murder\ntheir people need the means to do\nso, they buy their weapons from\narms manufacturers which do not\ncare what their weapons will be\nused for, just as long as the sale\nmakes a healthy profit.\nIn today's world, money sadly is\npower, and without it polluters and\narms manufacturers cannot continue to do what they do. A financial\norganisation that invests in companies that pollute and produce arms\nenables these companies to carry\non. If all financial institutions\nadopted an ethical investment pol-icy, these polluters and arms producers would find it very difficult to\nCURRY\nCONFUSION Dear Felix,\nAli Campbells \"Thought of the\nday\" raises an interesting question.\nThe fundamental fact that has been\nmissed is that curry bills follow the\nlaw that states that the sum of the\nparts is not equal to the whole (or\nwhatever the law says?). This\nmeans that if you work out what\neveryone had and then added it\ntogether and included service and\ndamage this will still not be equal\nto the bill, even in honest rest au rants. There are two ways to overcome this problem, split the bill\nevenly and rely on the fact that\nafter knowing someone for four\nyears what you all really owe each\nother is irrelevant or just make\nsome excuse and leave early thus\nlanding the bill with someone else.\nYours faithfully\nNick Newton, ICSM\nSOUND BUSINESS\nDear Felix,\n1 write with reference to Mr.\nBaker's column in issue 1098. It is\ncontinue without investments, and\nit would also send a message to\nthem to clean up their act.\nIf a company is \"doing something dicey\" it does not automatically mean the truth always gets\nout about it. There are several\ndod gy dealings of companies that\nnever make it to the attention of\nthe masses because they keep\nquiet about it, or silence people\nwho protest about it, or the media\nis not interested or legally unable to\nreport it. Coupled with a politically\napathetic nation means that companies can get away with murder,\nliterally.\nI invite Mr. Baker, as an intelligent man, to open his eyes to what\nis beyond the boundaries of his\nown life.\nB Canning, Chem 2\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nHAIR CUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES: c3^ CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your sty ie. try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\nJr SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage.

Galileo Galilei: A tad unlucky,\nperhaps?\nZ UJ\n6\nCO\ndared to speak about the idea of\ninfinity, against the idea of the\nuniqueness of the Man, the best\ncreature made by God, was burnt\nalive in Rome. The century after saw\nthe birth of the Age of the Reason\nand Enlightenment. During the\nFrench Revolution, the citizens of\nParis destroyed statues of saints and\nangels and instead placed statues of\nthe \"Goddess of Reason\". Last century, Giosue' Carducci, an Italian\npoet, wrote \"Inno a Satana \" (Hymn\nto Satan), in which he spoke about\nreason, progress, modernity and the\nneed to live in the world thinking\nabout the world and not about\nHeaven; the importance of what is\nimminent, not what is transcendent.\nMuch has been said about the\nbirth of Science, but not many\npeople know the hidden relations\nwhich existed between science,\nmagic and even the philosophy of\nSatanism. Let us understand what\nreally happened in those dark ages\nwhen scientists, magicians and\nastrologers belonged to the same cat-e gory. Until 1600, there was what is\ncalled a \"triangular knowledge\nprocess\" where men were forbidden\nto understand the world with their\nreason; they had to refer to the Holy\nBible to know what was around\nthem. Through the Middle Ages, the\nRoman Catholic Church adopted a model of the Universe based on\nAristotle's ideas, revised and corrected by St. Thomas,\nHoly Doctor of the / / ( . . . .\nChurch. This model\nin any agreement wi tnt neT \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3$r Devil, there is a moment at which\nUniverse, and that it\nwas surrounded by 55\nspheres made of the\na price must be paid.\npurest ether, and the whole Solar\nSystem, including the Sun, spun\naround our planet. Outside this \\\\\ntern there was heaven and God, jar rounded by angels. But in the seventeenth century, Galileo Galilei, the\nItalian scientist, used binoculars lor\nthe first time to observe the sky.\nThat night, on the lop floor of a small villa in Pisa near Florence, the\nstory was going to change. Howgreat would have been Galilcu'^\nwonder \"-hen he saw mourn.i in s ii ul valleys on the Moon! Where was the\npure ether? And what about t ne four\nlittle satellites orbiting around\nJupiter, so similar to the Moon and\nto the other planets? That night, the\nso-called \"triangular knowledge\nprocess\" was broken: men tried to\nunderstand the world using only\ntheir reason, not the Bible. And, in i doing that, Galileo rebelled against\nthe Holy Church, like Lucifer did\nagainst God. In fact, the basis of the\nphilosophy of Satanism is that man\nis able to look after his life without\nthe help of God.

After all, it is\njust a matter of reproducing the normal electrical currents present inside\na human brain on complex silicon-based chips.

But who can state\nthat men will never be able to understand this complexity?\nIf these ideas seem to\nclose to science-fiction,\nwe should remember that\nnow we can connect the\nlittle brains of some little\nbugs to a small\nmicrochips, and scientists\ncan control the movements\nof these living insects using a simple\nremote-controllers, as if these living\ncreatures were micro-models.

    "content": "28 November 1997\nALIEN RESURRECTION REVIEW AND COMPETITION\nFILM\nALIEN RESURRECTION\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\nEverybody' s favourite alien-killer is back.\nAfter Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character\nkilled both herself and the alien inside her\nin Alien3\n, audiences would be forgiven for thinking they had seen the last of her. But fortunately\nthis is not the case as Ripley has received the\nJurassic Park treatment and been reconstructed\nfrom a blood sample taken 200 years earlier in\nthe third instalment.\nThe motive behind this genetic engineering\nwill raise a smile from anybody who has witnessed the aliens' legendary ferocity. The\nmilitary of the future want to extract the chest-burst er inside Ripley and tame it, thereby\nbreeding the perfect all-round work animal of\nthe future. This dubious venture takes place on\na space station heading for Earth, thus making\nthe inevitable rampage all the more threatening\nto mankind.\nWhat distinguishes this hokum from the rest\nof the films in the series is that the resurrection\nprocess means Ripley now has a substantial\namount of alien DNA inside her. This gives her\nthe advantage of superhuman strength and,\nmore interestingly, a sixth alien sense. She is\naware of this alien streak and her loyalties are\ndivided between humanity and the rioting creatures who are, in effect, her offspring. Long\ngone is her despising of the species as we see\nher em pathi sing with and even having a semi-erotic relationship with the Alien Queen. Weaver\nis on top form as Ripley displays touches of\nalien behaviour and resigns herself to battle\nonce again.\nThis personality development is not restricted to Ripley. The director gives us an insight into\nthe aliens' minds as they display emotions and\ndemonstrate intelligence. This is a refreshing\nchange to the treatment the monsters have\nreceived in the past and makes for some memorable scenes as they concoct a plan to escape\nfrom their confines. Jean-Pierre Jeunet also\nspends time on Ripley's human allies. Winona\nRyder is cast as a mercenary on a mission to\nwipe out the aliens and is the subject of an interesting twist towards the climax.\nAlien Resurrection has less action than its\nforerunners but this is no bad thing. It is more of\na suspense thriller than an action film and this\nallows time for some clever predictions of\nfuturistic life from the director. There are also\n19\nplenty of amusing one-liners which were\nnot present in the first three films but\nprovide welcome relief here. All in all, an\nexcellent science fiction film and just what was\nneeded to put the Alien series back on track. O Chris\nHere she goes again.\nDon't miss the chance\nto win tickets to see\nAlien 4 at the\nOdeon Kensington.\nTHE CD FILES\u2122\nTRIVIA GAME\nOn Video W ho is the production\ndesigner on The X Files?\nWhat is Dana Scully's middle name? What is Mulder's FBI\nBadge Number? If you couldn't care less; stop reading this review.\nIf these are the questions that\ndominate your lecture breaks in the\ncommon room then The X Files\nTrivia Game on Video will be at the\ntop of your Christmas list.\nThe idea of this board game is\nsimply to reach the opposite end of\nthe board before your opponents.\nYou move forward by correctly\nanswering questions related to the\nvideo clips of episodes from series\none to three of the cult sci-fi pro-gram me. These questions fall into\nfour categories; Character, Story\nLine, The Unexplained and Behind\nthe Scenes. The category you\nanswer is chosen by rolling a die\nand there are also Action Cards\nwhich are occasionally beneficial\nbut are more likely to move you\nback several spaces. And that's it.\nOnce the novelty of the video\nclips wears off there is little here\nexcept for die-hard fans of the pro-gram me. Questions are split into\neasy and hard categories but even\nthe \"easy\" ones are taxing unless\nyou can remember the finer details\nof episodes which were televised\nyears ago. The game only includes\nthe first three series so to stand a chance of making progress you'll\nneed to have been a fan ever since\nthe pilot episode. However, if you\nare a dedicated follower of Mulder\nand Scully and have equally committed friends then you will doubtless think this is the finest board\ngame ever made. You'll also know\nthat the answers to the posers\nabove are Graeme Murray,\nKatherine and JTT047101111.\nObviously. D Chris\nFor just \u00a322.99 you can\nspend those lonely\nevenings learning\nall about Mulder\nand Scully.\nFORTHCOMING REVIEWS IN FELIX\nThere are some quality films in\nthe pipeline so here's a brief preview of the films you'll be seeing\non these pages soon...\nTomorrow Never Dies\nBrosnan's Bond is back and bigger\nthan ever. The 18th instalment is\nthe most expensive ever made and\nis released in two weeks.\nThe Jackal\nBruce Willis and Richard Gere head\nthe all-star cast of this thriller in\nwhich an assassin attempts to\neliminate a top US official.\nHome Alone 3\nThe first was incomparable, the\nsecond was possibly the best\nsequel ever made.

He represents. Much\nrespect to Felix for ha v in' him in the\nshow. He is one cool cat.\nThe Man: Jivin Gerald\nThe funky follower,\nOf choclate flav a'd choon s. OK, so its good to see a shift\nfrom the domination of generic\nindie in the review section of\nfelix, with the addition of the hiphop section, and Milen's 'inspired'\ncommentary, (1 assumed it was\nsomeone taking the piss), now\nhows about something towards the\nother end of the spectrum.\nConsidering the number of excellent releases in this genre recently,\nthere have been remark abl ly few\nreviews, most of which have been\nbad. At least give the stuff you do\nget, to people who may appreciate\nit and know something about it.\nFor anyone interested, and I know\nthere are people out there, the\nunofficial Rocksoc meets in\nSouthside upper lounge Mondays\n1 pm, and ICRadio has its very own\nmetal/rock show at 9pm every\nMonday.\nYours long winded ly, Steve.\nJivin, we'll pass on your comments to Milen, we're sure he'll\nappreciate them.\nSteve, nice to know you read\nthe reviews but what would be\nthe point of only giving people\nmusic that they love? If every\nreview got 5 stars then there\nwouldn't be much use in comparing albums. Also if you feel you\ncould write better reviews we'd love you to come and write for us!\nCome to the meetings on Fridays\nat 1.30 pm. Laters. Music Eds\nERIC WRITES\nIf you put your head above the\nparapet, one must reasonably\nexpect to get shot at: if not shot.\nTo this end I have generally avoided replying to factual inaccuracies\nin the letters page in Felix over the\nlast year and a half. However, as I was writing in anyway this may be\nan opportune moment to compensate for the interesting spin that Ms\nHarries put upon the OpSoc story\nlast week.\nFirstly, no single society has a God given right to use the Concert\nHall, despite what some may think,\nand it has always been allocated on\na first come, first served basis, with\nno credence given to tradition or\nhistorical precedence. Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool Light Operatic Society, well\naware of the fact that would be\nunable to use the Wolfson Hall this\nyear, asked if they would be able to\nuse the Concert Hall. This request\nwas made about two months in\nadvance of ICU's illustrious and\nnormally well organised operatic\nsociety.\nAll bookings for rooms are\nmade at the Union Reception, and\nwhilst I did indeed sign a letter I twice stated the caveat that my\nsupport was conditional on the\navailability of the Concert Hall\nbeing confirmed.\nWhat 1 find most peculiar about\nthe rant last week, besides the\ninaccuracies and the double standards being requested, was that a solution was found to the problem\nand agreed upon some three\nweeks ago. This maybe due to\nOpSoc not achieving the booking\nthey wanted. However in these\ntimes of expansion and the resultant pressure on facilities, clubs\nand societies will have even more\norganised or embrace the new\ndiversity and, heavens forbid, co-operate. Or possibly Ms Harries\nhas committed too many productions to memory and is now unable\nto differentiate between fact and\nfiction.\nAs for the various bleating\nregarding the alleged block voting\nall 1 can really say is put up or shut\nup. If people realistically think that\nthe medical students are sheep like and vote en masse for a prescribed\ncandidate as laid down by their\nexecutive they are fooling them-selves. Every member of the Union\nis entitled to express his or her\nopinion at the ballot box. If the\nmedics feel that the sabbatical\nelections warrants a, high turnout\nand the remaining South\nKensington students a low one;\nwell then that's democracy. It is,\nafter all, a rather false argument to\nstart w hinging after the event particularly when it's an event that the\nmajority of students felt no desire\nto participate in. Perhaps an analysis of why members feel so disenfranchised from the electoral\nprocess would be slightly more\nconstructive.\nOn a lighter note I would like to\nthank everyone who made my time\nas President so enjoyable and in\nparticular those that have given\nsupport during the last six months\nfor what otherwise may have been\na particularly difficult period for the\nUnion. There are many people 1\ncould single out but I will limit\nmyself to the collective of the\nUnion staff who do a sterling job\nand without whose expertise and\ndedication the Union would be not\nwhat it is today.\nAs always I have no interest in\nepistolary duelling so if, in the\nunlikely event, people wish to\ncomment further 1 would appreciate if they save it for my face: and\nif it happens to be in the bar then\nmine's a Guinness.\nRegards, Eric Allsop\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

Recently,\nas a result of their last album OK\nComputer, they have been unfairly\nbranded as a second-rate Pink\nFloyd or as being dull and plodding\nin their style. Their reaction to the\ncritics has been extremely nonchalant and they have carried on doing\nwhatever they wanted to do and\nhowever they wanted to do it. OK\nComputer is full of neat sound\neffects and mood-creating washes\nof noise that enhance all of the\ntracks. Therefore the test of their\nability would always be whether or\nnot they could reproduce their\nsound live.\nLights, smoke and some\nstrange dance tracks. People were\nsmoking cigarettes next to me and\nJarvis Cocker was sitting in the\ngallery just above the mosh pit\nwaving like royalty when Airbag\ncrashed down onto the crowd.\nLike a person in a car crash that's just been whiplash ed, this song\nturned everyone's head to the\nstage. Thorn Yorke acknowledged\nthe audience only briefly before\nlaunching into the excellently\nschizophrenic Karma Police with its\nhaunting piano stomping mercilessly over the slightly non-sens ical lyrics. Jonny Greenwood never\nremained stationary throughout\nthe whole two hours that they\nplayed. He moved between the\npiano, guitar and various other\ninstruments that surrounded him\nwith alarming talent and style. This\nalso highlighted the fact that every\nsingle nuance of the albums was\nplayed. From the eerie tinkling at\nthe beginning of Lucky to the various bits and pieces that adorn\nParanoid Android, all of the effects\nwere played live. This left no holes\nin the sound which plagues so\nmany bands who insist on recording tracks with a thousand over-dubs.\nThere was a slight problem\nwith the gig, though. It had nothing\nat all to do with the band, but\nrather the venue. Arenas really sap\na band's performance - the atmosphere inside them is always so\nremote that you feel distant from\nthe band. Admitedly, the light\nshow and the spectacle might have\nbeen better than in a smaller\nvenue, but the closeness that a member of the audience would\nfeel to the music at one of these\nwas sadly missing. Something\nseemed really cold about the\nwhole thing. This manifested itself\nquite blatantly as the very mosh-worthy chorus to My Iron Lung\nscreamed out from the stage,\nprompting a very confused reaction from the massive crowd.\nSome wanted to mosh whilst the\nrest just didn't want to move at all.\nHalf of the crowd had a vibe, the\nothers just didn't seem to realise\nwhat was going on. This is a real\nshame because Radiohead played\nan absolutely spotless set. There\nwas everything there to make a good gig but it was like a souffl e someone must have opened the\noven door to have a look at how\neverything was going and it just\ndeflated.\nAll of this complaining still does\nnot detract from one thing,\nthough. Radiohead are a fantastic\nband and even though the venue\ndid not suit them, 1 wholeheartedly recommend seeing them. USAIok\nLAB REPORT\nExcision No Stars\nL ab Report are aptly named as\neveryone knows here at IC\nthat lab reports are the most\ndull, boring, and inanely monotonous things in the world.\nPigeon holing Excision is hard\nsince, in my vast musical experience,1 have never heard anything\nlike it before. In fact the album\ndoes beg the question is this really\nmusic at all or just a random concoction of clock ticks, match-st rik ing noises, chimes, interference,\ndoor creaks, gunfire and dod gy beeping sounds? There also seems\nto be considerable portions of\nmany tracks dedicated to utter\nsilence. Strange, very strange\nindeed. What seems even stranger\nis that there appears to be no\ndrum track or rhythm used at all.\nHmmmm.\nThe tracks overall have an\neerie, distant film soundtrack feel\nto them. The first track, In The\nBeginning consists of a few discordant notes, weird wailing sounds\nand a deep drone that goes on and\non. Christ Playing With Tops does\nliterally sound like 'Christ' is playing with one of those Da-da toy\ncars, a whisk and, true to the title,\nsome milk bottle tops. Really it\ndoes. The last track, Geeks Choose\nTo Work In The Carnival, is the\nbest, if that word can be used to\ndescribe any of Lab Reports music.\nLab Report should never have\nbeen signed or allowed to make\nthis sort of avant-garde, ex peri mental, classical crap. I would prefer to listen to 62 minutes of\nsomeone farting down adige red oo than ever disgrace my hi-fi by\nputting this Lab Report in it again.\nThis is one for playing Frisbee with.\nC3 Ramzi\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT 28 November 1997\nFootie Fourths Four Ever\nCFC III v ICFC IV ICFC IV v Golds IV ICFC V v Holloway VI ICWAFC v RFH\nhis was no fluke; ask any player\n'ram the Thirds who deserved to\nwin and albeit through gritted\nteeth, they would have to say the\nmighty IC Fourths.\nAfter having scouted the thirds\nand discovered their strengths and\nweaknesses, Captain Quick\nemployed the revolutionary 4-4-2\nformation thus preventing their\nwing-backs from operating, leaving\nthem with no creative ideas. This\nhowever wasn'ta game for forma-t ions, it was about passion and\nspirit, about who wanted the victory more. The defence (Paul, Andy,\nElliot, David) didn't put a foot\nwrong all game, the midfield\n(Ryan, Phaedon, Bola, Serge) and\nDarren and Richard up front were\nall magnificent. However, as\nalways special credit should be\ngiven to the goal scorer, Darren,\nbagging a quality brace, showing\nthe third's defenders what muppets they really are. And also the\ncentral midfield duo of Phaedon\nand Bola totally dominated the\nmiddle of the park, preventing the\nThirds from attacking and still creating chances for the strikers.\nICFC III 1 - 2 ICFC IV\nWell, what can we say? The game\ntoday was the crowning point of\nour BUSA campaign so far. Our\njungle skills flowered under the-grim sky as our first BUSA win\nguaranteed us entry into the BUSA\nknock-out shield. Specifically, the\ntouch of the elephant/last a don was not in our ranks today. Ryan,\nBola, Dazzla, Bertie and Elliot had\nall been blessed with the skill of\nthe racoon, and our ever-solid\ndefence with the consistency of a yak. The first goal was born - a vivid, joyful combination terminated with a clinical finish.\nThe stamina of the mountain\nbilly-goat then set well in, replaced\nat times with the stealth of the\nleopard and the low cunning of the\nfox. Our team surged forward like\na herd of buffalo and over-came\nthe Goldsmiths scum. And then\nthe second goal was created...\nFrom there we held fast like a baboon colony and waited patiently for the final whistle, with\nunshakable confidence. For the\nrecord, both the goals were scored\nby Elliot and thus the spirit of the\nmongoose lives on.\nICAFC IV 2 0 Goldsmiths IV\nWithout doubt our worst performance of the season so far We\nstarted the game in confident\nmood, keeping possession and\nputting pressure on Holloway early\non. A sequence of corners very\nnearly saw IC take the lead, with a beautiful turn and shot by Dmitris\nbringing out a fine save from the\nopposition keeper. Andy C was\nunlucky not to score after being put\nthrough on goal on three separate\noccasions as IC kept up the pace.\nUnfortunately those early misses\nwere soon to be regretted as\nHolloway won a corner and put in a testing cross, which was headed in\nby one of our own players.\nA rethink during half time then\nsaw new boy Bic come on in midfield Again we started brightly with\nKublai forcing a good save with a well directed header at goal. But an\ninability to keep the ball for any\nlength of time soon led to Holloway\nscoring again.\n1C tried to raise the tempo, and\nDan's fluke 40 yard s creamer through the midfield, defence, and\nkeeper legs gave us hope with fifteen\nminutes to go. But it wasn't to be.\nICAFC VI2 Holloway VI\nRapture for Rugby\nIC Iv St George I IC II v St George II ICIII v St Mary'sI Possibly the best performance of\nthe season saw the IC dragon slay\nSt George! The opening try began\nunder our own posts and went the\nfull 101 metres - \"le Telfor\" was\nshowing off! After \"Hog's breath's\" interception and fine\nbreak, Ali \"Taff\" Jefferies showed\nhis immaculate kicking skills by hitting the post with the conversion,\nafter champagne rugby (England,\nare you watching?) mainly by the\n\"miners\", the ball swept smoothly\nfrom hand to hand with \"Buffy\"\nButtenshaw putting \"Mongol\"\nLloyd away for a well worked try.\nYep, Ali missed the conversion.\nLionel scored the decisive try. The\nback row were more rampant than\nherpes and Dan \"I 'll kick you and\nrun away\" Higasi won man of the\nmatch for infecting them more\nthan the others.\nICRFC I175 St George'sI The purple helmets still pissed\nand something over from the night\nbefore descended on St George's with a wrath of great vengeance\nthen delivered them from their\ngreat pain and suffering.\nSpuw Tanoy having chun de red before the game twice decided to\nbe a back this week and actually\nmanaged to receive 'some' ball\nfrom El Capitan (crash fly-half) to\nrun some n if tey little waddles of\nhis fat arse!\nMatt Faggoty managed to\nscore a try (Surprise) which was\ncommendable.\nDim Slim Tim (sounds like a Chinese dish?) scored a try after\nmany wain attempts to get the ball\nto him.\nIt was scrappy but we wanted\nit and the win was well deserved.\nICURFC II 15 - 0 St George's II\nThis game was fought mainly up\nfront with both sets of fat boys\ntrying to gain the upper gut. We\nhad the weight, but they had the\nspeed and height. They scored\ntwo quick tries before we woke\nup and joined the fray. A superb\nsolo try from James 'Quicksilver'\nWelsh was converted by Chris\n'Golden Boot' Dickenson.\nDespite tactics re men is cent of\nthe All-Blacks even the defensive\nefforts of Tom 'Offside' Hovard\ncould not keep the Medics out,\nafter losing our glorious captain\nJulian 'Logic' Harrison RIP.\nIn the second half, having\nthen lost Kolone 'What half is it'\nYung, we were down to fourteen\nmen.\nWe played some of the best\nrugby of our season but the ref\nwas aba xxxx d. ICRFC III 7 - 31 St Mary's III\nIt was quickly evident that the\nRoyal Free were of a lower class to\nus, so it was only a matter of time\nuntil we scored. A rather impressive individual effort by Brindley\nsaw our first notch on the goal\npost. This was soon followed by a superb strike from Taffy, who at\nlast realised which team she was\nsupposed to score for.\nThe first goal in the second half\nfollowed a scramble in the box and\nthen a simple chip into the top\ncorner. Next was a more classy\neffort - Freud played a beautiful\ncross in from the right which was\nmet with precision by Scrubber.\nBrindley then completed her\nBrace with a penalty after one of\nthe Free defenders blatantly handled the ball in the box, lest she\nshould spoil her make-up by heading the ball.

Smash mouth\nsound like a cross between NoFX\nand the Beach Boys without the\nmusical abilities of the latter or\neven the taste of the former, (if you\nknow what I mean). They manage\nto combine dire, teenage vocals\nwith tasteless percussion and a guitar tone that leaves you screaming with frustration. Tracks switch\nfrom feeble, lifeless reggae to fast\npunk several times within a single\nsong, all of which are cramped full\nof the worst, most obvious riffs\nthat you have ever heard, (the sort\nof stuff you learn to play on the\nguitar as a spotty adolescent).\nThe only thing that they can be\ncredited for I guess, is that they\ndon't take themselves seriously,\nbut then again, does anyone? The\ngimmicky humour of the sudden\nSka-like changes from calm to\nSmash Mouth? manic get on your nerves after\nLooks like it about ten minutes and leave you\nwondering why they bothered. I'm afraid that their attempts at satire\nand self-mockery fail miserably\ndespite the promising sound of\nsome of the song titles. Beer\nGoggles, The Fonz and Padrino. if\nit's humour they want, they could\nlearn a great deal from the greats\nlike Frank Zappa and Bonzo Dog.\nBut not everything I have to say\nabout them is that negative. I am\nashamed to confess that there is\none track on the album which I like\nand another one with an inch of\ntaste. It's no coincidence however\nthat the you'll have heard of\nWalkin' on the sun, the track that\nappears to have boosted the\nband's career, (something had to).\nPerhaps by luck, they have managed to capture a highly catchy\ntune with a riff that will stay in your\nhead for weeks to come. (They\neven manage to get a smooth tone\non the guitar which is complemented nicely with a high pitched hammond when the chorus comes in).\nThe other track which I was talking\nabout was Push; the song launches\nheadlong into an instrumental intro\nwith hard, pounding drums followed closely with a fast wah-wah\ndroned guitar. Unfortunately the\ntrack goes downhill from here, salvaged momentarily by a nifty little\nlead break in the middle, which\nseems to have influences in heavier\nbands like Rage Against the\nMachine.\nBut don't let me deter you.\nThere is a fair bit of swearing\nthroughout the album, with an\n'explicit content' sticker on the\nfront, so they must be pretty cool!\nTake my advice, buy the single if\nyou have to because you'll be\nannoyed if you buy the whole\nalbum. Don't say 1 didn't warn you!\nEH Marc\nM PEOPLE CDs\nTO BE HAD!!\nA limited edition five track CD is\non offer, entitled By Personal\nInvitation Only and is not available in any record shop.\nQuestion: Which bitter is the\ncream of Manchester?\nYou can drop your entries in to\nthe Felix office, located in the\nleft hand corner of the Union\nBuilding.\nSINGLES\nMeredith Brooks - I Need\nEssentially a shopping list set to music.\nReasonable girl ie attitude and shout y chorus.\nNot as good as her last single Bitch which is\nremixed by Todd Terry on the B sides.\nVarious - Perfect Day\nEveryone's heard it, its just the same as on TV\nbut with all male and all female versions. It does\ntell you who everyone is, though they should\nhave left out Gabrielle and the opera singers.\nLower - Life's Too Slow\nBoring, whiny rubbish about which nothing constructive can really be said.\nBreaker - Stereotype\nRather daft, angst y lyrics sung by an Alanis\nMorrissette-et te. The second track, sinister minister is somewhat Breeders-esque. The chorus\nof Sinister Minister fails to be as for boding as it\nwas meant to be.

    "content": "NEW COLUMN MUSIC INTERVIEW FEATURE\nIs your future in\nthe stars?\nGemini moves\nhouse\nWhat's going on\nin your head?\nP raed Street Unsafe BY JITEN PATEL\nIt has emerged that Praed Street,\nthe road that passes between St\nMary's Medical School and\nWilson House hall of residence,\nhas recently been highlighted as a crime black spot. A rape that was reported in last\nweek's Felix occurred during the\nsummer on 2 July when a young\nAsian student, with no connection\nto the medical school, was blindfolded and held at knife point by\none man whilst another went to\npick up a car. The girl was then driven to a house and repeatedly\nattacked during the night, before\nbeing dumped near Wembley\nConference Centre the following\nmorning.\nThe incident was first brought\nto the attention of the students\nwhen a relative of the St Mary's Accommodation Officer, Natasha\nNewton, saw the incident reported\non BBC's 'Crimewatch' on Tuesday\n11 November. The medical school\nwas not informed of the incident\napparently because police thought\nthat it was not necessary that people should be notified of the pro b lem.\nOliver Warren, St Mary's Welfare Representative, told Felix\nthat he \"personally went into every\nlecture and warned the students of\nthe need to be alert.\" He also said\nthat over 300 rape alarms had been\nhanded out to male and fem le students who wanted them, and that\nnotices had been posted around\nthe school.\nAlthough this was an isolated\nincident, the safety of the area\naround Praed Street has been deteriorating for some time. Ms\nNewton spoke of an occasion\nwhen she \"had five offers for a good night, mistaking me for a working girl\" in the space of 5-6\nminutes. Another reported incident\ninvolved a female student being\nfollowed back to St Mary's from\nSafeways supermarket.\nThe current security measures\naround Wilson House are \"inadequate\" according to Mr Warren,\nwho said that the security lodge is\nclosed after 1 1 pm and that there is\nno on-site security. He added that\ncameras have been installed around the area but that the relay\nnetwork has not yet been set up, so\nthat they only record onto video-tape.\nAccording to Keith Reynolds,\nImperial College's Head of\nSecurity, there are plans to \"have\nthe patrol at St Mary's extended to\nWilson House,\" but that he had to\nensure that he doesn't \"stretch\nresources to far\". Other plans\nunder consideration are to introduce 'group walking' at set times,\nor to run a minibus service similar\nto that at the South Kensington\ncampus.\nMs Newton added that \"the\nmain problem is that students think\nof Praed Street as an extension to\nthe campus\", and cautioned students \"to be aware of the people\naround them.\"\nTuition Fees: Placards in the Park\nBY IVAN CHAN\nAnother major demonstration\nwas held in Hyde Park on\nWednesday 26 November to\nprotest against the imposition of\ntuition fees. Although it was\nthought only 2,000 students\nwould attend, an estimated\n10,000 turnout reflected the\nanger of students towards one of\nbiggest changes to the British\nuniversity education system.\nThis is the second such event\nto take place in London during the\nlast month. The demonstration\nbegan at noon outside the\nUniversity of London Union in\nMalet Street. The student protesters then marched into Hyde Park\nnear Speakers' Corner at Marble\nArch.\nThe demonstration was organised by the Campaign for Free\nEducation (CFE). According to one\nof their press officers attending the\nevent, the demonstration marked\nthe beginning of a series of\nFor the second time this month Hyde Park hosted thousands of students\ndemonstrating against paying tuition fees.

The\nofficial insisted that the demonstration was 'fantastic' and added\nthat it was \"one of the biggest for\nthe past five or six years.\" He went\non to say that around 60% of\nLabour MPs are in favour of free\neducation. CFE marshall s along\nwith police officers at the scene,\nwere happy with the behaviour of\nthe students, suggesting that the\nrally had been 'peaceful'.\nThe\nStudents'\nNewspaper\nat Imperial\nCollege\nIssue110028 November1997 "

    "content": "28 November 1997 MUSIC 13\nA Collection of 10 Acid House Anthems * * * *\nALBUMS\nACID BRASS\nWe 've all had them. Those\npub ideas. You have an\ninteresting concept that\nyou share with a few friends that\nsoon escalates into drunken stu-pid it y. We all say how great it would\nbe if this idea could really happen,\nknowing full well that it never will.\nThis is one of the few that have actually come into fruition: 'to get a traditional brass band to play a selection of Acid House anthems.'\nThe concept was, er, concept ed during the summer of last year, by\ncult artist Jeremy Deller. He convinced the Williams Fairey Brass\nBand ('the world's leading brass\nband' - from Stockport) that his\nidea was a good one and a Liverpool\nconcert was soon arranged. The\nconcert (held last March) attracted\nmass interest, most notably from Bill\nDrummond of ex-KLF fame, who\nwas intrigued by the prospect of\nhearing a brass rendition of his\nhouse anthem What Time Is Love?\nOn seeing the concert, he was\nblown away and, whilst watching\nthe performance of his song,\nphoned fellow ex-KLF member\nJimmy Cauty to let him listen. It\nfired Drummond's imagination so\nmuch that he went to meet the\nband later and talked about a musical collaboration that would bring\nthe KLF out of their 5-year retire-ment.\nYou can probably guess the rest:\nThe KLF reformed (as 2K) this September for their '23 minute spec-t acul ar' where they performed a revamped version of What Time Is\nLove? called Fuck The Millennium.\nJoining them in their performance\nwere the brass band and Deller. So\nyou could say that this album is the\nbrainchild behind the most infamous\nmusical performance in history. Or\nyou could say it is a load of boring\nNorthern horn players trying desperately to look cool. I'd go for the\nfirst - listening to this album is just\nso enjoyable. It's even possible to\ndance to, especially such uplifting\nanthems as 808 State's Pacific 202\nand Can U Dance? by DJ Fast Eddie.\nBut the standout track has to be The\nKLF's What Time Is Love? with its\ntrombone Mu-Mu's and strangely\npsychedelic Fast-Show style jazz\nsolo.\nThere are a few occasions during these 10 tracks where the songs\nresemble second rate James Bond\nthemes (1 think Sheryl Crow knows\nwhat I mean). Even so, this album\nis the most innovative, weird and\nhilarious to be released this year. So\nwhatever you do, listen to the songs\non this album, preferably when in an\naltered state of mind. They are crazy\nsongs but they'll make you shine.\nCI Ed\nROBERT MILES\n23 am * * *\nAfter his first foray into the\nBritish music scene with\nChildren, anything Robert\nMiles does from now on is going to\nhave to be something special to get\nnoticed. And I must say, 'hats off\nto our Bob', because this really is a pretty good attempt.\nIf drawing parallels to night-clubs, this is definitely more of an\nEquinox than a Ministry, but as\nEquinox claims to be the biggest\nclub in the world, this really can't be\na bad thing, however, I would like to\npoint out that size isn't everything.\nIn-depth track analysis really isn't worth going into because this is\npretty much all along the same lines\nas Children when it comes down to\nthe musical composition of each\npiece. A very out of character introduction gets 23 am underway, but\nsoon you get what you'd expect,\ndecent if somewhat commercial\ndance music and maybe the surprise\nof some well sung lyrics. But in all\ntruth, not many genuine club\nanthems have or will originate from\na man who will no doubt be seen in\ncoming weeks on Top of the Pops\nas a lonely on stage figure with his\nPC and keyboard tapping away to his\nscreaming teenage fans.\nThere is quite a European flavour\nto 23 am, and occasionally it\ndescends into a mellow state. This\nvariety does lend itself to being able\nto be played from start to finish and\nbeing appreciated more as a per-son's own expression than many\nother dance albums. Hints of Beverley Hills Cop's Axel F, and maybe\neven a bit of Olive are evident, and\nthey complement the overall sound\nwell.\nThis isn't going to appeal to\nwell-seasoned, single-minded club-be rs, with their definite ideas on\nhow dance music should be, but\nthen they don't need warning, as the\nname Robert Miles will alert them\nstraight away. However, if your\ntastes are varied, and the depressing guitar scene is getting a bit much,\nthis comes recommended.\nEH Derek\nTHA BOMB!\nHey, what up to all the fly people, what's goin'\non, hope everything fine. First up I got a couple of things to promote; number one is the\nInternational Tamil Society's annual cultural\nshow. On show will be a variety of entertain-ment, from ancient Tamil art forms up to a modern dance, the show is on tonight\n(28/11/97) at the Great Hall in Sherfield\nBuilding. Next up is an event that I haven't been asked to write about but I'm gonna anyway - The ACS Nubian Jam. Its on the Friday\n5th December at Grays Inn (nearest tube\nChancery Lane) and will be running from\n10pm to 5am, for a cheap (from \u00a34) bang in' night out, be there.\nThere ani't really much goin' on in the\nworld of R&B and hip hop, so this week y 'all\ngot a run down of the killer LPs and singles at\nthe moment.\nTHA BOMB! - CURRENT TOP TEN KILLERS\n1. 'Nothin But the Party' - TruceReviewed last week this party tune is wicked,\nits bad and British and number one.\n2. 'When Disaster Strikes' - Busta Rhymes\n- Hip Hop album of the year and there ani't no\ndoubt about it. Its packed full of star names\nand star tracks, if you need confirmation just\ncheck ' Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can\nSee', 'Dangerous' or the current smash 'One'\nfeaturing Erykah Badu.\n3. 'You Make Me Wanna' - Usher - This is\nall that and more, number one in US (RnB\ncharts) for weeks and still goin' strong. Phat\npiece of R&B, this is a must have.\n4. 'Harlem World' - Mase - Bad boy bin\nblow in' up the whole universe, now its Mases'\nturn to cut an album and this doesn'tdi sap point. Puffy does his usually shit on pro duc tion, and the huge number of guests' do their\npart. The album is pretty much feel good\nmusic, as previewed by the first single off it\n'Feel So Good'.\n5. 'Phenomenon' - LL Cool j The old man\nof hip hop is back with this, the title track of\nhis much hyped album, for me the album ani't all that, but this single is definitely a must\nhave.\n6. 'FirmBiz' - The Firm - Taken from the\nalbum 'The Firm', made up of Foxy, Nas,\nNature & AZ and with production from Dr\nDre, add to this Dawn (from En Vogue) on\nchorus duty and you got another killer.\n7. 'My Dream' - Yvette Michelle - This LP\nhas been out for an age but sales have not\nreally taken off, which is a shame because\nthis is full of phat head nod R&B. After being\nshowcased on the Flexx mix tapes this young\nlady has not looked back and now is certainly\nstaking a claim to Mary's crown.\n8. 'Sexy Cinderella' - Lyden David HallPhat Nu Soul on a British tip, this talented\nyoung man has made a single that is smooth\nand has the sign of quality all over it.\n9. 'Mourn U Till 1 join' - Naught By Nature\n- The party boys of hip hop do their thang on\nthis long awaited tribute to Tupac\n10. 'London' - D'l nfl en ce This is the third\nset from D'i nfl en ce is certain the best yet,\nevery track is an A class gem. Why this is not\nnumber one in the album charts is beyond\nme. This is pure gold soul, acquire.\nMuch Love To ALL. Milen\n\n"

    "content": "16 MUSIC 28 November 1997\nCLUBSCENE - COMPILATIONS\nm ANIMALS ON WHEELS\nDesigns & Mistakes (Ninja Tunes) * * * *\nT hey say there a fine line\nbetween genius and mad-ness, this album is on that\nline. Animals on Wheels has been\ncreated by Andy Coleman. He\ntakes us on a journey out of the\nordinary, to a world where everything is weird.\nTrack 1 sets things off in a down beat style then tearing\na mens come in raising the tempo\nto D&B speed then you're up and\ndown for the rest of the track, a bit\nof a insight into how the rest of the\nalbum proceeds. Next is a great\nD&B track on an intelligent tip with\nnice crisp beats cut in and out over\nstrong atmospheric als. The pace\nslows down over the next few\ntracks, much more minimal with\nthe odd stabbings of beats here\nand there. Some are soft, others\nare harsh and hard. Then the pace\nis lifted again with Shoddy Kicks,\nagain in an experimental D&B style.\nThe last few tracks comprise of\nsome beautiful down beat numbers\nand superb D&B. This album was\ncreated, not made, it fits together\nperfectly. Just sit back, spark up a fat one and be taken on a journey\nto the outer realms in a way that\nonly Animals on Wheels can take\nyou. This is as underground as it\ngets, not one for the faint hearted.\nA lot of people just won't understand this album. If you're looking\nfor something different, a glance\ninto the future, then this is worth a listen. I'm sure that some of these\nexperimental ideas will be developed and used in more main\nstream D&B, if there is such a thing. This is also a useful collection of tunes to have on vinyl, with\nquality D&B tracks and some nice\nand weird down tempo numbers\nsuitable for just chilling to.\nIf this is your type of music or\nyou just want to find out what I'm going on about, check out\nColdcut's end of tour pre-Christmas party. 4th Dec at 333\nOld Street, a night not to be\nmissed with some of the best\nscratch DJ talent in the world. The\nthings these guys do, makes the\nlikes of your house 'n' jungle DJs\nlook like they haven't even learnt to\nmix. See club listings. 1\n7\n1 cl\nIP\nPete Tong\nEssential Selection * *\nI didn't expect much from this\nCD as I have never respected\nPete Tong much as a mixer, but\nreputedly he gets up to \u00a31,500 a set. So he must be doing something right. You'd expect to be\ntaken on a musical journey, with\noutstanding mixing and a visionary\nselection of tunes. And what do we\nget? Well none of the above.\nCD01 starts off with the funky\nGritter Shaker by David Homes,\nthen the essential selection goes\nall wrong with Deep Dish's Stranded. This tune just doesn't work, starting things off on the\nwrong foot. There's also a lot of\nquality tracks on this CD like\nIndustry Standard Vol. 1 and Popper\nPresents Aura's Every Little Time.\nBut it's the occasional chart toppers that are dropped in now and\nthen that kill any sort of vibe.\nCD02 sets off with DJ Dado's, Back For Me a fat bouncy tune,\nthen things are running along nice-ly, when Nain & Kane's Beachball\ncomes in. I 've seen this tune clear\ndance floors, it's too laid back 'n' dreamy, no punch to it. Then a few\ntracks later, in comes Dario G's Sunchyme. 1 really don't like this\ntune, it bores me with the way it\njust plods along. Things get harder\ntowards the end with the likes of Y Traxx and Mysteryland. Then totally out of the blue Roni Size's Hero's is dropped in. Yes, D&B style,\nprobably the most commercial\nD&B track around at the moment.\nA quality tune, but very commercial\nand it seems to me that Pete\nTong's jumping on the band\nwagon, putting a token D&B track\non the end. Oh, what an essential\nselection he's chosen, NOT. The\nsame goes for the last track on this\ncompilation, Black Gold.\nOverall, 1 wouldn't spend hard\nearned cash on this compilation as\nthere are so many better ones\naround. This compilation is OK if\nyou want tunes you know from the\nradio, but you aren't really into the\nscene. If you're looking for quality\nmixing, a bit of effort going into\nworking and cutting the tunes, and\nwith each tune following on from\nthe previous one, which is the\nwhole point of DJing, in my humble\nopinion, then this CD sadly falls\nvery short of the mark. 1\n7\n1 cl JP\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nDRUM' N' BASS USE GA \u2022 AGE Hidden Agenda - Sons / 12'\nSeconds\n(Creative Source 016)\nRelease: Dec.\nThis is not as strong as the previous release from Creative Source,\nit's in the same musical rolling style\nwithout such strong beats, nice to\njust sit back and listen to. 12'\nSeconds is the stronger of the two\ntracks and showing D&B is an art-form with well structured beats,\nstrong atmospheric als and a slightly eerie feel. Again Creative Source\nare keeping D&B moving forward\nwith their innovative styles of deep\nrolling steppers, Intelligent D&B at\nit's best.\nTo check the Creative Source massive live & direct, with their trend\nsetting styles of D&B get yourselves down their new club night at\nThe Velvet Rooms starting 26th Nov. and evey Wednesday then\non.\nTeckniq - One Style/911 * * * *\n(Formation Rec.)\nRelease: Dec.\nThis the first release for a while for\nTeckniq, and they haven't lost\ntheir touch. One Style is on a more\njump-up tip with echoing beats, a rhythm setting bass drum and with\na wicked b line; this is certain to be\nbig in the clubs. 911 has a darker\nmore experimental feel to it, keeping with Formations way of not\nbeing afraid to try something new\n'n' different. So two quite different\nand quite excellent tracks.\nFormation still going strong.\nAmon Tobin - Piranha Breaks\n(Ninja Tunes)\nRelease.Out Now\nThis is as experimental as D&B gets, Amon Tobin mixes his unique\nblend of Latin Samba vibe & breaks\nwith crazy amen driven beats, too\nheavy on the samba beats for me.\nFast Eddie the 2nd track, was my\nfavourite & more of an out 'n' out\nD&B No. Heavy use of amen\nbreaks, fast & hectic with deep\nbase tones. If your looking for\nsomething on the Eclectic tip, the\nouter limits of the D&B spectrum\nthis is well worth checking.\nDJ Supreme vs Rhythm MastersEnter The Scene * * *\n(Distinctive) Release: Nov\nIf you haven't heard this one yet,\nyou must have been locked in a cupboard or something for the last\n6 months. With the distinct'ive\nvocal's of DJ Supreme,\ntime stretches, scratching and\nbuilding beats it's been a big hit in\nthe clubs and on the radio over the\nsummer. Finally getting released, 1\nfeel a little to late as it now sounds\nold and dated due to it being\nCained for to long before it's release. This has also given it that\ncommercial feel, not one for the\ndie-hard.\nSpinning Atoms 3 - The Enhanced\nVelocity EP * * * * (Prolekult\nRec.) Release: 8th Dec.\nThis can only be described as\nfalling somewhere between banging hard house & techno. Fast\nbouncy bass drum, echoing beats\nand pleasant dreamy breaks. All 4\ntracks (2 mixes of Bubble Memory\nto choose from) are rocking. It you\nlike it hard, fast & hectic this is for\nyou.\nUnderground Vibe - Free Style\nOrchestra * * * (Sweat Rec.)\nRelease: Dec.\nTrack Al. Til da Break starts off\nwith a funky garage thing going on,\nthen in comes a dreadful\nSaxophone sample total killing the\ntune. If it weren't for that Sax it\nwould be a good track. Lost the\nplot on that one. But luckily there's SSO Groove Dub mix that saves\nthe day with a different use of similar sounds and a grinding b line it\nworks out nice.\nRodd-Y Ler - The Art Work EP\n* + + (Blue Banana Rec.)\nRelease: 8th Dec.\nAll three tracks on this one are in\nthat banging House style. The\nstrongest of these is the A side\n(funny that). Starts off with a flute\nthat could be out of Arabian nights\nor something then it gets down to\nbusiness with bass drum taking\ncontrol and a bouncy b line. This\none keeps building nicely into a pleasantly hard track. Well worth a listen.\nIP\n\n"

    "content": "28 November 1997 ARTS\nIN THE PLAYHOUSES\nTHE POPULAR MECHANICALS\nUnicorn Arts Theatre\n\u00bb m we're new to London and\n\\ i\\/ it's a big city with many\nV V theatres. We got lost.\nSo. we're riot quite sure what\nhappens in the first half hour of\nPopular Mechanicals. To be honest,\nwe were quire glad of our mistake\nbecause at this point the comedy\nwas a little strained: Reminiscent\nperhaps of an over-done school\nassembly with at least five minutes\nof bottom jokes. However, we\ncould see that r he cast, comprising\nof: Lisa Kelly. Dean Lennox Kelly,\nCal McCrystal, Keith Robinson.\nDevon Scott and Simon Walter,\nwere comfortable with their parts\nand the overall effect of the costumes and the scenery was first-class.\nBased on A Midsummer\nNighr's Dream, Popular\nMechanicals maintains the themes\nof madness, enchantment and\nimagination but concentrates on\nthe ridiculous Mechanicals and, as\nRebecca Wolman\nAngels and demons is an\nintriguing play that presents\nan intricate account of the\nbattle between good and evil within the human soul through humorous and uplifting tales.\nThe audience is first introduced\nto the Shekhinah, the Princess of\nLight who once angers the King so\ngreatly that his anger causes her to\ndisappear in flash of light. Years\nlater, the King, unable to locate the\nPrincess calls on all the Princes of\nthe world to search for his da ugh ter, promising that he would give\nhis daughter's hand in marriage. It\nis not until much later in the play\nthat the story of the lost Princess is\nrevived and in fact this opening tale\nserves as an awkward finale to the\nplay. The key to understanding the\nidea of the Shekhinah lies in the\nrealisation that the King represents\nGod and the Princess of Light symbolises God's presence in the\nworld.\nBut with light comes darkness\nand in the second scene Lilith is\npresented through a profound and\nthought provoking interpretation of\nGenesis; It would appear that in the\ngarden of Eden, God created two\nwomen. The playwright describes\nthe first woman as Lilith, the name\ndirector Geoffrey Rush (that blok e; ri'tt\":;:;\n-. '.:,;ft tSi^ Ml-':.\".CT.'iS' ^ -ft; '%b(H: t. admirable if misguided aspirations\nto perform beyond their true cap a In real life however, the cast\nwere incredibly perceptive, with a wide array of facial expressions\nThe lively start to the second\nhalf began to change our opinion\nof the play. From here, the performance broke up into a series of\nsketches, linked by r he original\ntheme. Dean Lennox Kelly. In his\nrole of 'Snug the Joiner' kicked it\noff with a satirical stand-up show\nincluding his impression of Sir\nWalter Riiey in Al Paccino\nstyle...\"Art thou talking to me?\" And\nhere's a good one to tell you:\nfriends \"What do Simon the\npie man and Alfred the Great have\nin common? The!' Maybe you\nhad to be there?\nThe highlight of the evening\nwas a puppet dance routine with\ngiven to her by Jewish legend\n(Midrash). Created equal to Adam\nshe refused to \"lie below\" him and\ntheir relationship did not last long\nas neither listened to the other. In\nanger and frustration, Lilith pronounced the secret ineffable name\nof God and disappeared into the air\nbecoming a vengeful demon and\nalluring se duc tress, equal of Adam.\nThe play proceeds as a compilation of tales told by two actors\nand two multi-instrumented musicians. This small cast takes the\naudience on an enchanting journey\nthrough a wealth of legends and\ntales that explore the angels and\ndemons that influence our moral\ndecisions. The tale of Azazel, an\nangel who betrays God by attempting to marry a beautiful Princess is\na key tale to which other tales are\nrelated. Azazel is clearly meant to\nsymbolise the devil and like Lilith is\none of the omnipresent demons\nthat we must contend with.\nThis play, though fragmented at\ntimes, manages to em bro ida diverse range of cultural and biblical tales. The tale of the Princess of\nlight in the prologue is an adaptation of a13 th Century Spanish tale\nand other tales in the play stem\nfrom Moroccan and Tunisian oral\nrubber Tudor chickens. On sticks.\nAlthough the play vaguely stuck\nto the storyline of the original\nShakespeare. It now began to\nexplore \"classic\" theatre and its\nassociated quirks. The director's experience of re-created\nElizabethan theatre was apparent in\nthe clownish jigs and ditties. At the\nsame time the props became more\nbizarre - watch out lor the irons I and modern language can be a little confusing. The script is also\nunnecessarily coarse in places so\ndon't take your gran. We would\ndefinitely recommend the second\nhall to all you budding artistes.

Hanging rope ladders\nare used to great effect and the\ntwo actors Simon Thorp and Emma\nCater are very gymnastic in their\nacting and play multiple roles very\neffectively which makes the play\nboth dramatic and dynamic. The\ndrama is further strengthened by\ntwo excellent instrumentalists\nwhose music is very well synchro-n is ed with the changing moods as\nthe tales oscillate between good\nand evil, light and dark, angels and\ndemons.\nOverall this is a very interesting,\nhumorous and thought provoking\nplay but we were both disappointed by the ending which we felt was\nuninspiring.\nCachao Kiuna &.

I could\nsay that the photographs and the video screens\nportray the dissatisfaction with\nsociety, the nihilistic feeling so\ndominant in our pre-millennium,\nangst-ridden culture. I could\nalso say that the sensitive juxtaposition of the old visual medium of photography.with the relative novelty of the video nation\nexemplifies the abandonment of\nstaid traditions, and the\nembrace of a newer, more radical approach to art. However,\nthis is Felix, not iD magazine, so\nI won't.I 'll say what I think. I thought that this was awful, real-ly, really bad. At the risk of\nrepeating my editor's article on\ncontemporary art, I would like to\nsay how disillusioned and disgusted I am by the state of art in\nBritain. Nowadays, you only\nhave to state that you're an\nartist, and everything you do is\nautomatically regarded as valid\nart. If I'd been to art college, collected a degree and become an\nartist, 1 could place 22 baked\nbean cans on a brick, and call it\n\"nosTalgia\", and maybe I'd win\nthe Turner Prize. Alternately, I could chop up three man-ne quin s, insert a cucumber, two\nmelons and a kumquat, and call\nit \"ProstitutioN\". For goodness\nsake, this exhibition is awful,\npretentious rubbish. Don't go.\nJulia H Blanket is at the Imperial\nCollege Ante Gallery until 5th December. Free.\nANGELS & DEMONS\n\n"

In this adaptation of George Orwell's classic Keep the Aspidistra\nFlying he stars with Bonham Carter as a quirky 1930's couple with very\nmodern ideas. He plays Comstock, who walks out on a secure job to follow a \"career\" as a poet and inadvertently discovers life along the way.\nHe relies on his friends to bail him out when the finances go down the\ndrain while he just recites wonderful poetry, swears and moans about not\ngetting into Oxford. Things seriously go pear-shaped when he makes his\nspectacularly tolerant \"lady friend\" pregnant, which makes him all the\nmore determined to escape the dreaded \"middle-class respectability\".\nThe film is blessed with some beautiful camera work and more\nrecognisable, though alas un-name able, British faces than you would\nthink possible. Should you be looking for an un challenging stab at one of\nOrwell's lesser-known works you will do no wrong in seeing this. U Alun Hart\nTHE TANGO LESSON\nStarring: Sally Porter, Pablo Veron\nDirector: Sally Porter\nT he Tango Lesson is about a film-maker struggling with\nscript writing who decides to\ntake some tango lessons from a professional dancer (Pablo Veron).\nAs the film develops, the situation\nbecomes more complex,\nincorporating love, love-in-work\nand leadership. She wants to be a tango dancer, he wants to be a movie star. Do they have real love\nor are they just using one another.\nCan each learn how to follow when\nboth are leaders?\nShot almost entirely in black\nand white, this true film shows how\nSally Potter (playing herself)\nstruggled with writing a decent\nscript after her acclaimed Orlando.\nIt sets a strong mood from start to\nfinish and seems ready to induce\nempathy from its viewers.\nSadly it fails chronically. Far\nfrom being anything close to\nengrossing, it excels in tedium and\nis incredibly inane. The dialogue is\nrestricted to one or two lines about\nissues such as leadership and\nfeminism while the audience\nexpects far more. Unfortunately\nthe scenes of spontaneous crying\nor the two lovers interacting also\nfail to effect the desired reaction\nfrom viewers. However, although\nmost screen time is dedicated to\nthe two leads doing it in every single public place imaginable, (the\ntango that is) it is filmed with\nplenty of style and control and a never-ending soundtrack which\nalmost redeems matters.\nTo the film's credit, however, it\nis never at any instance confused,\nit is a rare film in that it allows you\na peak inside the mind of the\ndirector as if you were chatting\ndirectly to Sally Potter. This\ntherefore probably explains why\nthe film stubbornly persists in\nshunning entertainment in favour\nof more analysis of the director.\nAt the end of the day, people\nwill walk away with one of only two\npossible opinions. Absolutely\nfascinating or an utter waste of\ntime. I'm afraid I can't see many\npeople vying for the former. Q Tesfaye Asfaw\nICU CINEMA - SUNDAY 30TH NOVEMBER AT 6:00\nLA DOLCE VITA\nStarring: Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg\nDirectonFrederico Fellini\nArguably the best film ever\nmade, La Dolce Vita boasts a wonderful story line, the\namazing setting of 1960's Rome, a beautiful female and a gorgeous\nmale lead.\nDirected by Italy's premier film-maker, this deals with a journalist's struggle to find morality in the\nseedy Italian capital. He feels that\nhe is an outsider and apart from the\nworld he cynically observes.\nHowever, his very cynicism prevents him from realising that he is,\nin fact, drawn towards and into the\nlife he pretends to despise.\nMarcello Mastroianni stars as\nMarcello Rubini, who travels\naround Rome in company with\nPaparazzo, played by Walter\nSantesso. This film gave rise to the\nterm paparazzi, which has come a long way from this foolish, bumbling photographer. Anita Ekberg\nis fantastic as Sylvia, a beautiful\nSwedish actress, who jumps into\nthe fountains in Rome and provides\none of the most memorable\nmoments of the film.\nI highly recommend this film\nto those who wants to know more\nabout the art of film-making, as\nwell as anyone who enjoys tales of\ndecadence and immorality, where\nsex and alcohol are the driving\nforces and the only escape is\ndeath. Although it's in Italian, it has\nsubtitles, and really is something\nspecial. It's showing this Sunday at\nICU Cinema, providing a rare\nchance to see it on the big screen.\nGo on, treat yourself.

The centre is available to students and staff requests alike and\nhave already set up bulk orders\nwith the Department Of\nMaterials.

Their only compensation\nbeing take-away only access to\nthe snack-bar in the postgraduate\ncommon room.\nThe Chemistry department is\nnow one of the few departments\nthat is unable to provide specific\nrecreational facilities for their\nundergraduates. Dr Goodgame,\nthe department's college tutor\nexplained that the Common\nRoom was an \"under-utilised\"\nresource, and in a time where\nspace is at a premium within the\ndepartment, it was not a cause\nworth fighting for.\nIn contrast, Ed Walker,\nChemistry's RCSU Department\nRepresentative, saw the facility as\na necessary part of college life\nand depicted the whole operation\nas the \"withdrawal of the last\nsocial space for undergraduates\".\nHe objected to the reticent manner in which the undertaking had\nbeen carried out, referring to a recent RCSU meeting where it\nbecame apparent that staff as\nwell as students were oblivious to\nthe conversion.\nThe postgraduates are indifferent to the undergraduate invasion of their common room.\nAndrew Ofori\nA bust of Lord P.

The\nDepartment of Computing now\nboasts the Fujitsu AP3000, along\nwith a Fujitsu VX vector pro ces sor. It is an upgrade of the\nAPI000 which was donated to\nthe college by Fujitsu in 1994.\nThe college received an award\nof \u00a31.65 million as a result of the\nproposal it entered in a competition run by the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council\nand the Higher Education Funding\nCouncil. This, in conjunction with\nsupport from Fujitsu enabled the\nacquisition of the new equipment,\nwhich was unveiled on Commemoration Day.\nThe 80 node AP3000 has 12.5\ngigabytes of memory, 336 gigabytes of internal disk and has a theoretical peak performance of 45.6\ngiga flops( compared with the 1 -2\ngiga flops of the AP1000). The system is placed on a high-speed network and brings with it a sophisticated priority scheduling system,\nto enable the equipment to efficiently deal with numerous\nresearch projects concurrently. Its\napplications in modelling/ simulation alone can be applied to almost\nevery department within the col-leg e. This machine, which hails from\nthe new generation of supercomputer, enhances IC's position in\ntop-line European research. Unlike\nthe AP 1000 which is open to general use, the AP3000 is only available for college use. In order to\nuse it a proposal satisfying the parallel computing centre's( ICPC) criteria must be submitted.\nThose brave and able enough\nto utilise the AP3000 can make initial enquiries to the following email address: i cpc@ doc.ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Ola\nHolmer finished the 'brown'\ncourse in 80:05 minutes - two\nminutes under par time.\nWe always welcome new\nmembers and anyone who is inter-este d, contact Gareth Jones at\ng dj l@ doc.ic.ac.uk.\nThe Chess II team, glowing with\nthree wins from four matches this\nterm, were trounced by a strong\nside from Hackney in the\nMiddlesex League last week. In the\nabsence of star players Jeremy\nDavies and Rob Kruszynski, last\nseason's impressive win at home\nwas not repeated.\nAt the \"late\" start time of\n7.30pm only three of our eight\nplayers were at their boards - the\nmatch looked lost without a move\nhaving been played. Dave Tang\nhad to be dragged away from a friendly \"warm-up\" game next\ndoor. Others arrived one by one\nwithin the half-hour default time.\nl vo Tzenov lost too quickly on\nboard 8. His opponent belched\nand smoked and almost died of\ncoughing, but unfortunately lived\nto deliver checkmate.\nA fire alarm interrupted the\nmatch - a welcome break for\nsome, and maybe the opposition\nwould be cheesed off by it (of\ncourse, we're used to it now).\nAndy Slough resumed his game\nwith a rotten move, and slipped\nfrom a dominating position into a loss. Dave had also been better\noff, having played quickly (his\nforte) and swapped off pieces, but\nhe failed to turn it into a win.\nJeremy didn't appear, so Giles\n'squirrel' Cope was substituted on\nboard 4. More at home with\nbridge, he was slowly and methodically crushed. Even his combat\nboots and trousers, pint of beer,\nand an aggressive squat on the\nchair couldn't save him. Kostas\nVafiadis was not on form and lost\nto a stormy attack on his king,\nunsuccessfully sheltering behind\nrickety pawns.\nTim Douglas continued to perform brilliantly and pulled off our\nonly win with a mating attack on\nthe castled king. Barry Gale faced\nthe same opponent as last year;\nhaving survived the opening with a reasonable postion as black, he\nfoolishly allowed thrusting pawns\nto creep up on his deserted king,\nand soon found himself in a mating\ntrap.\nSimon Warman requested the\nchallenge of playing a tough opponent on board 1. He showed himself up to the task and lasted to a very draw ish endgame. However,\nhe entered the \"speed finish\" a couple of minutes down and,\nunwilling to accelerate his thinking\nprocesses, he lost on time.\nThe final score was 1.5 - 6.5,\nour worst defeat so far.\nThe Islamic Society\nevents have started off with a bang, or I should I say 'splat!' Our\nannual paint balling event saw us\nthis year pitted against the shooting skills of City University. Played\non a thirty acre site we had an\naction packed day, with every one\nsuited out in a combat suit and a semi automatic paint gun. The\nevent including four main games,\neach lasting forty minutes was held\nat the 'Big Red' in Slough.\nImperial got off to an impressive start in game one, the objective to take the opponents flag and\ndefend our own. After thirty five\nminutes both sides were locked in\nan endless stalemate with little\ncasualties. Then with two minutes\nto spare 'VP Areeb' ( our vice president ) made a suicide rush at the\nCity base and single handily took\ntheir flag and made his way back to\ngive Imperial a twenty point lead.\nMission accomplished but mainly\nbecause the City's defence had run\nout of paint bullets. Game two -'defence of the village'- saw each\nside try to defend a village and\nstop the enemy stealing your flag.\nBoth sides defended the village\nand the game was declared a draw, thanks mainly to the sharp\ndefensive shooting of Imperials\n'ewoks' Ishtiaq and $a qi b. After a break for prayer and a much needed hot meal, game four\n- 'speed ball.' Like game one the\nobjective was to the take the enemies flag and protect your own,\nbut this time it was a quick fire\nmad rush of four, three minute\ngames.\nIn game one our favourite secretary himself, 'hitman' Harris, was\nthe only Imperial man left alive.\nHe ran the whole length of the\nfield, took out the remaining three\nCity players in amazing manoeuvre\nand walked back with City's flag.\nCity won the next two but fresher\nRizwan maintained our lead by\nwinning the last game with a great\nindividual effort.\nCity fought back trailing only by\nfive points, by defeating Imperials\nattempt in game four to 'defend\nthe bridge.' With both sides cheating in our attempt to take City's bridge ( thanks to our 'shifty'\nfresher Hussan) the last game was\ncalled a draw and we won the\nevent by five points.

For\nspace age fun there'll be a gyroscope in the quad & the evening's incidental music comes from\nHedonizm in the concert hall and\nthe Pop Tarts in dBs. Live music is\non an indie tip with The\nBeekeepers, and Bratpop.\nThe Union will be fully decked out\nto match the Bond theme, and the\nguests are expected to do the\nsame - so Bond or Bond girls\nplease! Tickets are \u00a36 or \u00a35 with\nan ents card. We're expecting to\nsell out, so get moving!\nBIZARRE\nAs editor, I frequently have to deal\nwith random people appearing in\nthe office to submit truly strange\nofferings. Sometimes this is a pro b lem; it's horrible to watch someone\nretreating, tail between their legs,\nbecause their masterpiece has\nbeen rejected. In this case, how ev er, it was a source of considerable\namusement. We truly have no idea\nwhere this came from:\nTOO LITTLE, TOO LATE\nThe turnout at this week's tuition\nfee protest was encouraging\n(although the Imperial delegation\nwas five-eights of bugger-all), but 1\nwas a little surprised when I heard\nwho had organised it; not the\nSmall Ads\nBilly Bragg / Gene\nTwo tickets for the above gig are\navailable from Rob on 01 71 298\n7593 priced \u00a313.\nE&O Apologies are due to the Islamic\nSociety for the continued non-appearence of their paint balling article.

Full marks to SW,\nbut where the hell were the NUS?\nThe whole point of that union is to\nrepresent students and relay their\nopinions to those in charge.\nStudents, to a man, are rejecting\nthe fees but the NUS seems to\nhave a weak, deterministic attitude\nand is making very little noise. The\nrules CAN be changed (just look at\nthe series of concessions already\nmade over gap-year students and\nmeans-testing), so what are they\nplaying at? The sad truth is that the\nNUS presidency is little more that a fast track to the Labour govern-ment, so clearly they have to practice spouting vacuous crap.\nIndeed, according to Private Eye,\nthree ex-presidents who are now\nMPs fail to even mention their\nposition in Dods (the parliamentary\nbible). AH three are however keen\nto point out their directorships of\nEndsleigh Insurance, a company\nthat is both unashamedly promoted by the NUS and denounced by\nWatchdog as rip-off merchants.\nSo get off your backside, Mr\nTrainer, reread your job de scrip tion, ditch that poli c ical rhetoric,\nand do what the students tell you.\nkv OR LD AIDs DAy 70s CHARITY PART\\1\nALL PROCEEDS TO THE\nTERRENCE HIGGINS\nTRUST\nEVERYONE WELCOME\nThursday 4 December\n7.30pm, dB's \u00a3 2 . 0 0 entry on the\ndoor\nOrganised by Imperial Queers\nThe Lesbian, gay and Bisexual Society of ICU\nHAIRSALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY\nBY OUR TOP STYLISTS\n\u00a3L5 LADIES\n\u00a3 1 3 MEN No r mal Price \u00a3 3 0\nmmr mm Telephone 0171 823 8968\nTHE\nFELIX WEEK\nMONDAY\nArts Meeting - 1 pm.
