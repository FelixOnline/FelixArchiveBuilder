This is\nthe race for which the as yet\nundiscovered have trained\nhard and raced abysmally all term. They might even have\nlaid off the beer a bit in the\nprevious week too! Such a man is A Davey!\nThe use of the above\nstrategies is designed to\nensure that the Captain is\nhoodwinked when he performs\nthat one rho us task \" working out the handicaps\". Fellow engineers would no doubt\ncom is e rate with Ian ' cos this requires \" sums\" to be\ndone: on the other hand there's plenty of scope for \" guesswork\" in the \" calculations\", so it's not all bad.\nThe es sense of the \" method\" is one of estimating how\nwell the victim should be\ncapable of running round\nPetersham on the basis of\ni he terms races and \"current\nform\". Corrections are then\nmade in order to discourage/ prevent previous winners or\nfirst team members from\noverhauling too many other\npeople. However, many hours\n(or pints) are poured into\nthis ritual, though, the\nprobability of the handicaps\nbeing wrong remains infinitesimally close to one. The race itself was not\nuneventful. Nigel would have\nhad a better handicap had he\nnot been first away and\n\u2022running round the unmarked\n' course for the first time (Ho,\nho \u2014 there's always next\nyear). Rich would have made\na further contribution to keeping\nthe lad down by choosing the\nwrong path towards the\nPlantation. Unfortunately Roman\nand Paul hadn't been forewarned\nabout this ploy and, gullible as hell, were also led astray.\nThe result, what about the\nresult? Well, despite Rob tearing the race apart from the\nback\u2014knocking a minute off\nhis personal best by hurtling\nround in under twenty eight\nminutes - Andy Davey hacked\nover two minutes off his expected time to finish a comfortable winner. A prize\nreally ought to go to Mike\nWe I ford for predicting this\nvictory a week beforehand\nin FELIX. Everybody else finished\nin an order roughly like Alan, Mike, Rob, Alf, Roman, Dave,\nPaul, Dave, Rich, Ian and\nNigel. It should be noted that\nIan Ellis ignored vociferous\nrequests to take part in the\nrace, missing it for the third\nyear in succession. \"The Hog's Back 10\"\nENTHUSED BY Steve' s recommendation \" Its a good\nrace, lads\", those, of us who\nhadn't fled from London at\nthe end of term entered Guilford\nand God.

Having come third\nin a10 mile race the previous\nweekend, Rob too decided to\ngive the Hog's Back a miss\nand left for home at the last\nminute.\nStarting by the pictures e que wooded lake at Cuts Mill, the\ncourse winds its way along\n(and up) country lanes: through\nthe little villages of Seale\nand Puttingham before turning\nand climbing sharply to join\nthe A31 at the top of the\nHog's Back after 61\nA miles. From then on it's downhill\nall the way, taking the A3 and finishing outside the\nUniversity of Surrey Sports\nCentre.\nDue to road works and\n\"impending police advice\" the organisers had moved\nthe start half a mile down the\nroad from the previous year.\nSadly they hadn't remembered\nto mention the fact to the\nfirst two coach drivers taking\neveryone to the start, so all but those in the last coach\npartook in an extra bit of warming\nup... very popular.

    "content": "F ttl X EDITORIAL\nScarborough Conference\nFor many\"students, it is through either FELIX or Sennet\nor the national newspapers, each wit h their own bias, that they get. to hear of what went on at the Conference and\nthe policy decisions taken. This in many cases is the only\n-communication between most students and the National Union. When this august body of situ dents(?) decides that it\nshould forge links with the trade unions and take sides with the MPLA in Angola, one wonders about the relevance\nof such time consuming motions and indeed the whole of\nconference, to improving the lot of the IC student (and\nthat is assuming that it needs to be improved).\nAlthough politically aware, many students through a lack of political understanding tend to the opinion that the\nconference is merely a forum for political theorists to\nexpress their grandiose ideas for creating a perfect society \u2014\nthey would not be far wrong.\nThe solidly theoretical approach to student affairs and\ninternational politics is, supposedly, what alienates people\nfrom the NUS. The practical aspects \u2014 the grants protests,\nletters to the ministers concerned, the patronising calls for change \u2014 are all unimaginative but effective. However,\nthere is a need for strength of character within the National\nUnion heir arch y to direct resourceful efforts to the immediate\nproblems facing students. We are in danger of seeing decreasing\nstandards in education and must take positive and realistic steps to protect ours and future students' educational\ninterests.\nThe election by the union members of the NUS Executive could ensure the relevance of the action taken by the\nleadership and might help prevent the build-up of a clique\nwithin the heir arch y of the Union. TheN US appears to be divorced from students \u2014 the\nUnion means little to them and the national conference only\nserves to crystallize their lack of interest.\nOr is it simply a problem of communication?\nIf so, the new national student newspaper, National' Student, could go a long way towards providing a solution.\nThis is the fourth such venture by NUS and shows the\nimportance attacked to communications within the student\nbody by the NUS Executive. It is reassuring to know that\ndespite having a Broad Left editorial line, it is not the\nNUS's intention for the paper to carry propaganda.\nWe are sorry to announce that one of FELIX' S long-serving staff has had to resign. Mike Williams, last year's Editor, contributed much to the paper; he lead it through the\ndifficulties of change from letterpress to printing on the\npremises, and has continued to write articles and give\n\u00bbadvice since his term of office expired. Now Mike finds\npressure building up in his post-grad course, and does not\nfeel it right to continue with FELIX at the expense of his studies. We wish him every success in the future, and thank\nhim for what he has done in the past.\nChristmas tree sabotaged\nDuring the vacation, the\ndecorations from a Christinas\nTree in the Mechanical Engineering Department were\nfound smashed.

This was a statement\ncontained in a paper which was recently submitted by\nthe NUS to the Department\nof Education and Science( DES) to supplement its\n1976 grants claim. NUS has revealed that mature students,\nespecially those with children, are living below the poverty\nline.\nStudents with families face\ndiff i cuI ties because of anomalies\nin the way that the grants'\nregulations operate. A mature\nstudent's allowance is linked\nwith previous earnings.

    "content": "FI LIX Apathy or misdirected\nslothfulness\nHAVE YOU ever noticed, how,\nshortly after IC elections or\nan NUS demo, various persons\nstart accusing the IC populous\nof displaying extreme apathy?\nNormally like all good students,\nwe nod and say ' There'sa terrible apathy problem here'\nthen dash off to some wild exhausting activity such as\nskiing only to rush back and\nuse several armfuls of energy\nconsuming such beverages as\nthe Bar committee see fit to\noffer us. The time has come to\nprotest!!... I emphatically\ndeny that the strong and\noverwhelming display of non-participation at elections and\nNUS shindigs is not due to\napathy but a variety of other\nless condemning reasons such\nas disinterest, lack of time,\netc, etc.\nMisdirected energy\nIn my Humble opinion if\nanyone wants to protest about\nthe non-reaction to any issue\npolitical, should instead\nof shouting\" bloody technologists\" and throwing\ntantrums in the Union office \u2014\nthey should examine the\ncurious amount of \" misdirected energy\" in this College. If\nanyone doubts that vast\nquantities of energy is not\nused up for purely non-academic\npursuits then they ought to have\na look at any third year's job\napplication form. You will be\namazed how many societies and\nsports clubs that the average\nthird year appears to belong to.\nVaried interests\nI think it is about time a new public image was given\nto the average IC mob. We\nshould also show the world\nthat apart from working eight\nhours a night, the average\nIC student has wide and\nvaried interests.\nFirst and most obvious there\nis a very impressive collection of road signs and notices In\nabundance around the Union \u2014\nthese having been obtained\nfrom all over Great Britain\nby our enterprising represent ives at these locations. This collection is frequently\noverhauled and new ones\nadded. This shows the extremely\nby Karen Gadd\nadmirable determination and\nenergy of several intrepid\nstudents here who go to\ngreat lengths at . times to\npurloin them.\nHorrific influences\nSecondly, there is the\nunique and varied folklore\nof the three sub-cultures\nwhich simultaneously exist\nin various parts of the College. These three cults (known\nto the few as CC Us) have\nan impressive mascot and\nan interesting selection of\nchants and ceremonies which\nare open to those, initiated\nand accepted into the appr opiate coven. The great white leaders\nof these cults are renowned\nand upheld as per pet u at or s of the great IC tradition.\nUnfortunately this great\ntradition has been lost now\nfor several generations of\nstudents. This has caused\nmuch frustration to the three\nmighty warriors \u2014 as has\nbeen recently displayed when\none succumbed to the unknown,\nhorrific influences of \" academic pressures\", and another\nfinding it all too much, ran\nnaked five times round the\nAlbert Hall \u2014 this sad and\nmoving sight of Big B clad In\nnothing but a toph at will not\nbe forgotten for many a long\nyear.\nFrenzied activity The astonishing degree\nof activity of those involved\nin C GUs is a clear indication\nthat apathy does not prevail.\nFor who can claim that\napathy has us in its sluggish\ngrasp when. so much frenzied\nactivity can be seen nightly\noutside the Union after 11\no' clock at night. For while\nthe sight of several young\nmen simultaneously singing\nand relieving themselves in\nthe middle of Beit Quad can\nstill be witnessed at regular\nintervals we realise that the\nsocial and political life of\nthis Union is not on its knees.\nAnd if you still have doubts\nthat energy and enthusiasm for\nour great, common cause are\nnot in evidence, try shouting\n' Knickers!' in the Union\nBar.

They would\nbe very grateful.\nExternal Eclairs\nAs you are reading this, I shall be in Durham, a provincial\nplace somewhere in the wilds north of Watford, at the NUS Universities Conference. I shall probably be writing about\nthat next week. Meanwhile I suppose you are all gasping\nto hear the juicy details of\nwhat happened at the Scarborough\nConference; yes, I thought\nyou would be.\nImagine a hall filled mainly\nwith students; on the platform\nare the National Union's Executive and their running\ndogs; the Executive consists of fourteen Broad Lefties( a coalition of the Communist\nParty and various other\nMarxists), two International\nSocialists( the \" Trots\") and\none International Marxist.\nThe leader of this shower is\none Charles Clarke, a fat,\nbearded old Etonian from\nKing's College, Cambridge\n(hiss) and a career is t. You may have gathered\nthat these hacks are not\nexactly my favourite people,\nand can assure you that I am\nnot one of theirs. In fact,\nno-one seemed to be quite\nsure what I was politically; Mary Attenborough concluded\nthat I was a\" Trot\" and\nTrevor Phillips that I was a\" Bloody Tory\". I can now\nreveal that I am a right-wing\nLiberal balls hitter. No doubt you have read\nin FELIX or elsewhere about\nthe main events of the\nConference; the removal of Ms\nSlipman as the chairman of\nInternational Policy Group, the\ndebate on Democrat i sat ion,\nand the financial problems of\nNUS Travel. You may not know about\nsome of the other debates\nthat took place, for example,\nthat on Government Economic\nPolicy. This showed two\nthings about the Broad Left\nand the Trots; firstly they\nknow nothing about either\nGovernment or Economics and\nsecondly, that they wish to\nsee the economy of this\ncountry totally destroyed. The\nmotion which was eventually\npassed called for a massive\nre flat ion of the economy, full\nemployment and an end to all\nwage restraint. Those Labour\nParty students with whom\nI later discussed this were so\ndisgusted with this motion that\nthey are considering withdrawing their support from the\nBroad Left in protest.\nThis sort of thing is not\nonly outside the concern of\nthe NUS, but also brings them\ninto disrepute which can only\nweaken their influence with the\nGovernment, small as it is. The democracy debate was\na complete railroad by the\nBroad Left, mainly by Pete\nAshby and Alastair Stewart.\nWe were attempting to have\nat least some of the Executive elected by a ballot of all students, and to improve\nthe procedures for electing\ndelegates to the conferences. As far as the latter is\nconcerned, I would like to\nsee the NUS lay down standard\nelection procedures which\nwould be a condition of\nattendance, for example,\nat least, to elect delegates\nfrom aUG M, as we do at\nIC, or (preferably) by a secret\ncampus-wide ballot, as is\ndone in many colleges. The conduct of Pete Ashby, in the chair, was quite d is gusting. He twisted a motion\nto take the third amendment in\nparts so that he could be sure\nof removing the section on\nExecutive salaries, and then\nhe refused to accept a challenge\nto the chair supported by the\nrequired number of delegations.\nThe Executive also used a member of the elections committee in support of their\ncase, and Alastair Stewart,\nsupported by Charles Clarke, misrepresented the views of\nthe Electoral Reform Society. The moderates did not allow this to go un refuted. The Tories and Liberals, together with the \" Students for Representative Policies\" group, issued the text of the\nletter from the Electoral Reform Society, despite\nthreats of legal action from\nCharles Clarke. In their\nattempts to foil the move for\ndirect elections, the Broad\nLeft used every political\nploy, including underhand\nones, at their disposal. Perhaps after the next\nnational conference, at Easter, the new Executive will contain\na few moderates.\nServices\nAt the last Council meeting,\na very tired External Affairs officer presented some cons it tut ional changes to ICU Council. These included the creation\nof the post of Services Liaison Officer, whose brief will be\nto arrange and advise students\non travel facilities and\ninsurance services, provided\nby NUS or otherwise.\nHe might also investigate\nthe potential of marketing\ngoods, for example, calculators, wine, Ascot water heaters,\nelephant-foot umbrella stands\nor whatever by the Union. The new post should be open\nfor nominations after the\nnext U GM. That' s all folks, except\nfor my slogan of the week:\n\"Force the Reds to resign\nand get students into a mobil is ation situation to\nreturn an anti-imperialist\n(but not anti-Imperial) ToryTrotskyite Executive pledged\nto moderate policies\".\nDerrick (Dermot) Everett\nPROSPECTIVE REAL ALE SOCIETY\nAnyone interested in forming a Real Ale Society please\ncome to the R CSU office on Thursday 15th January at 1.00pm( PS - Guilds and Mines invited if interested.)\n\n"

The meeting, held to discuss\" The State, the Law, and Ireland\" had been\ninfiltrated by between twenty and thirty\nNF members identifiable by black arm\nbands. Six people were seriously injured\nincluding a senior lady citizen who was\nhit over the head with a chair.\n\u00a31200 of damage was caused to\nUMIST Union buildings in the ensuing\nrampage. Subsequently, police arrested\n29 NF members suspected to have been\ninvolved in the disruption of the N CCL meeting. This happened despite threats\nand hounding of executive officers of\nUMIST Union by persons said to belong\nto the NF. However, the police who are vigorously\npursuing the case have had difficulty in\npressing charges against any of those\ndetained. This arises from the fact that\nthey were arrested about 500 yards off\nthe u ii versify campus. The task of\nproving that they were on the campus\nhas not been aided by the arrested\nrefusing to take part in identity parades\nas is their prerogative.\nA spokesman for UMIST Union says\nthat despite the great deal of work being\nput in on the case by the police the\ncase is proceeding at a very slow pace.\nAn amendment to the motion calling on CO's to expel any of their members\nknown to belong to the National Front\nwas heavily defeated after an impassioned\nplea from Charles Clarke warning that\nits passage would assist those who\nwere attacking democracy.\nThe motion reiterates previous policy\nand calls for the banning of platforms\nfor extreme right-wing factions and urges\nfor an active opposition to fascism. Condemnation of South Africa's invasion\nof Angola was declared in an emergency\nmotion which recognised the MPLA( People's Movement for the Liberation of\nAngola) as the only genuine liberation\nmovement in Angola. Paul Burton( UCL) moving the resolution\nsaid it was vital that the NUS tonight\nalongside the Anti-Apartheid Movement\n(AAM) and the Angola Solidarity Committee\nin support of the MPLA who were a coalition of all the left in Angola. They\nwere not controlled by Russia as stated\nin the bourg ios e right-wing press.\nSue Slipman, NUS National Secretary,\nsumming-up on the debate which was\nsomewhat one-sided, reiterated that it\nwas imperative to support the MPLA who were fighting for a People's Republic\nof Angola.\" Progressives all over the\nworld supported the MPLA as does the\nNUS\", she said.\nThe motion was overwhelmingly\ncarried.\nClarke lashes out at\nuniversity unions\nIN HIS OPENING speech to the Scarborough\nConference, Charles Clarke, President\nof NUS, stressed the need for students\nto unite and work on a larger scale with the trade union movement.\nIt was, he said clear that no government\ncould survive without at least the tacit\nsupport of the trade union movement.\nStudents could not now assume that\nthey would find themselves in the\nupper reaches of the professional class. The vast majority of students would\nbecome trade union members. As a result, the natural allies of the student\nbody were no longer the chamber of\ncommerce, instead they were the trade\nunions.\nSpeaking on the cuts in public expend-it ure, Mr Clarke made it clear that the\nNUS was playing a leading role in the\nfight against them and as such would\nface attempts aimed at defeating the\nUnion.\" Tactics of 'divide and rule'\nwill be used\", he said. He took the\nopportunity to criticize those university\nunions which had been slow to take up\nthe fight against cuts in educational\nexpenditure.\n\"I must say to conference that the\nleadership of some, not all, large\nuniversity unions appears to be happier\nto stand by and watch the fight... They\nseem to look at the fight to save education\nas though it had nothing to do with them;\nwith a lack of concern which will ultimately\ndestroy the education sector that they\nclaim to represent\".\nHe also condemned attempts to\ninterfere in the internal democracy and\naccountability of trade union structures,\nincluding in their electoral processes. NUS could expect the same treatment,\nas their opposition to government policies grew nearer the centre.\n\" The twin principles which this\nconference must uphold are the maximum\ninvolvement of the NUS's members in our\nunion \u2014 for without this we are nothing \u2014\nand the principle of accountability.\nBy this I mean the accountability of\nthis union to this national conference and\nnot to the judgements of the Lords of\nthe Fleet Street press\". Mr Clarke went on to warn of the\nimplications of decisions taken in other\ncountries around the world. It was no\ncoincidence that loans were yet again\nbeing proposed after their successful introduction, albeit partially, in West\nGermany. Similarly, the attacks on 60%\nof overseas students who come from\nthe poorest parts of the world was\nintensifying just at the time the Government was pursuing oil deals in the\nMiddle East. The problems facing students had to\nbe confronted honestly. It did no good\nto condemn cutbacks in education\nand at the same time say that the\ngovernment's economic policy is broadly\ncorrect \u2014 the cuts are central to this\npolicy. It was time to realise that the\nera of 1968 was over.\nHe concluded: \" Tactics full of sound\nand fury and no more, in the end, signify\nnothing.\" \" Severe and difficult tasks\nlie ahead. But the fruits of success are\nworth fighting for. They are: better\neducation from the nursery to the\nuniversity; the rights of many more\npeople to education throughout their\nlives; and an end to education for the\nprivileged few.\n\" The ashes of defeat would be\nbitter indeed. For it is not only our\nown education which is at risk but\nthe education, permanently destroyed,\nof those who will follow us.\" Foreign students\ngetting a rough deal\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS were being used\nas a whipping boy to implement more\ncuts, Trevor Philips, NUS vice-president\nresponsible for overseas students,\nclaimed at a press conference on overseas\nstudents. Mr Phillips was speaking\nimmediately after a motion condemning\ndiscrimination against overseas students\nhad been carried by an overwhelmingly\nmajority. Less than ten students voted\nagainst it.\nIn this context therefore, the overseas\nstudents (OSi campaign was directly\nlinked to the grants/cuts campaign. Mr\nPhillips said that this term was the\nfirst time the OS campaign had been\ntaken-up demonstrably and in his view\nthe best way to pursue the campaign\nwas through the areas of the NUS. The motion on OS which calls for a day of action says that the present\nattacks on OS \"constitute a deliberate\nand systematic attempt to exclude from\npost-s choo! education, overseas students\nwho are not privately wealthy or backed\nby Government or bust n~ss interests. The\nconsequence of frits is to restrict\neducational opportunity to the ruling\nelite in those countries\". Opposition to proposals contained\nin the report of the CVC P Study Group\non Postgraduate Education and the\nILEA document ca!i ing for drastic\nreductions in the number of overseas\nstudents in ILEA colleges, were expressed.\nSuch proposal? had to be \" seen in. the\ncontext of the '^creasing use of ra sci st arguments by various groups, which\ncontinued on page 7\nFELIX 7\nConference\nBroad Left increase\nhold on Executive\nTHE BROAD LEFT strengthened their\nhold on the NUS Executive with the\nelection of Pete Davies to fill the\nvacancy left by the resignation of\nLiberal, Francis Haydn. He is a student\nof English Literature at the New University\nof Ulster where he also holds the sabbatical\npost of Deputy President.\nPete was a full-time Loch ness monster hunter for three and a half\nyears before becoming a student at NU U. Alan Williams (Bradford University)\nwas elected to the Elections Committee\nand Mike Hill( NLP) elected as a three\nyear member of Finance Committee.\nIn addition, the following people\nwere elected to serve on the Steering\nCommittee: Ti! Wright ( Leeds), Anne\nHarrison (New College of Speech and\nDrama), Sarah Ward ( Leeds), Valerie Phillips( Rachel McMillan), Clare Wilson\n(Manchester), Ian King( Moray House CE) and Keith Underbill (UMIST).\nHousing\nBallyhoo and now t else\nFOR THE SECOND conference running\nthe problem of housing was discussed.\\ Charles Clarke moving the section of j the Executive report on housing described !\nit as \" the most politically divisive i issue facing students and young people !\nin general\". There was an expanding demand by j young single people for single places j to live. For National and local government j to take-up this problem and provide i accommodation for them, seemed to be\nMr Clarke' s solution to the problem.'\nThe actual housing motion was\neventually carried by a majority after\nall three amendments, each supported by\na different extreme political group, had\nbeen debated and defeated. The policy\nadopted reaffirmed previous policy. Note\nof the acute housing shortage, increased\nuse of repressive legislation against\nsquatters occupying empty property, the\nCriminal Trespass Law and the massive\nincrease in hails of residence charges\nwere made. Calls foi a rent freeze and\nusage of short-life accommodation were\nseen as temporary measures against a very poor situation.\nIn the meantime, the NUS Executive has been charged with a careful study\nof the situation and to seek solutions\nwith the help of the relevant interested\nbodies.\ncontinued tic ur page 6\nattempt to lay the bia me for the crisis on\nethnic minorities''.\n\" Many overseas student;, have no\nchoice but to come to Britain due to a| history of exploitation and repression\nin their own countries which has resulted\nin a criminal lack of facilities. Britain\nhas a moral duty to provide education\nfor these students and also to those\nwho come from countries with fascist governments''.\nThe motion calls on the NUS executive\nto approach vice-chancellors to reconsider\nproposals to increase fees. It also believes that the overseas aid budget\nTHE DEBATE on the NUS constitution\nwas characterised by confusion and\nstrong emotions. Despite their status as\nan independent body who usually do\nnot take part in discussions at conference,\nthe Elections Committee were called on\nto give their views on points in the\nmain motion and accompanying amendments,\nprior to their being discussed. The Elections Committee were of\nthe opinion thai they would not be able\nto carry out the instructions as stated\nin the main motion, because they were\nnot equipped to do so. This was due to\ntheir independence and therefore they\ncould not draft parts of the constitution\nas they were being asked to do.\nThe main motion was moved by\nLeighton Adams (Newcastle Polytechnic).\nHe wanted to see NUS supporting the\nsmall colleges and become more represent-at ive. There were 750,000 full and\npart-time students in the NUS he pointed\nout. \" You represent 200,000 of these\nstudents at the outside. We are concerned\nabout the attitude of the average student\ntowards the NUS. It is not even an\nattitude; it is absolute non-concern with\neverything to do with the union.\"\" TheN US effectively divorces the\nmajority of students because of the\nsmall number of people who come to\nthese conferences assuming they represent\nthe majority.\"\nMr Steve Moon, Birmingham University,\nmoving the first amendment, called\nfor direct elections of the top four\nexecutive members and said he recognised\nthe problems inherent in establishing\na majority ballot. A recommendation in\nthe amendment asked for the election\nand observers in COs to be carried out\nby a secret ballot of all their ordinary\nmembers.\nMr Francis haydn attacking the\namendment described it as a Tory/ Liberal plot that would lead to a right-wing takeover of NUS if passed. He was not in\nfavour of democracy for its own sake.\n\" Stop farting about and support the\nmain motion\", he concluded.\nGavin Grant speaking for the amend-ment, thought that the NUS was in\ndanger of becoming moribund. \" There is a chance that direct elections will re vitali seN US.\" The amendment was overwhelmingly\ndefeated.\nA second amendment supported by\nthe NUS executive strove to maintain\nthe existing status quo. Howard Smith\n(Architectural Association), moving the\namendment, pleaded, \" Let us clearly\nreject the idea that the proposer s of the\nmain motion seek democracy. The\ndemocracy of NUS has been demonstrably\nproven by its effective campaigning for\nstudents.\" Charles Clarke con curing with him\nsaid the debate concerned the life-blood\nof the Union. It was taking place at a time when many organisations were\ntrying to weaken NUS.\" Kick out the\nreactionary main line\", he concluded.\nThe second amendment was carried,\non a card vote, by 344,473 votes to\n115,720. A majority of 2 to 1.\nA third amendment, containing a recommendation that the four full-time\nofficers should receive a salary of\n52/30 of the main rate grant, was\nvigour ou sly opposed by members of\nthe executive with the exception of the\nTreasurer, Hugh L anning. The new\nproposals would mean a drop in salaries\nfrom \u00a33,200 to about \u00a31,400 w j th \u00a3100 for\neach re-election.\nBy this time, the debate had been\nin progress for nearly three hours and\nat only about five minutes to midnight,\na procedural wrangle developed regarding\ntaking th'e amendment in parts. The\namendment was eventually voted on as a whole and declared carried, although\nfrom the press table, it looked as if it\nhad failed. A revote was demanded but amidst\nthe confusion that reigned, no clear\ndecision was announced. In the event,\nthe main motion was put to the vote\nand declared lost.\nHowever, a card vote taken on the\nthird amendment the following morning\n\u2014 proceedings having been cut short\nby electricians turning off the microphones\nand leaving - produced 184,702 for and\n204,426 against.\nThis result meant that no policy had\nbeen decided on the NUS constitution.\nSo the status quo is maintained for\nthe time being.\n\u00a3985 grant claim approved\nTHE CLAIM FOR a main rate of grant\nof \u00a3985 for the 1976-77 academic year\nwas approved by the conference. A claim for a grant of \u00a31,200 was heavily\ndefeated after an amendment to the\nGrants and Education Cuts motion, in\nwhich the claim was a part.\nThe Grants motion itself reaffirmed\ncontinued opposition to any further cuts\nin the education budget, and again\ncalled for the abolition of the means\ntest and the ending of discretionary\nawards. Demands were also made\nfor full grants for all full-time students\nshould be increased and a larger proportion of it spent in providing greater\neducational opportunity to working-class\npeople in developing countries.\nover 16 years of age and a restoration\nof all the cuts made to date in public expenditure on education, housing and\nsocial services. The motion also called on the NUS Executive to organise \" a national\ndemonstration just before the Annual\nStudent Grant Review\". Building links with the trade union\nmovement was seen to be of central\nimportance to the campaign on grants\nand cuts.\nPete Gillard NUS executive member,\nspeaking during the debate said \"It is time to put forward our own ideas and\ntake action. This is the only way we\nare going to build links with the trade\nunion movement.\"\nThe motion was carried through with\na large number of abstentions.\n\n"

    "content": "MU X THE QUESTION OF\nDISAFFILIATION\nDerrick Everett sets out below the pros and cons as he sees it.\nAlready Glasgow and Aston Universities have left NUS; at present the question is being seriously discussed at St\nAndrews, Newcastle, Liverpool, Brunei, Nottingham and a few others. It is with this background in mind that I wish to\noffer a brief summary of the arguments for and against IC's continued affiliation to NUS. For: NUS provides service, for example, NUS Travel, for its\nmembers.\nAgainst: Before Imperial College last joined NUS, it boasted\nan excellent travel service of its own. Both End sleigh Insurance and the British Rail Card are available to non-members.\nFor: NUS provides legal and financial advice to student\nUnions. Against: Why should we pay for these services since we\nnever use them; like much of NUS, they are irrelevant to a large college with a well established Union. For: TheN US provides cultural and other facilities for\nstudents, for example, the Drama Festival. Against: The political attitude of the NUS has destroyed\nany power they have to stop a non-member Union from\nentering the Drama Festival( see Thomas Stevenson's article in FELIX No 403). However, they have stopped\nGlasgow University from entering the Observer \" Mace\" Debating Tournament (sic), which Is about to fold due to\nlack of support. (It's surprising that the NUS Executive have\nnot entered, since they would manage to win every time).\nAgainst: NUS is essentially a fiddle on the part of a small\ngroup of politicoes to obtain funds for their activities, for\ntheir activities, for example trips to Rumania to sign 1 7 -page communique's on \" the State of the World\"( text\navailable from T. Phillips, c/ oULU, Malet Street, London\nWC1) and sending telegrams to support to the Marxist\nPopular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,( the USSR\nare not really intervening with their troops, missile launchers,\nMiG21 fighters, etc \u2014 after all they do not really want the\noil!)\nAgainst: The political activities of this organisation have\nhave destroyed any credibility it might have had with, for\nexample, the Government over student grants, etc. The\nvoice of an independent Imperial College Union might\ncarry more weight!\nFor: If we leave, we shall weaken the voice of the moderates\nwithin the National Union; we shall be taking the easy way\nout. If there is any chance of changing the policies and\nand politics of NUS, we should stay in.\nAgainst: If we leave, we save IC Union a mere four thousand\npounds per annum.\nThe options we have are as follows:-(i) To stay in and do our best to break the Marxist stranglehold on the NUS;( ii) To pull out for one year and encourage other moderates\nUnion to join us, just to see the effect on the NUS( and\npossibly to get some concessions?);( Hi) To pull out for an unspecified time and organise our\nown travel arrangements, etc;\n(iv) To do nothing until we are forced to pray three times a day to Moscow and sing the \" Internationale\" and the \" Red Flag\" in Beit Quad before morning lectures.\nI await comments.\nAn idea for summer\nThough there is still a long\ntime to go until summer, many\nof you will be beginning to\nmake plans for the long\nvacation. One very enjoyable\nway of passing the summer\nis to work on a Kibbutz in\nIsrael.\nThe first Kibbutzim were\nformed in the early part of\nthis century by Socialist Jews who based their ideals\non a return to work on the\nland, and are thus based on\nagriculture. On the Kibbutz\nthere is no need for money as\neveryone receives according\nto his or her needs; this\nincludes everything required\nto live, such as food, housing,\nclothing, education, medicine\nand recreation. Essentially the Kibbutz is one big family.\nThe life on a Kibbutz fifty\nyears ago was difficult, but\nin spite of the hardships the\nKibbutz movement has flourished\nuntil now about 100,000\npeople live on the 250\nKibbutzim spread throughout\nIsrael.\nFor many years Kibbutzim\nhave been taking in volunteers,\nJews and non Jews, from all\nover the world for periods of\ntime of a minimum of one\nmonth. This alone makes a Kibbutz working holiday\nworthwhile as one has a unique opportunity to meet\npeople from all walks of\nlife and from all environments.\nA typical day on the\nKibbutz would consist of\ngetting up at six o' clock( ugh!), working for six to\neight hours with breaks for\nMutters Arising\n\" Good Morning, Campers\" as I said on New Year's morning. No one appreciated\nit then either, so I had better\nget down to the three bits of\nbusiness which I would like\nto raise: National Societies\nI now have a list of all\nthe overseas registered\nstudents. It is available for\nyou to consult, at your leisure.\nWriting - up Students\nWriting-up students are\neligible for full Union member-ship. I now have a list of\nall students, who are registered\nas such, and Union cards are\nobtainable from the office.\nRules for Publicity\nThe following regulations\nwere passed at the last\nCouncil meeting, and are\nnow in force:\nbreakfast and lunch. The\nrest of the day is free for\nswimming in the pool, going\non an excursion or just lazing\nin the sun (which is guaranteed!)\nSo if anyone is interested\nin working on a Kibbutz or\nwould like more information,\nplease contact Andrew Pal through Mech Eng 2 letter\nracks. After all, as the posters\naround College say:\n\" There is more to life on\na Kibbutz than picking oranges\" Rules For Publicity Within\nIC on IC Union Notice\nBoards And Within The\nUnion Building.\n(1) Application: These rules apply to all full\nmembers of ICU with one\nexception (see 8). They\nrefer to Union notice boards,\nthe Union Building, and the\nJ CR. Anyone else wishing to\nput up publicity must first\nseek the approval of the IC\nUnion Publicity Officer, or\nthe Hon. Sec. ICU.(2) Size:\nThe maximum size for all\nposters shall be A1 (34\" x54\") or the equivalent area.\n(3) Fluorescent Paper:\nOrange Daygiow' flour e scent paper shall only be used for\nposters with the prior authorisation of the Union Publicity Officer, or the Hon. Sec. ICU.(4) Location of Posters: Posters may be put up on the\nwalls within the Union Building and J CR at the discretion of\nthe Deputy President. All such posters must be affixed\nwith ' Blue Tac' and not with\nsell o tape or drawing pins.\n(5) Frequency:\nWithin the Union Building and\nJ CR no two posters public ising the same event/ function/ club/ service etc shall be within\n20 feet of each other.\nPosters on Union Notice Boards shall be put up such\nthat no two posters public ising the same event/ function/ club/ service etc are within 20 feet\nof each other. Staples may not\nbe used to affix material to\nnotice boards.\n(6)\nIt is an offence to remove or\ncover up any poster, except\noutdated posters, or on the\norders of the ICU Executive or\nthe ICU Publicity Officer.\n(7) Contravention of these\nrules renders poster producers/\ndistribute rs liable to action\nby ICU Discipline Committee.\n(8) Exemption:\nCandidates standing for any\npost requiring a college wide\nballot shall be exempt from\nclause(5) above.\n(9) Interpretation of these\nrules rests with the ICU\nExecutive and the Union\nPublicity Officer.\n(10) Alteration\nThese rules may be altered\nby a majority decision at\nCouncil. Thank you for reading all\nthis so avidly. At this time\nof year, it is pretty hard, is it\nnot? Anyway, see you around,\nJohn\n\n"

Bar prices to stay at present level Ms Cowell's report\nfound disappointing\nBAR PRICES would remain at\ntheir present level it was decided at the Refectory\nCommittee meeting held last\nThursday. They would however\nbe reviewed at their next\nmeeting by which time the Bar Committee would have presented\nits report regarding the financial position of the bars.\nA profit of \u00a3 8,879 had been made on sales in the\nbars to date. If bar profits of\nbetween \u00a312,000 and \u00a315,000\ncould be made, then it was possible that brewery charges\nand the recent rise in wages\ncould be absorbed. This would mean that no\nprice increases would have to\nbe made, at least for this\nterm.\nMs Cowell's report\nThe meeting also discussed Ms Cowell' s report, following\nher visit here last term, on\nthe catering facilities. In it\nshe commends the Union's paper\nsubmitted to her for its\" brevity and clarity of expression\". Although she sym pathis ed with some of the opinions\ncontained in the Union's submission she felt that the\nproblems were not easily solved. The chairman of the Refectory\nCommittee, Dr Levy, said he\nwelcomed the report.\n\"There are a number of points\nwhich require careful con-side ration, some of which we\nhave already had thoughts\nabout. It is nice to have an\nauthoritative statement from\nsomebody who has a knowledge\nof university catering\".\nThe report itself is largely\nconcerned with the financial problem of the catering system\nbut recognised that within\nthis was a management problem\nof not insignificant proportions.\nMs Cowell suggests in her report that an offer of accommodation at the middle\nmanagement level, an area in which recruiting poses particularly difficult problems,\nmight help the situation with\nits strong incentive value*\nThis suggestion is already\nbeing vigorously pursued by\nthe College. The report also says that\n\"As the fixed costs represent\nan increasingly high proportion\nof the total cost, a fixed\nincome becomes more\nessential\". Ways suggested of\nachieving this include charging\nresident students a contribution\ntowards the catering costs, or\nincluding in their boarding fee\na certain number of meals. This was not unfair, the report\nsays that \"it is usually the\nresident students who use the\nfacilities at the weekend,\nbreakfast time and evening\nmeals when, for obvious\nreasons, labour costs are\nhighest\",\nHowever, Dr Levy does not\nagree totally with this because\nas he points out, the College can only accommodate 2 5 %\nof the total number of students\nin College residence . His suggestion, which has been\nput to the College, is to\ncharge a kitchen fee applicable\nto the whole of the IC community. This fee would\ncover the catering staffs\nwages thus leading to lower\nrefectory charges.\nMs Cowell in her report\nrefers to the barrage of\ncriticism levelled at the\ncatering staff. Their morale\nwas very low and they could benefit from a few months'\nbreathing space without\ncriticism. Dr Levy also expressed his great concern over this. \"It\nhas to be realised that they\n(the catering staff) are doing\na difficult job to the best of\ntheir ability\", he said.\n\"Members of the College\nshould remember that all the\ncriticisms they might make,\nsometimes in very forthright\nterms, do not help the catering\nstaff to do a better job\".\nAsked to comment on the\nreport, Ri z Shakir, ICU Deputy\nPresident and a member of\nthe Refectory Committee, said\" On the whole it was rather\ndisappointing and told us\nlittle that we did' not already\nknow. But then perhaps it\nwould be too much to expect\nfrom a few hours work\". NUS Travel\nAs from this week the NUS travel office in the Union Lower lounge will only be\nopen Mondays, Wednesdays,\nand Fridays. This is because Valerie has to go and work in the branch at Goldsmiths College on Tuesdays and\nThursdays due to a staff\nshortage.\nNUS to launch\nnewspaper\nTHEN US launches an eight-page tabloid newspaper called\" National Student\" on the\n16th February. National\nStudent of which 100,000\ncopies are being printed, will be distributed free to each of\nthe 750 student unions * in\nmembership of NUS. This will be the fourth\ntime that NUS has attempted\nto produce a national student\npublication \u2014 the other three\nwere Student, New Student and\nMagnus.\nNational Student which is to be published termly will be\nfreely accessible to all students and will cover\nstudent activity on a national\nbasis. The paper should\nhave a high news orientated\ncontent and it is hoped that\na large proportion of the material\nwill come from the staffs of\nnewspapers. In the long\nterm, NUS hope to expand\nthe service in the form of a weekly newspaper which would be purchased through\nnews agents.\nAt the recent Student Press Conference at Essex University, reservations were expressed\nby representatives of student\nnewspapers attending the\nconference. They feared that\nthe advertising revenue a college paper could accrue\nwould decline considerably\nas a result. This, it was contended, might force the\nclosure of some of the papers.\nHowever, the unification\nsuch a national publication could bring would be tremendous\nand none at the Conference\nwas opposed to the idea in principle.\nThe first major role that\nNation Student will play\nis that of informing all its readers of the national student\nstrike on Friday,27 th February\nin support of the grants claim. Trade union members teaching\nin colleges are expected to\ngive support to the strike.\nStudents on strike are being\nasked to come to London for\nwhat, it is hoped will be the biggest student demonstration ever mounted.\nThe demonstrators will assemble at 2.00pm in Belvedere Road, near Waterloo station,\nand will march to Hyde Park Corner. There they will be\naddressed by Charles Clarke, President of the National Union of Students, and prominent trade union leaders.\n\n"

I consider the rent levels\nthat are coming into effect\nas reasonable, and consistent\nwith the full student grant.\nThe increase in the middle of\nthe session is regret able and hopeful I/ will not be\nnecessary in the future.\nAs well as the increases in\nrent there are - 'n creased economy measures in the\nHalls particularly.\nIncreases in Tuition Fees The new levels of tuition\nfees for the session1976/7 were announced in December\nby the Secretary for Education,\nMr Fred Mulley. Fees for\nhome students are to be\nincreased from \u00a3140 to\n\u00a3182 and those for Overseas\nStudents are to go up by\n\u00a396 from \u00a3320 to \u00a3416 per\nannum. These' increases\nwill have no great effect\non the majority of students\nwhose fees are paid either\nby their Local Authority, or\nby their government, if they\nare from overseas. Those\nwho will be affected, some\nquite seriously are the home\nstudents who are on a minimum grant and have to\npay their own fees, and\nprivately sponsored overseas\nstudents. I believe that a hardship provision of some\ndescription will be made for\nmost continuing students\nand I will let you know what\nthese provisions are as soon\nas I can. Many overseas\nstudents will be forced to\nleave the country as a result,\nclaims the UK Council for\nOverseas Students. They\nalso say \" By its action the\nGovernment is making ability\nto pay the main criteria n for\naccepting students from\noverseas.\" I am sure that\nyou would agree that this\nshould not be so. I hope to\nwrite a longer article on\nthis topic soon.\nAre you satisfied with the\nUnion\n\u2022John. Downs publicised in\nFELIX last term that a Working Party has been set\nup to find ways in which\nthe Union could be made\nmore responsive to the needs\nof the membership. The\nWorking Party will be\npleased to receive any\ncomments that you may wish\nto make. Contact myself,\nJohn Downs, Rick Parker,\nPhysics PG or John Morgan,\nMining 2. If you want to\nmoan about the Union now is\nyour chance.\nNUS Conference - The\nStudent Road to Revolution\nI was pleasantly sup rise d at the light character of the\nNUS Annual Conference\nbut most disappointed at a great deal of the debate.\nFar too much time was spent\non discussing issues which\nI do not feel are crucial to\nthe body of students in this\ncountry. There will not be\nany world crashing changes\nif the NUS decides to support\nthe MPLA in Angola or not.\nOur national union, for we\nare all members, is definitely\npolitical at present and\nalmost all its policies are\nextremely left wing orientated.'\nI disagree with many of them,\nas I am sure a large number of\nthe people reading this\narticle do. The policies and\ncomposition of the Executive of the NUS are very difficult\nto change because of the\nNUS structure. \" Should we\nremain members of NUS?\" is a question which we should\nBe thinking about deeply\nand not hastily. More of this\ntopic later in the term.\nWishing you all an\nenjoyable and successful term.\nPete Available now in RESTRICTED NUMBERS at the f anti stic introductory price of \u00a33.00\nThe new\nImperial College London\n4 4\nSlop Shirt\"\ncolours\nRed\nGreen\nGold\nLight and Dark Blue\nsizes\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nExtra Large\nMarketed by 'Honest John' Enterprises\navailable from IC UnionOffice\ndinner times1.002.00 pm "

    "content": "FELIX\nReviews\nCinema\nThe Return of the Pink Panther ( U, United Artists). Directed by Blake\nEdwards; starring Peter Sellers,\nChristopher Plummer, Herbert Lorn and\nCatherine Schell.\nALTHOUGH SOME of the gags are\noverplayed and generally flogged to\ndeath the film is as funny as one could\nwish. The team seem to have enjoyed\nthemselves tremendously during the\nmaking of the film so much as that Ms\nSchell was unable to stop her self bursting\ninto laughter on a couple of occasions. Sellers gives another excellent\nperformance as the bumbling, inept\nClouseau who eventually drives his superior, Dreyfus (Herbert Lorn), to\ninsanity. Lorn is outstanding as Dreyfus\nand the scenes involving he and Sellers\nare some of the funniest I 've seen for ages Clouseau now a patrolman and recently\nsuspended by Dreyfus is reinstated and\nasked to recover the Pink Panther\ndiamond that has been stolen from the\nLug ash National Museum. He immediately\nmakes for the South of France to apprehend\nLitt on, alias The Panther (Christopher\nPlummer). Litton proclaiming innocence\nsets off for Lugash to catch the real\ncrook and hence clear himself.\nThe plot develope s and after much\nchasing to and fro all the protagonists\narrive in Gstaad where Litton catches-up\nwith the real thief (his wife); Clouseau catches up with Litton; all three are\ncaught up by Colonel Sharhi (Peter Arne),\nLug ash Secret Service who is mistakenly\nshot by Dreyfus in his attempt to kill Clouseau. Dreyfus is institutional is ed, Clouseau gets his job and Litton and wife return\nto their previous life of peace and\nquiet. One cannot finish a review of\nthis film without mentioning Richard\nWilliams' Pink Panther ami nations which\nare quite marvelously amusing to watch.\nTheatre\nHamlet At The Old Vic\n(National Theatre)\nThe usual reason for deciding to put\non a production of Hamlet is, I suppose,\nthat there is an actor whose time has\ncome. His stature as an actor is such\nthat Hamlet is the logical progression\nof his career. However, Hamlet Is a young man \u2014 it is surely his youth and\ninexperience that prevents Claudius from\nkilling him earlier \u2014 so that decision must\nnot be left too late.\nAlbert Finney is an actor whose time\nfor Hamlet has come, but it has also almost gone. He is too old a prince \u2014 he\ninjects the part with more experience of\nlife than it needs. He is also too impulsive;\nthis is the man who would leave the\nscheming to others and go for Claudius with both daggers drawn. His style of\nsoliloquy is that of Jimmy Porter and\nhis scenes with Ophelia bear similarity\nto those with Alison in ' Look Back in\nAnger\".\nPeter Hall's production itself is flat, literally. The stage is flat and\nLucky Lady ( A A, Fox-Rank). Directed\nby Stanley Donen; starring Gene\nHackman, Liza Minnelli and Burt\nReynolds.\nIT IS A PITY that director, Stanley\nDonen let sentimentality and the Hollywood\ncraze for 'happy endings' put what I can\nonly describe as a lousy ending to an\notherwise entertaining film full of warmth\nand character. The net result is of course\nto reduce what could have been a very\ngood film to an average seasonal-type\nthrow-up.\nHackman who plays Kibby, says that\nit was the most spontaneous and natural\nrole he' s ever played - it certainly\nlooked it!\nThe trio, Kibby, Clair e(Liza Minelli)\nand Walker (Burt Reynolds) team-up after\nHarry ( Claire' s husband) dies and using\nWalker's ketch ' Lucky Lady' run bootleg\nbooze into the United States. The ketch\nis sailed by Billy( Robby Benson of\n'Jeremy' fame) and together with the\nthree get-rich-quick adventurers soon\nfind that the bootlegging business is\nnot all fun and games, especially when\nyou do silly things like buy-up Mc Teague' s( played by John Hillerman) consignment\nof booze.\nHowever, they escape Mc Teague' s wrath for the time being having sold the\nbooze profitably set about spending it on\nthemselves and doing-up the boat. They\ncontinue their exploits until when the\nare ambushed by McTeague and his henchmen aboard the North Star.\nThe two heroes escape badly injured\nand after a long convalescence join\nforces with other 'independents' to try\nand stop Mc Teague who has been knocking\noff the small operators and stealing\ntheir cargo.\nIn a spectacular finish McTeague is\nblown-up and his cache of 50,000 cases of liquor divided up between the victors. Certainly a film with lots of gusto,\nsad and funny moments. Liza Minnelli is\ngood as Claire \u2014 she hams her way\nthrough with a carefree a bondone ment that is well matched by Hackman's portrayal of Kibby.\nPaul Ekpenyong\nin all but a few scenes the actors are\non their feet presenting a monotony of\nlevel and a lack of visual interest. It\nwas only when the stage was full of\ncharacters that things really came to\nlife \u2014 in the play scene, when Fortinbras\nrequests permission to cross Denmark\nand arrives on stage with his army, and\nthe final duel scene. Perhaps it is wrong\nto criticise Mr Hall for wishing to use\na single acting area for everything from\nthe intimacy of the Queen'sap partment to the expanse of a plain with an army, for\nit is by frequent changes of set that\ninterest can be lost; here the scenes led\ninto one another with almost indecent\nhaste.\nPolonius must be one of the director's greatest headaches in an uncut version\nof Hamlet. The part, as written, gives\ngreat scope for comedy but this all appears out of place in the circumstances\nof the whole play. Whereas the grave-diggers (who, incidentally make no\npretence of the fact that they are refugees\nfrom another National Theatre production\n\u2014 ' The Playboy of the Western World') are\nextraneous characters outside the\nmainstream of the plot, Polonius has a much more important role to play as father to Laertes and Ophelia. Roland\nCulver plays him with a multitude of\nfacial expression, drawing the comedy\nout too far. His children (Simon Ward\nMusic Zappa/Beefheart - Bongo Fury\n(Discreet)\nSir Alf, your opinion...\" Well Jimmy,\nFrank's bin kick inn' the poop pretty hot\nover the last few seasons an' gettin n' the results. Now Beefheart crashes in\nfrom behind an' knacker san v chance of\nprogressing. Who needs >im ... an' 'e won't take his baa ff with the lads\nafterwards\"... than kinn you, Sir Alf.\nAs pointed out by his eminence,\nUncle Frank Zappa has been makin n' mos\nwu nner full sounds of late, in the Form\nof \" over nile sensation\", \"apostrophe\"\n(containing the absolute classic track\n\"Nanook runs it\"), and \"one size fits all\"\n\u2014 his best moments to date with the\nexception of \"Hot ra/s\". All the ingredients\nhad been bought \u2014 explosive musical\ninvention, superbly zany hou m our, and\nunbeatable musicians playing the stuff.\nOnly Fz's warp-factor eight brain nodules\ncould have conceived such blur bed brilliance and put it out on vinyl. With this album, it's back to the mind-less, no-direction, self-indulgence of his earliest pressings. The cohesion has gone and the \" original Mr-out-of-sync.\"\n(Beefheart, that is) is back with his. pie in-the-stratosphere eye wash verbal ese. Out of the window goes the musicianship of impeccably and intricately played tunes,\nand in come the sloppy stumbling blues\njams that lesser musicians like Beefheart\nconstantly have to resort to \u2014 and Frank\ngoes along with it all, a great shame.\nHIC\nSadistic Mika Band - Hot! Menu\n(Harvest, EMI)\nGRAVITATING AROUND a funky base\nwhich is immediately discarded for a beautiful and melodic sound entitled\n'Mummy doesn't go to parties since\nDaddy died', SMB please and displease\nwith infuriating consistency. There is an abundance of borrowed\nideas proliferating the album. It is a pity that they are rarely put to good\neffect. A Latin-American influence\neven creeps in on the fourth track of side\none, 'Mada Mada Samba' which in English means Not Yet, Not Yet, Midwife.\nOn side two ' Okinawa'( Strange\nFish), an aptly named song, slides into\n'Style is changing'. In so far as it is\nfor the better, I wholeheartedly agree.\nThis is followed by a nice funky tune\nentitled ' Funky Mahjong' and is one\nof the better tracks.\nAh Well! All one can say is that\nwhoever thought of the title for this\nalbum must have just fallen out of a refrigerator in a drugged stupor.\nPaul Ekpenyong\nand Susan Fleetwood) are excellent\nthough mad scenes tended to set my\nteeth on edge as Miss Fleetwood sang\nharrison Birtwistle' s arrangements in a high soprano.\nFour hours, including only one\ninterval, is a long time to s it still in a theatre, even when you are captivated\nby the action on the stage. It is to be\nhoped that the seats in the new National\nTheatre will be more comfortable than\nthose at the Old Vic. Thomas Stevenson\n\n"
