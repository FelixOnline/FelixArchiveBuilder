St.\nMary's block vote, that is. 1 had\nheard rumours that it might\nnot be quite as tight this year,\nbut in the event, the dissenting\nmedics were but a handful. At first I simply\nthought \"what a bunch ol mindless sheep\", but\nrealised I was doing you a grave disservice. After\nall, you made up almost a third ol the voters,\nhighlighting a pathetic turnout at South\nKensington. You bothered to vote, which is more\nthan many of us did. Then I thought again: you\ndid not vote in your hundreds. At most, about\nhalf a dozen people voted at Mary's, namely the\nofficers of the Student Union, who persuaded\nyou to vote on their behalf Why did you?

Alter attempting to protect the already\npaltry fish quotas remaining to Britain, Irom\nplundering Spanish fisherman who registered\nhere in 1988, we now face the prospect of having to pay compensation of up to \u00a330 million to\nthem, when little or no money has been paid to\nour fishermen whose livelihoods have been\nmined. This cannot be tolerated.

The\nonly solution is to leave the CFP The UK should return a situation where we fish our waters,\ntaking account of demand and\npreservation of fish stocks. The\nEU has a lot to commend it -free trade within Europe is a great achievement\n- but the desire to regulate and harmon is e every\naspect of life has lead to crackpot systems like\nthe fisheries and agricultural policies that merely create massive bureaucracies, inefficiencies\nand injustice.

The\nEngland cricket team have crashed out of the\nWorld Cup in about as embarrassing a manner as\npossible after a pathetic performance against Sri\nLanka, who we should have beaten comfortably.\nHad it not been for three of our bowlers, the\nscore would barely have made three figures.

There commences a roller-coaster\nride lor Dr. Corbett around Manhattan and the\nNew York area in search of the truth.

We also get the ubiquitous car chase and stakeout in the dark garden\nof a mansion. More interestingly, we are pre-sem ted with the scheming of healthcare companies and the secret \"Round table\" they establish\nto \"save themselves money\".

FELIX WEDNESDAY MARCH 20TH1996 NEWS\nElectronic cash made for our\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nThe college and ICU are looking\ninto the practicalities of introducing a combined swipe, ICU, library and bank linked credit\ntransfer card.\nThe smart card technology on\nwhich the system is based was\ndeveloped in France in the early\neighties and is now extensively\nused in several European and Far\nEastern countries. Throughout\nSingapore, schools and companies use the cards to pay for food\nin refectories and as a means of\nidentification, but it has not broken into the mainstream as it has\nin France, where each phone card has a chip built in.\nSome Oxbridge colleges\nalready work with the system,\nbilling students annually for the\ngoods and services they purchase.\nMondex - a pioneer of the technology in this country \u2014 has\nalready started a pilot project in\nSwindon, with 10,000 people\nand 75% of the retailers taking\npart. Credit transfer is effected\nby charging the card with credit,\neither by swiping through a phone, with Mondex debiting\nyour account for the sum, or via\ncash machines. The card also\ncomes with a key-ring credit\nreader to keep track of card bal-ances.\nThe system can be introduced rapidly by printing library\nbar codes and adding magnetic\nstripes to the card, allowing exist-ing- systems to be phased out\ngradually.\nThough free in the pilots, the\ncard is expected to cost users\nabout a pound a month to maintain once properly introduced.\nSuch costs are expected to be\nmet by College through savings in\ncash handling (counting and\ntransporting monies) and by cuts\nin the current cards' administration costs. The feasibility of all\nthis will be explored in meetings\nbetween College, the Union, and\nMondex.\nThe issue was raised at the\nStudent Representative Council\nmeeting of March 12th when the\nproblems with the previous\nattempts at introducing a combined swipe-union card were dis-cussed. The main points raised\nwere that students had difficulty\nconvincing other unions to accept\nthe card as a union card and that\nthere could be a recurrence of\nthe problems with voting that\noccurred last year. In addition\nthere could be problems where\nstudents do not have accounts\nwith the designated banks and\nany loss of a card will entail a long\nwait for a replacement and loss of\nall credit on the card.\nThese were answered by\nMatthew Crompton, Deputy\nPresident for Finance and\nServices, who said that ideas such\nas having printing on both sides\nwith prominent ICU wording\nand symbols on one side, and a dedicated voting chip would be\nexplored with Mondex and\nCollege in meetings. He went on\nto explain that the possibility of\nlinks to other cash machine systems were being explored, and\nadded that the loss of credit with\nthe cards could not be stopped\nand was equivalent to anyone losing cash or their wallet.\nRichard Wilson pushes out Johnny\nBall to be new Rector of Glasgow\nBY ROBIN RILEY\nOn the 24th of April, the actor\nRichard Wilson will begin a three\nyear term of office as the new\nLord Rector of Glasgow University, following his election by\nstudents last week.\nStar of the BBC's \"One Foot\nin the Grave,\" Mr Wilson was\nelected at the third count, beating the previous Rector, lecturer\nand television presenter Johnny\nBall, by 1912 votes to 1483. At\nGlasgow University the rector is\nlargely a figure head, in a position\nnominally below the Chancellor\nand above the Principal in the\nUniversity's hierarchy. The\nRector has the option of chairing\nthe meetings of Glasgow\nUniversity Court, a student-staff\nbody, but Johnny Ball is the only\nRector in the last two decades to\nhave exercised this right.\nBefore the voting on\nFebruary 28th, opinion polls suggested that Johnny Ball would\nretain the position by a considerable margin. The defeat came as a shock to Mr Ball who, far from\nhis usual effervescent self, was\nquoted shortly afterwards as saying \"I am not some bleeding\nactor... I 've been the most effective Rector in 540 years. I have\nworked and worked, and I am sad\nnot to be given a chance to carry\non. I am bitterly disappointed.\nGutted.\" He also expressed concerns regarding the overt left-wing political affiliation of\nRichard Wilson, whose campaign\nwas organised by Glasgow University's Labour club.\nMeanwhile, the jubilant Mr Wilson was bubbling between\nswigs from a celebratory bottle of\nchampagne, most unlike his\nVictor Meldrew alter-ego:\n\"Although I said I was quietly\nconfident of winning, I wasn't really. I am absolutely delighted.\"\nThe other two other candidates congratulated Mr Wilson\non the result. Dorothy GraceElder, a journalist and Scottish\nNational Party affiliate, came\nthird with 446 votes while\nProfessor Al-Mass'ari, a Saudi\ndissident seeking asylum in the\nUK came last, gaining a respectable 280 votes with his\nhigh-profile \"Mass'ari Must Stay\"\ncampaign.\nIn spite of a pre-election poll\nwhich revealed that only 19% of\nGlasgow students could name all\nfour candidates, the overall\nturnout for the Rectorial elections was a huge 52%. However,\nthe turnout for Glasgow's sabbatical elections, held last Monday,\nwas only 6.8%, putting Imperial's supposedly apathetic 8% turnout\nin a more favourable light.\nIt would seem that the election of a celebrity figurehead\ndoesn't encourage students to\ntake any deeper interest in the\naffairs of their University.\n\n"

FELIX WEDNESDAY MARCH 20TH1996 DIARY\nIC Symphony Orchestra Spring Concert\nAristocrats and Plebeians:\nCopland Fanfare for the Common Man\nWalton Violin Concerto\nTchaikovsky Symphony No.6 in B minor\nFriday March 8th,1996 Word is getting around! Even with the\nextra seating, there was a capacity\naudience lor what turned out to be a remarkable evening. This was heralded by Copland's Fanfare for Brass and\nPercussion of 1942, which immediately established the precision and\nflair of these sections and set the standard for what was to follow.\nAll three composers were crucially influenced and supported by older\nwomen with strong personalities.\nCopland was inspired by his Parisian\ncomposition teacher, Nadia Boulanger, who he found \"ex hil arat ing\" (and who captivated those of us\nwho saw and heard her at the RCM a few years ago). Walton was supported\nby Viscountess Wimborne, who lived\nin Wimborne House at this end of Piccadilly.\nTchaikovsky's muse was Madam Nadezhda\nvon Meek, who gave lavish financial support\nfor I5 years and then broke off the passionate\nbut entirely platonic (they never met!) relationship in such a way as to affect him pro-found ly. The Walton violin concerto expresses his\nfeelings for Alice Wimborne, who took him to\nRavello, near Naples, to aid his convalescence\nfrom surgery and to encourage him, rather\nforcefully, to write the piece. After many\nwartime tribulations it was given its English\npremiere two years later in 1941, at the\nAlbert Hall. David Juritz, the leader of the\nLondon Mozart Players, is an ideal soloist for\nthis piece. His unassuming manner and powerful playing match the relaxed opening,\nwhich gives no hint of what is to follow, and\nthe developing brilliant display which was\ndesigned to stretch the abilities of Heifetz in\nall three movements. Throughout, the sense\nof romance and Italian provenance are un mistake able. This is Walton at his very best.\nParticularly memorable in this performance\nwere the melting ly beautiful sounds from the\nwoodwinds.\nTchaikovsky's \"Pa'the ti que\" symphony\ntook us to another emotional extreme. Given\nwhat follows, the middle movements exemplify Auden's remark that \"Music is the\nbrandy of the damned\". Walton's brandy\nis for enjoyment, but here we really need\nit to get through the last movement. It\nwas the turn of the strings for prominence, and their playing, in both intonation and attack, and better than ever\nbefore, took us to the brink of the abyss.\nThe music stopped; there was a long\npause, followed by a gasp of appreciation\nand then grateful applause.\nNine days after the first performance,\nTchaikovsky died, probably not as a suicide as has been claimed, but by contracting cholera by drinking un boiled water. Evidence from the Tchaikovsky\nMuseum in Russia (which only became\navailable in the last year or so) seems to\n\u2022 - be conclusive on this point.\nIf performances like these can be produced with current facilities, we can look forward very eagerly to the future endeavours of\nmaster blender Richard Dickins, when the\nmusic distillery which is to be built above the\ncollege library, as announced by the Rector at\nCommemoration Day last term, becomes\navailable.\nCANTERBURY BUSINESS SCHOOL One year Master of\nBusiness Studiesthe bridge between university\nand a better career\nIf you're graduating this summer, you probably know already how tough the\njob market can be.

    "content": "A telescope on the web\nSabine Louet\nWe live in the age of the Hubble Space\nTelescope, of orbiting observatories\nand Very Large Arrays. The cost of\nstar gazing is truly astronomical. But a British\ngroup has set up a telescope that brings these big\nboys' toys within everyone's reach.\nThe Bradford Robotic Telescope is a modem 46cm telescope sitting on a hilltop in the\nYorkshire Dales. It can be accessed through the\nworld wide web, making it available to millions\nof people. What makes this telescope unusual is\nthat it does everything itself. It checks that it is\nnot raining or cloudy. It checks that nobody is\nsnooping around the site and most important of\nall, it knows when it gets dark!\nThe telescope is a prototype built by the\nEngineering In Astronomy (EIA) group within\nthe University of Bradford's Department of\nIndustrial Technology. \"The site is designed to be\nused by lots of different people\", says Dr John\nBaruch, of the EIA group. The group hope to\nmake access to the telescope as open as possible.\nThey are already working with a number of\nschools who can use the telescope as a learning\naid. Ultimately, they would like to see a network\nwith telescopes in Tenerife, Japan and Australia.\nand a car that tells you\nwhere to go...\nAndrew Lloyd\nT he Cybergeneration is about to bring\nadvanced technology to driving. In\nBritain, two hardware companies, Bosch\nand Philips, will launch versions of a computer\nguidance system this summer. Meanwhile,\nPsychologist Paul Jackson, of the University of\nLondon Centre for Transport Studies has been\nexamining individual responses to guidance in\norder to improve existing devices.\nIn the British system directions are stored\non a simple CD Rom containing maps of every\nbig city in the country. The onboard computer tells you where\nyou are and asks you where you XI want to go. Simultaneously, the 28 orbiting\nUS military satellites constantly update and\npinpoint your position on the computer\nmap. The system then guides you directly to\nyour final destination, saving you time and\npetrol. In order to focus the driver's attention on the road and not the screen, an electronic voice gives the directions.\nAiming a guidance message at the driver requires more than advanced techno lo gy, it also needs an understanding of individual responses to information. Paul Jackson\nconcentrated his research on the way people\nreact, depending on their age, gender and\ndriving ability. Contrary to popular beliefs, gender is not important. Neither sex showed a better ability to find their bearings. Surprisingly,\nwhen it comes to navigation, age counts for more\nthan experience. Young women drivers fare better than older, yet more experienced, male dr i vers.\nResearch is now focussing on whether certain messages have more impact on us than o th ers. For instance, the order of presentation\nchanges people's response to the guidance s ys tem. Hence if the voice tells you \"at the garage,\nturn right\", it might prove more efficient than\n\"turn right at the garage\".\nUsing the telescope is free, once on-line you\njust have to spend two minutes registering with\nthe computer to get a password. You can then\ntell the telescope what you want to look at, and\nsit back and wait lor the results. It automatically\nstores each request, and when conditions are\ngood, it carries out as many observations as it can.\nWhen it has taken the picture you asked for, it\nsends you an E mail message inviting you to look\nat the results. In good weather, this could be the\nnext morning.\nWith the less than perfect Yorkshire we a th er, there is often only a short time each night for\nobservations. Nevertheless, the reward for perseverance can be some spectacular images.\nIndeed, on a recent visit with a BBC film crew,\nSir Patrick Moore was moved to say, \"It was just\nwhat I expected, only 50 times better.\"\nThe site is fairly unique on the Internet. \"It\nis the only one with an autonomous robot and\nthe only one where you can request astronomical observations,\" says Dr Baruch.\nIf you have access to the world wide web\nyou can find the telescope at http://www.tele-scope.org - and be that rare breed of astronomer,\none with their nights free for other pursuits.\nevents going on all over the country, here are a March, please rit jg for times01717' M7S0 S Venue Imperial college\nIMpMMMrX'rl '''V'777.77y: if ei\">.,7777&> yy!\"7 v v77r,y y..r b;f7'/7.7.&^ K:it W l'\\ '\u2022kiM iv77'y?; K.:y/ y777\\77777.777777:::% fj|\n7 7 7 7 7 7 >'7777''/!\": Vy Xs X^';:';7'7::.':y;;: s37::':v; K''':: \u2022<;\u2022'\n7 : . 7' \u2022 \u2022yy\nt MAy;i:M^ pPi'''< v.7::7:,;];7;a^77';| \u2022 : 7 7 H w v,:/.:y;7; ll f^i7 j;~.; yyyy6. yy.7 f7m i p}p&[p: y: hM x::.7:7l;7::7:.:! j:7;7 yo xM Jp pix M7777;,.77'k^ pppp iv;-;:\n'.-.'7':\n7''.!y,;:;U>\"/:7' f7y fe7:\\:'.:':y777:7 i[ \u2022:\u2022 y'''''y'', rw..: X7:\".] y:y x:X' r my T w0y::^!/ J::p fr: K^.r;:K i%;77|77i7.'..:;: y;>;; f77.777:',:ri Y:'7'., v X:''7,7. \u2022 '\u2022 -777i;:777:' \u2022<---:\":\u2022 7 7 7 - yy;77:7 M: \u00a3 $ M';77\". \u2022'\n!;,.''.;<;7 7y[,.: \u2022:: p.,'\"'777:;.:::;7!7?7777ye G77.=\"\". \u2022\u2022rmS P K,77y7 c#l*:7 v.77%J|| \u2122 \u2022\nKteie ; M7M v777y,; yy.

Not in the same way that\nthey have been waiting for hyped film adaptations of Scottish novels perhaps (have you spotted that train?), but with the general hope that\nthis would be the film that sees one of\nHollywood's famous actors return to the sort of\nrole which he's made for. Thankfully, Steve\nMartin has done just that - he's no longer trying\nto be soppy and paternal; he's just being funny.\nAnd yes, Sgt. Bilko is fon ny. At least it is if you\nlike the sort of humour displayed in Police\nAcademy before they started recycling gags in\nthe vain hope that only amnesiacs were watch-ing.\nSteve Martin plays Sgt. Bilko (surprise, sur-pri se),a man who can smell money like a shark\ncan smell blood and who runs a million and one\nillegal gambling ventures at the army camp\nwhilst pretending to be head of mechanics. This\nis about as inventive as the story gets. The tale is\na familiar one, of a corrupt-but-lovable hero\nfighting to keep the camp open despite the\nefforts of an equally corm pt but-not-half-as lovable past adversary, with a sub-plot involving an\nhonest rookie who joins Bilko's division but predictably ends up as dishonest as the rest of the\npeople there. No, it's not very original but then\nthis is not the sort of film you go to see for an\nintricate plot and message. The emphasis is firmly on the gags, both visual and oral, with some\nparticularly hilarious ones which make light of\n\u2022the homosexuals in the army' issue.\nAll in all, Sgt. Bilko is a welcome, if not spec-t acul ar, return to form for Steve Martin. It's amusing and a pleasant way to pass an evening,\nalthough it lacks that certain je ne sais quoi that\nwould make it a great film. I suppose if I were\ndoing a music review, as I'm accustomed, I'd give\nit a(7), but I'm not so you'll just have to imagine\n\n"

Y10\nplay - dead awake nui oia Describing this production, the word\n'surreal' springs to mind immediately,\nclosely followed by 'fresh', 'innovative'\nand 'entertaining'; Ibsen is well known\nfor his often very strange style. The\nLondon-Irish playwright, innovator and\nfounder of the Praxis theatre laboratory\nSam Dowling has successfully liberated\nthis play from time and place to make it\ntm ly universal.\nIn the intimate surroundings of the\nNorth Pole Theatre in Greenwich - possibly the smallest acting space I 've ever\nseen - the audience cannot help but feel\ninvolved, especially since the set is continually being painted during the performance. Right from the start a barrage of\ncomplex ideas is fired from the\nNorwegian playwright's mind as Rubeck,\nan artist, faces crisis in his failing marriage\nand the return of his former lover and\nmodel Irene. His wife, Nadia, is drawn\ninto the arms of the bear-hunter while\nthe constant presence of the shadow - a silent woman dressed in strange black garb is distinctly unnerving.\nDead Awaken is often described as a problem play because if a cast tries too hard to understand its deeper meaning they limit themselves\nto portraying only their interpretation. This com-p any, however, work without a director and are\ncontinually changing and improving the performance, leaving it up to the audience to figure it\nout. The play is about an hour long, which is\nabout as much as the average sane person can\nabsorb, and provides plenty of time to sample\nthe wares of the bar downstairs and argue over\nwhy on earth there was a tin bath in the centre\nof the stage.\nIn his first article for a fortnightly review in\n1900, a young James Joyce described the play as\nIbsen's best, but it's not often seen. Discover art,\nlife, idealism, young love, bitterness and the\nmeaning of life - it's all there.\nplay - serving it up, \u2122\nSet in an urban wasteland somewhere in the East\nEnd of London, David Eldridge's play 'Serving It\nUp' is an in-yer-face tragicomedy dripping hilarity and pathos in equal proportions. Sharp social\ncaricatures\nare depicted\nwhere the\nslags, the\n(new] lads\nand the parents melt into\none dystopian\nand dysfunctional mess.\nSmart, streetwise banter\nricochets around the\nconfines of\nthis compact\ntheatre; the\ndialogue occasionally scratching the surface of some deeper\nrealities.\nEssentially it is a story about the boredom\nand frustration of the underclass; the disaffected,\nthe disenchanted and the disillusioned. Their\nescape comes in many forms. Val, the bored\nmother, has an affair with the best friend of her\nson, while Sonny (funnily enough the son) spirals\nout ol control through anger and violence. He\ndevelops an overt nationalistic pride - which\nembodies itself in some\nrampant racism. The\nacting is top\nnotch; the cast\nfilling out their\nlimited roles\nto the fullest\nextent p ossi ble, though\nadmittedly\nnone had any\nreal presence.\nThe set was\none of minimalist realism:\nconcrete and\nsteel bars, while the occasional snatches of music\nwere interlinked with the script and varied from\nThe Who to Supergrass. This is emotionally\nexciting fringe at its best.\n\n"

FELIX WEDNESDAY MARCH 20TH1996 NEWS REVIEW\nNews Review of Spring 1996:\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nFelix 1045\nDecember's Tory budget cuts of\n\u00a32m were followed by madness\nof a different kind, though this\ntime the news was better.\nFollowing new research, scientists at St Mary's were hopeful\nthat mad cow disease (BSE)\ncouldn't cross the species barr i er' into humans. Progress on the\nBMS building appeared to have\nstalled, still awaiting permission.\nThe RCS II building continued to\n?\nill8 lillE stand defiantly in the way ol the\nnew BMS block, with College's position on the issue unclear.\nClarity was also absent in\nTime Out magazine, already having shot uncomfortably to lame\nover IC's alleged drink-problem,\nwere now making allegations ol\nnuclear waste emissions from the\nBiology department in Beit.\nAgain, the college position was\nunclear.\nAny clarity that then' may\nmay been in Da Vinci's was to be\nremoved, alter its free newspaper\nservice was withdrawn. \" A minority continue to abuse it,\nstealing papers, tearing them up\nand generally trashing them,\" the\nbar staff complain e il. Felix 1046\nMore theft, tearing up and\ntrashing seemed to be in the\noffing... Progress on the BMS building appeared to have\nstalled (again): the medics continued to campaign for more\nsocial space in the new building,\nat one stage even suggesting\nthat ICU make representations\nto the local council, to try to\nblock the BMS planning bid.\nThe R CSU had also been\nsomewhat vexed by the BMS,\nworried about their proposed\nmove to Civil Engineering, having already been shunted out of\nold Chemistry into Biology.\nTheir president, Mo Dulloo,\nsaid, \"we'll move again, but my\nconcern is that we have a working office,\" annoyed at IC's apparent predilection with blue\nsignage rather than student\nneeds.\nTheft manifested itself in\nthe form of computers disappearing from Mech Eng\nComputer centre, student property d is a ppe ring from halls and\nmoney disappearing from universities nationwide, due to the\nround of government cuts.\nEmily Baldock, Durham SU president, was called for a day\nof student action to oppose any\nintroduction of top-up fees. At\na staff level, the cuts were akin\nto the closure of 7 universities\nor the loss of 6500 lecturers'\njobs, according to the, AUT. Pushing for pay increases, \"If\nthis...is not forthcoming then\nwe will not take it lying down,\"\nsaid Tom Wilson, their General\nSecretary. They weren't alone:\nSimilarly skin t was IC Rag, having earned less than a fifth of\nlast year's total.\nFelix 1047\nIn an attempt to get things\nstraight, or at least less twisted\nthan before, the Medics claim\nthat they'd be unfairly represented in the last issue; the BMS\naction group had decided to not\nattempt to block the application,\nbut instead called for a cross-campus discussion of student\nfacilities. They insisted that proposed social space for the building had been more than halved,\nnot merely reduced by around a quarter, as suggested by the\nestates department. Discussions\nthen took place about student\nsocial space, with which Sarah\nWhite said she was \"very\npleased.\" Meanwhile, progress on\nthe building appeared to have\nstalled (once more) as the planning application failed to be considered anyway. The BMS, not\nmerely content with harassing\nthe RCSU, broadened their horizons by giving the C&GC U hassle with their hovercraft.\nSmiles were also in evidence\nas it seemed likely that IC, with\nits links with industry, could benefit from a new funding formula,\nthough other universities would-n't been quite as lucky. The\nAldwych Group, also concerned\nwith the state of university fund-ing, sent an open letter to the\nCVC P stressing its opposition to\nthe introduction of top-up fees.\nOddly, the usually vociferous\nNUS was quiet on the matter.\nThe ICU front doormat, whose\ntheft last term had flung ICU( and certainly Sarah White) into\nan uncomfortable spotlight, as\nwell as a security photo, had\nreappeared in Royal Holloway\nCollege Union.\nFelix 1048\nThe Government, unusually in\nagreement with ICU, opposed\ntop-up fees; the CVC P wanted\nto claw back its losses some-how; HE FCE said that universities could admit fewer students\nif they needed to. Ideas mooted\nby the CVC P included the\nintroduction of a one-off signing on fee, or an annual top-up\nfee proper. Many were uni m pressed, Professor Alan\nSwanson telling the Academic\nAffairs Half Day that having to\nmake such decisions amounted\nto the Government \"getting\nother people to do their dirty\nwork.\"\nProgress on the BMS building appeared to... well, guess.\nOn a more regional scale, more\ncuts were sustained when it was\nannounced that Fire Service\ncover for South Ken was being\nreduced. College's signage\npredilection took a new twist\nwhen a newly installed placard\non the walkway announced the\narrival of the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany, while the Saga Of The Rug continued after Sarah\nWhite and Matt Crompton\nphoned RH CU to re tre ive the\nerrant carpet only to hear that it\nhad vanished again. Sarah was\nsaid to unimpressed with their\nattitude, saying it was irresponsible to leave a \u00a3250 item just\nlying around outside an office.\nAs opposed to leaving it just\nlying around outside a Union\nlobby, perhaps...?\nFelix 1049\nAs if the Government couldn't worsen HE funding, a Tory think-tank proposed to do just that,\nthis time targeting student\nfinance. They suggested the abolition of government grants in\norder to partly compensate for\n\n"

It has also been remixed by the\nsaid producers who have thankfully cut out any of\nthe original vocals and really done their best to\nmake this the after hours anthem alluded to in the\ntitle.\nCocteau Twins are next with one of their\n\"impossible to comprehend lyrics\" tracks which\nusually annoy but this one is really quite pretty.\nThen there is Audio Deluxe with a very jolly, summery piece. Some people could even be excused\nfor describing the tinkling bells which ran along in\nthe background throughout as being quite blissful.\nThis is followed by Warp 69's mellow, shu f fly jazz sound, remixed to an unknown extent by\nGlobal Communications. And talking of the\nAphex Twin we come to possibly the best track\non this tape which is Mr James' remixed to fuck\nversion of St Etienne's \"Who do you think you\nare\". Lots of scratchy bass and the merest snippets\nof sampled vocals. Very nice.\nWe get a predictable Oakenfold remix of\nIzit's \"Stories\", a track by some people called\nInnocence and then there is the interesting combination of an L. F.O. remix Art of Noise\n\"Crusoe\". Still recognisable, with agent ie break-beat. Yep, quite probably an anthem by now, in\none form or another. The Ballistic Brothers (vs.\nAccentric Alios) keep on with the jazzy, breakbeat sound though by the end of it you are ready\nfor something a bit different...

It was an IC final\nfor the under-78kg category\nbetween Steffen Fredersdorf and\nHrvoje Jasak, with Hrvoje Jasak\ntaking the Gold.\nOyvinc Eikeland (under-78kg), Christophe Carrere\n(under-71kg) and Apostolis\nGalantis (under-86kg) unfortunately lost their rep e chages for\nbronze medals.\nThe under-65kg competition\nhad valiant efforts from Chris\nLeach , Richard Tompkins (IC)\nPHOTO: CHRIS LEACH and Richard Webster (UCL)\nagainst the better skilled black\nbelts.\nOn the second day, the five-man and ten-man team events\nwere fought.\nThe five man team,\nApostolis Galantis (of UCL), and\nOyvine Eikeland, Hrvoje Jasak,\nSteffen Fredersdorf and\nChristophe Carrere (all IC), won\nconvincingly against Cambridge\nin the finals, winning gold for the\nfirst time in six years.\nFor the second year running\nthe UL U team consisted mostly\nof IC players (all 5 last year and\n4 out of 5 this year), which\nserves as a good measure of the\nquality of Judo at IC.\nRUGBY\nVIRGINS035 CHAMPAGNE UNIVERSITY VIRGINS020 UMD S FOOTBALL\nI CW AFC II 4 - 0 UCH WATERPOLO\nIC IN LAST PLACE To Hull\nAnd\nBlack\nAt the Annual British Universities Snooker Championships,\nImperial's A' Team boy opened\nwell with a100 thrashing of\nloudly supported Loughborough,\nand proceeded snugly through\nthe early group stage, then beating Leeds and home-team Hull\nto reach the quarter finals.\nThere they tragically fell\nfoul of the luck of the Irish, in\nthe form of mighty Ulster who\nachieved their second-best ever\nresult in the championships.\nThe 'B' team also beat\nhost's Hull in their early group,\nwith a crunch last-ball win in\ntheir final match seeing them\nthrough the round. They also-succumbed to the Irish, losing to\nno.l seeds Queen's in the quarters, for their best ever result.\nDead In\nThe Water\nThe IC Polo-canoe team outdid\nthemselves this year by being\nplaced dead last in the recent\nUniversity of London Union\ntournament (on a par with last\nyear's performance)\nOur team; well there was\nPaul who stunned the audience\nwith his incompetence in goal,\nand Garth, who attracted all\neyes with his nude-look\nswimwear. Tasmin baffled\neveryone by spending half the\nmatch upside down. ShitCliffe\nlived up to his name, and Mattwell, at least he knew the rules.\nSo now we look forward to\nnext year when we can be beaten again.\nNo Breakthrough For\nVirgins In\nULCup\nFinal\nVIRGIN 0 - 20 UMDS\nThe score line does not reflect\nthe Virgin's domination of the\nmatch until well into the second\nhalf, and with Guy's up only 5-0\nat half time, Imperial were still\nconfident that they could still\nwin the UL Cup.\nThe IC forwards outclassed\nthe medics, with both Adele and\nLyndsey playing exceptionally\nwell. Guys' advantage lay in the\nalertness and speed of their half\nbacks, only kept at bay by the\nexcellent tackling of the IC\nbacks.\nThe previous Sunday saw\nthe Virgins take another beating,\nthis time at the hands of\nAmerican tourists from the\nChampagne University, Illinois.\nThe visitors gave the Virgins an\nexcellent game, playing superb\ntechnical rugby.\nAs ever, IC's forwards\nplayed extremely well, though\nweakness in organisation was\nhighlighted by impeccable ruc k ing and mauling from the opposition. The IC backs were confident and aggressive in attack,\nthough this confidence was sadly\nlacking in defence. In the end,\nIC were well beaten by a superior side.\nAll the Virgins would like to\nwish the girls who are leaving\nthis year all the best for the\nfuture; you will certainly he\nmissed.\nIC Athletics Clubs Committee is\nsponsored by\nLAYERS "

This might have\nstretched the band's talents beyond their capabilities, but fortunately they have coped exceptionally well and whilst 'Lovelife' doesn't offer anything new, it is an excellent album.\nThe girl's lad dish reputation is reinforced on\ntracks such as 'Ladykillers' (the latest single),\nwhere Miki attacks those men who try to use the\nthin pretence of having a politically correct attitude towards women to their advantage when\ntrying to cop off - telling them 'I don't need your\npracticed lines / your school of charm mentality'.\nSimilarity, 'Childcatcher' finds her berating those\nwho can't cope with women with opinions of\ntheir own - 'You just want a daughter without the\nwife / You don't need a girlfriend you need a life'.\nA number of the songs are concerned with a need\nto be popular, glamourous and loved.\nApart from 'Single Girl', the majority of\nthese are ballads, such as the excellent 'Olympia',\nwith emotive strings and horns being used to good\neffect, producing a song that wouldn't be out of\nplace on a60's film soundtrack. Only once (on\n'Papasan') is both the listener's patience and the\nband's vocal ability tested. Even Jarvis Cocker gets\na look in, on the duet 'Ciao', a tongue-in-cheek\nlook at the aftermath of a broken relationship.\nAlbums of this quality don't come along very\noften, make sure you don't miss out.

FELIX WEDNESDAY MARCH 20TH1996 NEWS\nPhotographic exhibition cut short\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nThe IC Photographic Society\nhave complained that pictures\ndisplayed in the Consort gallery\nhave been damaged by college\ntechnical staff, who took them\ndown because the room had been\ndouble-booked. The exhibition\nhad to be taken down premature-ly, after it was discovered at the\nlast minute that it clashed with\nplans for the BAYS events of last\nweek.\nThe organisers of the display\nwere given less than 24 hours'\nnotice that their exhibition,\nwhich had been booked until the\nend of term, had to be removed.\nAs members of the society were\nunavailable, IC staff removed the\nphotographs themselves early on\nThursday morning. The photographic society chairman, Neil\nChadbornc, told Felix that the\npictures had been stacked up in\ntwo large piles in a cupboard:\n\"one frame has a large chip missing and I'm sure the photos at the\nbottom of the pile must be damaged because of the weight.\"\nHe was also upset that the\ndisplay had been taken down\nbefore the end of term. The society had booked a professional\nphotographer to come and view\nthe exhibition on Thursday\nevening.\nAnne Kemp, the conference\ncentre manager, said that the\ndouble-booking was an 'un for tu nate' consequence of a 'break-down in communication'. \"I feel\nwe've let them down badly\nbecause we didn't know about\nit,\" she said. She explained that\nrooms are not 'booked off on\ntheir computer system if the\nevent is an exhibition which will\nenable the rest of the room to be\nused. The organisers of the BAYS\nexhibition needed to put posters\non the walls as well as using the\nroom itself.\nMs Kemp insisted that it was\nthe first time that there had been\na problem with double-booking\nevents. \"Things like this have to\nhappen so we can learn and make\nimprovements for the future,\"\nshe said. She expressed surprise\nthat the students had complained\nthat pictures had been damaged.\nDefending the conference centre\ntechnician who supervised the\nexhibition's removal, himself a nart enthusiast, she insisted that\n\"you could not beat Ned for per-fec tion.\" PHOTO: NEIL CHAD BORNE RCS Union elections score poorly\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nUnbeknownst to many, the Royal\nCollege of Science Union elections took place last Wednesday\nwith one of the smallest turnouts\nfor years.\nThe RCSU held a bar-night-cum-hustings in the traditional\nbar the evening before the elections, with a promising attendance by current students, but\nthis failed to translate into a high\nturnout on polling day. The number of people voting was even\nlower than that for the City and\nGuilds Union elections a few\nweeks previously, confirming\nallegations that students are suffering from 'ballot fatigue'.\nMo Dulloo and Chris Bragg,\ncurrent incumbents of R CSU posts, both won another year in\ntheir offices of President and\nHonourary Junior Treasurer\n{HIT}. Karl Condron will be the\nnew Vice-President, Rob Park\nwill be Honourary Secretary, and\nSamantha Baker the new\nAcademic Affairs Officer.\nConcerns were expressed in\nthe preamble to the elections\nafter confusion about nominees\nand a very poor turnout at the\noriginal hustings on the 5th of\nMarch. Further problems arose\nwhen some candidates' names\nwere put on nomination papers\nwithout their knowledge. The\nelections themselves then had to\nbe postponed when candidates\nmanifestoes didn't appear in the\nR CSU publication Broadsheet in\ntime. Voting had originally been\nplanned for Monday and\nTuesday, but in fact ballot boxes\nwere only open for a single day\nlast Wednesday.\nThe office of the presidency\nwas initially contested, but when\nMo's intention to re-stand\nbecame apparent the others\nwithdrew in his favour, one opting to run for VP instead. Seven\ncandidates stood for the posts in\nthe end, but three of the five\noffices were uncontested. The\nnumber of people voting reached\nabout 150 which corresponds to\naround 6% of the electorate.\nThe presidential incumbent,\nMo Dulloo, re-stood pledging to\n\"...get rid of the insular nature\"\nof the organisation and to lay the\nfoundations for a strengthened\nUnion which could stand on a par\nwith the Medics in 1998.\nChris Bragg, HJT, promised\nmore active, powerful lobbying\nfor Imperial College Union\nfunds, and Rob Park has said that\nhe wants to expand the role of his\noffice beyond it's current remit.\nHe plans to oversee and coordinate the Constituent College\nUnion's internal affairs to facilitating more student involvement\nand lobbying to create more\nR CSU clubs and societies.\nKarl Condron aims to resurrect student interest in mascot ry as Vice President, and Samantha\nBaker will work to improve communication at the student-a cade mic representative level and\nensure that R CSU students are\nnot 'sidelined' with the arrival of\nSt Mary's on the South\nKensington campus in 1998.\n\n"

The ban was imposed on the\nrowing club after it apparently\nnamed an ineligible oarsman for\nthe race. The college rowing club\nmatched Cambridge University\nover two set-piece rows in the\nTideway.\nA spokesperson for the\norganisers said \"I cannot see the\npossibility of Imperial College\ncrews competing in the event at\nthe moment. I feel wretched\nabout it.\" The organising committee found irregularities in the status points of the seven college\ncrews and has suggested the total\nwithdrawal of the entry.\nSteve Ellis, College's chief\ncoach, admitted that a mistake\nhad been made, but commented\nthat \"the punishment does not fit\nthe crime.\"\nMeanwhile, the College is\nredesigning the boat house development plan after the original\nplans were rejected by the\nWandsworth Council planning\ncommittee as too 'bulky'.\nAnother objection, that the\nplanned extension was too close\nto nearby residential homes, has\nalso forced a rethink by College\nplanners.\nThe College is presently in\nthe process of redesigning the relevant parts of the complex, primarily to overcome these two\nobjections. Frank Murray, Sports\nand Leisure Manager, told Felix\nthat \"we are trying to redesign\nthe complex with minimal reduction in facilities.\"\nHe continued, \"We will\nmeet with Wandsworth Council\nin the near future to discuss our\nrevised plans. I am hopeful as\nwell as optimistic about the\nchances of it being granted.\"\nBY IVAN CHAN\nThe British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science Youth\nSection held its third annual\nBAYS day exhibition at Imperial\nCollege and the Science Museum\nlast Friday and Saturday.\nThe show is intended to\nincrease schoolchildren's awareness of science and technology,\nand the impact that it has on\ntheir lives. It teaches them basic\nprinciples of science through\nplaying with 'hands-on' exhibits.\nAs in previous years, there was a wide range of exhibits on display,\nfrom the cold and wet 'Water\nTurbine' to the filthy 'Fun with\nFeathers'.\nVolunteers from several\norganisations, including staff and\nstudents from Imperial, gave up\ntheir weekend to help run the\nBAYS exhibition. Most of the\nstalls were open between\n10.15am and 3.15pm, but some\nstayed open all day, resulting in\nthe dedicated helpers missing\nlunch. Nonetheless, the organisers declared the event \"a success\", and said that in many ways\nit was better than last year's. This year the BAYS day\ncoincided with the SET96 initiative, a project set up by academic and industrial research scientists which sets out to educate\nthe general public about how\nmodern-day science is organised\nand how research is undertaken,\nas well as what is done with the\nknowledge gained.\nWilson to be next Rector\nGlasgow University students\nhave elected Richard Wilson, of\n\"One Foot in the Grave\" fame,\nas their new Rector. Any ideas\nfor our next Rector, anyone?\nDale Winton perhaps? page 2\nPlastic cash\nA pilot scheme for the electronic cash system Mondex has been\nmooted by College for use\naround campus. The cash cards\nwould also be used as a swipe,\nand possibly for ICU. page 2\nPhotographers irate\nAn unfortunate clash with BAYS\nday led to the premature removal of the Photographic Society's exhibition in the Consort\nGallery. They say their pictures\nhave been damaged page 4\n\n"

The young age of\nmany of these bands usually leads to debut\nalbums filled with happy, jump-a long guitar riffs\namid the usual claims that the lyrics are supposed\nto be dark and personal. On some albums, this is\nrefreshing. However, it tends to end up as a clumsy attempt to inject some sort of eloquence into\nwhat is usually a load of mb b ish. Bad Religion has\nbeen around for a while. 'The Gray Race' does not\nbreak any new ground musically. Typical guitar\nriffs and a nice, well backed chorus is the standard\nfare here. Lyrically, it is brilliant. Phrases like\n'forming the fabric of a wayward people' and 'so\nmany righteous revolutionaries spouting Utopian\nlove'. 'Pity The Dead' asks the question of 'why\ndo we pity the dead' and proceeds to elaborate\nthe many negative sides of life. Although it made\nme take out my dictionary (knew it'd be useful\nsomeday), the phrases lacked the raw emotions of\nthe Manic Street Preachers' \"The Holy Bible'.\n'The Streets Of America' is probably the best\ntrack of the album, making statements like 'hard-cracked, daunting, lifeless veins, false hopes corridors to greener pastures is all that remains'.\nFor all the eloquent lyrics are worth, the\nmusic lacked the right passion. There was nothing\ngreat about the riffs and at times, it becomes bor-ing. Extreme is an example of a great rock/metal\nband and their hugely underrated 'Three Sides To\nEvery Story' is one of the albums to measure any\nrock album by. Every track here pales musically in\ncomparison to the album. Greg Graffin's lyrics\nare often a joy to read in a time when lyrics do not\nseem to matter anymore. It is a shame that the\nmusic simply fails to provide an adequate canvas\nfor the various prose. (6)\nalbum: mega city four -soul scraper an The album opens with Android Dreams' which is\na nice tune but frankly, so was Honeycrack's 'Go\nAway' and so was The Longpigs' 'Far'. It's almost\nimpossible these days not to find a great tune. The\nonly question is, what is the difference? Not very\nmuch, unfortunately. One can almost imagine\nhow a good tune will be like. There is nothing\nwrong with the songs themselves but if a compilation came out, it would be a challenge to\nremember the title of the last six tracks. Although\nthere are loads of cool tunes around, very few will\nactually blow you away. In 'Soulscraper', most\ntracks do not even go that far. The music here is\nso typical of almost every new band that it is not\neven worth describing. The phrase 'heard it once,\nheard it all' seemed to have been adopted as the\nstandard war chant of new pop/rock albums.\nLyrically, the album is crap. Pure and simple. At\ntimes, it seems like a by product of teenage writing and I am surprised that they were bold enough\nto actually print them out in the sleeves. Well, if\nthey want to print them, they have to take the\nflak as well. Musically, the only moment for me\nwas the first track which was also their last single.\nThe album tends to become a chaotic mix of loud\nriffs, shouts and nothing else. Don't bother with\nthis album. There is more than enough out there\nto attract and hold your attention. (4)\n\n"

This\ntime round, the brother of the villain from Die\nHard is threatening to set off bombs in public\nplaces around New York City unless McClane\n(Bruce Willis) completes a variety of tasks and\npuzzles. Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus, a shopkeeper reluctantly forced to accompany\nMcClane on his chase around New York.\nAlthough the initial plot seems quite\npromising, the script quickly runs out of ideas\nand reverts to a secondary plot about a gold heist.\nNeither plot seems quite compatible with the\nother, and neither are developed sufficiently to\nsustain the movie. By maintaining exactly the\nsame pace all the way through, the director has\ngiven very little sense of a beginning, middle, or\nend - in fact, the film seems to end twice.\nThe Willis-Jackson partnership provides\nsome witty repartee, but the humour revolves\naround a single joke which wears thin over the\ncourse of the film. Willis has perfected his John\nMcClane, doing the whole film as if he really\ndoes have a bad hangover. Jeremy Irons is suitably nasty as the villain but, probably through a lack of screen time (he doesn't actually appear\nuntil the half-way mark), doesn't make as much\nimpact as Alan Rickman did in the first film.\nBecause the action is not confined to one\nlocation, die film lacks the sense of claustrophobia which permeated its predecessors. Unlike\nthe first two, McClane is not alone; not only has\nhe been given a partner, but he also has the entire\nNYPD as support. Last of all, the sense has gone\nthat McClane is an accidental hero; no longer is\nhe simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nBecause of these differences, this is less a Die Hard film and more a buddy-buddy cop\nmovie, and the film consequently sacrifices a lot\nof originality already. To be fair, it is at least different from its predecessors but what it has\nbecome has already been much better done -witness the Lethal Weapon series, or Bad Boys.\nAll in all, besides the fact that the protagonist is called McClane and over the course of the\nfilm he gets increasingly beaten-up, there is very\nlittle to distinguish this as a Die Hard film.\nAlthough the New York setting could theoretically have provided many plot devices, the sheer\nrange of options means that the scriptwriters\nhaven't had to be as inventive, and the lack of\noriginal ideas shows.\nTherefore, With A Vengeance is a poor third\ninstallment to the Die Hard trilogy, suffering\nmainly from a lack of identity. If it had borne\ncloser resemblance to its predecessors (despite\nhaving the same director as the first) then it\nwould quite probably have been a worthy third\nfilm, but as it is, it comes across like McClane's hangover.\n'\u2022X^ yyyy, -v....0426914666 yy'yj W^y t^ WWy'.yy y.''&??b. i My f.M: r;y# bby;y:.7b by;. rest ii ration Iff ii ff;......;':b;f:; yb -;bib^ by bb'b. ff-bby.y':;,'\",:<;> \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\nbbb i::;i/: M.,,:^ WyWy\n'\nXyMfMeMMyyXyy'y' train spotting3.40,7.10,9.30 riff PMyM^v:;y my y m:y.

TWENTY-ONE\nLETTERS TO FELIX: EDITED BY ALEX FE A KES Dear Rachel,\nCongratulations to your\nteam on producing the elections\nspecial so speedily. I'd just like to\npoint out that my comment -\"those Mary's votes didn't make\nthe difference at all\" was said\ntongue in cheek.\nHowever, I 'll stand by what I said. The results would not have\nbeen affected ii no-one at Mary's had voted: mainland IC voting\ngave the four victors convincing\nwins, even in the well contested\nposts. Only for Felix, where the\nblock vote weakened a little, did\nMary's fail to confirm the freely\nmade choices. A win's a win - it's not the size that counts.\nThough entertaining in parts\n(whilst being generally insulting\nand immature) the hustings at\nMary's need n't have been treated\nlike a victory parade. As far as\nblock voting goes I'm all in favour\nso long as all the candidates are\nconsidered. If groups of people\nmake the effort to calculate\nwhat's best for them why should-n't they promote their can di dates? And if anyone can drum\nup enough enthusiasm to get\nmore than half of their colleagues\nto vote then that has to be better\nthan the feeble turnout in my\nown department.\nThe turnout of 11 % was dis-appointing. If 89% of us have no\ninterest (or at least don't have a say) in who is: representing us in\nIC and beyond, keeping an eye on\nunion services and budgets, looking after the interests of the enormous range of clubs and societies,\nor producing our weekly news-sheet, then that's a great shame.\nWell done to those who had the\ncourage to stand for the elections. Oily Newman, Elections\nCommittee, Civ Eng dep rep.\nDear Felix,\nOn behalf of ConSoc I am\nwriting to express my thanks to\nICU for providing the necessary\nfunding for Daniel Neiss, one of\nour members, to attend a7 day\nconference in Oxford at the end\nof this term. The conference,\nwhich will focus on the current\nand future role of the EC, will be\nan excellent opportunity for discussion of real and highly relevant\nissues. The findings of this meeting will be presented to the EC commission at a future date.\nJamie Oliver, ConSoc Press\nOfficer.\nUnion money used for political\nends? No, just joking. Good\nluck, Daniel, and let's just hope\nthat you all reach a consensus\nfor once, eh?\nDear Felix,\nI'd like to say congratulations\non a well-written piece concerning the International Night in last\nweek's issue. Regrettably, how ev er, I must say I was somewhat\nannoyed by an error in the article\nin which I was misquoted as saying 'there were a few more mistakes last year.' Despite the fact\nthat I was not involved with the\nOverseas Students' Committee\nlast year (and therefore could not\nmake a comment regarding last\nyear's event) and that Mr Riley,\nthe journalist who penned the\narticle, did not interview me himself - I fail to see how an irresponsible remark like that could\nhave to made it to the piece. I realise that occasional misprints\ndo occur, but let's not keep them\ntoo occasional, shall we?\nG Tan (OSC Honorary\nJunior Treasurer).\nAs far as I can gather, your\nquote was passed on to Robin by\nsomeone who had spoken to\nyou. In any case, it only served to\nunderline the ever improving\nsuccess of International Night.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1055: |\n12pm, Tuesday 30th April\n| Please bring your union card for j identification.

The facade has concerned English Heritage.\nBY TIM ST.CLAIR AND\nRACHEL WALTERS\nPreparations lor the gradual\ndemolition of the RCS II building are currently underway after\nplanning permission for the new\nbiomedical sciences building was\ngranted earlier this month.\nKensington and Chelsea\nBorough Planning Council passed\nthe plans and approved the\ndemolition of RCS II subject to\nthe design being brought up to\nEnglish Heritage's standards.\nAmendments to the building's blueprints are now being made in\nthe light of the recommendations. Alterations to the proposed\ndesign include cosmetic changes\nto the tower, which was to be\nclad in a textured stone. English\nHeritage recommended that\nsmooth stone be used instead,\nharmon ising the frontage with\nthe appearance of the Queen's Tower. English Heritage also recommended that the site could be\nbetter landscaped to fit in with\nthe current surroundings. These\ntwo recommendations are considered as fairly minor and little\ndifficulty is anticipated in their\nimplementation.\nA more demanding job will\nbe the redesign of the plant room\non the roof ol the BMS building.\nIn the present plans, this extends\nforward, projecting over the top\nof the building, and English\nHeritage has recommended that\nthis be redesigned so that it will\nnot stick out. New designs are\nanticipated to take three weeks\nto produce.\nWhile Norman Foster adjust\nthe designs, demolition of the\nRCS II building proceeds apace.\nThe building will be dismantled\nrather than demolished, due to\nits proximity to the science\nmuseum and chemistry build-in gs. Scaffolding was erected\naround the RCS II building last\nWednesday and the d is assembly has already begun. While the\nRCS II building is taken down,\nthe BMS groundwork will be laid\nwhere possible; this move has\nbeen taken to catch up on lost\ntime, estimated to be several\nweeks. Imperial College Estates\nDirector Ian Caldwell predicted\nthat \"this won't be last of our\nproblems, so we want to regain\nlost time while we can.\"\nMr Caldwell said that the\nbiggest concern now about the\nproject is what impact the noise\nof construction may have on students doing exams. Estates staff\nare presently looking at ways to\nmake sure that disturbance is\nkept to a minimum for the duration of the examination period.\nAs a priority, exams planned to\nbe held in the nearest corner of\nthe Civil Engineering building\nwill be moved elsewhere while\nthe work takes place.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nPot stashed\nThe Three-Handled Pot of the\nRoyal College of Science Union\nwas stolen from the Union bar\nduring the R CSU Election\nbar night last Tuesday. The bar\nwas packed with students from\nall the CCUs, and at around ten\no 'clock R CSU officers noticed\nthat the prized possession was\nnowhere to be seen.\nColloquially known as the\n3HP, the pot is a one-off design\nand the R CSU has requested its\nreturn \"preferably before\nWednesday night [this evening|\".\nRob Park, R CSU Publicity\nOfficer and Hon Sec-elect,\nassured Felix that if the 3HP \"can be returned to any C CU office, no questions will be\nasked.\"\nHe warned that if the pot is\nfound in anyone's possession\nafter this time, then steps will be\ntaken to involve the Metropolitan Police and set in motion\nthe Imperial College Union disciplinary procedure.\nRCSU Election results: page 4\nBanks:\"Tory hypocrisy\"\nTony Banks, Labour MP for\nNewham North, gave an outspoken talk on a range of subjects\nlast Wednesday at a meeting of\nIC Labour Club.\nHe made plain his disgust\nwith the Tories for their\nhypocrisy over the Scott report,\nparticularly the ministers who\ndid not resign after having misled\nparliament, but called for the\nresignation of the shadow Welsh\nSecretary after a remark he made\nregarding Prince Charles' suitability for the throne. Mr Banks\nalso said he looked forward to\nseeing a united Ireland.\nThough looking forward to\nseeing Labour in power, he is\naware of the difficulties the party\nwill face after being on the opposition benches so long, especially\nas he will still have to ask difficult questions of ministers.\nSmiling ruefully, he rated his\nchances of becoming a minister\nhimself as \"slim\".\nPhysicist dies in crash\nA second year Physics under-graduate, Christos Orillas, was\nkilled in a road accident in\nFrance on the 9th of March.\nChristos made a lasting\nimpression on many people during his time at Imperial College.\nDepartmental staff described\nhim as a quiet student who was a pleasure to teach. He was studying Physics with Theoretical\nPhysics and his enthusiasm convinced many that he would have\ngiven a great deal to science.\nTo his fellow students, he\nwas someone who always had\ntime for others. He was respected for his wit and intelligence as\nwell as his top academic performance, and was always ready to\nlisten to other people's problems\nHe was always warm, funny, and\nunderstanding, whatever the situation demanded. Chris was also\na keen member of the Hellenic\nSociety, who have expressed\ntheir condolences to the family.\nThe funeral was held in\nFrance, but his family visited the\nPhysics department last Friday\nand were deeply moved by the\nsorrow expressed by Chris's many friends, who came to see\nthem.\nSokol Dauti, Andreas Mershin,\nDaniel Figueras-Nieto.\nEmergency numbers\nKenneth Weir, Deputy Head ol\nSecurity, has highlighted an\nincrease in the incidence of\nbogus 4444 calls on the internal\ntelephone network.\nThe 4444 code, which is a direct dial number to the security desk, was established to alert\nSecurity to emergency situations\non campus and not for day-to-day use. Bogus calls make the\nservice less effective, and endanger those who have a genuine\nproblem.\nAnother security issue currently a problem around the\ncampus is a rise in reported pick-pocketing and theft from motor\nvehicles. Imperial College\nSecurity remind students and\nstaff to be alert and to keep an\neye on their belongings.\n\n"

    "content": "EIGHT . FELIX WEDNESDAY MARCH 20TH1996 FEATURE\nA Century of Change, A Cent u of ogress? Last Easter, Felix interviewed Mr Reginald Pink on the occasion of his 100th birthday. Just before his 101st birthday, Mr Pink passed away.\nHis great-granddaughter looks back upon the past 100 years and considers\nthe changing world that we have created.\nThe name Reginald Pink will never be\nfound in the history books, although he\nplayed a very important part in the history of the world. He left the world\nalmost as anonymously as when he\nentered it in 1895. Having fought in\nIndia in the First World War, he was\nthe last surviving member of his regi-ment. He was too old to fight in the\nSecond World War, but worked on the\nrailways. He spent over 40 years of his\nlife a widower. Last week, just before\nhis 101st birthday, my Great\nGrandfather (or GG D, as I called him)\ndecided that he'd had enough, and that\nit was time to leave the world.\nThe world he left behind, though, was\nvery different from the one into which he\nwas born. After all, we are talking here about\na man who could remember hearing the news\nof Queen Victoria's death; a man who was\nalready retired when the Berlin Wall went\nup; a man who was a grandfather when the\nBeatles were founded! He lived to experience\nthe reigns of six monarchs and twenty Prime\nMinisters.\nTechnologically, the world has advanced\nbeyond all recognition in the past century. In\n1895, the concept of television would have\nseemed totally ludicrous. The idea of man\nwalking on the moon would have been\nreserved for childhood fantasies. Fingerprinting had not been invented, let alone\nDNA discovered. The words 'genetic' and\n'Internet' did not even exist in the English\nFashions are different - I was often accused\nby him of 'looking like a boy' because my\nattire was not considered feminine enough.\nPeople are no longer punished for writing\nwith their left hands. Everybody receives an\neducation, regardless of wealth or social sta-tus. There is a National Health Service\nOustI).\nGG D was born into the pre-suf-fra get te world, before women had even *\\\nconsidered being able to vote.\nYet he lived to see a woman\nPrime Minister come and\nHe heard of trou- jfk\nsi /e cu ut\nlanguage. There were no motor cars, no electricity, no radio, no supermarkets, no heart\ntransplants, no penicillin, no polythene...\nSocially, too, the world has changed.\ngo\nble s developing in\nSouth Africa - the\nBoer War was raging\nthroughout his childhood.\nHe saw a black President\ntake control. Ireland was\nonly one, undivided co un try, and Sinn Fein did not\nexist. There was still as\ndeath penalty, and divorce\nwas only legal on grounds\nof adultery. There was no\nLabour Party, there were\nno Boy scouts. The\nKaisers still ruled in\nGermany, and the\nCzars in Russia.\nGG D saw the world almost destroy\nitself in two world wars. He believed that\nWWI was 'the war to end all wars', but\nhumanity created bigger and more destructive weapons, and went to\nwar again. He would never\nhave believed he would see\nsuch full-scale mass\ndestruction as that created\nby the dropping of Atomic\nbombs on Hiroshima and\nNagasaki. How much devastation could we have\ncaused if the Cold War had developed into a Third World War?\nAs GG D is laid to rest, I cannot help but\nwonder how the world will look in another\nhundred years' time. Can we continue to\ndevelop at the speed we currently are, without totally destroying ourselves? I don't want\nto see us go back to a time when children\nwere sent down mines, when women had no\nrights, when watching hangings was a childhood treat. I dread to think what\nwould be like if Hitler had been\nallowed to rampage his way across\nEurope unstopped and unhindered.\nBut I would like to see a world where it is safe for\nchildren to play outside\nin the streets;\nwhere there is\nless pollution;\nwhere materialism and\nconsumerism play a less\nimportant role in soci-e ty; where poorer countries are not exploited by\nlarger ones; where children are able to enjoy\nthemselves without the\nneed for expensive toys,\ncomputers and te levi sion.\nGenetic engineering\nhas achieved some\namazing things, but\nwhere does it go from here? Will we soon\nreally see a world similar to that in Huxley's \"Brave New World\" - written as a warning\nagainst such things happening, but looking\nincreasingly likely to become, at least in part,\nreality?\nGG D's own words about the world as it\nis today were: \"It's all wrong! We're doing\neverything too fast!\"\nHe put it somewhat more bluntly than\nAldous Huxley, but the point is the same.\nAre we really making the world a better\nplace? How will we progress further? Will the\nworld as we know it still exist in another hundred year's time?\nGG D knew what he thought - and he\nshould know, he saw a lot of it happen.\n\n"

SEVEN\nPabri\nJokes prevail over issues\n. i,,V cli yj , lt m.m.<>< T, \u2014I* the HEFCE cuts, with a view to\nfunding by the private sector.\nThe CVC P met in London to discuss introducing a one-off \"gov-ern ment deficit levy\" of \u00a3350otherwise known as a top-up fee.\nHowever, one university head\nsaid this was inadequate, citing\n\u00a31000 as more realistic figure.\nBut according to IC's Rector,\nthere was \"no intention of charg-ing... it would achieve almost\nnothing for the college.\" Jonathan\nAitken MP dropped by Consoc,\noutlining Britian's position in the\nNew World Order, while a pair\nof drunk miners dropped in\nthrough the ceiling of the ICU Print Unit, claiming they were\nlost. Also direction less were\nICU's s abb elections, which had\nnot so much started slowly as\nbarely started at all, with only\ntwo candidates declaring them-selves...\nFelix 1050\nIn the wake of the Docklands\nBomb, Sir Patrick Mayhew visited ConSoc, saying that the\nIRA would have to call the\nceasefire again before the peace\nprocess could begin. At the\nother end of the political spec-t rum, the ex-Labour leader\nMichael Foot visited, giving a lecture on the far less contentious issue of one of IC's more famous alumni, H.G. Wells. A more right-wing\ni Tories Labour politician dropped in a ICU( though not through the\nroof this time) when UL U President Ghassan Karian visited ICU council to describe the\nnew shape of the UL U Consitution, especially with\nregard to medical school representation. More budding politicians\nsigned up as the Sabb elections\ngathered speed, or at least lost\nslowness. Although contests for\ntwo of the four posts appeared\nto have become one-horse races,\nthere were now two candidates\nfor the post of D PfC& S) and\nthree for the presidency. Many\ncandidates lacked a full compliment of second ers. However,\nmany lamented the lack of\ninterest shown in the whole\nevent: \"It looks like it's all\ngoing to be very boring this\nyear,\" muttered Tim Townend,\nDP(C& S). Felix 1051\nProgress on the BMS Building - al\ntogether now - appeared to have\nstalled. The Borough Council\nshould have viewed the app lica tion, though it had now been put\noff for another two weeks, so as\nto allow English Heritage to put\nforward their views. This was the\nthird time that the application\nhad failed to even be considered,\nlet alone approved. It was a tough\nweek for the union: ICU could\nsoon be denied bar extensions\nfrom the local constabulary, possibly due to police changes in\nstaffing commitments.\nICU was also temporarily\ndenied its clock after one of its\nhands became \"mis-aligned\", and\nit was further denied \u00a31000 of\ndisco equipment. To further\ncomplicate matters, it would\nsoon be denied some 28% of its\nbudget. The s abb elections,\nincreasingly derided as lacklustre,\nat least seemed to gather more\nmomentum as the chase for\nDP(C&S) became 3-horse race,\nand everyone gradually became\nfully seconded. Elsewhere, the\nC&G elections weren't doing\nquite so well...\nFelix 1052\nJokes, bad singing and widespread downing of pints. AC CUba r night? No: election\nhustings (differing from the former in that fewer serious issues\nwere raised). Although there\nwas much amusement at both\nthe ICU ents-lounge event and\nits block busting, flan-throwing\nsequel at Mary's, few serious\nissues were discussed. College\nwere still in the dark over\nEnglish Heritage's decision for\nthe long suffering yet paradoxically as-yet-un built BMS building. Also in the dark were\nmedics over their proposed syl-la bus, due to be implemented in\n1998. A worrying increase in\nbike thefts prompted suggestions of a 'Big Brother'\napproach to security - CCTV may end up being installed outside the college library.\nFelix 1053E Election Results! The votes,\ncounted in record time, elected\nAlex Feakes as Felix Editor,\nSarah Corneille as DP(C&S), Piers Williams as DP(F&S) and\nEric Allsop as President. Yet for\nall the cheers in the bar, the\ninterviews, the photos, the inter-views, the tears, the interviews\nand the alcohol, did the average\nstudent really care...?\nFelix 1053\n...After all, less than 900 votes\nwere cast, with only 8% of the\nSouth Ken students voting.\nUnlike last year, the Mary's medics didn't seem as united as\nusual in their block vote...\nTurnouts were, better at the\nOSC's International Night, successful as ever. The BMS was\nfinally put out of its misery as\nEnglish Heritage finally gave it\nthe go-ahead: \"It's full steam\nahead from here,\" said Estates\nDirector Ian Caldwell, for possibly the nth time. Against a backdrop of new sabbaticals\nappearing, one of the current\nincumbents vanished for the\nday: Sarah White, apparently\nkidnapped in a Rag stunt. Also\nexperiencing misery was IC'sHE FCE grant, facing a3.7% cut.\nPhotos: Alex Feakes and Ivan\nChan\n\n"
