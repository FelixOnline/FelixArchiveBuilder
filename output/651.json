    "content": "ILetters-fo-f he l^iJ or Arthur Again\nDear Pallab\nHaving read the article and\nyour editorial in the Postgrad\nFELIX on Michael Arthur I can only agree with your\nconclusions that he \"couldn't give a toss about ordinary\nstudents\".\nLast year I desperately\nneeded accommodation during\nterm time and found his attitude of studied indifference to\nmy plight very frustrating. In\nthe end I was provided with an\nexpensive, cramped, uncomfortable and very unsatisfactory\nroom which, with exams approaching I was in no position\nto refuse. Mr Arthur has a 'captive audience' of students\nand seems to, as far as I can tell,\ntake advantage of this. I sign\nanonymously to avoid possible\n'complications' in future at the\nAccommodation Centre.\nA Student\nAdrian\nProtests\nDear Pallab\nI would like to apologise to\nall fresher s for several major inaccuracies in this year's Handbook. As you know, the final\ncopy was recalled from the\nprinters by MessrsLewis, Teller\nand Davis following a complaint from an RCSU\nofficial that I had questioned\nthe value of Freshers' Dinners.\nAs a result, the Exec re-wrote\nseveral pieces of text against my\nexpress wishes\u2014in fact, I felt\nstrongly enough about this to\nresign my post as Editor,\nalthough as the work was all\nfinished this was no major\ndisaster.\nBy the time students read the\nHandbook, they are committed\nto coming to Imperial and so\nwill not be put off by an honest,\nunbiased view of the College.\nThat is the very purpose of the\nHandbook. Of course I agree-that the Union should have\nsome control over material\nprinted on its behalf, and for the\nsix weeks during which I was\npreparing the Handbook any\nUnion Officer was welcome to\nread what I had written. As it\nhappens, the Exec left it until\nthe day when they knew printing was \u2022 due to start, and\nPage2 HB HH HH recalled the copy from the\nprinters to replace editorial material with the kind of bland,\nuninformative waffle that imparts no knowledge and gives a very'wrong impression of life at\nIC.\nYours sincerely\nAdrian James\nHandbook Editor (Retired)\nVoice of\nExperience\nDear Ed\nAs another Freshers' Week\nbegins at IC, I think it's a good\ntime to record some of the old\nviews about the importance of\ninvolvement in IC Union. The\nCollege and the Students'\nUnion provides buildings and\nfacilities but these are only\nframeworks for the people who\nuse them, for without these\npeople\u2014YOU\u2014the College\ndoes not exist.\nOne of the most important\nparts of a University education\nis the exchange and development of views with fellow\nstudents, and a climate to\nachieve this is possibly the\ndifference between our form of\neducation and any other. If you\nnever do anything then you can\nnever expect to have this\ncontact; and therefore active\nparticipation in some part of\nCollege life is an absolute\nnecessity.\nIn departments, where one\nworks, student meets student\nand views are exhange d. In\nhalls, which unfortunately not\neveryone is lucky enough to\ninhabit, one will meet people\nwith whom one's only apparent\nconnections are eating, sleeping\nand living next door, but much\ncan be gained from such\nunlikely friendships.\nIn the Union clubs one\nencounters students with whom\none has common interests. If an\nactive part is taken in the club\nthen these are the people with\nwhom one will mix most, be it\ntravelling to a game, over coffee\nbefore a meeting, or sharing a room on tour.\nThese personal contacts\nwhich you will develop are the\nvery substance of university life,\nand unless advantage is taken of\nthem your education will be\nincomplete.\nAs in every sphere of life\nparticipation brings its own\nrewards and IC Union is no\nexception. The facilities are\navailable, as you will see on the\nafternoon of 4 October when all\nthe clubs will be on display, but\nthe onus is on the individual to\nmake the best use of them. If\nyou feel that something else is\nneeded, make your opinion\nknown and then do something\nabout it\u2014this is your Union.\nYou will have met most of the\nUnion Officers by this time,\nremember that they are your\nofficers and approachable as\nsuch.\nCombine a successful\nacademic career; a well rounded\npersonality derived from a breadth of interests; and an\nability to deal with people and\naffairs, derived from an active\nUnion life, and you will have\nreceived a true university\neducation. Good luck with\nFELIX this year.\nCheers!\nColin Palmer\n(FELIX Editor 1979/80)\nRector\nResigns\nDear Sir\nHaving been a student here for\nseveral years I like to think that I have developed a strong sense of\nloyalty to the Imperial Collse of\nScience and Technology and\nwhat is more, a personal loyalty'\nto our leader. Imagine my shock\nand dismay on glancing at page\nfour of your last issue. The\noffensive headline \"Rector\nResigns\" was placed at the top of\nthe page in letters more than half-an-inch high!\nAlthough closer examination\nshowed that this referred to the\nRector of the Royal College of\nArt.\nOf course it's OK to have fun\nand undergraduate pranks are\nacceptable. But please, no more\ntricks.\nGood luck.\nPJ Potter\nBaron Who?\nDear Sir\nHaving read your first\nFELIX, I feel that I have to\ncomplain about the amount of\ntotally fabricated material\nwhich you chose to put in it. I. realise that you had a limited, if\nnot zero, amount of input from\nstudents not connected with\nFELIX, but did you have to go\nout of your way to invent\ncharacters to fill your letters\npage and artificial small ads\nwhich have been deliberately\nmisleading. One unfortunate\nstudent, having read the small\nad concerning the hot bikes\ngoing cheap, rushed off to\nMend-a Bike to purchase one,\nonly to find that he had been\ndeliberately misled by the only\npublication which a student\nshould be able to believe. So, no\nmore fabrication please!\nYours faithfully\nBrian F Lowers\nFELIX\nFabrication\nDear Pallab\nA rumour has come to my\nattention which I find hard to\nbelieve. Having spent less than\na year at IC, I am suspicious\nthat my leg is being pulled. As\nyou are, as FELIX Editor, the\nsource of all information for\nstudents, I wonder if you can\nclear up the confusion.\nThe point is this: Is our\nRector, Lord Flowers, really\nthe Baron of Queensgate? How\nfar does the Barony of Queensgate extend? Does it in fact\ncontain any or all of the IC\ncampus? Is Lord Flowers not\nonly our Rector, but our Ruler\nas well?\nYours in anticipation\nDiane Love\nCountess of Beit\nPhysics PG\n/ believe that the Barony of\nQueensgate has no geographical\nboundaries. Our Rector has\nmerely chosen to incorporate his\naddress into his name in order to\nimprove his status with, all his\ntrendy SDP friends-Ed.\nDH BH HH Fell*\nMonday,October 3 19B3 "

It is the only student\ntelevision station in London, one of thirteen\nin Britain.\nUsually we broadcast two programmes a week: on Tuesday an interview with a well-known personality (including Michael Palin,\nTim Brooke-Taylor and Gordon Jackson last\nyear); an extended report or a feature on a recently released film. On Thursday is our\nweekly news and magazine programme NewsBreak, which includes a look at some of the\nlatest films, with clips from the distributors,\nin Film Review. Look out for our posters for\nprogramme details.\nIf you want to know more and meet some\nof the people involved, visit our stand at\nFreshers' Fair (in the Sherfield Refectory).\nOr, why not call in at the TV Studio on the\nWalkway next to the Electrical Engineering\nDepartment entrance, around 5:00pm on\nWednesday afternoon when we are making\nThursday's edition of News-Break.

The membership comes not just\nfrom IC but from other colleges and local\ninstitutes. The most popular dances are the\nWaltz. Quickstep. Cha-cha. Rliumba and\nJive.\nThe central activities of the club are the\nclasses on Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday,\nwhich cater for standards ranging from complete beginners to bronze and silver medals\nand above. In previous years the club has\nattracted a large number of beginners and\nthere will be at least one class per week for\nthem. In all the classes the atmosphere is\nrelaxed and dress informal and there is no\nneed to bring a partner since you swap\npartners during the evening. One of our\nprofessional teachers takes the class for about\n1 '/hours and then you can practice for about\nanother hour.\nIn addition to the classes the club holds an\nannual ball in November and has a team\nwhich competes at Inter Varsity balls. Many\nmembers go along to support the team and\njoin in the social dancing.\nThe club will be at the Freshers' Fair in the\nBotany/Zoology Common Room, so come\nand see us there or come to one of the classes\nin the Sherfield JCR at 7:30pm starting the\nsecond week of term.\nPaul Kirkman\nPhysics PG\nBikes\nDuring this period property totalling\n\u00a316,431 was reported to Police as stolen\nfrom within the College. The bulk of stolen\nitems were 102 bicycles with a total value\nof \u00a312,088. Within this amount were five\nbikes with a value of over \u00a3150. Other\nitems of property stolen amounted to\n\u00a34,343, which consisted mostly of cash in\nwallets and purses. The wallets etc were\nusually left unattended in unlocked drawers\nor in coats and handbags left by seats or in\nlibraries whilst the owners went elsewhere.\nIt is hoped that all students and staff who\nown pedal cycles will take advantage of\n'post coding' their bikes during the first\nweek of term. The Crime Prevention\nOfficer, PC MacDonald and myself will be\n'post coding' on the first two days of term\nand on the next three days we will be\nassisted by five cadets. The 'coding' which\nconsists of stamping the owners home\npostcode onto the frame will take place in\nthe Ante-Room Sherfield Build-ing on the\nfollowing dates and times:\nMonday 3 October\nTuesday 4 October\nWednesday 5 October\nThursday 6 October\nFridav 7 October\nll:00am6:00 pml:00 pm6:00 pm8:00 am fj:00pm8:00 am6:00p m8:00am4:00 pm Paul Goodison\nperi aL COLLEGE\nNow com'on troops, retrieve that scrap of\npaper, with all the squares on it. from 'the\nround file' (dustbin) and concentrate on it for\na second of your valuable time...Hi there, it's IC's biggest Pseud here\u2014well that's what the\nsheet says!\nRight, things that should be concentrated\non and noted well:\n1. The fresher s meeting will not be as dire\nas it sounds. In fact, it will probably be one of\nthe best during this week of introductory\nevents...as we will no doubt give you 'live'\nexperience on the radio...so you can be real\nmedia stars!\n2. The Bar Programme is the place to be on\nThursday night. I can categorically state that\nalthough a caravan will not appear in the\nSouthside Bar, there are rumours of a Cheiftain tank....\n3. Look out for the special features at\n8:()0pm each evening. The Fast Food & Pub\nGuide are vital for your existence in South\nKen and the Monopoly may help you discard\nyour A to Z! It should also be noted that if there are any\nwine buffs reading this article that Chateauneuf du Pape 176 will not be served at our\nfresher s meeting...as some of us have drunk\nSouth Ken dry in this vintage already. See you\nall at Freshers' Fair.\nCaving\nCaving is often regarded as a dangerous sport\ncarried out by a set of irresponsible masochists who, for some unknown reason enjoy\ncrawling down small muddy holes. Be that as\nit may, it doesn't really apply to IC Caving\nClub. We tackle all manner of caves from the\nmuddy crawls of Mendip, to the spacious\nstream passages of S Wales and the deep\npotholes of Yorkshire. We run trips every\nother weekend all over the country, leaving\nFriday evening and (those still alive-Ed) returning Sunday night. Accommodation is in\nlocal caving huts and we provide all the\nequipment and training.\nThe level of competence of the club is high\nand we tackle some of the most demanding\ncaves in the country as well as mounting\nsummer trips and expeditions abroad. However we cater for all levels of experience;\neveryone is welcome, it doesn't matter if\nvo u 've. never set foot in a cave before, so why\nnot come along and give it a go? We meet\nevery Wednesday at 1:00pm in the Lower\nUnion Lounge and we'll be at the Freshers'\nFair.\nFelix mOB MM H MBH H nH HI Monday,October 3 1983 \u2022 HH HB HH HH Page21\n\n"

    "content": "Jjtorial\nFreshers\nWelcome to all fresher s, this is the start of three or four years at\nImperial, I hope you enjoy it. The first week is a very exciting\nyet apprehensive time for new arrivals. The best thing to do is\nto go to all the parties, join lots of clubs and make sure you\nhave a good time in your first week.\nCensorship\nI must sym pathis e with the Handbook Editor Adrian James. He has\nbeen very badly treated by the Union Exec. The reason President\nGaynor Lewis recalled Adrian from the printer was that she did not\nrealise that she was supposed to check the artwork before it went to\npress. It seems common sense is beyond these high Hying sabbaticals.\nOnce Gaynor got her hands on the artwork she proceeded to rip\napart the Handbook that Adrian had painstakingly completed. Her\nreason for censoring the Handbook was that she felt that it might\ncause offence to College block. The Handbook is supposed to be 'an\nhonest and unbiased view of College' and that is exactly what\nAdrian's Handbook was. Certain sections of College are inefficient\nand badly run and deserve all the offence students can throw at them.\nI think Gaynor has got her priorities wrong somewhere if she is\nmore concerned about the fragile egos of administrators in College\nblock than student interests. She is after all the Union's representative\nin administration and not the administration's representative in the\nUnion.\nFELIX\nStaff\nYou are now reading FELIX, undoubtedly the best student newspaper in the country.

    "content": "Whilst most of you were sunning yourselves over the summer vacation, life at Imperial\ncontinued hectic and unabated. A few members were able to get down to some real work.\nThe rest were able to take their holidays and potter off to conferences in hot foreign\ncountries without a care in the world. Postgrads would mono polis e coffee machines and fall\nasleep in refectories to their hearts content. Amidst this hive of activity, FELIX worked\nhard to maintain its reputation as the best student newspaper in the country; the peak of\ninvestigative journalism. We now present an update on the summer's news and scandal.\nGoulder Goes Out With A Bang\nMr Stephen Goulder, retiring ICU President, formally handed over to\nhis successor Miss Gaynor Lewis in his last day in office at the top of\nthe Queen's Tower. The handover came at the end of a jolly afternoon\nof wine and champagne provided by Mr Goulder.\nThe Queen's Tower, perhaps South Kensington's best phallic if\nsomewhat castrated symbol provided an excellent opportunity for an\nego massage for Mr Goulder and a chance to give Miss Lewis a tongue-in-cheek kiss. Or perhaps he was whispering to her the sweet nothings\nof the President's job.\nMr Goulder, typically absent-minded to the last, handed over the\nkeys to his Linstead Hall room instead of the Union Office keys. It was\nreported that they later went off together and had some hanky-pan ky. Summer Lettings Scheme\nMr Michael Arthur, Student Services Officer, ran into severe problems with the management of\nthe Summer Lettings Scheme.\nExamples of overbooking, in cor ect charging and mismanagement\nwere rife in the first two weeks of\nthe scheme's operation.\nMichael Arthur's mismanagement and creative accounting\ncame under heavy criticism from\nall quarters. He was described in\nFELIX as the most arrogant and\nunhelpful official in College.\nGuilds Romp Home\nOn a happier note, City & Guilds\nsuccessfully completed their\nround Britain pedal car marathon on Thursday 21 July. The\nintrepid Guildsmen pedalled into Charing Cross Station after a furious last leg that set a blazing\nnew record time of 252 hours.\nGuilds hack Mike Stuart managed to hog all the publicity,\nalways arranging to be in the\npedal car just as the photographers arrived. Despite Mike,\nthe nationwide media coverage\nhelped Guilds to raise nearly\n\u00a310,000 towards a lifeboat engine\nfor the RNLI.\nCutbacks Equal 'Efficiency'\nThe governing council of Queen\nElizabeth College, Chelsea College and Kings College approved\ndocuments stating an intention to\nmerge the three colleges into one\ninstitution based at the Kings\nCollege site on the Strand. The\neventual aim is to sell the QEC\nand Chelsea sites, but according\nto UL U President Chris Sale,\nintegration will take five to ten\nyears and much time-consuming\nbussing of students will be in-vol ved. Meany Mooney Swindle\nScandal\nMr Victor Mooney, the much\nmaligned Refectory Manager,\nwas up to his old tricks again over\nthe summer. He prevented the\nstudent cleaners from having\nbreakfasts using breakfast tickets\nthat had been given to them as\ntips, despite the fact that the\ntickets had been paid for. Apparently, cunning old Victor, realising that many of the tourists\nwould rather not eat his breakfasts (who can blame them-Ed)\nthought he could make a bit on\nthe side by not cooking enough to\nfill breakfasts the orders.\nDavy Handover\nDavy, an oversized Davy lamp\nand the mascot of RSMU was\nreturned to them on 19 June. The\nransom set by RCSU was a Rag\ncollection in front of Harrods.\n\u00a3200 for charity was raised.\nFire in Chemistry\nIt was feared that the Chemistry\nbuilding might explode when a fire broke out in one of the fume\ncupboards engulfing a doctor in\nthe department in flames. Fortunately the fire was under control\nvery quickly.\nRector Resigns\nNo, not Lord Flowers. Dr Lionel\nMarch, Rector of the Royal\nCollege of Art, resigned on\nMonday 1 August in response to\nmounting criticism of his management of the College. The\nclimax was his appointment of\nDr George Sting, his friend and\nformer colleague at the Open\nUniversity, to the new post of\nDean. Both men denied reports\nthat Dr Sting was holding on to\nhis old job in America. These\nreports were subsequently\nproved true, and both men have\nnow resigned. Earlier criticisms\ncentred on what many felt to be\nDr March's lack of experience\nand the irrelevance of his field of\nstudy to most work at the RCA.\nNo Cunt No Fuck\nThe Rag Mag was censored yet\nagain this year. The words 'cunt'\nand 'fuck' were banned from use\nin the Rag Mag. Other material\nbanned included jokes relating to\ngeriatrics, babies, disabled\npeople and natural disasters.\nRacist, sexist and religious jokes\nhave been allowed to remain\nsince they only affect insignificant minorities in College.\nBackslapDJjng and Backstahhirjg\nSelf-congratulations and petty\nsnubs were the order of the day at\nthe final meeting of ICU Council\nthis year. Engraved pots and\nHonorary Life Membership were\nawarded for exceptional service\nto the Union to Mike Prosser\nPublications Board Chairman;\nNick Pyne UGM Chairman and\nformer Welfare Officer; John\nMcCallion, non-sabbatical Deputy President; and, 1982/3 President Stephen Goulder. Further\nawards went to Andy Grimshaw, Jonathan Miller, Ian Bull,\nSimon Rodan, Colin Butter and\nMatthew Tonks. All were nominated by Stephen Goulder. Martin\nTaylor, last year's FELIX Editor\nreceived no recognition for all his\nhard work in the Union.\nPage 6 Monday,October 3 1983 Fell*\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs\nICSO\nDramsoc provides a range of activities which\ncover most aspects of drama. Each term, the\nsociety performs one major show involving\nwork from people from all aspects of the\nsociety: actors, lighting and sound people,\nstage managers, set designers and builders,\ncostume designer and even a bar manager!\nThis term's major production is called The\nUnknown Soldier and His Wife, a comedy by\nPeter Ustinov. If you are interested in acting,\nlighting or general odd jobbing in this show\nthen please attend the first of the weekly\nWednesday afternoon workshops on 5 October that will be taking place throughout the\nyear. There will also be a special workshop\nfor those interested in acting in this show on\nSunday 9 October. Both are at 2:30pm in the\nUnion Upper Lounge.\nDramsoc not only provides lights for its\nown shows but also for Ents gigs and for large\nparties such as the Silwood Ball. We also\nprovide sound, design and build sets for our\nown productions. The society makes regular\ntheatre trips, the first one being on 12 October\nto Daisy Pulls It Off at the Globe Theatre.\nTickets, at reduced rates, are between \u00a34-5\nfrom any committee member.\nIf you are interested in any aspects of\nDramsoc I hope to see you either at Freshers'\nFair, at the first workshop or at an informal\nparty which will be on Wednesday 5 October\nat 8:00pm in the Concert Hall for those\ninterested in Dramsoc. All fresher s are more\nthan welcome and if you cannot make any of\nthese even fs then the storeroom (up the stairs,\npast the Union Office) is occupied every lunch\ntime.\nTHE\nWl ONE!\n\u2022v.f we uji Ness wiE sS\"c \u00a3 aS ft TTh\nPftEfgHcfls Ff l|, tIh nj oR CuSSi SttttieH+hi'nk is i Av Si V QS iT TO THE TIM cS( Sj | BUSINESS CflHE\" \\KC MC,HTCLU(\nPage20\nPatricia Hughes' Book of Time Fillers No 17\nAs we have a few minutes to go before our\nnext gramophone record here on Radio 3, let\nme tell you a little about Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra and its forthcoming\nconcert season. As featured in this year's Handbook, this full size symphony orchestra\nis currently under the direction of Richard\nDickins, a busy professional freelance con-duct or, and has recently been acclaimed for\nits characteristic interpretation of Mozart,\nthe virtuosity of its players, and its overall\nprofessional attitude.\nSometime in December we shall be broadcasting a performance of Shostakovitch's Sym-phony No 5 and the overture to Weber's Der Freischiitz; in 1984 there will also be a chance to hear Tchaikovsky's5 th Symphony,\nMo-z art's Clarinet Concerto, and Borodin's Polo-v tsi an Dances. Other events in the Orchestra's calendar include a 'Well Known\nTunes' festival, held in Silwood Park during a weekend, various musical evenings and possibly a joint venture with the College amateur\nchoral society.\nThe Orchestra is keen to welcome new\nplayers, and you can find out more either at\nits stall at the Freshers' Fair or by going to the\nfirst rehearsal this Wednesday at 7:00pm in\nthe Great Hall\u2014preferably bringing a string\nplayer, (pause)\nAnd now with the time at 8:30 we have\nsome muf i cke from the Court of Terence the\nTone-Deaf, played on this record by the\nFflangehorn Inharmonia Consort with The\nBoat Club\nThe Boat Club is one of the most successful\nsports clubs at Imperial College. The boat-house at Putney is equipped with its own\nrowing tank for teaching novices to row, and\nalso contains the best fleet of boats of any of\nthe UL colleges, looked after by boatman,\ncoach and former international oarsman, Bill\nMason.\nLast season was highly successful with all\nlevels of the club winning events at open\nregattas, and 44 wins being recorded in all\ncompetitions, including nine of the twelve at\nthe UL regatta.\nMuch of the success was achieved by the\nsenior squad whose season culminated in the\nselection of the first eight to represent England at the Home Countries International.\nAt Henley Royal Regatta, the eight was\nbeaten in the semi-final of the Ladies Plate by\nHarvard the eventual winners. The remainder\nof the senior squad, the cox less four, were\nbeaten in the final of the Visitors' Challenge\nCup by UL BC. At the National Championships, the eight\ngained a bronze medal behind two eights\nfrom the British National Squad. The cox less four also gained a bronze.\nIf you wish to row\u2014at whatever level\u2014\ncome and meet us at the Freshers' Fair on the\nQueen's Lawn\u2014just look for the boats.\nSnK H Monday, October 3 1983 WamM\nThis, the newest society at Imperial, has been\ndescribed as the only College club that sets\nout to perform music badly (on purpose, that\nis) (ready made excuse-ed). In fact we exist to\nencourage music at all levels; we can book\nrooms for rehearsals and (if you like) recitals,\nfind obscure sheet music and, most important\nof all, put you in touch with like-minded\npeople who play whichever other instruments\nyou need in your ensemble.\nObviously, to do this we need a list of all the\nmusical people in the College, so whatever\nyour aspirations/inspirations/expiration s, come to see us at Freshers' Fair and tell us''\nwhat you play/scrape/hit/blow/sing/listen\nto and how well or badly you do it. Nonfreshers or anyone who misses us on Tuesday\ncan telephone us most evenings at 289 6504\n(ask for Richard Williams). Our plans for the\nnext year will depend entirely on how many\npeople contact us, so do let us know of your\nexistence as soon as possible.\nFurthermore, we have some kind of social\nevent lined up for the second week of term; at\nthe time of writing we haven't the faintest idea\nof what-this will be, but someone's suggested\na 'Music to Forget' party with live (dis-pos able) entertainment, so if you have any,\ntasteless or just forgettable music that you'd like to inflict on your fellow-musicians, let us\nknow. Further details at Freshers' Fair and in\nFriday's FELIX. Consoc\nAs its name implies this is the society of\nconniving con-artists. We try our best to be\ndevious and underhand in everything we do.\nAre you aw hinge ing snivelling little bastard?\nIf so join Soc Soc we don't want you. We want\nfine upstanding conservative types with a penchant for conundrums.\nBut suffice it to say if you want to put your\ndevious little nose in the running of the\ncountry do it right. Vote conservative and\njoin Consoc.\nConsoc is a really interesting society. We\nall meet and talk about what a great job\nMaggie is doing and then we contemplate\nways of how to get Tony Benn deported to\nRussia. Then once a year we have our annual\nChristmas card sending to our MPs who go\nout of their way to save us lots of money by\ncutting taxes.\nIf you've got lots of cash, join Consoc and\nwe'll take it off vo u.\\ Felix\n\n"

    "content": "THE HANDBOOK ALTERATIONS\nAdrian James writes about the alterations made to the ICU Handbook by the Exec.\nOUT!\nBars and Refectories\nAs you should have gathered\nfrom Hugh Southey's article on\npage 6 of this Handbook, the\nCollege refectories are not the\nbest places to eat. However, if\nyou must eat there (and only a small percentage of students do\nregularly) here is a guide to them\nand their alternatives.\nSherfield Refectory: the lar\nge st and most popular outlet, this\nprovides several main courses\nand desserts, school dinner style.\nPossibly the least disgusting\nrefectory; there is usually an\nincomprehensibly large queue of\npeople wanting to eat there.\nThe Sherfield Refectory is also\nused for formal College dinners\n(see later).\nSouthside: Even the water\nhere is badly served. The food is\neither recycled from the Sherfield kitchens, or frozen and\n(barely) thawed out. Very few of\nthe staff speak any language\nother than Spanish, which means\nthat when you ask for the grey\nsludge that looks like curry you\nwill be given the green sludge that\nlooks like lasagne, and then when\nyou complain about being over-charged, the staff will jabber at\nyou in some obscure Catalonian\ndialect.\nThe Union Refectory was\nmoved and re-vamped last year\nat great expense, none of it\njustified. It now serves 'fast food'\n(we won't go into why it's called\nthat): chips, beans, hamburgers,\nsausages, plus a 'dish of the day'\n(normally the day before) which\nis cooked in the Sherfield kitchens and re-heated.\nThis room also contains a Lounge Bar which dispenses\nmuch-needed liquid refreshment\nand what are optimistically, described as 'Ploughman's Lunches', although any self-respecting plough man would\nfeed them to his horse. This is\nlittle used, most people pre\nfer ring the Union Bar next door,\nwhere soggy rolls and pies are\ndispensed.\nThe JCR Buttery in the\nSherfield Building sells mostly\npies, chips, sandwiches and\npasties, which are comparable\nwt th what you would get at a British Rail buffet if you weren't In the introduction to the\nCCUs (page 30) and the article on\nrefectories (page 43) I had written\nthat the food and drink served at\nFreshers' Dinners was simply not\nworth \u00a37 (however heavily sub sidi sed) and that the only reason\nfor attending these functions\nwould be to meet people. I am\nstill of that opinion, and from the\nRCSU's refusal to pay for one of\nlast year's dinners and the recent\nmove in City and Guilds Union\nto abolish the dinners entirely, it\nwould seem that other people\nshare my views. Furthermore, I would point out that very few\nstudents other than fresher s and\nvirtually no members of staff\nbother to attend these dinners, so\nthat they merely provide an\nopportunity for fresher s to meet\nother fresher s. The Exec removed my paragraph on formal dinners from\npage 43 (and, for some reason\nknown only to themselves, one\non catering in Linstead Hall) and\nreplaced it with one encouraging\nfresher s to attend the dinners. It\nis reprehensible behaviour on the\npart of the Exec (who will all, of\ncourse, be invited to many formal\ndinners throughout the year) to\ntry to mislead fresher s into\nparting with their money; no\nserious attempt to improve the\nstandard of these functions has\nyet been made by them.\nFinally, having really got into\nthe swing of things, they altered\nthe introduction to the Who's Who of Administrators on page\n36, removing sentences at random and replacing them with bits\nof last year's Handbook, which\nare no less insulting and rather\nless up-to-date. To add insult to\ninjury, Gaynor Lewis insisted on\nremoving the caption from the\nRector's photograph, which\nmakes the reference to it in my\nEditorial obscure to say the least.\nThe reason she gave for this was\nthat she would be embarrassed at\nfuture meetings with Lord\nFlowers if she felt that he had\nbeen made fun of in a Union pub-li cation; I fear he will be more\nworried by the text concerning\nhim (which is serious) than he\nwould have been by the photograph (which wasn't). OUT!\nLinstead: this 1\n5 dealt with 0\n.\n1\nage 4\n4\n. h is widely accepted thai\n1 his service should he done away\nwith; but the provision of an\nevening meal was apparently a condition imposed by the anonymous he ne fai tot who financed\nthe building of [.instead Hall with\nthe well-meaning but misplaced\nhope of founding the basis ol .1\nsocial life like thai in the colleges\nal Oxford and Cambridge. As\nthis has (ailed lor various reasons\n(largely thai Oxford and Cam\nbridge are wha lI hey are almost\nentirely because they are noi in\nthe middle of London) the\nCollege admitted that abolishing\nFormal dinners: As a general\nrule, these are not worth all end ing. You will pay upwards of f_'7 for a meal (hat you would send\nhack in are s laura nt, with very\nun generous amounts of wine,\nport and cold coffee. Many\nUnion societies now hold their\nannual dinners outside College,\nand there was a move las l year in\nCity and Guilds Union lo replace\nthe Freshers' Dinners with a cheaper form of entertainment.\nRemember that the people trying\nlo sell you tickets to Freshers'\nDinners are generally those who\ndo not have lo pay for them, but\nsit at Ihe top table, and make\nspeeches and enjoy themselves\nprobably a great deal more than\nyou will.\nr The Rector collecting at Green Park tube station\nA Warning\nIf for religious or other reasons,\nyou cannot eat some types of\nfood, do not believe anything that\nthe refectory sla ff tell you. Fen\nsome years, die College sole beef\npasties as lamb, which caused I great distress to several religious f minorities who are ot allowed It eat beef. Vegetarians are al st quite likely to be offered fish pie\nAll the refectories Millet !r<>u the same problems the -.i. il\nregard students as a nui:\nand are incompetent, rud t frequently un hygienic.( The\nwas a widely publicised online\n*of cockroaches in the kih !\nsome years ago. and things ha v not improved suite then). Stafi\nare not averse to smoking white\nserving the food, despite the no\nsmoking regulations I he food is\nof poor quality, and badly pre\npared and frequently recycled\nfrom the previous day.\nWhat it comes down lo is that\nall the staff, from the Manager\ndown are paid whether or not the\nfood is eaten. Hence there is no\nincentive for them to provide a good service\nI Felix AVIonday.October 3 1983\n\n"

    "content": "EXEC NEW\nFRESHERS U GM GREAT HALL l pm OCT6 PRESIDENT'S REPORT\nMEWS RESIDENTS\nAt the end of the summer term a number of complaints were received from the\nresidents of the mews at the rear of the Southside Halls, concerning the\nbehaviour of resident students. Noise and objects being thrown out of\nwindows were the main problems. As a result of this, notices are now being\nplaced on the windows warning students that disciplinary action will be taken\nif such behaviour occurs. A document on this matter is now being included in\nthe conditions of acceptance of residence in Southside and Linstead Halls.\nINCOST\nThe \"84 INCOST is being held in Finland and therefore we will not be hosting\nthe conference next year.\nU. A.U. It is almost certain that we will affiliate to the Universities Athletic Union\nwithin the next nine months. Two options are available: (i) enrolling for\nfull membership for the 84-85 session, or (ii) enrolling for an interim year\ninvolving a percentage of athletic clubs for the current session. At present\ndiscussions are still in progress.\nREFECTORIES\nDuring the summer vacation the JCR Buttery has been expanded, refurnished\nand redecorated. As term continues the food service is to expand, with\nemphasis being placed on the sandwich service it currently provides.\nOverall, the increase in refectory prices this session has been set at\napproximately 4%. However, this is being achieved in two stages; everyday\nrefectory prices are to increase by 2.5%, the increase in external occasions/\ndinners being 5.8%, to average about 4%.\nRESIDENCE\nOver the summer a number of new flats were acquired in Hamlet Gardens, and\nrecently a new Head Tenancy in Earls Court Square. Thanks to the effort put\nin by Michael Arthur and the Students Services Office this is the first year\nwe have been able to guarantee places in residence for all fresher s. Due to bad weather a few problems have recently occurred at the Fremantle\nHotel, these being leaking roofs and dampness. After numerous defect reports\nto the Landlord work was in progress by the 20th September. However, this\ndelay may result in a number of rooms being uninhabitable at the beginning\nof term. All students who were to resident in these particular rooms have\nbeen found alternative ac com moda*. \"he rent increase this session K* grant increase.\nS. A.C.T he Summer Accommodation Centre has TJH eff ici en accommodation being fully occupied approximately\n\u00b0yg j* SEAS STUDENTS\nJudgements made at the House of Lords durin-: the\na significant effect on a number of I.e. student\nclassified as home students may now find\ntu dent sly\n\"its. Many s a Ives classified as overseas\nstudents. Fortunately, in most cases where students have been awarded research\ngrants, the departments involved are covering the extra fees involved. A few\nstudents may not be able to pursue their research due to financial problems.\nAnother outcome of the judgement is that some students may be eligible for are fund on fees paid due to incorrect classification? Over 50 students have\nWritten to College stating their case.\" College is presently waiting until a judgement is made on a test case before makin q any policy but the test case\nmay not come before the Courts for some months.\n*82/83 session only.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT\nUNION BUILDING\nDespite the re decoration of several areas of the Union Building, the general\naspect of the building is still fairly tatty. After Freshers' Week, I shall\nbe discussing with House Committee the next stage of the programme to improve\nthe building generally. One major area of change is the Old Refectory on the\nground floor which has been redecorated and refurbished as a weekly night\nclub starting this Saturday.\nSECURITY\nWe have had problems over the summer with the security of the building including\na break into the games machines and vandalism. The Security Officer and I are considering improvements to the Security system.\nSPORTS SHOP'\nWe have moved all the regalia and sports goods out of the Southside shop and\nhave set up a new shop on the Walkway in what used to be the London Student\nTravel Office. The bookshop manager will be responsible for the running of\nthe shop which will sell an increased range of sports goods (all suggestions\nwelcome) plus ties, scarves, T shirts etc.\nwith the departure of LST, I have discussed with a variety of travel agents\nthe possibility of opening a new travel centre on a different site in College.\nMeanwhile LST are still trading from Victoria, and STA who run a similar\nstudent travel service, have an office in Old Brompton Road.\nFRESHERS' WEEK\nWe have for the first time sold an all inclusive Freshers' Week ticket for\n\u00a37, which entitles you to go to all the large events in Freshers' Week\nincluding the Ents Ball on Friday which should be one of the biggest and\nbest carnivals held in the Union Building for some time. I hope to report\nverbally about the progress of Freshers' Week, and especially Freshers' Fair.\nFinance\nWith the Finance section in College, 1 have discussed several changes to the\naccounting system which should enable us to have a much cleaner picture of\nUnion Finance. A new guide for junior treasurers is being produced though\nunfortunately it won't be completed this term, however I have limited number\nof last years version for treasurers who are not sure about what their job\nent a i1s. CRASH PAD\nCrash Pad is operating until at least the end of the week. The venue is the\nGreen Committee Room on the third floor of the Union Building and it is free.\nBring along a sleeping bag.\nI have wasted much time chasing up Estates to get something done about the\nappalling state of the Bars and Finance to provide reliable Bar accounts.\nI expect to see some results in both these areas fairly soon.\n\n"

    "content": "News\nStop\nThe\nPresses!\nThe artwork for this years ICU\nHandbook was recalled from the\nprinters only hours before the\ncopy deadline, in a last minute\ncensorship bid.\nFuming\nThe call to stop the presses came\nfrom ICU President Gaynor\nLewis. The fuming sabbatical\nphoned the printers as soon as\nshe learnt of certain 'offensive'\narticles in the Handbook.\nBut the editor Adrian James was at\nthe printers when the censorship\ncall came through. He was ordered\nto return to the FELIX Office, and\nbring his artwork with him.\nAmazed\nAmazed Adrian said \"I went\nrigid when I heard the news; it\nwas like a bolt from the blue.\" He\nstormed back to IC to face the\nexecutive rumpus. They\nannounced that they should have\nread the Handbook before it\nwent to the printers.\nThe reason that they failed to do so\nwas that they didn't expect the\nHandbook to be produced on time!\nAdrian James pointed out that\nthis was their own fault and\nthreatened to resign if any\nchanges were made in the Handbook.\nAnd Publications Supremo David\nRowe reluctantly accepted\nAdrian's decision.\nFrantic\nIt was then left to FELIX staff to\nmake the changes that the Exec\ndemanded. The team worked\nfrantically through the night in a bid to minimise the delay caused\nby the censorship mix-up.\nAnd only days later the Exec\ncensors struck again.\nBut this time their target was the\nRag Mag, edited by Carl Burgess.\nThe ruthless trio were let loose on\nthe Mag with a fine tooth comb removing jokes indiscriminately.\nMr Burgess was too upset to\ncomment.\nThe Last Laugh\nCarl Burgess,Rag mag Editor,having been instructed by an aloof and\nunfeeling executive to destroy the products of his deranged mind set about the\ndismantling of his publication with his customary gusto.This leads us to a very\nintriguing question of what humour is and do people have a right to laugh at\nanybody else.Here is a case for the defence.\nHow do you fuck a vegetable?\nEat his wheelchair\nNow this joke is extremely derogatory but you can see how\nfunny it is only if you are not\nanticipating the answer. Only\npeople who think that invalids\nare mental deficient s would think\nlike that and I can only say I was\nimpressed by the multi-layered\nplay on words in this joke. I think\nbeing offensive is a matter of\nintent; I did not deliberately attempt to be offensive, I was only\nattempting to find the jokes I found the most amusing and put\nthem in.\nWhat have Princess Grace and\nSue Barker got in common?\nThey've both been fucked by\nCliffs.\nWhats the difference between\nPrincess Grace and Glen Hoddle?\nHoddle can take corners.\nWell here again the joke is on\nthe play on words. I don't have\nanything against any of the above\ncharacters, it's just that I found\nthe jokes funny.\nEighty epileptics committed suicide\nyesterday after attempting a world record when they failed to fit in a telephone booth.\nThis was just a play on words. I admit I thought this one up and I was only trying to be funny. I'm sorry if 1 failed.\nDid you hear about Stunted\nWillie Jackson the Worlds\nfirst thalidomide pop singer\nwith his No 1 song 'I 've got\na puncture in my wheelchair and my arms aren't long enough to change the\ntyre blues'.\nNow this is just one of the most\namazingly funny things I have\never heard. It's even comparable\nwith Red Sovine's Teddy Bear,\nand if that got to number one,\nwhat's all the complaint about?\nWhat have niggers and hy pt other mia got\nin common?\nThey both attack old people.\nWell here we have the token\nracist joke. This was told to me by\nmy little brother. I found it very\nfunny because again it was based\nupon a certain characteristic\ngiven to certain groups.\nie Rastus \u2014 large member\nIrishmen \u2014 thick\nJews \u2014 miserly\nand so on and so forth.\nHow do you kill a geriatric? a) hook their walking sticks to the back of a bus.\nb) plug their hearing aids into the mains.\nHhy did the old lady cross the road?\nBecause she didn't see the jug ger naut.\nI got home one night and\npicked up a copy of the Number l Sun and my mind was overwhelmed by the amazingly witty\nway they wrote about geriatric\n\\ Monday.October 3 1983 \\\nmuggings and such like and so I pondered deeply on the subject\nand came up with the above,\nagain I am not trying to be\noffensive about geriatrics. After\nall I'm going to be one (I hope).\nWhy did the elephant cross the road?\nBecause it was stapled to the baby's head.\nWhat do you call several babies drowned in\napple juice?\nInfanticider.\nThe first joke was just a piss-take on all the cross the road\njokes starting with\nWhy did the chicken\nthen\nWhy did the baby\nSo, the natural progression was\nWhy did the elephant\nAgain I tried my best to be\namusing with this one.\nThe second is just a play on\nwords which I thought was quite\nclever. I am not going to go\naround drowning babies or any\nother such infant. Babies are nice\nand cuddly. I used (?) to be a baby\nmyself.\nSome of the grossest jokes were\nfrom sick ie Sean Davis, our\ndemented Irish Hon Sec. Quite\nnaturally he did not want it to be\nknown what a filthy little mind he\nhas so he censored his name from\nthe credits.\nOn a final note if you didn't find any of the above in the least\nbit funny please feel free to write\nto the FELIX Office and tell me\nwhy.\nIf you got any jokes you feel\noffended by please send them in\nand state your reasons.\nFelix\n\n"

Any resemblance to\npersons living or dead is purely\ncoincidental.\n\"Ah me, what am I to do now?\" thought\nSmarty Saylor aloud to himself as he lay\nawake in a dingy room in Evelyn Gardens. He\nwas in a right fix. Unemployed, broke, research in ruins, and sharing his room with\ncockroaches, silver fish and noisy plumbing;\ncould he sink any lower?\nSmarty felt the beginnings of a hangover\nthrobbing in his skull. His eyes rolled like\ngritty marbles and the room began to gyrate\naround him. Faces familiar and strange swam\nbefore his eyes. \"That third pint of ginger\nbeer I had last night was one too many,\" he\ngroaned as he sank into a faint.\nSmarty was rudely awakened by the sound\nof 1,000 people un enthusiastically clapping a small procession led by the Baron being\nwheeled on by his sidekick John Secretary.\nHe suddenly realised where he was. Gone\nwere the cockroaches and silverfish of Evelyn Gardens! In their place were the cockroaches and silverfish of the Grand Hall in the\nSurefield Building. The new citizens of\nCheapskate had gathered together for the\nfirst time.\nFor it was Stalers' Day in Cheapskate: a tradition dating back to the depths of anti-quit y. No less a person than the Baron himself\nwould give the Address.\n\"Psst,\" he psst ed at John Secretary,\nJohnny boy.\"\nBy\nJuvenal\nMr Secretary was one step ahead of the\nBaron, instead of the compulsory three steps\nbehind.\n\"Number two my Lord,\" he replied.\nThe Baron prepared himself to deliver his\nsecond speech.\n\"Good morning.\"\nAt these words, three of his audience fell\ninto a deep slumber.\n\"My name is Baron Weed of Cheapskate;\nI'm one of those people who seek to increase\ntheir status in life by incorporating their address into their name. Around here, what I say goes.\"\n\"In one ear and out the other,\" thought Mr\nSecretary.\n\"I make this speech every year. It is probably the most monotonous, boring, in sign i fig ant, irrelevant speech you will ever hear\nbut I have given it every year since 1971 and\nno one has written a new one for me yet.\" He\nscowled at Mr Secretary, who was fast a sleep. \"Yes, I know it's boring, I fell asleep\nduring it in 1978 myself.\n\"Now you won't believe how important I think I am; whoops, I mean I think you would\nnot believe how important I am, so I won't even start to tell you.\n\"Some of you may think that with so much\nto do during these few days: registration,\nfinding your way round, meeting new friends,\nthat coming along here to listen to me rambling on at you till I get fed up with it all and go\nback to bed, is a complete, utter and total\nwaste of time. Well, lean tell you it isn't. In the\nfirst place, I enjoy it. Secondly, by the time\nI 've ground you down, you are much more\neasy and pliable for my lesser initiates to\ndeal with. Fourthly, I do so enjoy dressing up\nin this tri corn and embroidered gown. To be\nquite frank with you, it's not often I get the\nchance to dress like this outside the lodge.\"\nSuddenly, Smarty jolted upright. He realised that if only he could become a citizen of\nCheapskate all his problems would be so lv ed. Then he could get a job, have some\nmoney, find a place to live, and carry on with\nhis research.\n\"But how can I become a citizen?\" Smarty\nwhined ninny ish ly. Who is Dr Hargreaves and is he the most\npompous, stuck-up, overpaid member of\nCollege?\nDo Profs Gutenhuis and Murgatroyd really\nexist?\nWhy is Professor Eric Brown of Civ Eng\ngoing to have his name splatter d all over the\nnext issue of FELIX in a most uncomplimentary manner?\nRead the answer to these questions and\nmany more in the next thrilling episode of\nThe Baron of Cheapskate.\nPage221\nBEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS\nNumber 1 John Hilary Smith BA CBE,\nCollege Secretary.\nJohn Smith came to Imperial College in\n1978 following a career in the diplomatic\nservice. His last posting was as Governor to\nthe Gilbert and Ellice Islands where his role\nwas to bring the islands towards independence. Mementos of this period adorn Mr\nSmith's office on Level 5 in the Sherfield\nBuilding and suggest that this was probably\nthe most enjoyable part of his career.\nHe is certainly an extremely effective and\nefficient administrator and as such has been\nquite frustrated during his period at Imperial\nCollege. He was rather surprised by the\nability of entrenched sections of the College\nto prevaricate. He has often achieved reforms at IC with only the support of the\nUnion. Indeed, he is quite prepared to appear\nbefore a UGM to explain College policy. To\nconfirmed Smith watchers like myself these\noccasions are quite illuminating.\nMr Smith uses slow measured phrases,\npausing slightly, with his head inclined gazing\ninto the far corners of the auditorium. Even\nduring daily meetings he adopts the same\ntechnique, immediately one is reminded of\nthe Great White administrator on the banks\nof the Niger among the unwashed masses. It\nhas been observed that the only changes that\noccur when 'Smith of Sherfield' becomes\nannoyed is that the inclination of the head\nbecomes greater and the pauses longer with\na quiet sarcasm becoming apparent.\nHe has a reputation for dumping duffers\nwho invariably are found cluttering sections\nof the Sherfield Building. After gazing at the\nsmile of the tiger they find themselves in what\namounts to administrative Siberia dealing\nwith trivia.\nMy favourite Smithian anecdote concerns\nhis period as Deputy President of the students Union at University College London.\nPart of his responsibility was for Rag. This\nwas rather difficult in the early post war\nperiod but John Smith hit on the idea of\nputting a replica Eros in Piccadilly Circus (the\noriginal being held in safe keeping). Unfortunately the Police had other ideas and prevented the papier mac he figure being placed\non the plinth. A \u00a35 donation to Rag will reveal\nwhat happened in the ensuing male e.A case\nof the poacher turned gamekeeper!\nThe Mole\n\\Manday,October3 19831 I Felix\nM "

First\nof all I would like to point out that 'veggie'\ndoes not necessarily mean vegetarian. Veggies are small in number but as they say 'small\nis beautiful'. The meetings, supper parties, etc\nthat Vegsoc hold have a friendly personal\natmosphere that can only be achieved in a small society.\nEvery Thursday lunch time Vegsoc takes\nlunch at the RCA, meeting outside Beit Arch\nbetween 12:30 and 12:45pm. There are fortnightly supper parties, to which veggies bring\na vegetarian dish.

    "content": "No fun in Southsidc\u2014Official\nNew students arriving in the\nSouthside Halls of Residence will\nhave to agree to a stiff new set of\nregulations devised by College or\nface expulsion from the Hall.\nThese regulations have been\ndrafted to pacify the Mews\nresidents who live around College.\nThis is the result of a long\nrunning campaign by Mews\nresidents who object to the noise\nand disturbance originating from\nthe Southside Halls. Several\nincidents have recently increased\nthe level of protest, these include\na bottle crashing through a skylight and eggs posted through\nletter boxes. This is especially\nserious because certain residents\nemploy armed bodyguards with\norders to shoot first and ask\nquestions later.\nA meeting was held late last\nsession to discuss this problem,\nthe meeting involved the Wardens, Estates, Don Monro and\nthe then President Stephen Goulder. This was followed by a meeting between the Rector and\nrepresentatives of the residents\nduring the summer in his office\non Level 5. Despite the Wardens\nand local policeman Paul\nGooderson being present outside\nthey were never invited to con tri bute. The Rector, however,\nstrongly supported student interests arguing that a certain level\nof noise must be expected.\nThe draft regulations that\nemerged from the discussion\nincluded:\n\u2022No noise after 11:00pm \u2022No shouting out of the windows.\n\u2022No activity designed to cause\nannoyance or disturbance\nBreach of these regulations\ncould result in residents being\nliable to expulsion from Hall.\nIf these regulations are not\neffective then the residents may\ntake legal action. If they do\nobtain a court injunction against\nfurther nuisance the situation is\npotentially very serious. Each\nfurther disturbance would then\nconstitute a contempt of court. If\nthe nuisance still persists then\nSouthside could be closed.\n_ Carl Burgess demonstrates what not to do in your Hall oj Residence.\nLST\nquit\nLondon Student Travel were told\nto quit Imperial College during\nthe summer by Deputy President\n.Christine Teller. She took this\naction after discovering that LST\nwere using their current office\nrent free and were contributing\nno money to IC Union, one of\ntheir principal shareholders.\nLST moved into Imperial\nCollege in 1978 when they were\nallowed to occupy a room in the\nUnion Building. They were\nformed as a partnership between\nthe Exchange Travel Group and\nvarious London student unions\nwith the aim of providing cheap\ntravel for students. They operated rent free for the first year to\nenable them to become established. In the years that followed LST\nmoved to the Walkway in Sherfield. However, successive Deputy Presidents failed to formalise\ntheir contract and LST continued\nto occupy an office rent free.\nChristine Teller discovered this\nstate of affairs and told LST that\nthis situation was intolerable. She\nasked for a written offer within a month. LST failed to come up\nwith any suitable offer in time\nand they were requested to leave\nthe campus.\nThis should come as no\nsurprise since LST have not lived\nup to expectations. They have\nbeen providing a poor service,\nand have allegedly provided large\nprofits for their parent company\nas a result of the preferential\ntreatment they receive from\nstudent unions.\nWinking Legal\nThe Tiddlywinks Rag Stunt will\nbe held again at its traditional\nvenue in Oxford Street this year.\nThe stunt, usually held on the\nsecond Saturday of term, was\ntransferred to the Kings Road\nlast year after complaints from\nthe Police.\nThe collection will be made on\n1\n5 October for MENCAP using\ntheir cans and licences. These can\nbe collected between 9:00am and\n9:30am from CCU offices and\nMore Racist Tory Cuts\nfrom here will move off to\nMarble Arch. The finish will\nbe held at Eros at 12:30 where\nICU sabbaticals will lead 'Ring-a Roses' around Eros. Gaynor j Lewis will call a 'Hey Vivo' j before everyone adjourns to the j Cockney Pride for a well-earned\ndrink.\n(Gaynor tells me that she\nwill buy a pint for anyone who\ncomes up to her in the Cockney\nPride after the Rag stunt-Ed.)\nThe Department of Education\nand Science has effectively reversed the House of Lords\njudgement concerning the classification of overseas students.\nThis means that a number of\nstudents at IC who had been\nclassed as home students last\nsession will have to register as\noverseas students and face bills of\nup to \u00a32,700.\nTo be classed as a home\nstudent a person had to prove\nthat he was resident in the UK or\nthe EEC for three years prior to\nthe start of the course.\nIn 1978 Lord Denning ruled\nthat foreign nationals who had\nmoved to the UK to study before\nthey undertook a degree course\ndid not satisfy the Ordinary\nResidence regulation. This decision reached the House of Lords\non appeal and was overturned in\nDecember 1982.

Proposed by: Michael Newman (Life Sci.2)\nSeconded by: Liberal Club.\nI.C.U. Notes:\n1. That B. S.M. Union organises and holds annually an event called 'Hon. Porn.\nNight' this has involved the showing of hard-core pornography and strippers\nperforming lesbian acts on stage. This is completely paid for by R. S.M.U. funds and by an admission charge.\n2. The pornographic business is a large multi-million pound industry relying\nfor its profits on the corruption and sexual degradation of young children,\nteenagers, adults and animals.\n3. Pornography is aimed primarily at a male audience and involves the portrayal\nof women and sexual organs to be used and abused. It portrays, perpetuates\nand derives from an attitude that women are inferior, are bodies to be\nleered at, to be laughed at, to be masturbated to and to be used and raped.\n1. It is the right of individuals over the age of 18 to entertain themselves in\nwhatever manner they choose so long as it does not hurt anyone else and is\ndone in private.\nI.C.U. Believes: \u2022\n1. That this Union in allowing such an event to take place supports its\ncontinuation.\n2. The event is an expression by Mines and this Union of an active support not\nfor freedom but for the pornographic industry. The Mines Union has become\na marketing outlet for hard-core porn.\n3. This motion does not endanger the individuals freedom to choose his/her\nentertainments. It does not seek to prevent people going to such events.\nJ \u00bb. The majority of members of this Union do not want I.C.U. acting in support\nof pornography.\nI.C.U. Instructs:\n1. That the President of this Union should make it known to all I.C. students\nand staff and to the University of London Union that we do not actively\nsupport the pornographic industry and have NEVER consciously intended to do\nso.\n2. That 'Hon. Porn. Night' and other similar events should not be held on Union\npremises. This decision to be made by and enforced by the I.C.U. Exec.\n3- That Union funds, equipment, transport and titles should not be used in\norganising and staging pornographic events inside or outside college. This\nincludes Constituent Unions and all Clubs and Societies. Any offenders shari\nhave all support, monetary and otherwise, from this Union promptly withdrawn\nuntil they can satisfy the Executive that they will not contravene Union\nPolicy on this again.

    "content": "Freshers week: the ghastly truth!\nThe FELIX guide to fresher s week\nOn arrival at Imperial College, most people\nhave little idea where the various places of\nimportance are located within the College. To\nremedy this situation the College and Union\nconspire on the first day to send fresher s on a sometimes fruitless search around College for\nUnioncard, grant cheque and registration slip.\nOn Monday morning queues of almost\nBiblical proportions build up in the JCR as\nmost students attempt to register. The experienced student would probably wait to register\nwhen the Rector's Reception takes place at\n10:00am. This event, which all first years feel\nobliged to attend, usually records a resound-ding zero on the c lapo meter with the Rector\nLord Flowers delivering his only speech yet\nagain. When they have wheeled the old duffer\noff, the Union Sabbatical Officers re-read last\nyear's Freshers' Reception speeches, 'get in-vol ved... rewarding... UGMs a must etc, etc'\nThis ends at 11:00am leaving enough time for\nyou to find your department for their intro-duct ion; you will have a chance to meet your\ntutors for the first time. At this point the\ndifficulty of the course and the failure rates\nare usually mentioned, as there is no need for\nthe 'nice guy' image now that you're here.\nIn the afternoon Scientists, Engineers and\nMiners split up to go to their CCU UGMs at\nwhich you are introduced to your CCU, its\nactivities and its officers\u2014a must for those in\nneed of comic relief. The UGM will probably\nfinish by 4:30 after which you will be free for\nthe rest of the day. This will give you the\nopportunity to chat up the boy/girl you have\nhad your eye on ever since you arrived at\nCollege and ask him/her to the Freshers'\nParty later on that evening in the Union\nBuiding.\nHaving woken up, hopefully not in your\nown bed, you drag yourself off to your\ndepartment where your course is explained to\nyou in greater detail. At this juncture the\ndedication needed to complete the course is\nraised in graphic detail. However, one does\nnot need to be Saint Augustine to graduate.\n....and don't forget all those vital little items\nfor the end of your first week: Optrex (for\neyes, bloodshot, two), mouthwash (take\ninstead of, rather than after, 14 pints of\nYoungs), deodorant (until we learn to wash\nour clothes!), some clean needles (for sewing\nof course) and those all-important precautionary measures (just in case you strike lucky).\nThe afternoon is devoted to Freshers' Fair\nwhere all the Union clubs and societies run a stall (see centre spread). Take a pen and paper\nto make a note of the introductory events of\nclubs that interest you. The highlight of the\nafternoon is a visit to the FELIX Office,\nwhere the FELIX Editor tries to cream off the\nmost interesting and talented new arrivals.\nThere is the Life Sciences Party in the JCR\nin the evening to which those in the know will\ngo since it is consistently one of the best\nevents of the year.\nBy Wednesday you reach your first lecture\nand come down to earth. By tradition this is\ndelivered by the most boring member of the\ndepartment.\nIn the afternoon the sports trials take place.\nThe squads are picked early in the session, so\nif you wish to play for ICU or your CCU you\nmust take part in these trials.\nLater on in the evening is the Gangsters\nand Molls Party with free cocktail for all\nthose who dress up. This is the event of the\nweek and anybody who is anybody will be\nthere; an ideal opportunity to see the President wearing next to nothing\u2014but don't let\nthis discourage you.\nThursday abounds with lectures and labs.\nThe Freshers' UGM takes place at 1:00pm. This is usually a forum for various Union\nOfficers, who strive to humiliate each other\nand indulge in backstabbing.\nEvery Thursday evening the Union entertainments committee show popular films\nrecently off the West End run. This evening\nthey will get things going with a double bill of\nCat People, possibly the most erotic film of\nlast year and Quest for Fire, possibly the film\nhaving the most amusing cast credits of last\nyear.\nIf you can still stand come Friday evening\nthen there is the opportunity to go and see\nsome really great bands at the Freshers' Ball.\nIt features Clint Eastwood and General Saint\non the first night of their nationwide tour.\nThere is also a barbeque, two discos, all night\nfilms and steel bands.\nFELIX Check List\n1. Registration Monday and Tuesday in\nthe SCR on Level 2 in the Sherfield Building.\nSubsequently on Level 3 in the Sherfield\nBuilding. Bring a pen and retain the stamped\nslip.\n2. Unioncards In the JCR Monday and\nTuesday, for the rest of the week in the Union\nSenior Common Room and subsequently in\nthe Union Office. You need to bring two\npassport sized photographs and the aforementioned registration slip.\n3. Grant cheque You need to take your\nUnioncard or other means of identification to\nthe SCR on Monday and Tuesday on Level 3\nin the Sherfield Buidling.\n4. Freshers' Week Ticket for just \u00a37 you\ncan attend all fresher s' week events for free\n(except the Life Sci Party). Available from\nICU and CCU offices.\n5. Food and Provisions The nearest supermarket to College is Waitrose on Gloucester\nRoad. There is also the Union shop which is\nto be found in Southside close to the RCS\nOffice.\n6. Recommended texts, stationery and IC\ndiaries All available from the Bookshop\nwhich is on the Concourse, Level 2, Sherfield.\n7. Lockers See departmental superintend ants or ask at the departmental office.
