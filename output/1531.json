    "content": "My wild Irish prose\nMax Eggl rewritesthehistoryoftheEmeraldIsleinCrusaderKingsII\nntro: Murchad mac Diarmata\n(1026 \u2013 1070) was a King of\nDublin and Leinster, and if\nyou haven\u2019t heard of him, no\nbig deal. He didn\u2019t really accomplish that much, and thus his name\nhas been lost in the realms of history.\nHowever, last week, I decided, with the\naid of Crusader Kings 2, to give the name\nof Murchad new meaning! Playing out\nhis life in full glory, and doing things differently from the way he did, Murchad\n(me) achieved crazy things! If you want\nto discover how this historical \ufb01gure\nlived out his life in my alternate universe,\nread his diary that was discovered and\ntranslated just yesterday!\nAnno 1066: To whomever will read\nthisinthefuture,IamMurchadMacDi-armata, Earl of Dublin! Hopefully when\nI \ufb01nish this document, I will be what I\nhave dreamed of, ever since I was a little boy \u2013 to be the King of Ireland! I will\nunite the Green Isle under one banner,\nand make it the force that it deserves to\nbe. To accomplish this, I have a devious\nplan, that hopefully will play out exactly\nas I want it to. Firstly, my dad is the Earl\nof Leinster, and therefore I will be the\nEarl of Leinster when he \ufb01nally kicks the\nbucket... GOD why is it taking so long?\nPatience, Murchad, patience, your time\nwill come, just gotta keep repeating that.\nSecondly I have to change these goddamn succession laws. I mean, C\u2019MON,\nwho the hell still uses Gavelkind Succession these days? You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s\nGavelkind?\u201d Exactly! No one even\nknows about it. Well basically when I\ndie, my stu\ufb00 won\u2019t go to my oldest child,\nbut will be split up in even bits for all of\nthem. The fact that I have 3 kids doesn\u2019t\nreally help. So my \ufb01rst plan on the\nagenda is changing it to seniority suc-cession! Boom Shakalaka, now Donnell\n(my oldest son) is my heir! Perfetto, now\nmy realm won\u2019t be split up when I meet\nmy maker! Next thing on the agenda is\ngetting rid of my chancellor. Seamus is a\nsuch an idiot. He managed to insult the\nDuke of Connacht\u2019s wife while he was\nstanding next to her... God, I had to send\nlots of horses and gifts to keep him from\ngoing to war with me. I HAVE to get rid\nof Seamus... hmmm I have to see about\nthat. I mean without a good chancellor\nhow am I supposed to fabricate claims\non other counties? Without any claims I\ncant even legitimately take over places...\nman this King of Ireland thing is looking\nharder and harder to achieve.\nAnno 1075: Oh God, where to start...\nWell dad is \ufb01nally pushing up the dai-sies! That means I\u2019m the Earl of Leinster!\nDouble trouble! I now have the armies\nof Leinster and Dublin combined, which\nmakesmeoneofthemostpowerfulmen\n(behind a few others) in Ireland! So now,\nthis power (and the extra cash) allowed\nme to hatch a dastardly plot! I murdered\nSeamus (yep, the chancellor, involving\nan unfortunate incident including rocks\nand a river), and installed his son Rhiann! Such a beautiful plan, and Rhiann\ndoesn\u2019t even have a clue!!!! Anyway, so I\nsent Rhia of to Breifne to bribe my way\nto claiming it for myself (and to stop him\nfrom getting suspicious), and viol\u00e1, 2\nyears later, I have the Causus Belli (rea-son for war) I need to attack Breifne! So\nin 1068, my troops overran that place,\nand now you may also call me the Earl of\nBreifne! So now with the army of three\ncounties, I looked for my next target!\nLuckily for me Rhiann dug out an old\nhistory book where it claimed (rather\ndubiously) that Ossory was part of the\nduchy of Leinster! Since I am the Earl\nof Leinster, I mean it\u2019s not thaaat much\nof a step to be the duke, right? Well, you\nmight not agree, but it was enough for\nme! I started calling myself the Duke\nof Leinster (instead of just an earl!) and\nnow had the reason to take over Ossory!\nPiece of cake!\nHmmmm what else happened....oh\nyeah wifey died, can\u2019t really remember\nher name! She died about the same time\nmy bastard child (who I had with my\nlover) was born... suspicious... Anyway, I\ndidn\u2019t really want to spend the rest of my\nlife alone, so I looked round for a good\nwife in the bridal catalogue, and then\nmy eyes fell upon her! Szo\ufb01\u00e1 was a Polish princess (plus points!!) and an absolute peach! Married her within a year of\nwifey dying.\nThat\u2019s it for now! Till next time!!! I have\ngreat things planned, and Rhia has many\nthings in motion!\nAnno 1086: Bad day for the house\nmac Diarmata... Donnell passed away\nfrom severe stress (is that even possi-ble?!?!)... anyway gotta live on... at least\nI have a beautiful grandson, F\u00e1el\u00e1n...\nand even though he prefers to play with\ndolls instead of swords, I think he has\na lot of promise. Anyway, \u201cWhat\u2019s new\non the King of Ireland front?\u201d you ask.\nRemember the Duke of Connacht? Well\nhis son, Ruadri, (whose mother had\nbeen insulted) is being a right stroppy\nlittle twit. I usurped the title of Duke of\nConnacht(Breifnekindaispartofit,and\nI mean, I\u2019m a much better duke anyway)\nand forced him to become my vassal,\nall totally acceptable things! So he gets\npissed and starts plotting to kill F\u00e1el\u00e1n,\nyeah I know, shocking. The NERVE of\nsome people. Really, I had him thrown\nin to my dungeon... kinda was forced\nto let him out though, after everyone\nthreatened to declare war on me. Sucks\nto be not as powerful as all your enemies\ncombined. Oh yeah, I also took over\nUlster, after Rhi had fabricated a claim,\nsaying my uncle\u2019s mother\u2019s dog had been\nthe Earl of Ulster, which means it\u2019s mine\nnow. Pretty standard stu\ufb00. Also I created the title of Duchy of Meath just because I could. Good times! That means\nnow I am the Duke of Meath, Leinster\nand Connacht as well as the Earl of Ulster. My plan is coming to fruition, soon\nwhen I own more than half of Ireland,\nI will be able to crown myself King of\nIreland, MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! (P.S.\nGotta do it fast though... I\u2019m 60 now,\nmost people don\u2019t even live to 50 these\ndays... gotta hurry up!)\nAnno 1096: Ladies and gentlemen,\nmay we present you: THE KING OF\nIRELAND!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAH. Yes, dear reader, we have\nsuccessfully battled, bribed and fabricated our way to the Irish throne! The\nlooks on the people\u2019s faces when we announced our royal ancestry and therefore claim to the Irish throne was MAGNIFICENT. We are now known as King\nMurchad I \u2018the Great\u2019 of Ireland! Sounds\ngreat, we know! Anyway, once we had\nrisen to shoulder this great responsibil-ity, we started to declare war on all the\nrebel factions that still controlled more\nthan half of Ireland, and free the poor\nhelpless peasants (thinking about it... the\npeasants weren\u2019t actually that grateful;\npunishment is in order). So, we decided\nThomond would be \ufb01rst. Thomond, in\nthe southwest, was just a random tar-get, seriously, who could withstand us\nnow!! However, for some reason, Brian\nof Munster came to the aid of the Earl\nof Thomond. Split my armies in two,\ncrushed him and crushed Thomond too.\nHowever, we felt a bit merciful, as Brian\nhad become a cripple in some battle, so\nwe let him go home and keep Munster a\nwhile longer. A year later, in our pledge\nto free Ireland from the tyranny of rebel\nlords, we took over Ormond and Desmond, then we were feeling generous,\nand gave the royal Irish army Christmas\no\ufb00! That\u2019s all till now in Ireland.\nSo what\u2019s up in England!? We have\nbeen getting strange messages, that\nthere are now two factions in England,\none that styles itself as \u201cLancaster\u201d and\none that calls itself \u201cEngland\u201d\n. These\ntwo seem to be at war with each other...\nhmmmm I wonder at the possibilities.\nIf they are still \ufb01ghting once we have\nmopped up here, we can perhaps cut\nourselves a slice o\ufb00 of England as well....\nhmmmm!\nAnno 1106: Yes dear reader, this King\nis still alive and kicking, even though we\nhave reached the respectable age of 80!\nSo what has happened in the past few\nyears? We managed to free Oriol (1097),\nTyrone (1098, whose earl was waging\nwar in Scotland at the time. How consid-erate, it made it that much more easier)\nand \ufb01nally Tyroconnel (1099). Finally,\ncontrolofallofIreland!Success.Howin-teresting,thatwe,asayoungchild,could\nhave dreamed so big and then achieved\nit! Anyway Rhi was (and is) still around,\nnow Chancellor of Ireland (he certainly\nmoved up with us), and as we were\nbored, we sent him to fabricate a claim\non the Isle of Man! Since he did \ufb01nd a\nrecord of our grandfather\u2019s horse, being ridden by the Earl of the Isle of Man,\nit followed that the Isle of Man should\nbe Irish property! We ourselves led the\narmies there, and subsequently crushed\nany resistance! Anyway, so Ruadri (re-member him?) was plotting again, and\ndid manage to convince a few people\nthat HE was the Duke of Connacht...\nHe just doesn\u2019t know when to give up!\nAnyway, we \ufb01nally had him executed,\nas he was getting annoying and nobody\never doubted us being the Duke of Connacht anymore! A year ago, there were\nrevolts in Desmond... We are wondering why. With such a benevolent King,\nwho would ever want to revolt? Anyway,\nwe crushed the peasants and cruci\ufb01ed\nevery tenth survivor! That should teach\nthem!\nOh... also Szo\ufb01\u00e1 died. She was our\neverything. We almost committed suicide in the following months, but we\nwere too important to do that. However,\nwe swore to ourselves, that we would\nremain celibate... at the age of 80 that is\neasy anyway, we think! Anyway we are\nvery tired now... more tired than usual.\nWe hope that we our kingdom survives\nand lives on... F\u00e1el\u00e1n will have to make\nan amazing king, to hold all the earls\nin check. We however do not care any-more, we are giving this kingdom to the\nnext generation.\nThe following day, the King was found\ndead!Hehadpeacefullydiedinhissleep.\nWhile this story may be over, the story\nof F\u00e1el\u00e1n and the Kingdom of Ireland is\nnot!\nConclusion: Now you may be won-dering, if what I wrote here is a pure\n\ufb01gment of my imagination. I swear to\nyou, it is not! All that was written by\nMurchad, actually did really occur in the\ngame! So if you are thinking, \u201cHey this\ngame sounds way cool!\u201d then get yourselves a copy of Crusader Kings 2, and\nsee who you can make King. Create your\nown history!\nI Not pictured \u2013 the destruction of the\nUniversity of Oxford. Finally\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n22\nCOME AT ME BRAH....!\nOH GOD! Don\u2019t hit me! Anything but\nthe face!

You would not think that\nin a university filled with scientists,\nengineers and medics, the students\nwould be that interested in theatre.\nHowever, these clubs are more than\ninterested, they are good at it too,\nfinding new ways to entertain their\naudiences with their talent and pas-sion.\nICSM Drama\u2019s latest play, All The\nMeanings of Spring, running next\nweek, is set to be another such ex-ample. It is an all-new play, directed\nby final year medic, Richard Newman. However, he is not only the di-rector, he is also the wrote the play.\nTo find out more about all the meanings of spring in November, I caught\nup with the playwright.\nRhys Davies: Hello Richard. Thank\nyou for talking with me. Perhaps\nyou could start by explaining what\nthe play is about?\nRichard Newman: This play is about\ncoming to university and being in a\nnew environment where nobody\nknows you and trying decide who\nyou should be and why. It tries to\ncapture that initial feeling of escape\nand freedom that we have as fresh-ers. It is also about putting thoughts\ninto action, as we often don\u2019t do, and\nseeing where those actions take us\nand why we may have social and personal barriers preventing us from\nperforming those actions in reality.\nSo those are the themes but specifically it is the intertwined story\nof three freshers discovering their\nfeelings and how these affect their\nrelationships and lives.\nRD: That\u2019s quite ambitious. Where\ndid the idea for the play come\nfrom?\nRN: The whole thing started in three\nplaces. I\u2019ve wanted to direct a play\nfor ICSM Drama before but was unfortunately (fortunately, I now think)\nrejected. I find theatre exciting and\nalways felt that I had something to\nadd to productions. But I needed\nsomething to direct. Around a similar time, whilst travelling, I decided\nthat doing something creative was\nvital. It was absolutely necessary for\nme to have a place in the world. It\u2019s\nthe kind of thing one thinks about\nwhilst travelling. So I had in my\nhead that I wanted to direct a play\nand wanted to be creative \u2013 the two\nideas were not yet connected. I then\nbecame aware that many of the ideas\nI was having were being lost. I found\nI had real epiphany moments that a\ncouple of months later I would for-get. So I decided that I had to write\nthem down. And necessarily it took\nthe form of a play. It\u2019s quite interesting for me to realise this course\nof events now, as I had never really\npieced it together before.\nRD: It\u2019s taken a long time to go\nfrom that first idea to the stage\nnext week. How has the play\nchanged in that time?\nRN: Initially the play started as a\ngroup of eight students in a mysterious group with a cloaked man who\nthen go out into the world and follow their ideas and then report back\nat the end. This project didn\u2019t seem\nfeasible and there were too many\nmain characters. So I changed it to\na group of three with a representation of their unconscious self that\nfollowed them around instead. On\nadvice I wrote the final, climactic\nscene first. This scene plus the full\ncharacterisation of the main protagonists meant that the rest of the play\nseemed to fall into place completely\norganically.\nThere were certain things that I\nwanted to show about the characters and others which needed to\nhappen in order for them to reach\nthe final scene in the state that they\nwere in. This led to the first draft\nof the script. It was a \u2018bare bones\u2019\npiece of work as others pointed\nout to me many times. So I tried to\nflesh it out. This was difficult as I\nreally didn\u2019t want to add superfluous scenes which had no meaning\nor value. However, on consultation\nwith others I realised there were aspects of character and plot that, as\nthe writer, I had taken for granted\nand needed to expand on. So I did\nthis and it evolved into the current\nscript. It\u2019s still quite dense but I am\nreluctant to water it down.\nRD: Have you had any help in writing this? Who has inspired and influenced you?\nRN: Yes I\u2019ve had help from two main\nsources. For a while I was going to\nbe co-directing with another final\nyear medic, Matt Rinaldi. However\ndue to other commitments (such\nas an exhibition currently on in the\nBlythe Gallery) he had to drop out.\nPrevious to that we had had numerous scripting and ideas sessions,\nediting and re-editing the various\ndrafts. It was a difficult process as\nthere was always a difference between us. We had different visions\nand, as the original author, I sometimes struggled to incorporate both\nwhilst staying true to the meaning\nand purpose of the play. Matt\u2019s ideas\nhave been invaluable however, and I\nam particularly pleased with the way\nhe transformed the final scene into\nsuch a climactic event.\nThe other help was from my\nbrother who gave me many ideas\nand suggestions that were often\nalong the same line as my own. I\nalso had advice and ideas from oth-ers. In future I think I would always\nwork as a writer on my own and then\nhave other people read the piece of\nwork and make suggestions and give\nideas, leaving it totally up to me to\nmake the decisions. I think having a\npair of writers working equally together is very difficult.\nRD: Finally, What do you think\nis the importance of doing something creative like this? Writing\nplays. Directing plays.\nRN: We at Imperial are nearly all\nscientists and rarely, if ever, use our\nimagination in our studies. And, for\nmost of us, those studies take up a\nlot of our time and focus (the rest of\nit often being filled with sport and\ndrinking). I think this is a shame.\nAs Imperial students are generally\nvery intelligent, I\u2019m sure that there\nis a massive amount of great creative\nenergy which is currently not being\nused. And University is the best time\nto use it. After this it is extremely\nunlikely that I will ever get the opportunity to write and direct my\nown play again (particularly if this\none turns out to be rubbish). It is\nsurprisingly refreshing doing something creative, and is a welcome\nbreak from hearing and thinking\nabout medicine constantly. Theatre\nis, above all, very enjoyable and I\u2019m\nsure that there are many fascinating\nand important stories to be told by\nour students. I\u2019ve tried to tell one of\nthem.\nAll The Meanings Of Spring at the\nUnion Concert Hall: 21st - 24th November at 7:30pm.

It\nwill be pretty interesting to see what\nthe next move on this is. Will the\nspending plummet further?

Especially because this will be\na step up from the last exam you did.\nDon\u2019t get complacent but don\u2019t cause\nyourself too much stress.\nOne thing that I simply can not chill\nout about, though, is whoever walks\naround the Library and SAC (Student\nActivities Centre) and rips off every\nsingle one of the keyboard supports.\nIt\u2019s really annoying as they make typing slightly easier, and when my lab report is due in in about 12 hours, I need\nall the comforts that can possibly be\nafforded to me.

Memories of these\nmovements shape our worlds. They\nmetamorphose into nostalgia, sometimes even for times and places we\nhave never physically accessed. Obsessions with an idealised past are\nmanifested through the way in which\nwe portray our world today; we use\ncommodities such as retro-style\nclothing or the Instagram app.\nThe current exhibition at the Barbican explores this notion during the\n60s and 70s, an era of de\ufb01ned social,\npolitical, and photographic revolu-tion. Objectivity through the lens\nis captured by the subjectivity of 12\nphotographers from around the\nglobe, resulting in historic snapshots\nserved up for modern day interpreta-tion.\nThe exhibition starts with photographs by David Goldblatt, which\ncontrast the \u201cminutiae of Afrikaner\nlife\u201d with the racist repression during\nthe apartheid. Photographs of day-to-day occasions include mass burials\nof mine workers. A particularly powerful piece is his Johannesburg landscape of uniformly repeated lego-like\nhousing. This exterior is enough to\ninstigate imaginings over the limited\nfacilities, which surely \ufb01lled the interior to a bare minimum\u2013 the reduction of rights to bare practicality.\nBy persuading the Race Classi\ufb01cation Board that he was coloured, not\nblack, Ernest Cole was able to take\npictures of young homeless boys being slapped by white adults for beg-ging, as well as blurred time-lapses\nof street violence instead of being arrested for practising photography.\nOne of his most frank pieces, capturing the essence of the separation, is\na wide-shot over a train station \ufb01lled,\non one half, with non-whites scrambling (sometimes over the tracks) to\nget to non-signposted trains whilst\nwhites wait in comfortable personal\nspace on the other half of the station.\nThe struggles for the rights of indigenous South Africans is emphasised\nwith a matriarchal slant (although I\ncan\u2019t help but giggle at a photograph\nof what looks like Pocahontas with a\nboombox) in the collection by Graciela Iturbide, the only female artist\nfeatured in the exhibition.\nMartin Luther King and Malcom\nX sit next to Bruce Davidson\u2019s more\nharrowing pieces: for example the\nscene of a racially motivated mur-der. Despite its black and white col-our, blood stains on the car seat stick\nout boldly and unnervingly. It is one\nof the many photos in the exhibition\nthat absorb you completely into a foreign situation.\nThe US is also represented through\nthe works of William Eggleston, the\nfather of style-over-substance thus\nof style-becoming-substance hipster\nportraits. Although not as impressive\ncompared to the culturally and politically driven pieces of his peers, it is\ninteresting to see where this style of\nphotography originated from.\nUpstairs, the collection delves into\nmore speci\ufb01c events of the 60s and\n70s.\nAfghans watch the cruel \ufb01ght between two dogs and a chained bear\nin a German photographer\u2019s blotchy\ntime-lapse, suggestive of the Soviet\nUnion and US\u2019s power struggle during the Cold War, with Afghanistan\ncaught in the middle.\nThe next room holds bizarre nude,\npolitical, and religious superimposi-tions which had been prohibited by\nthe Soviet Union. Aesthetic beauty\nemerges in certain pieces, such as\nin one of a peacock tail decorating a\nnude young woman, demonstrating\nfrustrations with the censorship of\nthe times.\nIt is easy to re\ufb02ect over and enjoy\nall the pieces in the exhibition \u2013 even\nthe seemingly abstract ones \u2013 as photography and history novices thanks\nto the helpful blurbs accompanying\nthe collections and to the literature\nproduced by the Barbican.\nThe team has done well in engaging\nvisitors by making them empathise\nwith the photographs. Viewers are\nreferred to such present-day phenomena as the globalisation of Japan\nwith Homei Tomatsu\u2019s exploration\ninto Japanese post-war Americanisation.\nThe Far East is also considered\nthrough Li Zhensheng\u2019s journalistic photographs of Chairman Mao\u2019s\nCultural Revolution alongside playful self-portraits that were taken in\nsecret and had to be buried.\nSoldiers of the Vietnam War are\ncovered by Larry Burrows, whose\npieces documenting the con\ufb02cit are\nconsidered to be some of the \ufb01nest.\nThe exhibition ends on a happier\nnote, in the form of Malick Sadib\u00e9\u2019s\npartying and fun during the totalitarian French colonial rule in Mali.\nThese photographic subjects are enjoying themselves, pleasing the viewer and allowing for a way to relate to\nsuch stories.\nThis notion demonstrates how all\nthe events and photographs of the\nexhibition are rooted in human nature \u2013 universal through time and\nspace. This clever play on time makes\nyou wonder how our current choices\nand actions will shape the memories\nof future generations, in the context\nof history as well as of personal ex-ploration.\nEverything was Moving: Photography\nfrom the 60s and 70s at the Barbican.\nTickets from \u00a37.\nThird round finalist of Harlem\nfree-style hat wearing competition\n90% of viewers miss\nfloating flowerpot\n\u00a9 Boris Mikhailov\n\u00a9 Boris Mikhailov\n\u00a9 Boris Mikhailov\nGiant crouton attacks skiers\nLily Le goes on an emotional and interesting journey\n\n"

But this \ufb01lm\ndisappointed me greatly as a child \u2013 I\nkept waiting for the main feature to\nbegin. I couldn't fathom a \ufb01lm without\ndialogue at that age, and the sinking\nfeeling I felt when I realised this is just\nanimation set to music upsets me no\nless even now. The animation is great\n(come on, this is Disney, of course it\nis) but the concept of animation based\non music instead of coherent storyline\ndoesn't work for me. And I hate the\nmusic.\nFight Club (1999)\nThe inclusion of this \ufb01lm on my list\nnearly caused a real \ufb01ght in one of my\nlectures (not really, but I like to imagine people get as worked up about\n\ufb01lms as I do). This \ufb01lm starts really\nwell, but it unravels in an epically pretentious fashion towards the end,\nbecoming a victim of its own clever-ness. The \ufb01lm is about masculinity\ncrisis, starring Edward Norton as a\ntwitchy 'every man' type, who, when\ndiscontented with his dead-end job,\nforms a \ufb01ght club with Pitt, a sales-man. The \ufb01ght scenes are excellently\nconstructed, and the audio post work\nis deliciously \ufb02inch-worthy. And the\n\ufb01lm has an interesting premise \u2013 but\nthe twist at the end is inexpertly ex-ecuted. For all the \ufb01lm's pretension, by\nthe end it ceases to make any kind of\nsense. I've been reliably informed that\nthe book on which the \ufb01lm is based\nis much more coherent. Finally, one\nof the most annoying things in \ufb01lms\nis when the beautiful hero escapes\ndangerous situations unrealistically\nunmaimed \u2013 Pitt barely sustains more\nthan a scratch.\nNapoleon Dynamite (2004)\nProbably my most hated, yet well executed \ufb01lm of all time. Widely found\nto be hilarious, yet I can\u2019t seem to fathom why. Essentially nothing happens\n\u2013 90 minutes of nothing. Intended to\nbe deadpan and quirky, I would rather\npunch myself in the face repeatedly\nAmerican Beauty (1999)\nI don\u2019t know if my co-Editor will ever\ntalk to me again after including this,\nbut I can\u2019t pretend to like this \ufb01lm. The\n\ufb01lm has a great concept, is subversive\nand well executed in terms of direc-tion, but I couldn\u2019t relate or even connect in an objective way to any of the\ncharacters. Kevin Spacey plays a father\ninfatuated with his daughter\u2019s hot best\nfriend (Mena Suvari). The \ufb01lm is supposed to be a tragicomedy about middle class American life, but at times\nthe \ufb01lm verges on the pretentious (the\niconic scene with Suvari frolicking on\na bed of roses \u2013 rose petals forming a\nvisual motive throughout \u2013 a prime\nexample of this). I don\u2019t hate this \ufb01lm,\nbut I certainly can\u2019t see why it is so\nhighly regarded (clearly I am in the\nminority here \u2013 it won an Academy\nAward for Best Picture.) But for me:\nunderwhelming and self important.\nthan watch this \ufb01lm again. That said,\nthe \ufb01rst time full length director Jared\nHess creates an excellent framework\nfor comedy (a fact almost insulting\ngiven the cinematic results.) There is\nplenty of room provided for lead Jon\nHeder to shine, but his lack of future\ncareer success suggests that he lacked\nthe skill to make Napoleon remotely\nlikeable. In short, Napoleon Dynamite\nis a \ufb01lm a lot less cool than it clearly\nthinks it is.\nNick Clegg has been\npromoted up to tea\nmaking duty!\nPromote yourself to Film\nwriter by emailing\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis guy clearly sees something he likes...\n\n"

From their debut album (I) in 2008 to their\nlatest release (III), the band has attracted a huge\nfan base. They went from playing in dingy, under-groundbarstoplayingReadingthisyear.\nWith this rise, the band has matured. Their new\nalbum (III) is so much different yet so similar to\ntheir previous two albums. Whereas (I) has a more\nfriendly feel and a simpler production value, (II)\nsaw the band turn towards more harsh sounds,\ndeeper bass and louder vocals.

There\u2019s the slow build up of fading tones, vocals, then\nthe drum beat and finally the huge synth sound, which is so characteristic of Crystal Castles\u2019 songs. \u201cAffection\u201d keeps the big sound but slows down the beat, it\u2019s an\nemotional song and in my opinion the best on the album. After \u2018Affection\u2019 you are\nplunged back into classic \u2018Castles with the likes of \u201cInsulin\u201d, \u201cMercenary\u201d and \u201cSad\nEyes\u201d.Anoisy,electronicmixofheavilycompressedvocalsanddarkdrums.\nThe album closes with \u201cChild I Will Hurt You\u201d.

One of the authors, John\nFasullo, stated: \u201cThere is a striking relationship between how well climate\nmodels simulate humidity in key areas\nand how much warming they show in\nresponse to increasing carbon diox-ide. Given how fundamental these\nprocesses are to clouds and the overall\nglobal climate, our \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat warming is likely to be on the\nhigh side of current projections.\u201d The\n\ufb01nding that the best models also produce the greatest warming suggests\nnot only that the Earth will be getting warmer faster, but that extreme\nevents could become more frequent\nand damaging sooner than expected.\nEstimations of how much our climate will warm with increasing carbon dioxide vary greatly, with the\nlargest predicting twice the warming\nas the smallest. This uncertainty is\nthought to be mainly due to clouds.\nClouds occur on much smaller scales\nthan climate models can resolve;\nhence descriptions of them have to be\nwritten. The di\ufb00erent descriptions of\nclouds in models lead to models disagreeing about the e\ufb00ects and spatial\npatterns of clouds.\nObservations of clouds cannot be\nused in a typical way to look at how\nwell the models perform over long\ntimescales as we only have measurements of clouds over short timescales\nand this is not thought to be an indicator of the e\ufb00ects of clouds over\ngreater periods. Instead, the authors\nuse the seasonal change in humidity.\nAs well as having a better observational record due to satellites being\nable to measure it more easily, humidity is also highly related to cloud\ncover.\nSixteen of the climate models that\nare regularly used for predicting future conditions were tested against\nthe measurements of humidity made\nfrom two NASA satellites. The test\nOvercast with a small\nchance of global warming\nThe European ash tree is a familiar\nsight across the UK\u2019s gardens, parks\nand countryside, and has been part of\nthe landscape for many centuries, the\ncommon name even deriving from\nOld English.\nHowever earlier this year a serious\nfungal disease a\ufb00ecting ash trees,\nChalara fraxinea, was found in\nBuckinghamshire, in a consignment of trees imported from\nmainland Europe. Despite attempts to contain it the infection spread across multiple\nEnglish counties in the following months.\nThe disease, which initially causes leaf loss and\ndieback and eventually leads\nto the death of the tree, has\nso far been con\ufb01rmed found\nin 155 sites by the Forestry\nCommission. C. fraxinea\nhas had a devastating e\ufb00ect in\nother countries including Denmark\nwhere it led to the loss of 90% of the\nash tree population.\nA consortium of experts, including\nresearchers from Imperial\u2019s Department of Life Sciences, are leading the\n\ufb01ght to stop the spread of the disease.\nA new product based on copper sulphate has been developed, patented\nand successfully put through laboratory tests\nMS drug trial shows potential\nA new drug is the most e\ufb00ective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), say re-searchersattheUniversityofCambridge.\nThe scientists treated MS patients\nwith alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody normally used to \ufb01ght leukaemia.\nAlemtuzumab proved more e\ufb00ective\nthan a \ufb01rst-choice drug, interferon beta\n1a, in two groups of patients who suffered from relapsing-remitting MS.\nOne group consisted of patients\nwhere initial treatment had failed, the\nother in previously untreated patients.\nMS occurs when the immune system attacks and damages myelin \u2013 an\ninsulating substance wrapped around\nnerves. The impaired nerves fail to\ntransmit signals as normal. This is particularly harmful in the white matter of\nthe brain and spinal cord, which is composed mainly of myelin.\nThe disease a\ufb00ects almost 100,000\npeople in the UK.\nThe \ufb01ndings showed that in patients\nwho deteriorated after \ufb01rst-choice\ntreatment, alemtuzumab reduced relapse rate by more than 40% compared\nwith interferon beta 1a (known commercially as Ribif).\nIn untreated patients, alemtuzumab\nreduced relapse rate by more than 55%\ncompared with Ribif. Many patients\neven showed improvements in disabili-ty. MRI scans revealed less myelin damage in alemtuzumab-treated patients.\nAlemtuzumab wipes out T and B\nlymphocytes so they can be replenished anew, essentially resetting the\nimmune system. It binds to CD-52, a\nprotein on the surface of lymphocytes.\nThese lymphocytes are destroyed and\nrepopulated, leading to long-lasting\nchanges in immunity.\nDespite the obvious bene\ufb01ts of alem-tuzumab, undesirable side-e\ufb00ects of the\nmonoclonal antibody were reported. A\nhighproportionofpatientssu\ufb00eredfrom\nabnormal thyroid function (one in \ufb01ve)\nand thrombocytopenia, a platelet disor-der. But routine monitoring and education can prevent these side-e\ufb00ects, says\nDr Alasdair Coles, who led the research.\nThe research was funded by Genzyme\n(Sano\ufb01) and Bayer Schering Pharma.\nAlemtuzumab has since been withdrawn\nfrom the European and US market.\nGenzyme intend to remarket the drug\nspeci\ufb01cally for MS treatment under the\ntrade name Lemtrada. There is concern\nthat this potentially life-saving drug will\nbe too expensive for many MS su\ufb00erers\nand health services.\nDOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61769-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61768-1\nwas performed for the subtropics,\nwhere the deserts are found, as not\nonly is this area important for understanding our future climate but also\nthe lack of convection there helps reduce any errors in measuring humid-ity.\nThe comparison of models and observations found that the models that\nwere most accurate in simulating the\nsubtropical humidity also were the\nmodels that were most sensitive to\ncarbon dioxide; and therefore predict\nthe greater future warming. This suggests that models that predict less future warming are unable to simulate\nenough atmospheric drying and that\nthis feeds back into the clouds and\nis responsible for how much future\nwarming is seen in the model.\nThis study has not only helped in\ndeveloping a new way of investigating the accuracy of climate models\nbut it has helped constrain the range\nof future warming. Fasullo says \u201cIf we\ncan better represent these regions in\nmodels, we can improve our predictions and provide society with a better sense of the impacts to expect in a\nwarming world.\u201d\nNew study assessing climate models against observations provides worrying results\nSarah Byrne Writer\nNick Kennedy Writer\nwhere it was shown to e\ufb00ectively kill\nthe fungus. The product, CuPC33\n, is\nnow being tested at Imperial\u2019s Silwood Park campus and according to\nresearchers has proved in greenhouse\ntrials that it can be safely sprayed on\nor injected into trees without damaging them. They hope to carry\nout \ufb01eld trials on infected trees\nin Spring 2013.\nA major selling point is that\nthis is anticipated to be a low-cost solution, in part because\nof the proposed method of\ndelivery, which uses low volume spray technology to\nmake e\ufb03cient use of the\nproduct. The expected\ncost is 60p per litre to\ntreat a hectare of wood-land.\nIf it works as intended,\nthe product looks set to\nbe a success for the companies involved, including\nImperial Consultants\nwho are overseeing the\nacademic collabora-tion. We can hope it\nwill be as much as a success story for the British countryside\nand will prevent the loss of another of\nour distinctive trees.\nLaurence Sheldon Writer\n\n"

    "content": "What\u2019s In My Lunchbox? #01\nCarol Ann Cheah ponders \u201cladies who (liquid) lunch\u201d this winter\nh, winter. The season\nwhen just about everything seems to drop:\ntemperatures, number of daylight hours,\nmoods, hemlines (well, depending.)\nIt\u2019s around this time of the year when\nus Food Editors face a dilemma when\npacking our lunches \u2013 we need more\nwarm/hot sustenance, so our fallback\nof sarnies and salads just won\u2019t do,\neven with a cuppa after. At the same\ntime though, QTR/FiveSixEight/Eastside Bar meals can add up, and we\u2019re\nreally not about to give up the packed\nlunch habit yet.\nEnter soup, our favourite solution\n(ha!) to the issue at hand. It\u2019s an everyman\u2019s meal that\u2019s more than your \u201cfavourite freshers\u2019 \ufb02u remedy\u201d, or the\ntypical posh-restaurant starter.\nThere\u2019s a reason we love them so\nmuch. They\u2019re not just fun to eat;\nthey\u2019re a great way to use up leftovers,\nand keep well in the freezer so can\nbe made well in advance (lazy weekend cooking, anyone?) The most basic concoctions won\u2019t take you hours\nto slave over or require some fancy\nFrench cooking technique; but once\nyou\u2019ve built up your skills and con\ufb01dence, soup recipes then have plenty\nof wiggle room for you to start jazzing\nthem up more. The end product can\nbe as cheap or expensive as you want:\nit depends on your ingredients. If your\ncooking process does NOT include\nthe directions \u201cpull back tin lid\u201d or\n\u201cmicrowave on HIGH for ** minutes\u201d,\nall the better.\n\u201cSoup\u201d is such an umbrella term: it\nencompasses every \ufb02avour and texture imaginable. Some days we enjoy\nrich, decadent \u201ccream of\u201d concoc-tions; other days, clearer Asian broths\n(miso and the like) are more up our al-ley. Still other days we\u2019re privy to getting our handblenders out and slurping our pureed results after.\nOf course, we\u2019re all analytical people\nhere at Imperial; so what\u2019s the use of\nthis feature if we don\u2019t give you a detailed breakdown of this dish\u2019s anatomy to pore over?\nLock...\nAs said before, the ingredient combinations are endless when it comes to\nsoup. Stu\ufb00 like chicken, mushroom,\ntomato, pumpkin and pea etc are the\nusual fail-safe staples, so you can\u2019t go\nwrong with those \ufb02avours if you\u2019re just\nstarting out. It\u2019s then up to you to mix\nin whatever takes your fancy \u2013 we once\nexperimented with a chicken, seafood\nand chorizo concoction, which we\nthought only existed in paella. How\nwrong we were.\nSoup\u2019s commonly consumed with\na side of crusty bread to \ufb01ll you up\nbetter; but that isn\u2019t always needed.\nTo make soups heartier, the options\nare yet again limitless. Mulligatawny\nuses rice as its starch of choice, others use dried or tinned beans (do boil\nthe dried beans in water \ufb01rst to soften\nthough.) A very easy option (and one\nyou\u2019ve probably come across as a kid\nin the form of alphabet soup) is pasta;\nchucking in boiled pasta bits in a soup\nis a good way to make them go further.\nFor thickening, it again depends\nwhat your ingredients are. If you\u2019ve got\npotatoes, peas, pumpkin or the like,\nchances are you\u2019ll probably be doing\nthe thickening job by pureeing with a\nhandblender. \u201cCream of\u201d soups tend to\nhave \ufb02our sprinkled on the ingredients\nand then stirred in to make a roux just\nbefore the liquid is added to it. If you\ndo that, stir it as thoroughly as you can;\nbut don\u2019t worry about the odd lump \u2013\nit\u2019ll go when the liquid is added in.\nStock...\nWhatever way you look at it, stock\nis pretty much at the heart of soups.\nAsians even have the term \u201cmaster\nstock\u201d for their broths; in their soups,\nif you fudge the stock up it\u2019s bust for\nthe \ufb01nished soup \u2013 there\u2019s nothing\nto mask it, so there\u2019s nowhere for the\nstock to \u201chide\u201d (unlike some soups\nthat puree the ingredients after.) Stock\nmatters because there\u2019s no use having \ufb02avourful ingredients in a \u201cbroth\u201d\nof plain water; that would be akin to\nleaving your veggies in the water that\nyou used to boil them and drinking\nsaid water. Tasteless \u2013 why would you?\nStock-making tends to vary from\nlaborious methods that produce rich\nand complex broths, to simple \u201cbungin-and-forget\u201d methods as well. We\nappreciate that what you prefer will\ndepend on how much time you have/\nare willing to spare \u2013 we\u2019re into instant grati\ufb01cation as well. Our method\nof choice involves bunging a chicken\ncarcass/chicken bones (from a roast\nchicken, or raw direct from your\nbutcher for cheap) in a pot with some\nchopped onion and garlic cloves, plus\nsome chopped leftover veg (leek/\ncarrot/celery works well) with just\nenough water to cover. Bring to the\nboil, skim impurities, lower heat, leave\nfor half an hour and adjust seasoning\n\u2013 then strain and use immediately, or\nfridge/freeze portions. If you can\u2019t get\nhold of a carcass, making from fresh\nwith wing tips keeps the cost down\nbut maintains \ufb02avour.\nUnlike baking, soup isn\u2019t an exact\nscience \u2013 it\u2019s very much \u201chandful of\nthis/pinch of that\u201d cooking. If it\u2019s too\nthick, add stock/water/milk; if it\u2019s\nlacking in \ufb02avour, season a bit. Be\ncareful though, go slow when you do\nthis \u2013 you can always add, but ye cannae take away!\nIf you *really* must use store-bought stock cubes/bouillon, check\nthe amount of salt that\u2019s already there.\nChances are you probably won\u2019t need\nto add extra salt.\nA\nFOOD\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n26\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n...and two smoking barels\nThere are two important...er, vessels you\u2019ll be needing in the process,\namongst others. The \ufb01rst is obviously\nthe (stock)pot, where all the magic\nhappens. Make sure it\u2019s nice and big\nenough to hold your ingredients, with\na bit more room at the top \u2013 lest you\nrun the risk of things boiling over and\nlosing some of your end product (be\nit stock or the actual soup.) If you\u2019re\npressed for time, a pressure cooker\nworks well in getting your meat and\nveg soft in half the time (or less) usually required by traditional on-the-stove\nboiling \u2013 just make sure you read the\ninstructions.\nThe other important vessel is what\nyou\u2019ll be transporting your soup in\nfor that packed lunch. It needs to seal\nproperly, unless you\u2019re particularly\nkeen on consuming remnants of your\nlunch from your lovely lecture printouts or the inside of your bag. We\nlike our trusty Thermos-es \u2013 for the\nmore liquid ones you\u2019ll be \ufb01ne with\nstandard Thermos \ufb02asks (same ones\nmeant for hot water/co\ufb00ee/etc); but\nfor the heartier ones that actually need\na spoon, you\u2019ll de\ufb01nitely need those\nfood jars with a wider mouth to comfortably dip your spoon in. These can\ncost anything from a \ufb01ver to almost\ntwenty quid, depending on the retailer.\nIf you\u2019re really cheap, wide-mouth\nMason jars that are used for jam/hon-ey will work if you\u2019re using it to store\nfrozen soup portions, and have access\nto a microwave (just leave room for expansion during freezing.) Take out the\nfrozen soup jars in the morning, bag\nthem, and then reheat until piping hot\nduring lunch.\nCream of mushroom soup with crispy bacon bits\nIngredients:\n4 rashers bacon, rind off and chopped\ninto small bits (both streaky and back\nbacon are fine) -\u2013 optional garnish\n1 onion, finely chopped\n2-4 cloves garlic, finely chopped (de-pends how much you like it)\n375g mushrooms, finely chopped\n(use any kind of fresh mushrooms\nyou want, or even a mix. I made this\nwith a mix of chestnut and white,\nportobellos would work)\n2-3 tablespoons of plain flour\n600ml stock (chicken/vegetable)\n100-200ml milk (adjust according to\ntaste/consistency)\n150ml double cream\nOregano and parsley (dried is okay)\nOil or butter for frying\nBacon garnish: Heat up a small\namount of oil in a frying pan, then\nbung in the bacon bits and fry until\ncrisp. Remove and set aside on paper\ntowels to drain.\nSaute the onion, garlic and mushrooms in oil/butter until fragrant,\nsoft and just starting to colour. Sprinkle the flour on and stir until evenly\nmixed, then add stock and milk. Bring\nto the boil, then let simmer for up to\n30 minutes (you\u2019ll see it thicken up\nnicely.) Taste and adjust seasoning \u2013\nadd some oregano at this stage.\nAdd in half of the cream (75ml)\nand stir, then pour into bowls. Whip\nthe rest of the cream until stiff peaks\nform. Garnish with the bacon bits, a\nspoonful of the whipped cream, and\na sprinkling of chopped parsley. Omit\nthe extra whipped cream if you\u2019re\npacking this for lunch.\nServe with a slice of crusty buttered bread \u2013 feeds 4 as a starter, or\n2 as a main meal.\nI souppose you want a\npun here or something?\n\n"

He is fearless in undertaking a challenging topic, and his\ndeliberate ambiguity in his characters,\nthe deep complexities, the uncomfortable situations, hard-hitting scenarios,\nall make their appearances: very little changes in his hotly anticipated\nThe Master. Dense, heavy narrative?\nCheck. Top-notch performances?\nCheck. You get the feeling that there\nis something great here \u2013 an insightful\ncharacter study of sorts, delving into\nKneel, obey, submit, comply, surrender\na struggling man\u2019s psyche, but due to\nthe many obstacles that stand in the\nway of the \ufb01lm being a widely accessible experience, it sadly misses out on\nbecoming a classic.\nAlthough loosely based on the rise\nin popularity of the controversial religion Scientology, it would be a mistake to assume that this is in any way\na piece of expose. Instead we concentrate solely on the story of Freddie\n(Phoenix), a traumatised World War II\nNavy veteran who has lost his way. Alcohol and sex are the two things that\nhe\u2019s addicted to, and he has a special\nknack for producing his own quality\nbooze wherever he ends up. Not able\nto secure a job due to his \ufb01ery, uncontrollable temper, he decides to sneak\naboard a yacht, where a life-changing\nencounter occurs.\nHe has very little recollection of the\nnight he crashed the extravagant party\nthrown by Lancaster Todd (Ho\ufb00man).\nBut Todd is intrigued: Freddie\u2019s volatile behaviour, his childlike qualities,\nhis aimless path, and last but not least,\nhis exceptional ability to make his own\nvery unique brand of alcohol. Todd is\nthe founder of a philosophical movement known as \u201cThe Cause\u201d and with\nthat he believes it is his duty to help\nout the lost Freddie, and make him realise his true potential, as well as his\nplace and purpose in life. He\u2019s char-ismatic, well-spoken, intelligent, and\nknows what to say when.\nEssentially he is very good at what\nhe does, as he inspires and moves peo-ple, which is why he has so many loyal\nsupporters. His wife, Peggy (the steely\ncold but underused Adams), is one of\nhis biggest devotees, respecting everything he\u2019s achieved thus far, \ufb01rmly\nbelieving that their organisation has\nmuch more to accomplish. The sudden arrival of this unstable individual\nis a cause for alarm, as she casts a weary set of eyes on the stranger. Their son\nVal (Jesse Plemons) however, is less\nconvinced about his father\u2019s endeav-our: \u201che\u2019s making all this up as he goes\nalong\u2026 you don\u2019t see that?\u201d\nSo what is Todd up to? Is he a fraud?\nOr does he actually believe in what\nhe\u2019s doing? His methods of teaching\non human psychology, the repetitive\nexperiments he subjects his members\nto seem crazy and unnerving, but for\na broken man like Freddie, this alternate way of guidance, as well as Todd\u2019s\nopen arms and generosity become ir-resistible. Todd very gently pulls out\nthe necessary answers from Freddie,\nwhat happened to him in the past,\nwhat has hurt him most, his insecu-rities: all buried deep in his complex\nmind web.\nAnd of course, the pair of Volpi Cup\nwinning performances can truly be\nsummed up as a brilliant master class\nin acting perfection, a duo so well\nmatched that their e\ufb00orts will not go\nunnoticed. With Phoenix it\u2019s those un\ufb02inching eyes that do most of the talk-ing. Whenever he loses his way, his\ndownward spiral is quite the dramatic\nand disturbing one, with Phoenix quite\nliterally giving all he\u2019s got physically\nto the role. His erratic, unpredictable\nchanges, at times bordering on psychosis are so utterly mesmerising that\nif he would only stop trash-talking the\nOscars, he could score an easy win.\nEqually impressive is Ho\ufb00man, as\nthe enigmatic leader, calmly using his\nwords and civility to spread his mes-sage. He also succeeds in painting a\nvague picture around the core of his\ncharacter: at times he seems to believe\nevery word he\u2019s preaching, but there\nare moments where he himself seems\nto be lost for answers. Is he a fraud? Is\nhe leading a cult? Is he as smart as everyone makes him out to be? We will\nnever truly know.\nFull of unclear ideas, the \ufb01lm fails\nto be a truly compelling one. The\nrelationship between the two men\nseems to be the main focus but even\nthat doesn\u2019t give the audience a clear\nenough perception into them to\nmaintain enough drama and interest\nthroughout its running time. And as\nis the case with most Anderson\u2019s \ufb01lms,\neverything looks phenomenal. The\nmuch lauded 70mm does bring out\nthe enhanced quality and his many\nclose-ups into the outstanding actors\nfurther give them a chance to shine in\ntheir di\ufb03cult roles. But here is a \ufb01lm\nthat falls short of true grandeur and\ngreatness due to its lack of exploration\ninto its initially fascinating subject\nmatter.\nHe\u2019s just not that into her...nor should he be\nWhat happens to sel\ufb01sh, money-hun-gry, cold, heartless bastards in Hollywood \ufb01lms? They meet a kid. Or they\nmeet a woman. Or both. And oh look,\nthey do have hearts after all, because\nthey\u2019re human \u2013 and everybody has a\nheart, right? There, I\u2019ve just summed\nup the main story behind People Like\nUs, a mostly generic dysfunctional\nfamily drama that could have served\nwell as a brief story-arc on a daytime\nsoap. But I say \u201cmostly\u201d generic, because the \ufb01lm does try to explore its\ncharacters more, not always resorting\nto stereotypes, and ends on one powerful punch of a \ufb01nale.\nSam (Pine) is a struggling businessman whose latest deal lands him in a lot\nof trouble that also costs him \ufb01nancially. To make matters worse he receives\nnews that his estranged legendary\nrecord-producing father has passed\naway from cancer. Although trying\nto avoid his tense and uncomfortable\nhome, he eventually makes it back to\nhis now very much depressed and disappointed mother Lillian (Pfei\ufb00er). As\nif his life couldn\u2019t get any more compli-cated, his father has left a little task for\nhim to complete: a shaving kit containing 150,000 dollars, enough to cover\nhis debts. But the money isn\u2019t for him.\nIt\u2019s for a certain Josh Davis (Michael\nHall D\u2019Addario).\nThe connection? The kid\u2019s mother.\nFrankie (Banks), a recovering alcoholic as well as bartender, is the mother,\nwho also happens to be the illegitimate daughter of the recently passed\nrecord producer. Sam and Frankie are\nhalf-siblings. It\u2019s a part of his father\u2019s\nlife that was always kept a secret from\nhim; no surprises there. The only problem is that now it\u2019s up to Sam to carry\nout this act of kindness to an almost\nstranger when he can\u2019t even sort his\nlife out. It would be easy to take the\nmoney and run. And it\u2019s not as though\nthis thought hasn\u2019t crossed his mind.\nBut he decides to stay put, get close to\nthem for a while, and get to know the\nfamily he never thought he had.\nCreepy? Perhaps. He is essentially\nstalking these two. At an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Frankie announces her disappointment at being completely left out of her father\u2019s\neulogy in the papers. \u201cIt\u2019s o\ufb03cial, I\ndon\u2019t exist\u201d she says, appearing strong\nalthough clearly this identity issue is\na\ufb00ecting her. And this is a great performance from Banks, an actress who\ncan skillfully pull o\ufb00 sly, sarcastic,\ncon\ufb01dent comedy in a role that could\nhave been hampered by teary melo-drama. She has that right mix of cheerful charm as well as strong, intelligent\ncharisma that makes her damaged\ncharacter fascinating.\nIt\u2019s Sam and Jack who connect \ufb01rst,\nthrough their mutual love of music.\nJack is a borderline sociopathic, self-destructivemess,blowinguphisschool\npool with a chunk of sodium and getting into all sorts of trouble. And as\nSam appears Jack does miraculously\nsort out his issues almost immediately.\nPine, a likable actor who has his natural ways and a knack for playful wordy\ndialogue, \ufb01ts into the role perfectly,\nshowing the progressions and changes\nof his role with smooth ease. D\u2019Addario\nalso plays delicately with a role that\u2019s\nnot easy to warm to. He carries a lot\nof built-up resentment and frustration\ntowards his mother, and presents with\nthe classic signs of a neglected, ignored\nkid wanting some love.\nWaiting for the plot to escalate to\nits inevitable \u201cconfrontation\u201d is quite\nthe long one, as the \ufb01lm wants to\nsqueeze in as much sugary sweetness\nas it possibly can before having to deal\nwith the heavier drama. The feel-good\nmoments are handled with predictable familiarity, mostly with the lovely\ncountryside serving as the backdrop,\naccompanied by easy, soothing music,\nwhere characters move about without\ndialogue, sometimes in slow motion,\nlaughing and smiling at each other\u2019s\ncompany. It\u2019s not a particularly bad\nconcept, and it\u2019s certainly not unpleasant to look at, but sometimes you just\nwant the \ufb01lm to move on and check in\nwith reality.\nIt\u2019s also an exciting added bonus\nto see Pfei\ufb00er, whose luminous presence is often underused, playing the\nheartbroken widow and mother with\nsecrets and regrets of her own to bear.\nHer unkept exterior, withdrawn, blank\nlooks all work tremendously to \ufb01t her\nrole as the grieving woman, giving her\nscenes much more power as well as\ntranquillity.\nThere are scenes of heartstring tugging emotions, some forced, some\ngenuine, but in the end the \ufb01lm manages to \ufb01nd a good balance as it explores a very human, down-to-earth\nset of characters and relatable plot\npoints. It\u2019s not the most original, and\nis a touch too long to be a truly compelling drama, but here is a calm, collected and thought-provoking o\ufb00ering\nthat comes far too rarely.\nJohn Park Film Editor\nPeople Like Us\nDirector: Alex Kurtzman\nScreenwriters: Alex Kurtzman,\nRoberto Orci, Jody Lambert\nStarring: Chris Pine, Elizabeth Banks,\nMichelle Pfeiffer\nCome get me booooyyyssss!!!\nToo close?

    "content": "A trip around America\nMaciej Matuszewski reviews Neil Gaiman\u2019s best known novel\nou can\u2019t call yourself a fan\nof speculative \ufb01ction if\nyou\u2019ve never heard of Neil\nGaiman. He has made a\nname for himself with his\nproli\ufb01c writing, not only with novels\nbut also for the screen and in comic\nbooks. Yet until recently I had never\nread any of his longer works. Wanting\nto remedy the situation I thought that\nthere was no better place to start than\nwith American Gods \u2013 his most highly\nacclaimed novel.\nWinner of the Hugo, Nebula, Locus\nand Bram Stoker Awards the book\nfocuses on Shadow \u2013 a man recently\nreleased from prison who \ufb01nds that\nhis wife and best friend have died in\na car crash. At a loss of what to do\nwith his life he accepts a job o\ufb00er from\nthe mysterious Mr Wednesday and\nbecomes his bodyguard, driver and\noccasional accomplice in large con\ufb01dence tricks. Mr Wednesday, howev-er, isn\u2019t a simple conman and Shadow\nsoon gets drawn into a war between\nthe old and new gods \u2013 a war for the\nheart and soul of America.\nThis is highly ambitious and successful novel, exploring themes of\nloss, power and betrayal. It has a large\ncast of complex, engaging and well-developed characters \u2013 many of who\ndo not necessarily contribute directly\nto the main overarching plot but add\ndepth to the book\u2019s universe and are\nsimply a joy to read about. Shadow\nhimself is very satisfying as a main\nprotagonist \u2013 with a powerful and\nbelievable character arc as he grows\nfrom someone who is still obviously\nshell-shocked from his wife\u2019s death to\na man who is con\ufb01dent in himself and\nhis abilities.\nThe main focus of the book, how-ever, are not the characters, nor even\nthe plot, but rather the United States\nthemselves. Throughout the course\nof the story we explore many places\nin that great country \u2013 from cities to\nsmall towns to cheesy tourist attrac-tions. It explores the various contradictions of that place \u2013 from the\nbeliefs and desires of its immigrant\nfounders to its present day obsession\nwith media and technology. I believe\nthat Gaiman himself put it best, saying he considered the book to be \u201csort\nof weird, sprawling picaresque epic,\nwhich starts out relatively small and\ngets larger. It\u2019s about the soul of America, really. What people brought to\nAmerica; what found them when they\ncame; and the things that lie sleeping\nbeneath it all.\u201d\nThis is a truly great novel: deep and\nprofound but also very entertaining.\nAn HBO adaptation is set to premiere\nnext year so now is the perfect opportunity to read it.\nY\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n12\nSandman\nAlongrunningandaward-winning\nseries of comic books following\nDream, one of the Endless \u2013 personifications of fundamental forces in the universe.

The much maligned\nGCSE shall be replaced with\nthe \u2018English Baccalaureate\u2019 (EBacc),\nthe brain child of the Coalition\u2019s\ncombined educational reforms.\nThis initial bout of reformation is\nreserved only for speci\ufb01c subjects \u2013\nMathematics, English Literature and\nLanguage, Chemistry, Biology and\nPhysics. However, Geography, History\nand the languages shall also get to\nundergo the EBacc transformation in\n2017, the inclusion of the Languages\nbeing hailed by Stephen Twigg, the\nshadow Minister for Education.\nIs the change going to be reserved\nto the name of the quali\ufb01cation? The\nanswer to this is a resounding no. The\nEBacc unashamedly harks back to the\nold days of the O level, where more\nemphasis was placed on grammar,\nspelling and punctuation. Also, the\ncurrent tiered GCSE system shall\nbe scrapped, alongside the modules\nused to divide the GCSE into bite\nsize chunks. There shall also be no\ncoursework and no in class assessment\n\u2013 the child\u2019s performance at the \u2018do or\ndie\u2019 end of year exam shall be the only\nfactor that decides success or failure.\nAnd, in possibly the most signi\ufb01cant\nchange to the current system, there\nshall be only one exam board to one\nsubject. As Michael Gove himself\nstated \u201cif we remove modules and\nI\nreduce coursework, get rid of the\nfactors that encourage teaching to the\ntest and, above all, ensure there is just\none exam board for each subject, we\ncan restore faith in our exams\u201d.\nThe reception to the proposed\nchanges has been mixed, some of the\nsternest criticisms coming from the\nteaching unions, NASUWT and NUT.\nNASUWT General Secretary, Chris\nKeates, recently said that the changes\nwere part of a \u201ccynical and wholly\nunjusti\ufb01able attempt to discredit\nthe quality and rigour of the GCSE\nquali\ufb01cation\u201d. NUT has criticised\nthe proposed reforms, arguing that\nthey shall just \u201ctest memory and\nessay writing, which are not crucial\nskills for the majority of jobs or life\ntoday\u201d. Sir Nicholas Serota, Director\nof the Sadler Wells Theatre, raised the\npoint of the arts subjects that have\nbeen excluded from the Eng Bacc\nquali\ufb01cation, stating that the arts\n\u201care integral to our understanding of\nthe world, as important as reading,\nwriting, geography and arithmetic\u201d.\nThe architect Richard Rogers, whom\nworked on the iconic Pompidou\nCentre in Paris and the EU Court of\nHuman Rights building in Strasbourg,\nhas also condemned the possible\nreforms.\nThe English Baccalaureate does not\njust exclude the arts \u2013 IT, Sociology\nand Psychology are absences that\nshall raise many eyebrows, especially\nin an age where all three make up\na signi\ufb01cant minority of university\ncourses. The possible impact of this\nwas considered by UCAS, who argue\nthat the reforms \u201ccould create a two\ntier system, where some subjects\nlose value, and students may be\ndiscriminated against because of\nsubject choice\u201d. In reality, this has\nprobablyhappened\u2013theRussellGroup\nhave already voiced their preference\nfor speci\ufb01c subjects. However, UCAS\ngo further in their criticisms and say\nthat there is \u201ca potential for negative\non the arts and the social science and\nby discrediting the quali\ufb01cations one\ngains by studying them, one discredits\nthe institutions and the pupils that\nstudy them.\nAnother criticism lies behind the\nexclusion of vocational subjects, with\nthe reforms focusing on academic\nsubjects, thus ignoring the need for\na vocational quali\ufb01cation that carries\nthe same weight as their academic\ncounterparts. With the talk of a\n\u2018technical baccalaureate\u2019 fallen by\nthe wayside, this has worried many\ncommentators and business leaders\nalike, many of whom have already\nactively called for a generation of\nworkers to be practiced in the art of\ndoing, rather than discussion.\nAll in all, the reforms by Michael\nGove appear to tackle only one aspect\nof a complex problem \u2013 the problem\nof credible quali\ufb01cations within our\nschool system, whilst wilfully ignoring\nother, perhaps more malignant, issues.\nReforms...\ntackle only one\naspect of a\ncomplex\nproblem\nThe Independent\nimpact on social mobility\u201d. This is\npossibly one of the most troubling\ncounter arguments for Michael\nGove, the Minister for Education in a\nCoalition Government that has four\nEton educated white males in the\nfour most important and in\ufb02uential\njobs in the country (Prime Minister,\nChancellor, Mayor of London and\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury). The\nargument is even more troubling due\nto its validity \u2013 state comprehensives\nand further education colleges thrive\nAll around the world, elections\n\u201cCheck out my new\nglasses! So groovy.\u201d\nMichael Gove,\nEducation Secretary and\nStar Trek believer\nIn reaction to public discontent and\npressure for reform, King Abdullah\ndissolved parliament in October,\ncalling for early elections. The new\ncaretaker cabinet is the \ufb01fth cabinet\nsince the Arab Spring started. Jordan\nhas so far avoided protests on the\nsame scale as Libya or Egypt.\nTensions are rising as the need for\nreform becomes clearer. The Muslim\nBrotherhood and Islamic Action\nFront have declared that unless the\nAmericans have chosen the man to\nleadthemforthenextfouryears.China\nis easing its way to a new leadership.\nHow are other countries doing?\nZimbabwe has an important year\ncoming up: the population will have\nto vote in a referendum for a new\nconstitution and in the presidential\nelection. Yet, there is one major\nconcern: money. The \ufb01nance minister\nelectoral system in changed, they may\nboycott the polls. The current system\nis unbalanced. 60% of the population\nis of Palestinian origin and vastly\nunderrepresented, with little political\npower. The opposition demands a\nparliament where half the seats are\nallocated to party lists compared to\njust over a quarter now. The public\nreaction to this election will be crucial\nfor Jordan\u2019s future. Some observers\nare already arguing that this is the\nbeginning of the Jordanian Spring.\nhas said that the country simply\ncannot a\ufb00ord to hold the elections,\nestimating their total cost at 129\nUSD. President Mugabe has already\nsuccessfully argued to have three by-elections postponed, saving the state\n38m USD. Foreign bodies like the EU\nand the IMF are being appealed to for\nfunds.\nOther than money, the date of the\nelection is very much debated within\nthe country. Robert Mugabe, current\npresident, is pushing for March 2013.\nThe opposition claims the election is\nbeing rushed and holding it so soon is\n\u201cunrealistic\u201d. Moreover, Mugabe and\nhis party have their reasons to open\nthe polls sooner rather than later. The\nchange is constitution must go through\nbefore the presidential election. At the\nmoment, the two main parties have\nnot come to agreement. Early elections\ncould force the hand of the opposition.\nMugabe is also doing well, popularity-wise. There is a feeling that he has\ngood chances of winning the coming\nvote. His party is also pressed for\ntime. At age 84 and following rumours\nof ill health, there are concerns that\nMugabe might not last long enough\nfor an election later rather than sooner.\nOne last fear remains: a repeat\nof the violence that followed the\nlast presidential elections in 2008.\nMorgan Tsvangirai, candidate for the\nopposition, decided to pull out days\nbefore the vote, alluding to violence\nagainst his supporters.\nIn 18 months, Afghan voters will elect\ntheir \ufb01rst new president since 2001.\nHamid Karzai was nominated as\nleader, and then won two successive\nelections. The constitution currently in\nplace prevents him from running for a\nthird term.\nThese elections come at a crucial\ntime for Afghanistan. By December\n2014, the NATO mission will come to\nan end and most foreign troops will\nhave left the country. It is unlikely that\nthe major security issues that a\ufb04ict\nthe country will have been dealt with\nby then. The Taliban remain strong\nin some areas and little dialogue\nhas been established between the\nfundamentalist movement and the\nstate. Without communication, a\npeaceful resolution of the con\ufb02ict is\ngoing to be di\ufb03cult.\nThere are also concerns over election\nfraud and violence. In the previous\nelections, only 33% of registered voters\nwent to the polls and 18% of those\nballots were classed as invalid, in what\nhas been perceived as a move to favour\nthe incumbent and successfully reelected president\nJordan\n23 January 2013\nZimbabwe\nMarch 2013 (tbc) Afghanistan\n5 April 2014\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n38\nMargot Pikovsky Sports Editor\nMiners Morn Medic Defeat\nOn Wednesday 14 November, ICSM\nLadies\u2019 2s faced o\ufb00 with the RSM\n1s at their Osterley home ground.\nThe afternoon was glorious: the sun\noverhead and no-leggings-necessary\nheat a stark contrast from the last\ntime these two teams met back in\nMarch, an event that will long stay\nin the memory of both teams for the\ntruly dire conditions, including sub\nzero temperatures and a torrential\ndownpour that started on the third\nminute and prevailed until the end of\nthe match. With that encounter having \ufb01nished in a draw, both RSM and\nMedics were keen to make this game\nworth their while.\nPre-match anxiety was particularly\nrife amongst the Medics this week as\nit emerged that the team\u2019s goalie had\nbeen unable to make it for this game.\nStepping up to the task with no prior\nexperience of ever having played in\ngoal is always a big ask so the team\nare particularly grateful to Maria Koo\nwho did just that, and made a spectacular job of it whilst she was at it. Just\nas Maria was kitting up in her attractive out\ufb01t, the RSM opponent strolled\nonto the pitch and it became instantly\nevident that the Medics were outnum-bered, with RSM boasting 3 subs to\nMedics\u2019 0. At this point, ISCM captain\nBecky Ayres called the team together\nfor a motivational pep talk, and with\njust enough time to issue a \u2018Go Medics!\u2019 the game was o\ufb00.\nFor both teams, the match took\no\ufb00 with an unsteady and more than\nslightly halting start. Whether it was\nthe nerves or the fact that the aforementioned sun now emerged to be a\nmixed blessing and was blinding the\nentire right side of the pitch (sparing\nneither ICSM attack nor RSM de-fence), it took a good 10 or so minutes\nfor both teams to pull themselves together and turn on the gas. Rapidly,\nthe game turned to the Medics\u2019 favour\nas despite several good RSM attempts\nto move the ball into mid\ufb01eld, play\nultimately revolved in the RSM goal\nhalf and increasingly their defending\nD. Becky Ayres, usually sweeper, had\nbravely taken the place of the absent\nCentre Mid\ufb01elder and was playing superbly in this position: her con\ufb01dent\nand precise hits coupled with never\nbefore witnessed speedy pitch-length\nruns proving to be a challenge for\neven the sturdiest of Miner defend-ers. Of note too was Kylie Beale, recently promoted from defence herself\nto the rather di\ufb00erent role of Centre\nForward. Her dodging prowess and\nability to push the ball up alone a good\n50m proved invaluable and ultimately\nlanded her a shot at goal, only to be\nnarrowly missed as the ball came o\ufb00\nthe right post with a disappointing\nring.\nYoshi Anderson did a terri\ufb01c job as\nLeft Forward with Rosie Wilson (Left\nMid) who was able to consistently resist RSM pressure and together they\nwould frequently confuse the opposition by bringing the ball up the far\nleft \ufb02ank. Crucially Yoshi also helped\ncoordinate the Medic press, ensuring that most Miner shots taken from\ntheir D were fruitless. On the occasion that RSM were able to get the ball\nout of their defending half, typically\nthanks to the spectacular sweeps of\nGemma the ball was usually stopped\nby the unfailing stick of Krishna Shah\nwho would swiftly send the ball back\nto the Medics\u2019 attacking D. To give\nthem their due, RSM were doing a\nvery good job of intercepting many\nof these balls, and it fell to Right Mid\nRebecca Featherston (token physicist on the Medic team) to win it\nback for ICSM with some impressive\ntackles, particularly so because she is\nrelatively new to the sport. With both\nteams doing their fair share of running around and becoming increasingly breathless as the game went on,\nICSM players completed the \ufb01rst half\nwith a remarkable series of passes culminating in Margot Pikovsky (right\nforward) having a shot at goal. Always\none to mess around a little \u2013 hockey\nIS a spectator sport \u2013 Margot \ufb01rst insisted on hitting the ball straight at the\ngoalie a couple of times (to be met by\nan angry foot) before aiming it at the\nactual goal and being rewarded by the\nsatisfying \u2018thwock\u2019 as it bounced o\ufb00\nthe back board just as the umpire blew\nthe whistle for half time. Needless to\nsay, Margot did not celebrate by running up the pitch immaturely jumping\nand shouting \u2018Yay yay yay\u2019.\nHalf time talks over and with ICSM\nup a point, RSM took to the pitch\nevidently determined to salvage the\ngame. With possession between the\nteams now more or less equal, there\nwas a dramatic improvement in both\nRSM and Medic play. ICSM defence\nin particular were forced to up their\ngame, a challenge which they eagerly\nrose to. Amy Lam and Fiona Field,\nboth newbies to the team this year,\nplayed masterfully and made some\nspectacular saves each. So well did\nthey play in fact that both almost\ntied for honour of Most Valuable\nPlayer, with Amy crowned by only a\nfew votes. No less critical to the back\nline was Kate Richmond, \ufb01lling in for\nBecky Ayres as Sweeper, though by\nthe amount the two were running and\nthe strength of their play it was di\ufb03cult to tell which of the two was playing Centre Mid.\nAnother 35 minutes of relentless\ndefence from the two teams, and despite a great e\ufb00ort from the Miners,\nthey were unable to make a mark on\nthe scoreboard. Final result 1:0 to the\nMedics then, with fantastic play from\nboth teams (I think it\u2019s fair to say that\nevery single person on the pitch got\nat least a good run out of the ses-sion) and a very well deserved win for\nICSM. The Medics look forward to\nplaying RSM again later this season,\nbut for now: what more appropriate\nway to celebrate a victory then ICSM\nRAG Centurion later that evening?\nHockey Men\u2019s 1s make first bid for Sliverware\nInsert your own\nholding sticks joke\nDespite the almost blinding light from\nthedyingsun,astrongstartfromICpro-duced the \ufb01rst opportunity within just a\nfew minutes. Graham took it perfectly,\ndribbling easily into the D and dragging\nthe ball straight past the keeper for a\ngreat \ufb01rst goal. This, however, was shortly followed with a quick response from\nUCL which equalised the game at 1-1.\nThe intensity really started to pick up\nwith both teams now o\ufb00 the mark and\nbattling it out for the lead and a place\nin the next round of the cup. A huge\naerial from Gilles, which \ufb02ew right over\nthe UCL defence, coupled with some\nimpressive speed and stick skills from\nRichard, gave a great opportunity which\nunfortunately couldn\u2019t be converted to\na goal, but did result in a short corner.\nSoon after, IC once again took the lead\nafter Christoph \ufb01nished o\ufb00 a short run,\nutilising his well-practiced dribbling\nskills, with a clean and powerful strike.\nJust before the end of the \ufb01rst half,\nsome solid defending and \ufb02are skills\nby the mid\ufb01eld resulted in Christoph\ncharging down the right hand side and\ndelivering an amazing ball straight\nacross the D for Tom to \ufb01nish with a text\nbook de\ufb02ection, bringing the score line\nto a comfortable 3-1 lead \u2013 a good start\nfor IC and a fair re\ufb02ection of play.\nThe second half started quite slowly\nwith a lot of missed opportunities and\nstray passes from both teams. After\nquite some time and improved composure from both sides, the game picked\nup again and a UCL striker somehow\nmanaged to score an unlikely goal from\nangle, despite having completely missed\ntheballonhis\ufb01rstattemptatgoal,bringing the score to a less comfortable 3-2.\nA nerve wracking \ufb01nal twenty seconds saw UCL gaining a short corner,\nwhich fortunately was missed \u2013 giving\nIC a well-deserved win and a place in the\nnext round of the BUCS cup.\nYes it\u2019s a generic team picture. Yes if we had another option we\nwould use something fun, but we can only print what we get sent!\nAnthony Vaquero Men\u2019s 1st Captain\n\n"

Have you failed\nat basic logic at least\nonce since breakfast?\nHave you propagated\na myth or notion that despite its spuriousness has persisted through laziness and avoidance of fact-checking?\nHave you done your duty as a human\nbeing and exercised your right as a\ncitizen?\nThousands of people are wrong every day. You can \ufb01nd them blabbering\non the tube, yakking in caf\u00e9s and especially on the internet, where this function is held sacred, third only behind\ncats and porn. Open any news website,\nscroll to the comments section and\nyou will be greeted by heaps of messages of people who spar with fallacies\nusing the same skill that master fencers employ. But what you may think is\nmerely the noxious combination of an\nunwarranted sense of entitlement, a\nlack of proper education and way too\nmuch free time, is in fact a proud service indispensable to society.\nWrongness is not something that\neveryone across history has been able\nto a\ufb00ord: until not too long ago, people\nwere punished and killed for kneeling\nin front of the wrong monarch; in the\nnot-so-distant past people could\u2019ve\nfound themselves on the burning side\nof a stake for claiming that the Christ\u2019s\nleft nostril hair was the wrong shade\nof yellow while he was being cruci\ufb01ed;\nand in almost any age, you could be\npersecuted if your skin was the wrong\ncolour, if you were born in the wrong\ncountry, or if you simply looked at\nsomeone in the wrong way.\nBut it is our right to be wrong. We\nmust have no fear in picking a candi-date, an idea, a preference and holding it as right despite evidence to the\ncontrary. We must be able to claim\nwhichever band we prefer to be the\nbest without fear of repercussion, regardless of actual measurable talent\nor pleasantness of song. We must be\nallowed to stick to our personal set of\nbeliefs even in the face of insurmountable evidence that proves us wrong.\nFreedom of speech means that no\nmatter how inane, inaccurate and inarticulate our thoughts get, we must be\nable to stand by them and hold them\ndear, because they are our thoughts,\nand it is our prerogative to be wrong.\nPeople died for this prerogative.\nWars were fought, tyrants deposed\nand democracies established, so that\ntoday you could express your opinion\non current issues without getting the\npunch to the back of the head you so\nrichly deserve for being so demonstrably wrong. And we\u2019re all the better because of it! We have enjoyed the\nperiod of greatest peace, equality and\nprosperity in the history of mankind\nsince we\u2019ve all allowed ourselves to\nbe wrong. How could it not be? Attempting to punish everyone for their\nwrongness cannot be done with our\nH\nThe right to be wrong\nmeagre resources: too many people\nare just too damn wrong for too much\nof the time. It\u2019s better to let them stay\nin the error of their ways, and concentrate on technologies that allow them\nto share fallacies with strangers from\nacross the globe or medical advances\nthat can make them live longer and\nbetter, though they won\u2019t know how.\nBesides, wrong people provide invaluable services to the community:\nthey make smart people look good\nby comparison; they put arguments\nto the test; they spend a lot of money\nif you know what to sell, angmongst\nother things. And if everyone starts\nthinking the wrong stu\ufb00, and we\u2019re\nall wrong in some way, who can even\ntell? If everyone\u2019s opinion is incor-rect, who can even \ufb01gure out who\u2019s\nright? Apart from the smart people,\nobviously: they know. But the masses,\nthe many who spend their lives in idle\nchatter on forum boards and public\ntransportation, those who choose\nwho they\u2019re going to vote in their\nfever dreams and those who are easily confused by common sense, they\ncan all be wrong together, and in their\nshared state their wrongness will\nseem less so.\nThe next time you see someone\ndisagree with you despite his opinion being blatantly mistaken, delete\nthat scathing multi-paragraph post\nin which you denounce him and all\nhis ancestors as morons, and refrain\nfrom trying to bash some sense into\nhim. He\u2019s just expressing one of his\nfundamental rights, perhaps the most\nfundamental right of all: wrongness is\na prerogative of sentient beings, and\nbeing able to be wrong is what makes\nus human.\nPietro Aronica and our prerogative of wrongness\nPietro Aronica\nLetters\nfelixonline.co.uk/contact\nSir,\nI do believe I have come across a\n(partial, at least) solution to both the\nover congestion of the London Underground and obesity within our fine\ncapital. I happened upon the idea\nwhilst commuting to college a few\nmornings previous. As something of a\nrarity, the tube was running on time,\nhowever, as the doors opened before\nme I was unable to board said train\ndue to an obese man of surely no less\nthan 140kg blocked entry.\nIt occurred to me that had that man\nbeen of a healthier build I would have\nbeen able to board the train. Moments\nlater \u2013 after a number of expletives\nwere muttered \u2013 I had that eureka\nmoment: ticket prices should be linked\nto your size; not by height nor weight,\nbut a measurement of your widest\nbody part.\nNot only would this make pricing\nfairer by ensuring that someone taking\nup twice the space pay twice as much\nbut I imagine it would give the more\ncorpulent commuters an incentive to\nlose some weight.\nI do concede that my idea might not\nbe perfect and may require further development and refinement, but once\nthe minor details have been sorted I\nhave no doubt in the potential of the\nscheme.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY Technology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nes, dear readers, I have\nrecently discovered the\nworld of wireless head-phones. Two weeks\nago, bored and not\nfeeling like untangling my normal\nheadphones, I decided to peruse\nthe various stores of the internet,\nto discover if the World Wide Web\nhad anything to tickle my fancy. Lo\nand behold, on Amazon, I stumbled upon a whole array of Bluetooth headphones, and, perhaps\nmore surprisingly, very (and I mean\nVERY) attractively priced ones.\nI had previously visited an Apple\nstore (to check out the iPad mini)\nand had seen headphones priced at\n\u00a3300, so to see these puppies being displayed from \u00a320 to \u00a370 was\nreally astounding! Anyway, before\nI launch into my review of one of\nthese headphones that I purchased,\nI will firstly talk pros and cons of\nBluetooth/wireless headphones in\ngeneral.\nSo what are all the advantages of\nBluetooth headphones? Well the\nfact that you don\u2019t actually have a\nwire is beneficial in many different\nways. The lack of a wire also implies a lack of consequent tangles,\nso when you decide to listen to music you just pull your headphones\nout of your bag and you\u2019re ready to\ngo! Also, when I have headphones/\nearphones, the wire tends to be the\nweakest link of the whole thing, and\nthus usually breaks first. When the\nwire is faulty it impairs the whole\nlistening experience, for example\nonly being able to hear from one\near sucks. With the Bluetooth stuff,\nthere is no cable to be the weakest link, and therefore the\nthing as a whole\nis less likely\nto break.\nIf, like me, you listen to lots of music that requires a\ncertain degree of head\nbanging, then the wireless environment of the\nBluetooth headphone will\nallow you the freedom to\nhead bang to your heart\u2019s\ncontent! Lastly, but certainly not least, of the\npros is the fact\nthat these devices have a\nrange of\na b o u t\n5-10m. So if you are at home, listening off your laptop with your head-phones, you can easily just stand\nup, get that can of Red Bull [Felix\nin no way endorses Red Bull over its\nimitators] from the fridge, all without the hassle of losing your music.\nSo with all these pros, you must\nbe thinking, hey, what\u2019s the catch?\nWell, battery drain is about the biggest con if you are on the move. Users have experienced about double\nthe battery usage on their smartphone when they listen to music\nwith their Bluetooth headphones.\nSo if you\u2019re someone who uses your\nsmartphone a lot, as well as not having much access to a charger all day,\nwires may still be the best option for\nyou. There are also concerns about\nsafety, as you are open to people\ntaking control. You are pretty much\nopening up your device to others\nwho also have Bluetooth, although\nthis issue has largely been resolved\nin recent years. Some people also\nseem to think that the sound quality\nsuffers with Bluetooth headphones.\nWhile this may be true if you have\nyour phone 10 meters away, if it\u2019s\nin your pocket/bag/immediate area\nit sounds IDENTICAL to a wired\nconnection of the same price range.\nSo why are Bluetooth head-phones/earphones such a rare com-modity? Well, I believe that the\nwidespread usage of these devices\nhas been curbed by the expectation that they are really expensive!\nThat\u2019s why I am here to review my\nown \u00a322.97 headphones; to see if\ngood headphones really do cost a\nlot, or if bargain hunters can also\nwin!\nAfter I had seen the Bluetooth\nstereo Headset SX-907 on\nAmazon, I believed it\nwas too good to be\nt r u e . I mean, how can\nt h e s e things look so\nnice, do what they do\nand cost un- der \u00a325?\nAfter lots of d e b a t i n g\nI decided to s p l a s h\nout, convincing m y s e l f\nby saying I would start going to those free lunches\nthose societies all seem to\no r g a n i s e ! W h e n\nm y\npackage\nf i n a l l y\ncame in\nthe mail,\nI was ext r e m e l y\nexcited. I\ndropped everything and started\nthe arduous pro-FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n24\nY\ncess of ripping apart the wrapping.\nAs I got to the actual box, I was\nslightly disappointed. The picture\non the outside had obviously been\nphotoshopped (badly) to include\nthe headphones, and it all looked\nkind of cheap. Not only that, but\nthere was no user manual, and the\nheadphones just lay in the package.\nThis was not the way I expected my\nBluetooth headphone relationship\nto start.\nHowever, things seemed to look\nup from there. The headphones\nweren\u2019t exactly beautiful (mostly\nplastic), but for 20 quid I hadn\u2019t\nexpected them to look great. I\nturned them on, a beep greeted me\nand, nicely enough, they were fully\ncharged. This was signalled by the\nlight on the side of the headphones.\nThis light is the only way that the\nheadphones can communicate with\nyou, so this little lightbulb has many\ndifferent variations (red, blue, alter-nating, it does it all), which is extremely bright. Without the manual it took me a while to pair these\nbabies with my phone, but after a\nwhile I got it and it was surprisingly\npainless, with a nice little beep to\nconfirm I had paired successfully.\nThen came the big test, the mu-sic. I had chosen a set playlist to test\neverything on my new headphones,\nand started out with \u201cNumb/Encore\u201d by Jay-Z and Linkin Park,\nto be the virgin track. The first\nbeat blew me away. For \u00a320, I was\nhearing some of the best quality I\nhad EVER heard, and all wireless\nto boot. Also, they weren\u2019t too un-comfortable, and blocked out surrounding sound very nicely. There\nare buttons on the sides of the\nheadphones, allowing you to do the\nelementary functions you would\nnormally do on your phone. The\nvolume/fast forward button is a\nbit haphazard though, and I don\u2019t\nthink I will be using it much as it is\nhard to use properly without making mistakes. These headphones\nalso have a rudimentary mic, so\nright away I started a phone call.\nThe quality of the audio was good\nenough, but the mic was not up to\nscratch: it was not transmitting well\nenough. So I guess receiving and\nmaking phone calls are not on the\nagenda. As I turned off the music\nI noticed a quiet beeping/\u201cweird\nmachine\u201d sound in the right head-phone. Although this does not really disturb me, as my music drowned\nout this noise, for people who listen\nto music at lower volumes, this may\nbe irritating.\nA week after purchasing these\npuppies, I have fully charged them\nonce (still going strong) and have\nused them in every conceivable\nplace (Library, train, walking etc).\nThey\u2019ve passed all of the tests with\nflying colours, using about 6% of\nmy phone battery per hour. This is\nquite good as it means that I have\nabout 10 hours of listening to mu-sic! I\u2019ve paired them to phones,\nSX-907 Bluetooth Headphones\nMax Eggl discovers an incredible pair at a banging price, just \u00a330. Get in!\ntablets and computers and it has all\nworked flawlessly. I even managed\nto use them while my laptop was\non the other side of my apartment\n(with walls in between). Annoyingly though, I have found that the\nbuttons on the side of the headset\nare very easily pressed, so I keep\npausing in songs, but that may just\nbe me. Also, while studying in the\nLibrary, I did get the complaint\nthat my headphones were too loud.\nWhile this may not be a con for myself per se, it might annoy others.\nMy last con for these headphones\nis that, because they use plastic for\neverything, wearing these things for\nan hour did make my ears hurt, as\nwell as my scalp feel very uncom-fortable.\nAll in all, for the price that I got\nthese headphones, they are excellent and I give them a very impressive 9/10. However, considering the\nfact that they deliver in such spectacular manner, my question is why\ndon\u2019t many more people have these\nthings?\nFor \u00a320, I\nwas hearing\nsome of the\nbest quality\nsound I\u2019ve\nEVER heard\n\n"

I thought the decibel limit was\nset by Kat and Al\ufb01e from Eastenders\nor possibly Gordon Brown on a bad\nday, but it seems that Brian King and\nDavid Prowse can beat them all with\nthe intense garage rock made by Japandroids. I used to really love this\nband three years ago when their debut\nPost-Nothing arrived with a huge slab\nof hype and a shimmer of reverb, but\nI had somewhat forgotten about them\nuntil quite recently. Their second album Celebration Rock sounds more\nmature but, while lacking much of the\ncoverage that they once commanded,\nthey continue to produce spectacular\nnoise-pop. Japandroids may have disappeared from my radar for a while\nbut when the chance to see them play\nat Heaven, I jumped at the opportu-nity.\nThe crowd in Heaven was absolutely\npacked in and the anticipation to see\none of Vancouver\u2019s \ufb01nest exports (sor-ry 2010 Winter Olympic Games, you\nare not so cool) was tangible. Starting\nthe night with \u201cThe Boys are Leaving\nTown\u201d and newie \u201cAdrenaline Nightshift\u201d it was clear that Japandroids\nwere a heavy proposition, much darker and louder than they are on record.\nAnd for two people, my God they are\nloud! The set was roughly divided\n50:50 with songs from the new album and more well-known numbers.\n\u201cRockers East Vancouver\u201d and \u201cWet\nHair\u201d were de\ufb01nitely highlights and\nthe crowd gave a massive cheer to new\nsingle \u201cThe House that Heaven Built\u201d.\nThe one song, however, that I have always loved by Japandroids is \u201cCrazy/\nForever\u201d and they certainly gave it justice with a thrilling performance.\nUnfortunately, towards the end of\nthe set the band struggled to overcome technical di\ufb03culties with vocal\nlevels which slightly marred the show.\nBrian King admirably fought on and\njust ended up shouting to the audi-ence: true punk spirit if ever I have\nseen it. Once the sound problems\nwere \ufb01xed the show came to a thrilling\n\ufb01nale with a cover of The Gun Club\u2019s\n\u201cFor the Love of Ivy\u201d . The band invited one lucky member of the crowd\nto come up and then stage-dive head\n\ufb01rst into the heaving crowd and be\ncarried around in the air for as long\nas possible. One excitable fellow got\nup but then ruined his chance by trying to rep his own band. What a loser.\nAnd so, when the opening chords of\nsong crashed into light there were\nhuge cheers as one lucky guy had the\ntime of his life being thrown around\nthe adoring crowd while his favourite\nband totally destroyed his eardrums.\nAll in all it was a fantastic night.\nI had forgotten how fun straight up\npunk shows could be. Japandroids are\nso dedicated to their fans and it makes\nfor a glorious night when their epic\ntunes combine with the sweat and\nshakes of a relatively small venue. A\nFriday night well spent!\nMark England Music Editor\nMark England chews the cud with Japandroids\nBrian King, lead singer and guitarist of\nJapandroids, talked to me about London. his favourite record and where\ntheir awesome name originates from.\nWhere does the name Japandroids\ncome from?\nThere was no inspiration for the name\nJapandroids speci\ufb01cally. As a matter of\nfact, it was more of a compromise that\nneither one of us were particularly excited about. Originally, Dave wanted\nto name the band \u2018Japanese Scream\u2019,\nwhich is from a Kings Of Leon lyr-ic, while I wanted to name the band\n\u2018Pleasure Droids\u2019, which is a reference\nto the pleasure droids in the movie\nBlade Runner. Neither one of us liked\nthe other\u2019s name, and we found ourselves at an impasse. Being the diplomatic hero that I am, I decided to simply combine the two names into one\nsingular name: Japandroids.\nHow does London compare to other\ncities you have toured?\nLondon audiences are without question our best audience within the\nUnited Kingdom. When I tell them to\nget wild, they generally do. We always\nlook forward to playing London for\nthat reason. With respect to other cities from around the world, it is a bit unfair to compare one against the other,\nas what you\u2019re really comparing are the\nsocial and cultural di\ufb00erences between\npeoples. For example, the Spanish audience and the English audience are\ninherently di\ufb00erent as the ritual of how\none reacts to live rock and roll music is\nrooted deep in the history of the people and their way of life.

At least, I can\u2019t help but see it\nthat way. I certainly think it was worth\ntaking our time to record an album\nwe were proud of, and I don\u2019t regret\nthe resulting wait in the least. If we\ncould have done it faster, believe me,\nwe would have (for a band like ours,\nthere is no incentive to have such gaps\nbetween albums). Nevertheless, the\nreaction from our fans seems to be\nextremely positive, and I think as time\ngoes by, our decision to take the time\nwe needed to write and record this particular album (rather than expediently\nshitting out a mediocre follow-up) will\nbe seen as rather responsible.\nWhat is it like being a two person\nband on the road?\nMore or less like backpacking around\nEurope with your girlfriend or boy-friend.

As a student you can imagine that\nI\u2019m not predisposed to having a great\nsympathy for waking up at the unholy\nhour of four-thirty AM, unless for\na ludicrously inexpensive \ufb02ight. But\nhere I am \u2013 with another four hours\nstill to wait for what I came for; already starting to lose the feeling in my\nextremities from the cold.\nI cannot extol the virtues of liberty\nenough \u2013 appreciation of liberty is\nsomething that de\ufb01nes much of me and\nmy thoughts: I can only imagine that\nsomeone who would wish to happily\nsurrender their own liberties, or take\naway anyone else\u2019s liberty is utterly de-ranged, or just insidiously stupid. This\nis why I\u2019m here, waiting for nearly \ufb01ve\nhours in temperatures that only Antarctic research scientists could ever be prepared for. Our servicemen and women\nhave fought for our liberty (and for the\nliberty of our Dominions) in the past\nand continue to do so: I\u2019m here to pay\nmy thanks to them for this incredible\ngift of truly immeasurable wealth.\nHaving checked the information for\nthe event with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, I decided to arrive early in the hope of getting a good\nviewing point, close to the Cenotaph,\nour central memorial to the fallen. I\ncouldn\u2019t have imagined that I would\nhave arrived early enough to be at the\nfront of the barriers, about \ufb01fteen metres from the memorial itself. Instructed\nto \u2018stand easy\u2019, members of the Royal\nGurkha Regiment assembled to my left\nand, to my right, the Scots Guards; with\ntheir enormous ceremonial bearskin\nhats. After representations of several\nunits from di\ufb00erent areas of our armed\nforces had convened, the politicians and\nthe royal family came out of the Foreign\nand Commonwealth O\ufb03ce building. A\nbetter view I could not have wished for \u2013\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II stands\nat twelve o\u2019clock (in the gap between\nthe obscuring bearskins) \u2013 ten metres\naway, with David Cameron, Nick Clegg,\nEd Miliband, Boris Johnson and former\nI\nRemembering the fallen\nJames Dickson reports from the service at the Cenotaph\nPrime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John\nMajor further in the background.\nNever had a silence been so penetrating and poignant to me. At eleven\nam, on the eleventh day, of the eleventh month, thousands stood together\non Whitehall, and indeed across and\noutside the country, from Enniskillen\n(where the IRA bombing of Remembrance Day 1987 lends a special signi\ufb01cance to the event in the town) to\nToronto. A cannon \ufb01red. Big Ben\u2019s tolls\nrang out throughout the precinct. Conversations stopped. The camera shutter\nnoises stopped. Everything stopped.\nAs silence prevailed, every single one\nof these assembled peoples was united\nin an intense gratitude, not just to both\nliving and fallen friends and family, but\nto people whom they have never known\nand never will know. Through war, we\nhave found undying love, peace, and\ngratitude. Inscribed on the Cenotaph,\nare the words \u2018The Glorious Dead\u2019 \u2013 I\ncan\u2019t help but feel that this is a similar\nstory of intense juxtaposition.\nThe ceremony then continued\nthrough hymn and prayer, and through\na huge procession of veterans and their\nwidows. I can tell you \u2013 singing our\nnational anthem, with Her Majesty 10\nmetres away, directly ahead, is something quite extraordinary. Hearing one\nof the many brilliant marching bands in\nattendance playing Edward Elgar\u2019s exquisite Nimrod, with so many of our exceptional armed forces surrounding us,\nwas also something I shall never forget.\nAnd that is the lesson: we must never\nforget. For the sake of every person that\nhas fought for anyone\u2019s liberty; we must\nremember and be thankful. Lest we forget what liberty is.\nI would ask you to consider donating to\nthe Royal British Legion, or Help for Heroes, both of which are registered charities which help the families of the fallen,\nand support those whom have known,\nand may be bodily and mentally a\ufb00ected\nfor life by con\ufb02ict; \ufb01ghting for our ever-precious liberty.\nNever had\nsilence\nbeen so\npenetrating\nand so\npoignant to\nme\nFollow us on Twitter and on Facebook!\n@FelixComment | facebook.com/FelixComment\nJames Sean\nDickson\n\n"

But since the average success\nrate of these applications increased,\nImperial still received the high\namount of funding.\nThe table produced by THE\nshowed that Imperial ranked first\nfor amount of funding, followed by\nUniversity College London, University of Edinburgh, University of\nCambridge and University of Oxford. The complete table shows the\nfunding, success rate and number\nof applications for 20 universities\nacross the UK.\nUniversity of Cambridge saw a\nmassive drop in their income as\ntheir funding fell from \u00a385.2 million\nin 2010-2011 to \u00a356.2 million in\n2011-2012, a 34 per cent decrease.\nThey also had a fall in application\nnumbers so that their success rate\nincreased from 33 per cent to 37 per\ncent.\nSome institutions that actually\nhad an increase in funding from UK\nresearch councils were the universities of Birmingham, Edinburgh and\nUniversity College London. University of Liverpool had a dramatic rise\nin funding from \u00a312.3 million to \u00a324\nAemun Reza News Editor million, therefore almost doubling.\nThe University of Bath had a giant\nleap in their success rate, from 31\nper cent to 42. Jane Millar, Pro ViceChancellor for Research at Bath,\nsaid she was pleased with the suc-cesses, \u201cespecially at a time when\nfunding is getting tough\u201d.\nShe said that the institution\u2019s system of internal academic peer review and \u201coutstanding academic appointments\u201d had made a difference.\nSome institutions contested the\nfindings of THE, The University of\nLeeds had apparently seen a decline\nin their funding from \u00a334.5 million\nin 2010-2011 to \u00a321.3 million in\n2011-2012 as well as a drop in number of applications and awards.\nA spokesman for the university\nsaid the figures did \u201cnot give the\ncomplete picture of research council funding received by the university\u201d because they did not include\nSTFC cash and collaborative grants\nwith other institutions.\nHope the cameraman\nhad his lab specs on, or\nHealth and Safety will\nbe weilding their axe.\nOnly a foam axe though,\nfor health and safety\nreasons...\nthe science budget. Since then, researchers have been wary of the decrease in funding due to inflation.\nThe cuts for certain departments\nexceed 40%. Back in 2010, George\nOsborne decided to protect the science budget. He said \u201cthe secretary\nof state (for business) and I have decided to protect the science budget.\nBritain is a world leader in scientific\nresearch and that is vital to our future economic success. That\u2019s why\nI am proposing that we do not cut\nthe cash going to the science budget.\nIt will be protected at \u00a34.6bn per\nyear.\u201d The UK spends approximately\n\u00a325bn on R&D, positioning it seventh in the world by % GDP. The tables show that the UK government is\nnot spending as much (by %GDP) as\nother leading nations. Coupling this\nwith the real-term cuts could potentially damage the UK\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness.\nIn the UK, about 32% of funding\nfor R&D is provided by the govern-ment.\nWhen the UK is compared to other\ncountries in the G7 (United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Italy, France,\nGermany, Japan, Canada), the UK\nspends the lowest percentage of the\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) on\nR&D (see table above).\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nGermany\nFrance\nJapan\nCanada\nItaly\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n42\n37\n29\n20\n18\n17\n-Country\nExpenditure\non R&D as a\npercentage\nof GDP\nG7 R&D spend as % of GDP.

The years\nbetween 2006-7 and 2009-10 have all\nseen an increase in overall spending\non Science, Engineering and Technology.\nThe change means that spending\nis now, in real terms, which means\nthat in\ufb02ation has been taken into ac-count, the lowest it has been since\n2001-2002.\nPublic spending science cuts have\nbeen increasingly feared by the science community, especially over\nthe last few years of austerity. These\nfears are now becoming a reality,\nas shown by the \ufb01gures released by\nthe government; even though the\ncoalition government had previously promised to protect the science\nbudget amid the massive spending\ncuts. The Department for Business,\nInnovation and Skills\u2019s (BIS) core\nscience budget for universities and\nresearch councils is not aligned with\nin\ufb02ation. This results in a real-term\nreduction in spending, particularly\ndue to in\ufb02ation in these technology\nsectors tending to be higher than\nthe average. Recent \ufb01gures show\nthat in the \ufb01rst year of the coalition\ngovernment, through individual departments there has been a 7.6%\ndecrease in government spending\non science.

We know the pressure is on departments to cut [and]\nthis is something they can do relatively silently. There is more to fear\nfrom further cuts coming.\u201d Further\n\ufb01gures published by the BIS show\nlarge cuts during 2009-11. The department for Transport slashed\nspending on science and R&D from\n\u00a382m to \u00a354m, representing a decrease of over one-third. The Ministry of Defence is the department that\nspends the most on R&D, and they\ncut its budget by \u00a3239m, which is approximately 13%. BIS is responsible\nfor the core science budget, yet the\nindividual departments make decisions on wider spending for R&D\nand innovation.\nProfessor Stephen Curry, a structural biologist from Imperial College\nLondon has commented that these\nare \u201ctough times for UK science if\nwe are to protect our world-leading\nreputation, we need to reverse this\ntrend as soon as we are able.\u201d\nIn 2010, the government demanded a \ufb02ash cash settlement for\n\n"

It is\na simple truth.\nDon\u2019t bother to\nargue, it is mathematically proven\nand was stated as such in last week\u2019s\narticle by Becky Lane, as only around\n3 out of 10 people at Imperial contain a vagina. If Imperial students\nwere balls in a bag, and there were\nten balls, only three of these would\nbe yellow (or any other colour to represent women) and the rest would\noutnumber these signi\ufb01cantly \u2013 obviously belittle them and then make\nthem feel inferior. For the angry\nfeminists out there, I am sorry to use\nballs in this analogy, but the point\nstill stands (again, my apologies).\nRegardless of being a minority,\nobviously women should be treated\nequally to men. We should not be\npaid less in our jobs for the same\nwork and we should not stand for\nattacks on us based on gender alone.\nSo Becky\u2019s system to quantify sexism at Imperial to approach sexism that way is great, but women at\nImperial also need to do something\nmore than just sit back and write an\nangry email every now and then.\nThey also need to realise when\nsomething is a joke, and need to\nstop reinforcing the stereotype that\nfemales are oversensitive, emotional\nbags of hormones. I genuinely think\nthat there are few truly sexist males\nat Imperial \u2013 it is a cultural thing\n\u2013 just like inadvertently insulting\nsomeone\u2019s sexuality by using \u201cgay\u201d\nas an insult. I feel the same towards\nhomophobia; it is not common at all\nat Imperial, but the use of gay as an\ninsult is. I am not saying this makes\nit acceptable, or that people do not\nstill feel o\ufb00ense, but I do think it is\na cultural framework that supports\nthis so called \u201cbanter\u201d, not the truth.\nHowever, sexism can reach whole\nnew lows outside the relatively intelligent community on campus\n\u2013 which is why it still needs to be\ncombatted. Females nowadays need\nto actively challenge those stereotypes that are picked up on, even if\nmen may really believe them or not\nand not just sit back and live up to\nthe idea that women are the weaker,\nwhinier sex.\nI am not going to present my views\nas valid just because I am a woman\ntoo. Some women feel threatened by\nmen talking and giving opinions of\nviews in feminism because of something to do with \u201cnot understanding\nthe suppression,\u201d or whatever, but I\nfeel it is so straightforward an issue\nto approach even a man can contrib-W\nute to this (a joke guys). It is about\nwomen gaining positions of authority and respect and therefore proving that they can hold themselves\njust as well as men think they do\nthemselves. It is about striving to\nwork hard, doing your degree well\nand proving you are not the weaker\nsex, as opposed to sitting there and\nmoping about being called a little\ngirl. There are plenty of examples\nof these women around campus\nalready, but Imperial is not a great\nsample of the wider world.\nSexism comes in many forms, but\ncommanding respect as a woman\ncan only help narrow the gap and\nreduce our supposed vulnerability\nand susceptibility to such inequal-ity. This is why this is something we\nshould take with us when we graduate and enter a world dominated by\nmales in power. It is not fair that we\nshould have to invest more energy\njust to equal the playing ground, but\nunfortunately life is never going to\nbe that fair, is it?\nWomen don\u2019t dominate politics\nor banking despite them having\nthe capacity to do so, which makes\npeople feel that they are suppressed\nas a gender, but in reality, unless\nthere is a precise 50-50 split, there\nalways will be one gender more\npresent than the other. Why this\nis rarely women then? Maybe it is\nthe pay gap, or \u201ctradition\u201d, but I am\nafraid to say this may never go away\nswiftly, no matter how many graphs\nyou make of it.

    "content": "TELEVISION\nTelevision Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\nConfessions of a TV-holic\nNathalie Skrzypek gives us her take on this week\u2019s TV offerings\nfter wasting far too\nmuch time this week\nwatching all the series\nI am addicted to (like I\ndo every week), I have\ncompiled a top \ufb01ve episodes of the\nweek list and give my thoughts on\nthem below (SPOILER ALERT):\n1.) Castle\nEven though I generally stay away\nfrom crime shows, Castle caught\nmy attention back in the day, due to\nmy love for Nathan Fillion. My sci\ufb01 obsession introduced me to Fire\ufb02y\nnearly a decade ago, so my sci-\ufb01 obsessed heart skipped a beat when the\nCastle producers decided to mock\nFire\ufb02y for its 10 year anniversary \u2013\nand what better way to do so than to\nhave Nathan Fillion himself judge the\nshow, while his girlfriend and daughter out themselves as super-fans?\n2.) Two and a Half Men\nI feel like the show has gone slightly\ndownhill since Charlie \u2018left\u2019 and I\ngenerally despise Miley Cyrus (god\nI hope she was putting that accent\non\u2026), but I found this episode beyond hilarious. Berta is one of my\nfavourite characters on TV and her\ndescribing Miley Cyrus as what happens when a hillbilly has unprotected sex with a hummingbird, was one\nof her best comments ever.\n3.) The Big Bang Theory\nBeing an Astrophysics PhD student\nat Imperial, it is kinda compulsory\nto watch The Big Bang Theory. The\nshow cracks me up every week, potentially because I can identify with\nthe crazies, but this episode was particularly good, as Penny managed to\nget Sheldon drunk on (Long Island\nIce) Tea to the point where he nearly\nforgot his OCD and only knocked on\nWill Wheaton\u2019s door twice.\n4.) How I Met Your Mother\nI found the last few episodes of this\nseason not too enjoyable, as they\npacked all the break-ups in a bit too\nclosely, but I guess it had to be done,\nif the show has to end soon. I personally \ufb01nd this breakup the funniest\nto watch, probably because Robin\u2019s\nboyfriend is just so very special, Lily\nand Marshall are just so very horny\nand last but not least, my BarneyRobin shipper heart hopes that Barney\u2019s convincing \u2018fake\u2019 speech about\nhow he loves Robin wasn\u2019t all that\nfake.\n5.) 2 Broke Girls\nDespite my initial hesitance about\nthis show (let\u2019s face it, the synopsis sounds very lame\u2026 2 broke girls\nworking in a diner\u2026 who wants to\nsee that?), the trailer caught my attention and the first episode made\nme fall in love with the show. Even\nthough it is shockingly inappropri-ate, it is too funny to be offensive.\nThe latest episode showed Caroline from her \u2018best\u2019 side and Max\n(aka Kat Dennings, who is just plain\nawesome) is just an absolute leg-end.\nA\nNot to be outdone by my long-lost- twin Nath (see article above),\nI have also compiled a list of my\ntop episodes from this week.\nYou may notice that our tastes\nare quite similar, although she\nclaims she only watches Glee because she is incapable of giving\nup on a show once she\u2019s started.\nThat\u2019s true dedication. But enough\nabout Nath, onto my opinions.\nThe Big Bang Theory has a special place in my heart and rarely\ndisappoints, with this week being no exception. Sheldon drunk\nand confused about women is just\npriceless. I also simply love every\nscene him and Penny are in to-gether.\nCristina Yang \ufb01nally returns\nto Seattle! Thank the Gods, I really missed her snarkiness and her\ninteraction with the other core\ncharacters. I hope the new interns\non Grey\u2019s Anatomy man up soon,\nbecause they\u2019re getting on my\nnerves a bit.\nThe writers of The New Normal amaze me with their ability to produce entire monologues\npacked with a gazillion insults and\nstill make it funny.\nAs Nath already mentioned, the\nnumber of breakups has put a bit\nof a damper on the current season of HIMYM. That being said, I\nstill hope this isn\u2019t the last season,\nas I feel there isn\u2019t enough time\nto introduce the mother and get\nBarney and Robin together in a\nbelievable way.\nThe latest episode of Glee\nmarked the debut of Glee Project\nwinner Blake Jenner and I must\nadmit that I am disappointed with\nhis character. He just strikes me\nas another Finn (and really, one\nis enough). Also, I want Kurt and\nBlaine back together... like now.\nThe show just isn\u2019t the same without them as a couple.\nShe\u2019s definitely pulling that\nslit off better than Angelina\nMy Top 5 Episodes of the Week\nLucia Podhorska\nOh hey, I also watched some TV... beware, here there be spoilers\nTelevision Editor\n1.

The following\n\ufb01lms have caused much contension\nin the Felix O\ufb03ce \u2013 one in particular is one of my co-Editor's favourite\n\ufb01lms. But I'm sure everyone has been\nthere \u2013 watching a \ufb01lm that everyone\nelse thinks is amazing/wonderful/life-changing (delete as appropriate), but\nyou just can't understand what the\nfuss is about. It's not that I can't appreciate the intrinsic cinematic worth\nof some of these \ufb01lms, because I can,\nbut that doesn't mean I enjoy watching them. And if everyone can resist\nthe temptation to lynch me/form an\nangry mob on campus I'd be very ap-preciative...\nLord of the Rings Trilogy\n(2001, 2002, 2003)\nSo. Boring. I'm going to admit right\naway that I struggle with fantasy \u2013 I\n\ufb01nd it hard to relate to as a genre. I also\nappreciate simplicity in a \ufb01lm - too\nmany things to remember/too many\ncharacters or species or whatever and\nI get frustrated. If I'm going to have to\nwork so hard to watch a \ufb01lm, it better have something special to say (and\nfrankly these \ufb01lms don't reap much in\nterms of reward.)\nBut, that's not to say I can't appreciate the fantastic things about this\ntrilogy. The sheer level of e\ufb00ort is in-credible: the e\ufb00ects, costuming, cinematography and scale. And the acting\ncallibre is amazing, but none of this\nsaves the \ufb01lms from essentially being\nlong, quite same-y, action sequences.\nI think the truth about this trilogy\nis they are wonderfully executed, but\nbased on a story that I care little for.\nI have the same problem with the\nbooks \u2013 there is a limit to the amount\nI care about a gang of tiny, jewellery-obsessed hairy men.\nDonnie Darko (2001)\nWhere to begin? I think the main issue is that I just don't get it. I suspect\nI'm not alone in this \u2013 I have this suspicion that most people just pretend\nto get whatever the hell it is about,\nbut, really, they haven't got a fucking\nclue. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a teenager\nhaunted by hallucinations of a large\nrabbit, which manipulates him to go\non a crime spree. Mixing sci-\ufb01, black\ncomedy and mental illness was always\ngoing to be tricky, and from a young,\npractically unknown \ufb01lmmaker even\nmore so. Nobody can fault the writer\ndirector Richard Kelly for his imagination and con\ufb01dence of style (which\nwould be impressive even in an established director), but he pollutes\nan interesting story with confusing\nimagery and too much plot layering.\nDonnie Darko is probably more style\nthan substance, but even the style\nmisses the mark. Too chaotic and too\nweird for me, and I still don't know\nwhat Kelly was trying to say, despite\nthe \ufb01lm's dedicated cult following.\nRevolutionary Road (2008)\nThis \ufb01lm saw DiCaprio and Winslet\nreunited for the \ufb01rst time since Titanic in 1997, so naturally I was curious to\nsee how their chemisty had changed\non screen over ten years on. They\nplay a suburban couple, the Wheelers,\nwhose loveless marriage is irrevocably\ndisintegrating. I understand why this\n\ufb01lm is the way it is \u2013 slow and stilted\n\u2013 re\ufb02ecting the mundane suburbia\nthe couple \ufb01nd themselves in. They\nrepresent the bourgeoise of post war\nAmerica, plagued by lack of purpose,\nhopeless consumerism and the stasis\nSin City (2005)\nThis \ufb01lm disturbed me so much I can't\nlook at Elijah Wood without imagining him limbless and smiling, being\ngnawed on by a wolf (maybe that's part\nof the reason I hate LOTR so much.) I\nknow that the \ufb01lm is visually a piece\nof genius \u2013 the production design and\ncinematography is AMAZING, as is\nthe original score. It has a great cast,\nbut overall I think the \ufb01lm falls into\nthe same 'more style than substance'\ncategory. A less than memorable story\nand overly extreme violence are not\nmade up for by slick camera work and\nwonderful colour palette and visual\nshaping.\nof everyday life. It has amazing production design and is beautifully shot\nby director Sam Mendes. But just because I can appreciate the \ufb01lm in an\nobjective way, doesn't mean I enjoy it.\nThe book, written in the 60s by Richard Yates, was full of black humour in\na way that the \ufb01lm isn't, but also allowed for much more connection with\nthe Wheelers. Investment in the couple is essential for the audience of this\n\ufb01lm, because the scripting is light, and\nthe plot even more so \u2013 without it, despite its style and moving depiction of\nthe subtleties of the human condition,\nthe \ufb01lm failed to keep my attention.\nStages of watching Donnie Darko: bored, bored, DAFUQ?!?\n\"Dammit, I thought I got rid of you on that boat...\"\n\n"

    "content": "The Shining of Room 237\nFred Fyles Film Writer\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18 FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\nThe image of Jack Nicholson leering\nout from a hole in a door, his teeth\nbared and his eyes manic, has gone\ndown as one of cinema\u2019s most iconic\nimages. It perfectly conveys the unsettling atmosphere which Stanley\nKubrick conjures up in his 1980 \ufb01lm\nThe Shining. The \ufb01lm has become ingrained in our culture, and is often\nused as a benchmark against which all\nother horror \ufb01lms can be compared.\nHowever, this has not always been\nthe case; upon release it received a\nluke-warm response, with critics calling it \u201can overreaching, multi-levelled\nbotch\u201d and describing Shelley Duvall\u2019s\ncharacter as a \u201csimpering, semi-re-tarded hysteric\u201d. How things change.\nToday The Shining is widely recognized as one of the greatest horror\n\ufb01lms of all time, and has been established as a modern classic of cinema.\nLast week saw the UK premier of the\nUS extended edition, which has never\nbeen shown here before and includes\nan extra half hour of footage, meaning\neveryone now has the chance to see\nthis masterpiece on the big screen.\nBased on a novel by Stephen King,\nThe Shining\u2019s plot is a relatively simple\none: Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, moves with his wife Wendy\n(Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny\nto Overlook Hotel, a lodge that they\nagree to look after during the long\nwinter. Jack, a writer struggling with\nwriter\u2019s block, hopes that the isolation will help him \ufb01nish his novel, but\nShelly is more preoccupied with Danny\u2019s invisible friend Tony. Danny, it is\nrevealed, has some psychic abilities,\ncalled \u2018Shining\u2019, making him sensitive\nto the past horrors that occurred in\nthe hotel, centring around the mysterious Room 237. Brutal murders, elevators \ufb01lled with blood, and ghostly\napparitions all make an appearance as\nJack is driven deeper and deeper into\npsychosis. The majority of the lines\nare given by Nicholson and Duvall,\nwho are simply superb, with Nicholson playing the psychotic Jack with a\ngleeful enthusiasm. Duvall shines in\nher role as Wendy, portraying a woman on the edge, confused and terri\ufb01ed;\nshe stumbles through the corridors of\nthe Overlook Hotel, pursued by her\nhusband, with a look of pure horror\non her face.\nA large part of what makes The Shining so haunting is the set and the art\ndirection, overseen by Kubrick, who\nwas renowned for his methodical attention for detail. Each frame is an\nindividual work of art, and the smallest details in a scene take on a huge\nimportance. The Overlook Hotel has\nan atmosphere all of its own, the vast,\nsprawling lodge becoming a third central character alongside Nicholson\nand Duvall. Kubrick\u2019s gift in the director\u2019s chair comes across incredibly\nstrongly in this \ufb01lm, and his direction\nis breathtaking. He has taken the basic plot, and distorted it through his\ncamera\u2019s lens into a unsettling psychological horror, which frequently toys\nwith the viewer, making them question what is real and what isn\u2019t. What\nreally lies behind the door of Room\n237? And hasn\u2019t Jack been to the hotel\nbefore? These are questions that Kubrick leaves unanswered, allowing the\nviewer to make their own mind up.\nThis ambiguity of The Shining is explored in the \ufb01lm Room 237, a documentary released last month that explores di\ufb00erent theories behind the\n\ufb01lm. One commentator believes it is\nactually about the genocide of Native\nAmericans, while another argues that\nKubrick is making a commentary on\nthe Holocaust. Such outlandish theories may seem extreme if it was for any\nother \ufb01lm, but The Shining is di\ufb00erent.\nKubrick\u2019s obsession for precise details\nmeans that nothing can be dismissed\nin the \ufb01lm; everything takes on a new\nimportance, making some of the theories very persuasive. This makes The\nShining a \ufb01lm that de\ufb01nitely deserves\na second viewing, if not a third.\nThe experience of seeing this \ufb01lm\nin the cinema cannot be overstated.\nWhile the new footage included in\nthe cut helps to \ufb02esh out the \ufb01lm\nsomewhat, the most exciting thing\nabout this release is that it allows us\nto view the \ufb01lm as Kubrick intended:\non the big screen, allowing the spectacle to completely envelop the viewer.\nIn the screening I went to there was\na chilling atmosphere in the theatre.\nWhile the \ufb01lm remains as \u2018scary\u2019 as it\nwas when I \ufb01rst saw it on TV, seeing\nit in the cinema allows the action to\nbecome haunting, visceral, and truly\npsychologically terrifying.\nTop 10 Box\nOffice Films\n1.

After a\nrushed warm up, and with Imperial\nhave to don a somewhat village playing jersey to avoid a kit clash, the\ngame got underway. Imperial kicked\no\ufb00 proceedings, quickly leading to a\nturn over and good possession in the\nopposing 22. It didn\u2019t take long before the \ufb01rst points of the game, and\nafter an inch perfect pass from \ufb02yhalf \u201cBig\u201d George Lane \u2013 who admits\nhimself \ufb02y-half is not his natural position \u2013 Oli Benton crossed the line\nfor a 5-0 lead. Soon after the restart,\nthe pressure was back on Kent. The\nball was charged down by the face of\nJon Hardisty (some say his most useful contribution to the game) resulting in a lineout in opposition terri-tory. This again produced an Imperial\ntry, with good hands by the backline\n\ufb01nished o\ufb00 well by Nathan \u201cBrucey\u201d\nFitzpatrick in the corner. After the\ninitial burst of tries by Imperial, the\ngame started to get tighter. With the\nexchanging of tries, Kent started to\nget back into the game \u2013 due mainly\nto a lack of Imperial discipline and un-forced errors. A big blow to Imperial\ncame in the form of skipper Jack Flanagan having to leave the \ufb01eld with a\nsuspected broken ankle, although fans\nwill be relieved to here he has since\nbeen given the all clear. A further try\nfrom Fitzpatrick, and a penalty try\nawarded for a high tackle in the act of\nJack Judd scoring, lead to an Imperial\nlead of 22-12 at half time, But playing\ninto the wind second half Imperial\nknew the game was not over. This was\nquickly demonstrated as straight after\nthe restart Kent went over for their\nthird try of the game, closing the lead\nto just 3 points.

Furthermore,\nit was a great opportunity for people\nnew to the sport to earn some valuable match experience.\nThe tournament started on the Saturday morning, with most of the team\naveraging four hours sleep on the\n\ufb02oor of a common room and sporting a commendable hangover. It was\na slow start, with the \ufb01rst match ending in a less than ideal 0-7, but Imperial began speeding up their counter\nattacks and getting more o\ufb00ensive,\nwhich allowed Alex to bag a goal in\nthe second game, reducing Imperial\u2019s next loss to a more respectable\n4-1. The last game of the day ended\nin a particularly brutal 0-9 against\nAachen\u2019s 1st team of wild beasts and\nset the scene for an appropriate consumption of alcohol later in the even-ing.\nThe Imperial women\u2019s team performed in a similar light to the men\u2019s,\nsporting a modest 1-9 in their \ufb01rst\nmatch, with the goal executed skilfully by Anna, and a 7-0 in the sec-ond. A special mention also has to go\nto Philippine who saw the team was\ngetting so overwhelmed by German\nforce, she felt she had to get creative\nand save a goal with her face.\nThe day was not without victory\nhowever, because the men\u2019s team\nmanaged to earn a place at the semi\ufb01nals in the swimming tug of war,\nand the women\u2019s team succeeded in\n\ufb01nishing 1st in the tournament\u2019s beer\nrelay, in which a team of swimmers\nsprinted 25m, got out, downed a pint,\nthen sprinted back. Later that night,\nthe Aachen water polo club hosted\na party, in which, satisfyingly, there\nwas a predominant attendance of the\nteam\u2019s mascot \u2013 Blumenkohl the cauli\ufb02ower.\nOn the Sunday, Imperial started\nout at a disadvantage due to the goal-keeper, Jen Wei \u201cthe ninja\u201d Niam,\nbeing indisposed in his e\ufb00orts to\nrecover his lost passport and avoid\nimminent deportation, but they held\ntogether strong and played with Edward in goal, yielding an 11-1 loss,\nwith the goal scored by Vicente. The\nteam\u2019s ethos continued to hold steady\nand a combination of fast drives of\nstrong o\ufb00ence yielded in a further\ngoal from Marco against DSSC Duisburg and Anna against DSSC Duisburg (women\u2019s).\nImperial returned to campus at\n1am on Sunday night feeling extremely satis\ufb01ed by a very rewarding\ntournament, with lectures in store for\nmost of them on Monday morning.\nEven without their coach Adam at\nthe tournament, both the men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s teams performed admirably\nand are now more ready than ever\nto take on the other universities in\nBUCS and LUSL.\nWater Polo storm Germany\nand newcomers to the Imperial team,\nand appeared to be the turning point\nof the match. Great breaks from man\nof the match Rob \u201cCoach\u201d Kyle and\nJon Hardisty helped gain useful yards,\nas the Imperial pattern started to\nshine through. With Mike O\u2019Connell\nand Tom Hansen proving the catalysts for forward momentum, possession and territory started to show,\nleading to another try for Oli Benton\nand Syarif Hertog. As Kent started a\nslight revival, an interception by Robbie Cowan lead to a 60 metre score to\nclose out the game. Big hits in the \ufb01nal play coming from Mike Floyd and\nTom Hobson sealed the deal, resulting\nin a \ufb01nal score of 41-19..\nGraceful like a swan.\nGuy on the end:\n\u201cLoving life 2k12\u201d\nI\u2019d let those boys scrum me, anytime.\nRomylos Jackson Sports Writer\n\n"

Getting us o\ufb00 to a great start\nwas old timers Thoe and Andy who\ndropped only three points for the\n\ufb01rst 10 to imperial, and then new to\nthe team fresher Niall showed his\nworth (and \ufb02exible arm skills) in a\n5-1 victory. The three musketeers\ncontinued their \ufb01ne form and put\nimperial into an impressive 45-14\nlead.\nThen team captain Loek Janssen,\nnew team member Pavitar Singh\nand conscripted foillist Thoe stepped\nonto the piste for sabre. Despite\nstarting well the team fell to a 30-24 de\ufb01cit with just 3 bouts (to 5) to\nplay. However a late push from Pav\nand Thoe brought imperial to within\n3 points of their opponents, leaving it\nto the captain to win his spurs with a\nstunning (lucky) \ufb01nal hit against his\nEssex counterpart to win sabre 45-44.\nFinally with a strong lead and time\nrunning out the epee team went\nonto the piste to attempt to bring the\nmatch home. Due to the absence of\na couple of epeeist, Pav and continuing star of the show Thoe would provide the support to Jamie Simpson in\nOn what felt like the coldest morning\nof the year so far, a selection of Imperial Triathlon members met while\nit was still dark to ride o\ufb00 towards\nPaddington, and to the \ufb01rst race on\nour calendar. The team was severely\ndented with four members dropping\nout at the last minute due to falling down stairs (valid), recurring hip\nproblems (valid), misjudged coursework deadline (crap excuse) and a no\nshow(WTF??!). But never the less, the\nten-strong team headed out into the\ndarkness.\nThe event was at Hillingdon, a short\ntrain journey away. The warm, spa-cious, relaxing journey teased us into\na false sense of comfort, and as we\nstepped out on to the misty platform\nwe hurriedly got on our bikes and\nstarted pedalling to stop our joints\nseizing in the cold.\nArriving at Hillingdon Triathlon\nclub, we instantly forgot the cold.\nThe track looked gorgeous, with its\nsmooth curves and \ufb02awless surface,\nit\u2019s rolling course tempting us in for\na ride\u2026 still talking about the track\u2026\nbut in all seriousness, it was a great\ntrack! We had a few loops to get to\nknow the route, and then set up kit in\nthe transition area. For anyone who\ndoesn\u2019t know, a duathlon consists of\na run, followed by a cycling leg, then\nanother run, with each change-over\noccurring in the \u201ctransition zone\u201d. After a short warm-up, and a debate as\nto how cold we\u2019ll be in racing gear, the\nstart was upon us.\nO\ufb00 went the horn, and the front of\nthe pack shot o\ufb00. Hendrik Frentrup,\nKeesjan de Vries and Richard Mathie\nall represented the club up front while\nI started in the back quarter. Running\nhas never been my forte, but I was\nkept strong minded knowing the bike\nwas coming, building pace and regaining a few places from people who had\ngone o\ufb00 faster at the start. I was still\nin the second half of the positions,\nand the front runners were long gone.\nThe run was only 2 miles so before I\nknew it, we were on our bikes. A swift\ntransition and I was away. The run had\nwarmed me up perfectly. This was my\n\ufb01rst race on the new bike, and a new\nexperience for me spending prolonged\nperiods down on the aerodynamic tri-bars I had \ufb01tted to the bike. This is my\ndiscipline, and I started to pick people o\ufb00 one by one as I moved up the\npack. It\u2019s a bizarre feeling being so low\non your bike, and just seeing the road\nahead of you rather than handlebars\nand a wheel. I will admit, images from\nStar Wars podracer jumped into my\nhead, and the theme tune rang loud\nin my mind whilst swerving between\nother competitors to overtake. I was\nloving it!\nThe punishing blend of long rolling \ufb02ats and small swerving up-hill\nslugs meant my legs were beginning\nto slow on the inclined sections of the\ntrack. By transition two (bike to run)\nI was knackered. I had made up a lot\nof places, but I had two people hot on\nmy heels. Despite my best e\ufb00orts they\ntracked me down and left me for lost\nbefore the \ufb01nish line.\nWe clapped in the remaining com-petitors, and the organisers wasted no\ntime in preparing the podium ready to\npresent the winning prizes. Imperial\nTriathlon had performed exceptional-ly, with four people in the top 10, Alex\nMilne with 4th place, Richard Mathie\nstealing 3rd, and Jean-Claude beast-ing in to take pole position, \ufb01nishing\n7 seconds ahead of second place. Sam\nO\u2019Neill, who has continued with the\nclub from last year, came in a notable\n7th. A great result for the club, and a\nstart that will be hard to rival.\nNext it was the women\u2019s race. Our\nteam had been halved with the loss\nof Sophie Kirk and Josie Bowler to\nexcessive workloads and a basejump-ing attempt gone wrong. It was up to\nSarah Lewis and Harriet Nerva to do\nit for the girls! Sarah launched o\ufb00 the\nstart line with plenty of gusto, despite\nchoosing to start at the back. She soon\nclawed back the places and started the\nbike leg in a strong position, and it was\nhere that she put herself in contention\nfor a podium \ufb01nish. Harriet did IC\nproud, and \ufb02ew through transition like\na pro, to begin her cycle. It must have\nbeen a bit disheartening for her to see\nthe men\u2019s team cheering her on from\nbehind hot mugs of co\ufb00ee and sugar\npowdered doughnuts, but we did our\nbest to provide the two of them with\nmuch deserved support. Harriet powered in to 78th position (11th fastest\nfemale), safe in the knowledge that\nshe did the club proud in her \ufb01rst ever\nrace. However it was Sarah who stole\nthe day for the women\u2019s race, coming\nin second. She didn\u2019t believe us when\nwe told her, and didn\u2019t really take it in.\nThe impressive result from Sarah\nwas subsequently shattered by the fact\nthat when the Hillingdon representative called out her name to collect the\nsecond place prize winnings, she was\nnowhere to be seen. She was busy,\ncuddled up in the club house with a\nwarm cup of tea, completely oblivious to the megaphone calling out her\nname\u2026\nthe \ufb01nal bouts. Generally the slowest of the 3 weapons the lack of time\nprompted some show stopping \ufb01ghting and a 5-1 win to Jamie in just 27\nPosition Name Category Club Time\n1 Jean-Claude Besse Male Imperial College London 39:35 mins\n2 Rob Buldock Male Tri London 39.42 mins\n3 Richard Mathie Male Imperial College London 40.17 mins\n4 Alexander Milne Male Imperial College London 40.18 mins\n1.

Although by the time this\ngoes to print the website may be up-dated. This \ufb01gure is above the total\nraised throughout the entire year last\nyear.\nMoney has been raised through a\nvariety of events. For Remembrance\nDay, Poppy Sales and the sale of wristbands to The Poppy Appeal After Party at Piccadilly Institute.\nThis year\u2019s Poppy Appeal went out\nto 18 tube stations across Zone 1 and\nsaw a total of 93 volunteers head out in\nthree shifts thorough out the day. The\nbiggest individual collection of the\nday came from Phil Morris from the\nRCSU who raised \u00a3 489.84 at Kings\nCross. In terms of faculty collections,\nhowever, it was the CGCU that came\nout top, raising a total of \u00a34170.60.\nAll Participants in the appeal had\nfree entry to the RAG after-party for\nwhich tickets were also sold at \u00a35 a\npiece.

They also released their Sex\nLeague Table over the summer. In\nboth surveys, Imperial were towards\nthe bottom.\nTo those of you who used Felix\u2019s own\nFelix Sex Survey to bemoan the state of\nyour lives at Imperial (look out for this\nyear\u2019s Sex Survey later on in the year),\nthis can be an opportunity to think of\nthose less fortunate than even yourselves in these wintery months. Also,\nas this is a fair and balanced news ar-ticle, this has got nothing on the Felix\nsurvey. There\u2019s not even a question on\nthe subject of alternative library usage!\nIn the drinking survey Imperial Students rank closer to the bottom of the\nlist than the top, at 56th place out of\n74. According to Student Beans the average Imperial student consumes 16.4\nunits of alcohol. This is below the NHS\nguidelines for men and is borderline\nfor women (the \u201ctoo much\u201d guidelines\nNiall Jeffrey Reporter rather than sticking to your \ufb01ve-aday). Of course young adults may be\nmore susceptible to alcohol damage\nand this isn\u2019t o\ufb03cial advice, so don\u2019t\ntake this as an excuse to drink more.\nThe survey has some questionable\naspects. Imperial consumption has\napparently shot up from 11 units per-week from last year\u2019s survey by an extra 5 units per week. This would mean\nthat in 12 months the average alcohol\nintake at Imperial has risen by over\n35%, although it is possible that fresh-ers have \u201cgone wild\u201d.\nMore likely is that there are failings\nin the Beans\u2019 methodology. A contributory factor may be surveying \u201cstudents who drink alcohol\u201d, thus excluding large numbers of teetotallers. The\nsurvey, however, does place Queen\u2019s\nUniversity Belfast top of drinking. You\ncan decide for yourself what\u2019s going on\nthere.\nLet\u2019s talk about sex baby. In the\nBeans\u2019 Sex League Imperial places\n77th out of 101. According to the table\nImperial Students have had 2.88 sexual partners since starting university.\nWith absolutely no description at all\non how fractions of people are having\nsex with each other.\nImperial\u2019s relatively low position\nwill generally not surprise readers and\ninvoke the ominously old joke about\n\u201cthe ratio\u201d. But the revelation that\nImperial ranks higher than 24 other\nuniversities surveyed may raise some\neyebrows whose owners thought they\nwere in the bottom of the student pile.\nThe Sex League does make an analogous mistake to the Drinking League\u2019s\nonly surveying alcohol drinkers. Only\n\u201c4,656 sexually active\u201d students were\nquestioned, which is a low proportion\nof the total student population. With\nlast year\u2019s Felix Sex Survey revealing\nthat 18% of the student body have not\nhad sex, the Student Beans\u2019 survey is\nclearly skewed in favour of boosting\nImperial up the table.\nThus there are su\ufb03cient \ufb02aws to\nmake the bemoaners happy not to be\nhappy again with this new incarnation of the Sex League (a phrase that is\nbeginning to sound like a band of o\ufb00colour superheroes).\nIn related news, UCL ranked 37th\nout of 101 with student sex frequency.\nJammy buggers. Shame they can\u2019t replicate that form in academic rankings.\nAlso in the news...\nalso be the BIG Bake sale on the 23\nNovember. Additionally it\u2019s Movember e\ufb00orts have so far raised \u00a32000\n(see centrefold).\nDavid Goldsmith, RAG Chair,\nwhen asked for comment, said that\nRAG was doing really well and that\nhe \u201cdidn\u2019t expect the turnout\u201d it had\nreceived at the events that they have\nheld this year. He says there are plans\nto expand RAG and work with Clubs,\nSocieties & Projects and to hold hall\ncompetitions in the future. Goldsmith\nrepeatedly mentioned that RAG was\ndoing \u201cridiculously well\u201d and that it is\ngoing to \u201cmake tonnes of money\u201d.\nJust hope they didn\u2019t\nstand on the left on the\nescalator\nSomeone\u2019s taking a\nphoto.

    "content": "Get up and Chase the Dream!\nAnnabelle Mayers breaks down common startup excuses\nor some, overcoming\nendless hurdles is a memory they wish to leave\nbehind with school PE\nlessons. For others the\nuncertainty, challenge and commitment involved in developing a startup is what provides the buzz that\ngets them out of bed each morning.\nMotivations:\nThere are a multitude of reasons\nwhy people wish to create a startup but a few factors often prevail.\nFirstly, the opportunity to manage\nyour own time \u2013 undoubtedly the\nhours will be long and there will be\nsleepless nights, but for some this is\nconsidered preferable to being accountable and having to turn up to\nthe office at 9am day in day out. Secondly, it is desirable to feel your time\nand energy is being invested into\ncontrolling your own future and developing your brainchild as opposed\nto slaving away working for a large\ncorporation. Finally, whilst there is a\nrisk of loss there is also potential to\nrake in the cash.\nA friend suggested there are three\nways to become very rich: Work extremely long hours for someone else\n(read: investment baking), do something illegal (whilst drug dealing/\nweapon smuggling may be lucrative\nit\u2019s probably not the key to a bright\nfuture) or finally work for yourself.\nIn this article we\u2019ll explore the latter\noption.\nThe Idea\nHow many times have you found\nyourself procrastinating work by\ndaydreaming about business ideas?\nIt is a shame to think of all these\nideas being mulled over and not\nexecuted. One of them could be a\ngem \u2013 the next Facebook perhaps?\nI met some boys who keep an \u2018Idea\nbook\u2019 where they note down ideas\n\u2013 however crazy \u2013 and brainstorm\neach one. Many of the ideas end up\nbeing scrapped but by discussing\ntheir thoughts and combining ideas\nthey have managed to create feasible\nbusiness plans.\nI read a striking essay written by\na successful businessman who proposed that you don\u2019t necessarily\nneed a revolutionary or even new\nidea \u2013 you simply have to do better\nthan the competition. Look at dating\nwebsites for example. The market is\nhuge due to a reduction in the stigma attached to meeting your partner\nonline and growing numbers of career driven people who do not have\nthe time to find a companion. Yet,\nuntil recently, dating websites did\nnot facilitate the best matchmaking\nresulting in a low success rate. Over\nthe past few years new models have\nsprung up targeted at niche sections\nof the population. These sites strive\nto make suitable matches and ensure\nlike-minded people are introduced\nto each other. You only have to\nglance at the tube adverts to see the\nselection on offer from profession-alsingles to uniformdating.com. Not\nadvertised on the London underground are those such as Geek2geek\nand farmersonly.com. By building\non an existing idea those behind the\narray of new sites have learnt from\nthe mistakes of original players and\nearned their share of the $2.1 billion\nmarket. So, don\u2019t be deterred by the\nfact your idea is out there in some\nform. If you are able to spot fundamental flaws and think up inventive\nsolutions you may be able to secure\na fraction of the market.\nThat is not to say you should dismiss innovative ideas. By making the\nfirst move you have the advantage of\nsecuring the target market before\ncompetitors arrive. A daring man\nwho did just that is Jay Nemeth \u2013\nthe man behind the Zero-G cameras\nthat filmed Felix Baumgartner in\nhis recent Red Bull sponsored jump\nfrom space. Jay saw an opportunity\nin the emerging space tourism pro-grammes, pursued his passion and\ngot to work on creating remote controlled cameras that could withstand\nsuch conditions as those found in\nspace. Red Bull happened to be looking into how to film the feat when\nJay announced that he\u2019d been working on that very thing. It wasn\u2019t only\nFelix who landed on his feet.\nFunding\nStarting businesses in sectors such\nas biotech and oil requires huge initial investments and unless you have\nseriously rich and generous relatives\nit may be a difficult sector to break\ninto. However, not all businesses\nneed such serious sums of money invested into them. Many modern day\nentrepreneurs have mastered \u2018Bootstrapping\u2019; the art of creating something from the resources available to\nyou. A common mistake is throwing\nmoney away on the likes of renting\noffice space and hiring permanent\nstaff. There is usually no need to\nfork out for such expenses; there are\ncountless tales of folks starting out\nwith a laptop and their dining room\ntable. Avoiding such costs will prevent you from depleting the money\nyou do have and leave more to invest\nin the key components required for\nyour start-up. A useful piece of advice from the author of \u2018Rich Dad,\nPoor Dad\u2019 is, \u2018Don\u2019t buy what you\ncan borrow and don\u2019t borrow what\nyou can get for free\u2019. Participants\nof the recent Imperial Apprentice\nChallenge proved just how much\nvalue can be created from nothing.\nStarting with a paperclip they managed to make hundreds of pounds in\na few hours by trading the paperclip\nfor items of more value and eventually selling their trades. Rather than\ngetting stuck on the treadmill of full\ntime employment that so often follows graduation, why not put your\nenergy into creating value and capture your share of the money up for\ngrabs?\nRealistically you may need investment further down the line and\nthere are plenty of organisations\noffering this in return for equity.\nFor example, Studentupstarts was\nfounded by an Imperial Student and\noffers up to \u00a315,000 investment for\npromising entrepreneurs. However,\nit is unlikely you\u2019ll receive funding\nwithout some proof of concept so\nget the ball rolling, see how far you\ncan make it and if you envisage the\nneed for funding apply for it. What\ndo you have to lose?\nThe Team\nHaving a solid team is vital for suc-cess. It is generally advised not to\ncombine friends and finance, however I feel this advice should not be\ntaken as a given. Whilst it may lead\nto discrepancies, which could affect\nnot only the running of the business\nbut also your personal life, good\nfriends fully understand how each\nother work, know each other\u2019s skills,\nexperiences and weaknesses and are\noften a tried and tested team. This\ncould be more valuable than trying\nto suss out a stranger and risk working alongside someone you know little about.\nUnless you are jack of all trades\nyou are likely to need people with\ncomplementary skills to yours. In\nsome cases outsourcing work is the\nanswer but do not underestimate\nthe value of having one\u2019s attention\nfully invested in the start-up. Whilst\nyou may be reluctant to dilute your\nshares in the business, inviting a\nnew member into the founding team\nmay be the reason your business becomes a success. Imagine you are\nbeing paid per hour and your success does not depend on the success of the business \u2013 you are likely\nto do your work as required and get\non with your life.

    "content": "Thorium: a vital energy source\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\n8\nC\nlimate change and energy sources are two\nof the key issues of our\ntime. While our climate\nbecomes more and more\nvolatile by the year, the strain on\nour planets limited resources is\nbecoming exasperated by the development of large economies such\nas China and India, which in turn is\ndamaging the climate.\nIt\u2019s a vicious circle.\nAs a result of the competitive\nnature of our economic system,\ncountries are engaging in trade and\nactual wars against each other in a\nnecessary battle for resources.\nThe world economy is absolutely\ndependent on fossil fuels. Ultimately they are finite and not a genuine\nlong term solution. Despite this,\nthe unfortunate truth is that as the\nprice of fossil fuels goes up, previously non cost effective reserves\nbecome economically viable. Estimates of fossil fuel depletion dates\nsuggest late 21st and even early\n22nd century. But just because we\ncould burn it all, doesn\u2019t mean that\nwe should and we are going to need\nan alternative. Renewables are not\na realistic replacement for the base\nload energy currently provided by\nfossil fuels, and an attempt at this\nwould likely cause as much environmental damage.\nMost developed economies such\nas the UK use fossil fuels for around\n80% of their energy, and despite the\nmany, many summits organised to\ntake action against this, not one\nhas produced something even close\nto resembling change. The London Climate Forum coming up this\nmonth will make all the right noises\nno doubt, but with little substance.\nHowever it needn\u2019t be game over\nyet. There are several solutions\nwhich have been tried and tested in\nthe past, but have been closed down\nfor one reason or another. The 21st\ncentury is the time that energy from\nThorium should, and needs, to be\ntaken seriously.\nThe technology aimed at utilizing Thorium initially emerged in\nthe 1950s and 60s in the US, under\nthe stewardship of Alvin Weinberg,\nat Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\na facility that contributed to the\nManhattan project. The most important demonstration of this technology was undoubtedly the Molten\nSalt Reactor Experiment, running\nfrom 1965-1969. This experiment\nused Uranium 233, which can easily bread from thorium, dissolved in\na fluoride lithium beryllium salt as\nthe reactor fuel.\nUnfortunately, the US government didn\u2019t want energy- they\nwanted weapons. This was the\nCold War, and the focus of nuclear research was geared towards\nproliferation rather than a civilian\nenergy source. Milton Shaw, a former Navy soldier who was head of\nthe US Atomic Energy Commission\n(AEC) shut the programme down,\ndespite the huge potential for abundant energy in Weinberg\u2019s creation.\n40 years on, the reverberations of\nShaw\u2019s decision are being keenly\nfelt by energy hungry consumers\naround the world, whose prices are\nsky high due to ever more scant re-sources.\nAt the same time, conventional\nnuclear power is going quickly\nout of fashion with governments\naround the world. After disasters\nlike Fukushima countries like Japan\nand Germany have decided to scale\nback their nuclear programmes: the\nrisk of meltdown has been deemed\nunacceptable. Added to this, Uranium 235, which is used in nuclear\nreactors, is as rare as gold. Contrast\nthis with thorium, which is as common as lead, and you get some idea\nof the incredible abundance of this\nresource, which is currently treated\nas a waste product.\nThorium energy has been largely\nignored since Weinberg\u2019s initial\nforay into the field, but in the last\ndecade or so, there has been renewed interest in the technology\nas governments try to devise a way\nto meet their citizens\u2019 energy de-mands.\nBoth India and China have renewed research into the field, due to\nthe necessity of energy in developing economies, but there has been\ncomparatively little interest in the\nWest, despite the pressing need for\nclean, plentiful energy. Researchers\nlike Kirk Sorenson, the founder of\nFlibe Energy, Inc have tried to kick\nstart the Thorium renaissance, but\nas yet, few people are sitting up and\ntaking notice.\nGovernments have repeatedly\nshown that they will not forgo economic growth for environmental\nconsiderations. The primary requirement of a fossil fuel replacement is therefore going to be the\nability to be profitable at the market\nprice. In order to warrant replacing fossil fuels, it must also satisfy\nthe environmental criteria but ulti-mately, this is a secondary consid-eration. Most renewables do not\ncompete on price with fossil fuels\ndue to the diffuse energy sources\nand additional infrastructure re-quired. Thorium energy satisfies\nboth these issues. Not only is it a\nclean, but more importantly it is a\nmarket based, long term solution\nthat is available worldwide. Several\nestimates have put it at the same\nprice and even cheaper than the\ncheapest, dirtiest coal.\nMolten salt technology possesses\nmany crucial advantages over conventional nuclear power stations. It\noperates at atmospheric pressure,\nAlasdair Wynn and Matt O\u2019Neill explore an untapped resource\nRegistered charity no 803716/SC038827 Working with Anthony Nolan\nGO DOWN IN\nHISTORY AS\nTHE PERSON\nWHOCURED\nBLOODCANCER\nYou could save the life of someone with blood cancer by donating your bone marrow.

There is no risk of melt\ndown as the fuel is already liquid\nand operates at around 600K. It also\nproduces just 1% of the radioactive\nwaste, much of which has secondary uses and due to its negative coefficient of reactivity; it is able to\nrespond quickly and accurately to\ndemand. Most importantly, a reactor based on this type of technology\nis walk away safe and under power\nfailure, it automatically puts itself\ninto a stable configuration without\nthe need for any human interven-tion.\nCrucially, the fissile material produced from thorium is unable to be\nused in weaponry, and it is first and\nforemost an economic source of\nenergy \u2013 the fact that it is environmentally friendly is just an added\nbonus.\nThorium\u2019s time to shine has ar-rived. The world needs new energy sources, without sacrificing\neconomic growth. The solution is\nthere, people just need to sit up and\ntake notice.\n\n"

But\nfear not \u2013 for Google has managed to\nrelease new details on a new version\nof Android and a new family of Nexus\nof devices that are available right now,\nby press time.\nAndroid 4.2 - Still Jelly Bean\nAndroid 4.2 is a new version of Android, still called Jelly Bean (after\nGoogle\u2019s propensity to name Android\nversions alphabetically after deserts),\nthat brings incremental changes to\nkeep Android ahead of its competi-tion. The version sees improvements\nin its camera, security and usability\nfeatures among many others. Of interest to most users would be the\ncamera and usability enhancements.\nCamera Enhancements\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen those Google\nStreet View cars ply along the roads\ntaking sneaky photos of unsuspecting\npedestrians for publication on Google\nMaps, you might be glad to know that\nyou can also do that now in Android\n4.2. Dubbed \u201cPhoto Sphere\u201d, you can\nuse the same technology that powers the Street View cameras in your\nphone to take 360 degrees panorama\nshots worthy of your non-Android\nfriends\u2019 envy. If you count yourself\nas an expert photographer, you can\neven upload them to Google Maps\nfor sharing with the rest of the world.\nThe camera has received a new interface that allows you quick access to\ncamera settings. Of course, this new\nupdate also comes with the obligatory increase in the number of \ufb01lters\navailable that allow people to further\n\u201cinstagram-ise\u201d their photos without\nneeding to use Instagram.\nUsability Enhancements\nGoogle Now, the software that makes\nuse of the tons of data that Google\nhas on you to provide you with useful\nand timely live information, has been\nupdated to make use of even more of\nyour data \u2013 your emails! Google Now\nwill now remind you of any \ufb02ight\ncheck-ins, hotel check-ins and even\ndelivery timings. This is not a new\nfeature for Android 4.2 per se as it\u2019s\navailable for (the few) Android 4.1 devices out there as well.\nAndroid 4.2 also introduces several usability enhancements to bring\nabout extra polish to the interface and\nkeep Android in front of competi-tion. Quick settings is now available\nin the noti\ufb01cation shade that allows\nyou to access frequently used set-tings. This can be activated by a button in the noti\ufb01cation shade or by\nswiping down the noti\ufb01cation shade\nwith two \ufb01ngers. Widgets can now be\nplaced on the lock screen, allowing\nyou quick access to information without unlocking the phone. The default\nAndroid keyboard now has \u201cSwype\u201d\nfeatures allowing you to slide your\n\ufb01ngers across the keys to type. Multiple user pro\ufb01les are also available on\nAndroid tablets.\nFamily of Nexus Devices\nIt may be well and nice that Android\n4.2 has some new exciting features\nbut, as carriers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like to\ndo what they do best, many phones\nmight never see the update. This is\nwhy Google has the Nexus series of\ndevices that allow you to experience\nthe purest Android version that will\nreceive any updates to Android \ufb01rst.\nAnd for the \ufb01rst time, Google has announced a family of Nexus Devices\nthat are \u201cworthy of the Nexus name\u201d.\nThere is the Nexus 4, 7 and 10 for\na 4 inch phone, 7 inch tablet and the\n10 inch tablet respectively. They are\navailable now on Google Play store\nfor very competitive prices. The unlocked 16GB version of Nexus 4 is\navailable for just \u00a3279. The Nexus 4\nhas received very positive reviews\nfrom major news outlets. The Nexus\n10 sports an impressive 2560 x 1600\npixels screen that puts the iPad\u2019s retina display to shame, in terms of hard\nnumbers at least.\nWhile consumers drool over the de-vices, Google has strategic reasons for\nintroducing the whole host of Nexus\ndevices. The \ufb01rst reason is to cater to\nenthusiasts who like to have the unadulterated Android experience while\nhaving any updates pushed to them\n\ufb01rst. Think of these devices like the\ndevices Apple releases \u2013 \ufb01rst class citizens in terms of software treatment.\nThe Nexus programme has always\nbeen envisioned to be the hardware\nbenchmarks for the other OEMs to\nfollow. By having stellar hardware\nwith a good software experience,\nYong Wen Chua checks out Androids latest OS and looks at Nexus\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\nW\n25\nGoogle hopes to spur the OEMs to\nproduce hardware that match and exceed that of the Nexus devices. It also\nhopes that OEMs will be motivated\nto provide updates in a timely manner and not to bog down their devices\nwith additional software that will\nhamper the user experience.\nMost importantly, the new Nexus\ndevices hope to spur the development\nof tablet applications for the Android\nplatform. As Tim Cook very nicely\npointed out in his iPad mini keynote,\nthe tablet application ecosystem on\nAndroid is atrocious. After releasing\nthe Nexus 7 earlier this year, there\nhas been an increase in the number\nof developers adapting their applications to the 7 inch form factor. Google\nhopes that this will happen again as\nhigh quality 10 inch tablets enter the\nmarket and set a trend. As the 7 inch\napplications work well on the 10 inch\nscreens, Google is looking to the Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 as \u201cbootstraps\u201d\nfor more tablet applications.\nFuture Nexus and Key Lime\nPie\nWith the holiday season upon us,\nGoogle is hoping that more consumers will buy Android devices, especially the tablets. With Android phones\nalready dominating the smartphone\nmarket, Google is eyeing the tablet\nmarket with great interest, seeing that\nApple has held its dominance with\nthe iPad for quite a while. The new\nNexus devices look great, in terms of\nperformance, usability and aesthetics.\nWe can only wait with bated breath to\nsee what they have in store next year\nwith a whole new series of Nexus devices and the next version of Android\nslated to be called \u201cKey Lime Pie\u201d.\nThree screenshots from the new camera enhancements:\nPanoramics (above), quick access controls (middle) and hipster filters (right)\nPrezi Ambassador\nPrezi, that awesome presentation software, are looking for an\nImperial Ambassador, could you be it?\nThe Prezi Ambassador is responsible for increasing the\n\u201cPrezense\u201d at Imperial and giving out a ton of cool Prezi goodies.\nThe role also includes the chance to go to California or Budapest to\nintern at Prezi as well as win prizes (including iPads).\nTo find out more check out the official Prezi for the Ambassador\nprogramme at: http://goo.gl/Kx5AM\nAll interested candidates should e-mail Ashley:\nashley.whitlatch@prezi.com\n\n"

    "content": "AGRI-net symposium at Imperial\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER\nWriter\nSarah Byrne\nAs students at Imperial, we love good\nextra-curricular science, right? Right?\nI guess we can be excused from crawling out of the Library once in a while\nand going straight to bed as opposed\nto the nearest museum. But every so\noften, there are some great gems out\nthere to take part in, usually right on\nour doorstep.\nThe Natural History Museum currently runs a series of 30-minute lectures concerning all things bright and\nbeautiful, in their lecture theatre that\nthe Business School would be proud\nof. These talks make up their programme called Nature Live, which\no\ufb00ers talks and events for anyone\nto go to, for free. The Attenborough\nStudio is situated in the modern glass\natrium of the museum and hosts these\npacked introductory titbits into what\nis going on behind the scenes, usually\nto everyone\u2019s complete unawareness.\nOver 300 scientists work on various\nendeavours throughout the museum\ncovering many branches of research,\nand having an insight into what they\nare doing, alongside learning something along the way, makes these bite-sized sessions highly enjoyable.\nLast Friday the lecture \u201cWhat is\nyour posion\u2026 or venom?\u201d was presented by Dr Ronald Jenner, whose\nresearch into poisonous organisms\nmay hopefully lead to understanding\nof their hidden potential medicinal\nproperties. After presenting a stimulating introduction into what is a\npoison and a venom and the di\ufb00erences between the two, he went on\nto explain in more detail how these\noccur in nature and then onto how\nthis could apply to us. The lecture was\nfast paced, engaging and not too overwhelming at all to the younger members of the audience, who posed no\nend of thought-provoking questions\nthroughout that even at times left Dr\nJenner stumped. The science ranged\nfrom stu\ufb00ed models to molecules,\nensuring all of the audience, whether\na small scientist in the making, or a\nvisiting student learnt something new\nand didn\u2019t feel patronised or out of\ntheir depth.\nWith Dr Jenner currently working\nto \ufb01nd the \ufb01rst poisonous crustacean,\nwhilst looking into venom-derived\ncompounds to treat diabetes, such\nexpertise is not to go unmentioned.\nThese scientists know their stu\ufb00, and\nsuch lectures provide brilliant opportunities to talk to them unbridled\nand really get to know what is going\non behind the scenes. These talks also\nallow an insight into \ufb01eld courses and\nthe research they are currently doing,\nOne of the biggest challenges facing today\u2019s world is how to feed an\nincreasing population, particularly\nwith the impending threats of climate change and water shortages.\nOn the 1st and 2nd of November,\nresearchers from universities and industry nationally gathered at Imperial to present their work on Chemical\nBiology applications to fungal, insect\nand plant sciences on the molecular\nlevel, in the \ufb01rst AGRI-net (http://\nwww.agri-net.net/index) Young Researcher Symposium. AGRI-net is a\nnew collaborative network founded\nby Imperial academics together with\nthe agrichemical industry, with support from the research councils.\nThe focus was on young and early-stage researchers, particularly Ph.D\nstudents and post-docs, and so for\nsome the symposium doubled as a careers event. Industry representatives\nfrom Bayer, Syngenta and Rothamsted attended, as well as delegates from\nuniversities including Edinburgh,\nDurham and Birkbeck, and the relatively small size of the conference\nallowed plenty of opportunities for\nnetworking and discussions during\nthe poster session and over dinner.\nThe work presented covered a\nrange of approaches from computational modelling and data manage-ment, to genetic modi\ufb01cation, and\nproblems addressed included crop\nScience in London this week\nWhat is going on closer to home...\nNature Live at the Natural History Museum\nsupplemented by blogs online showing the research in action. It\u2019s great\nfor aspiring ecologists to check out at\nthe moment with an online blog being\nupdated from a recent trip to Borneo.\nStill can\u2019t bring yourself to leave the\nLibrary? Check online for videos of\nprevious talks and events if you can\u2019t\nmake the trip around the corner.\nHowever don\u2019t be put o\ufb00 from attending if you think it is all about the\nbiology. Upcoming talks include \u201cA\nBody of Evidence,\u201d which is given by\na forensic anthropologist throughout\nthe day on the 23rd of November, and\n\u201cMeteorites: Messengers from Space,\u201d\non the 28th of November, which may\nbe more to the taste of a physicist or\nmathematician, or simply any student who wants to feed their inner\nnerd. Talks are either family friendly\nor more suitable for adults, so choose\nyield, sustainability, genetic modi\ufb01cation and fungicide and pesticide\nresistance.\nHowever what all the projects had\nin common was their interdiscipli-narity \u2013 using tools from chemistry\nin particular, but also mathematics,\nphysics, computing and engineering,\nto address biological problems. This\ncollaborative and interdisciplinary\ntype of research has been increasingly recognised as important in the\nbiomedical sciences in recent years,\nnot least at Imperial with its doctoral\ntraining centres such as the Institute\nfor Chemical Biology, which trains\nthe next generation of physical scientists to apply their skills to biological\nproblems. It is clearly emerging as a\nkey approach in agriculture as well,\nand with AGRI-net Imperial is leading the way.\nFinally, the prize for best talk was\nawarded to Hannah Straker from\nDurham University who presented\nher research on chemical tools for\ninvestigating multiple herbicide re-sistance, while Imperial Ph.D student\nKerry O\u2019Donnelly won the best poster prize for her innovative project to\nimprove the e\ufb03ciency of the Rubisco\nenzyme in photosynthesis.\nwisely if you fancy taking a younger\nsibling if they come to visit. These are\ngreat events to supplement a day trip\nto the museum, or if you just have an\nafternoon to kill and fancy something\na lot more interesting and stimulating\nthan the Library Caf\u00e9\u2019s cake selection.\nCheck online at www.nhm.ac.uk to\nsee the full list of upcoming Nature\nLive talks.
