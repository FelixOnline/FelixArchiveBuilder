However, the weather\nnow looks as if it has returned to\nnormal and we will undoubtedly\nfind ourselves doing everything\nbut flying in,the near future.\nAlthough the club exists primarily to make students into competent aviators, it has also taken\non the r q le of broadening their\noutlook. This is mainly done in\nthe \" cottage\" which has been\nrebuilt by members of I.C. and is\nowned by two staff members and\nan ex-president of I.C. Here one\ncan learn how to brew highly\npotent wines and how to remain\nstanding longer after consuming\nthem.\nOne brew which has proved\nparticularly outstanding is called\n\" Barmanspite .\" after the name of\na local \"hundred;\" this fluid\ncontains about 25 per cent,\nalcohol,, is extremely pleasant to\ndrink, leaves absolutely no hang-over, yet after two or three glasses\n. . . Unfortunately we only made\n8 gallons this year and this took\nthree week,s to disappear\u2014next\nyear we have decided to step up\nproduction by 3,000 per cent.\nBadminton\nI.C. EXCEL\nComplete a nihil ation has been\nmeted out to L.S.E., Woolwich\nand Northern by I.C. men's1st team this term. Such victories\nhave been due almost entirely to\nto the large influx of new players\nof high calibre, such as P. Fitzgerald, and S. Watamangura,\nwhich the Club has been fortunate\nto attract. The mixed doubles\nteam has also taken on a new\nlease of life, defeating Q.M. C. in\nthe first match of the season. This\nimprovement has coincided with\nthe appearance of Miss D. Wokes\nin the ladies' section.\nCLOSE GAP\nWith five current internationals\nand several British University\nrepresentatives competing, I.C. did well to take second place in\nthe U.L. Swimming Championships at the Nuffield Pool on\nNovember 13th. The standard\nwas far higher than in previous\nyears, all the individual events\ngoing to well-known names. Best\nperformances for I.C. were those\nof C. Davis, 2nd in the 100 yd s. butterfly, and Christie, 3rd in the\ndiving.\nAt the end of the individual\nevents, Guys were well in the lead\nthrough ROfddy Jones, their\nBritish international, but in the\nteam races, good performances\nby N.C.L. enabled I.C. to close\nthe gap with a couple of third\nplacings and finish an overall\nsecond.\nAs runners-up, I.C. maintained\na consist an cy in University swimming over the past three years,\nhaving won in 1961, and finished\n3rd last year.\nSports\nShorts\nSoccer\nFREE coaches to the Soccer\nCup match at Harlington this\nSaturday, November 30th.

So far, the\n\" A\" team has played the Patent\nOffice and Morganite Carbon, the\nresults being 2-1 and 1-2 respectively.

Inevitably the purpose of the Union was discussed with special reference to the function\nT)fa constituent College within this framework. A student of 18\non arrival at South Ken. is taken by the Constituent Union and intro-u ced to corporate college life by breaking down his inhibitions.\nIn effect these Unions are an introduction to the Imperial College\nUnion and lead logically to that end.; I.C.U., however, although it\nmight do, does not provide a platform to NUS.\n\u2014on practical grounds I am CAMBRIDGE AND\nagainst it\u2014\u2022\n\u2014have your views changed at\nall since becoming President\u2014:\n\u2014No, my basic argument is\nthat we still need more people\nwith ability and enthusiasm to\norganise our own Union. I don't think we would make a worthwhile contribution to NUS or\nbenefit from an association with\nNUS.\u2014\nIMPERIAL\n\u2014You were at Cambridge;\nwhere do you think a student gets\nthe better education ?\n\u2014Taking education in the\nbroadest sense, and comparing an\nundergraduate here, and one\nthere, Cambridge undoubtedly\ngives a better education! I would\nhave hated to be an undergraduate at Imperial.\nJAZZ NEWS There were only 40 bopping\ndays to Christmas when 500 discriminating jazz lovers invaded\nSouth Side on November 13th to\ngyrate to the wailing of five bands. Mr. Rothwell started the proceedings by stamping six times on the\nstage with his metal-heeled boot.\nThe Kensington City Stompers\nthen played \" That's a Plenty,\"\nfollowing it with several other\nitems in the Traditional idiom.\nThe second set was blown by\nthe Clive Heath quartet, who\nproduced a nice tidy sound on\n\"Night Train\" and other offer-in gs. Rimshot Gold Star to Mr.\nHeath. Then followed ap interval\nin which the electronics experts\ndemonstrated how, by sub de placing of microphones, five\nsingers could be rendered totally\ninaudible. Rimshot Consolation\nAward to the Wayfarers folk\ngroup.\nMr. Hopkins then led his mainstream sextet into a bouncing\nversion of \" Now's the time,\" the\nfront line cunningly observing\ntheir solo power by blowing king-size riffs at each other. Happy\nis a very broad tenor player, and\nhe generated great excitement on\n\"'Beginning to see the Light,\"\npassing from frenzy to abandon in\n\" Undecided.\"\nThe funk spot of the evening\nwas filled by the RirXiard Rushton\nquartet, who ladled out soul renderings of \" Sack of Woe,\"\n\" Sister Sadie \" and \" Moanin' \"\nwith great spirit. Mr.\"Rushton has\nsince been nominated for the\nDuke of Edinburgh Rolling Stone\nAward, and the Dankworth Cup\nfor original work on the alto.\nFor those people who are still\ninterested in jazz, the following\nevents should be noted. The\nU.L. U. jazz competition is being\nheld. at U.L. U. on Saturday\nNovember 30th, so why not come\nalong to listen and support us?\nIf you still want more, come to\nour lunchtime concert on Tuesday\nDecember 3rd in the Concert\nHall. It's free.\nFinally, the Jazz Club would\nlike to congratulate Richard\nRushton and Dave Cain, who\nwere in the winning band at the\nRichmond Jazz Festival in the\nsummer, and later came third in\nthe European competition in\nZurich. Who said I.C. only produced engineers?\nRIMSHOT\n\u2014Why ?\u2014\n\u2014It's large and impersonal, a9 to 5 college\u2014\n\u2014But the Constituent colleges\nshould help here\u2014\n\u2014Yes, they can help to hu-m anise the place; to make it a place of people, not statistics.\n\u2014Is there anything we can\nlearn from Cambridge\u2014\n\u2014The main thing we can learn\nfrom it is the extent to which\nmembers of the i staff meet, mix\nwith, and talk to students on a social level, after 5 o 'clock\u2014\n\u2014Why is this not so here ?\n\u2014'The origins are historical\u2014\n\u2014Do you think an improvement could he effected by staff\nwriting in Felix ?\n\u2014This would be a very good\nthing. If Felix can do anything\nto encourage this it would have\nmade a great contribution to the\nproblem.\nOut of Touch\n\u2014Are you sufficiently in touch\nwith the student to appreciate his\nposition ?\n\u2014It is true that the President\ndoes not mix much with the stu-dents, but he must have done so\nto a tremendous extent before he\nis elected. He must base his\nactions in his year as President\non that experience.\n\u2014Can the President now get\nelected merely by knowing Council who elect him ?\u2014\n\u2014No; to get elected a man\nmust know a considerable\namount about the student and\nhis aims; otherwise he won't get\nelected.\u2014\nA Mature Minority\n\u2014-The average student is very\nmuch less mature than the average President; what sort of\nstudent are you catering for ?\u2014\n\u2014'3,000 mature students ; it is\nthe function of the President to\ngive the student what the student\nwants.\n\u2014We have not got 3,000 mature students; might the traditional I.C. apathy be due to the\nfact that you are catering for\nstudents you actually haven't got?\n\u2014If we turn out 600 students\nwho can run their own affairs we\ncan be proud. I personally am\nsorry that more students do not\ntake an interest \u2022 many will regret\nit later\u2014\n\u2014So you cater for a minority ?\n\u2014Only in that 60 people who\nknow what they want' are a minority ?\n\u2014Surely you should educate\nthose who don't know what they\nwant ?\n\u2014'Yes, this is part of my fun c: tion ; but in the last analysis it is\nnot for me to force on people\nwhat they dont' want.\u2014\u2022\nAnd at that point the tape\nended. ,\nAn attempt by Mr. Cameron\nto clamp down on parties in Tizzard Hall has been by-passed by\nthe Hall Committee. They have\nformed a parties sub-committee\nand applications should be made\nto this body; parties will continue as before.\nBUCHANAN\nfrom Staff Reporter \u2014'\nProf. C.A. Buchanan's long\nawaited report will be finally released on Nov. 27th. Three years\nago he was briefed by the Ministry\nof Transport to study the implications of the four fold increase in\nroad traffic during the next fifty\nyears on town planning. One of\nhis many projects has been to\nstudy in particular a part of London; his appointment last October as Professor of Transport at\nImperial College will have made\nhim aware of the problems facing\nthe student motorist here. His\ncomments on projected special\nlicenses for city motorists should\nhave special relevance to I.C. motorists.\nUNION\nMEETING\nInsurance\nThe next motion was that \"this\nUnion should convey its wishes to\nH.M. Government that students\nshould be credited with National\nInsurance contributions whilst\nundergoing full-time education.\"\nPaul Carter outlined the Government pamphlet on the subject \" a gro tty little bit of paper.\" If we\ndon't pay a \u00a3100 while at the uni-vers it y, our wives, our children,\nand ourselves will suffer. He\nwanted the methods I.C. had of\nreaching the right people muted\nduring the N.U.S. debate last year\nbe used. Don Leper thought\nthat \" if we were dependent on\npension for our livelihood our life\nat I.C. had been wasted.\" The\nmotion was carried overwhelm-ingly.\nApartheid\nThe final motion \"That I.C. Union condemns the application\nof apartheid to students in South\nAfrica and instructs the Executive to raise a subscription fund\nin support of South African campaign for Higher Education\"\nwas proposed by Tony Berry in a fluent forceful speech. In seconding the motion, a Ghanaian\npointed out the difference between\nbeing white and black in South\nAfrica. Black people had virtually\nno education, no skilled jobs, and\nthey died much younger. He gave\na grim picture. Some people\ndoubted that it was that grim.\nDon Leper suggested that a private collection should be made.\nMark Lee thought that\" it was a matter of Union members individual conscience.\" The motion\nwas carried heavily. The meeting then closed.\nThis Union meeting was a success, a success because many\npeople turned up, and a success\nbecause sensible points were dis-cussed. If other Union meetings\nand' functions are as good as this\none, there is no truth in saying\nthat the Union is apathetic and\nlacking in spirit.\n\n"

AH the\nscoring came in the first quarter of an hour, however, leaving the\nrest of the match rather devoid of interest for the four coach loads of spectators who turned up to cheer them on.\nI.C. moved into the attack\nfrom the whistle. Within minutes,\nprop-forward Ravno broke from\na line-out in the Woolwich \" 25 \"\nbut was stopped just short of the\nline. A scrum infringement by\nHavard enabled Woolwich to\ngain some respite, but I.C. were\nsoon back, spurred on by the\ncheering from the touch line. I.C. Score\nA scissors movement between\ncentres Turton and Armstrong\nforced play right up to the Woolwich line, but their defence was\ntackling well at this stage of the\ngame, and I.C. failed to score.\nAfter 15 minutes of play, how-ever, a wheel from the scrum\nenabled speedy winger Churchill\nto race on to a kick ahead and\nbeat the Woolwich full back to\nthe touch down. Ravno kicked\na beautiful conversion from the\ntouch line to make the score 5\u20140\nto I.C. No sooner had Woolwich\nkicked off than I.C. were on the\nattack again. Woolwich were\npenal is ed near their line and\nRavno had no difficulty in\nkicking the goal. 8\u20140, and it\nseemed as though I.C. were going to romp away. Woolwich\nwere determined that this should\nnot happen, however, and with\nplay oscillating from one half to\nthe other no further score resulted before half time.\nJUDO\nLeeds Report\nImperial College Judo Club\nreinforced their claim to being\none of <he strongest college teams\nin the country when they supplied\nfour of the ten members of the\nvictorious South-East England\nRegional team at the Inter Regional championships in Leeds on\nNovember 9th. The competition was held on\na knockout basis, the South-East\nteam beating the North 7-3 in the\nsemi-final and Scotland and N. Ireland 6-4 in the final.\nThe fortunes of the four^I.C. competitors are given below m the\nstandard Japanese terms:\nSemi-final:\nR. Bedding won with a hara i gosh iK.

Mee won with kes agata me Woolwich Attack\nIn the second half, play was\ngenerally scrappy with the I.C. three-quarters rarely in evidence.\nI.C. would have scored again if\nonly they had tackled their men\nlow when following up the kicks\nof the scrum and outside halves.\nIt was left to Woolwich to make\nthe first attack of the half, mainly\ndue to the rel ct ance of I.C. players (with the notable exception of open side forward Turner)\nto fall on a rolling ball.\nIt was not until after 20 mins.\nthat I.C. got another chance to\nscore when they were awarded\nanother penalty. This time, how-ever, Ravno's shot went wide.\nFrom the drop out, the ball went\nto Turton in the centre, who\nmade an outside break before\npassing to Churchill on the wing.\nChurchill made a dash forward\nbut was forced into touch just\nshort of the line.\nWoolwich were now generally\nforcing I.C. back across the halfway line and stalemate ensued\nuntil the final whistle ended I.C. fears.\nAthletics\nPIPPED!\nHaving won a trophy at the\nWinter Championships for so\nmany years back, the end had to\ncome sometime. The fact that it\ncame this year when we held\nsuch high hopes of wresting the\nTjalve field event trophy from\nMiddlesex Hosp. was however a great disappointment. We were\nthe runners-up in this by only\nthree points.\nDespite this, it is still true to\nsay that our field events strength\nis considerably greater this year\nthan last. D. Smith, returning\nto I.C. as a Postgraduate in Concrete Technology, came second in\nthe triple jump with 45ft. login s, and is capable of closing the gap\nbetween this and 50ft. even fur-ther. L. Hall only just dislodged\nthe bar at 6ft. in the high jump\nand should become U.L. second\nstring in this event with a bit of\nluck. Unfortunately, our throwers\nwere a little below form and this\nwas our downfall.\nOur performance in the relays\nwas predictably low. After a season when some of the best\nU.L. runners belonged to I.C., we\nare now left with little such potential and our future on the\ntrack this year looks dim.\nINTERNATIONAL Sheril Afifi our Egyptian international squash player.\nSoccer\nLeague and Cup\nI.C. have at last gained a point\nin a league match. This was no\nsummit of achievement, however.\nAfter being 2 goals,up against\nGoldsmiths, the team slipped to\nbeing 4-2 against in a manner\nsuggesting inexperience. Only a spirited rally in the last 15 mins.\ngave us the two goals and one\npoint. Two more league matches\nremain this term and these must\nbe.won to maintain EC' s soccer\nreputation.\nThe Club has a cup match on\nSaturday against this same Goldsmiths. Our cup team, however,\nis a completely different entity\nfrom our league team. We have\nSIX players in the U.L.1 st XI and these are released to us only\nfor cup matches. This seems to\nhappen every year, and as a re-sul t, we have won the U.L. Cup\nfor the last 5 years whereas our\nleague record is no better than\nthat of any other large College.\nTODAY\nA short Judo display will be\nheld this evening from 7.00 to\n7.15 p.m. to mark the official\nOpening by the Rector of the I.C.j u ao Club's \"Dojo\" by the\nEast Side car park. Go along\nand see our experts in action;\nBasketball\nWOOLWICH\nWIN\nWoolwich 50,1,C.37 I.C. Basketball Club have had\na bad start to the season in losing\ntheir first two matches in both\nthe University and the London\nLeagues \u2014 albeit to the two\nstrongest teams in each division\nThe last match in the University\nLeague was at Woolwich where\nI.C. went down to the Poly 37-50.\nIn the first half I.C. played a very\ntight zone, defence which was\nsuccessful in keeping out the fast\nWoolwich forwards and restricting them to hurried set-shots. In\nattack, Alex Termanis played very\nwell under their basket and had\ncollected 8 points by half-time\nwhen the score stood at 18-18.\nDuring the second half, both\nteams switched to a man-to-man\ndefence and although I.C.s screening attack caused some concern in the Woolwich defence,\ntheir own defence was very\nweak so that Woolwich's two\nU.L. U. forwards soon built up\na commanding lead which I.C. could not peg back when they\nreverted to their more successful\nzone defence. Ray Thomas played\nwell for I.C. in the second half,\nscoring 11 points and Alex\nTermanis ended with 10 points.\n-CROSS COUNTRYNOTES\nby Pete Crews\nThe club fixture list has been\nfull over the past fortnight. On\nWednesday 13th November we\nwere at home to Reading University, University of Sussex, Charing\nCross Hospital and L.S.E. The\ndifficulty of providing tea for 50\nodd hungry runners Was compensated for by the fact that we came\nsecond to L.S.E. in the actual race.\nOnce again it was the stout effort\nof the club as a whole that\nbrought this about.\nBoth U.L. and I.C. were at\nOxford on Saturday, 16th Nov.\nWhile Dave Reaves and Chris\nJames were representing the University vs. Oxford, the rest of the\nclub had a trying afternoon running on Westminster College's muddy course. Led by our contingent of fresher s we overcame\nthe foreign conditions and eventually defeated Westminster by 39\nto 43. Meanwhile Chris and\nDave missed the UL match\nthrough no fault of their own.\nFor some reason or other, the\nstart was held a quarter of an\nhour early.\nLeague positions are as follows:\nLeague Div.

Motor Club of its only form of\nmotor sport and caused suitable\nfermentation within the brains of\nWatson and Klat, who quickly\ncame up with the idea of a karting\nsection within the club. Two\nClass One frames were purchased\neven more quickly with financial\nassistance from the City & Guilds\nUnion and the Mechanical Engineering Department, and one of\nthese was modified to Class Four\nrules, which give more scope for\ndevelop em edt, in time for an\nappearance in the Carnival Procession and a few outings last\nyear.\nThis year will be the first full\nyear for the karting section and\nthere is much to be achieved. The\nsecond frame has to be completed\nand engine and frame tests have\nto be carried out on present\nequipment; The aims for {this\nyear are threefold. As many\ndrivers as possible will be trained\nwith a view to a possible race\nouting at the end of this year.

These\ndishes were then left on the step\nas an offering to Albert.

    "content": "6 FELIX EDITORIAL\nPUBLISH AND BE DAMNED In the best of Hearst traditions we published . . . and were\ndamned. The unfortunate case of Colcutt has spotlighted the whole\npurpose behind a college newspaper. At a recent Felix board meeting the Editorial policy (or lack of it) was criticised ; perhaps the\nfairest and most balanced critique of Felix as it now stands appears\nin Scrutiny. Here Chris Tye makes several valid points on the Felix\neditorial policy but to suggest that we have none (as has been done\nby others) and then talk of sensationalism is a paradox unworthy of\nany member at this College.\nThis paper will not under its present leadership present the\nUnion as the ideal institution some would have us believe. Although\nwe are a Union publication it is clearly our duty to report news and\ninform our readers. If the Union feels that thieving is an unworthy\nreflection on its members, then the answer is to stop the thieving,\nnot its publication.\nWe ARE tending toward sensationalism, but NOT for its own\nsake; if bigger headlines and a layout verging on that of a genuine\nnewspaper make Felix more readable and interesting, then that is\nthe way it will stay. If some of our issues are controversial then this\ntoo must be a good thing. Inaccurate reporting cannot be condoned,\nbut comment upon facts is an essential part of any student journal.\n\"What If It Sells\"?\nThis is a remark that has caused much grumbling in some\ncircles. Any function or publication can judge its success on only\none thing, namely the interest it creates. In the case of a college\nnewspaper the only possible yardstick is its sales. Felix has been\nselling better than ever before; we can only assume that this is\nbecause people are interested in it. When our sales fall it will be\nbecause our readers are no longer interested.\nA great deal of work has gone into Felix this year, headlining\nand layout techniques have been completely revised ; sale methods\nhave been improved and are giv irt g better results. we are trying to\nmake Felix a NEWSPAPER\u2014Reactionaries to this change will just\nhave to bear with it.\nThe Case for Colcutt\nThere was a time when Felix contained nothing controversial,\nwhen it was flabby and contented, when it reflected the Union as it\nis not; in that era Colcutt provided for many the sole centre of\ninterest. It wa,s an anonymous, opinionated and informative column\nwritten by a prominent person in Union affairs. The column held\nthe paper together and provided some spark of controversy in a sea\nof dead fact.\nThat era has passed, and Felix can stand on its own without a column of this sort. To stand out now Colcutt must be very strong\nindeed. That the last one was published is regrettable, but this\nshould not spelL his end ; there is a place in any newspaper for an\ninformed column which comments and bites where necessary, especially on Union affairs. However, since this comment is not necessarily that of the Editor, there is little reason for his continued anonymity \"; if Colcutt is to attack he must also be prepared to defend.\nSCANDALOUS As most of you will know\", the\nopening of Southside Was delayed\nfor many months. This article\nsets out to explain the reasons for\nthis delay. The factual evidence\nwas collected during the last\na cede mic year by the authors\nfrom diverse sources and, in their\nopinion, could all be substantiated\nagain if necessary.\nThe first point to be made, em-pha tic ally, is that the delay on\nSouthside was not due to strikes.\nThe builders were held up approximately two months by the\nweather. This, in turn, retarded\nthe carpenters and the electricians.\nThe latter lost four days, in\nstrikes, during the eight months.\nThey operated no overtime bans\nor go-slows. The carpenters also\nlost four days over a similar\nperiod. The second point to be\nmade is that these were quite\njustified.\nElectricians: One major strike\noccured when four men were\ntaken on without their union\nCards.\npaint, instead they put the bonus\nup to 2/- when it had just been\ncut from 1 / lid. to 1/ld. Even\nso the painters estimated that the\nfirms saving on materials and\nlabour ALONE was \u00a31,600 on\nthe 6th floor alone. This does not\ntake into account the gain due to\nfinishing the job quicker.\nSo, having presented the facts,\nsome words of explanation on the\npart of the authors are necessary.\nWhat reasons account for the\neight month delay before Southside was opened? The very hard\nwinter caused an estimated two\nmonths fall behind in schedule.\nThus there are still about six\nmonths to account for. It is\ncommon practice on the part of\nbuilding contractors to estimate\nconstruction time rather optimistically, especially for non-essential\nbuildings like Southside. This is\ndone because it makes a firm's tender more attractive, and then,\nlater it is possible that there might\nbe higher payment from the college for \" increased building\nCarpenters; At one stage three\ncoloured employees were sacked\nby the foreman. He was a white\nSouth African who said that he\nwanted no coloured men on his\nsite. It was necessary to call a strike to obtain their reinstate-ment.\nIt should be stressed that there\nwas no \" militant activist minority \" at work in the E.T. U. on\nSouthside-rather a majority. The\nunion estimated 80 per cent,\nattendance at site meetings, and\n25 per cent, at branch meetings,\nwhich is better than most unions\n(including ours!).\nNow for a closer look at some\nof the new Guilds buildings: We\nwere told by one of the site stewards that the individual contractors often ordered work to be done\ninadequately. For example they\ntold the palmer s to put ONE coat of paint on the ceiling tiles\nof the fifth and sixth floors in the\nElectrical Engineering building.\nThe contract specifies \u2022 THREE.\nAgain not enough paint was\nordered to be put on j heaters, skirting s, and walls, both inside\nand out. When the painters complained the contractors still did\nnothing about the missing coats of\ntime.\" However it does often\nmean that the work gets done pro-per ly, and we were told that the\npainting, carpentry, decorating\netc., in Southside, were being done\nexactly to the architects schedule.\nIn comparison, the work on the\nnew Guilds' building was being\nfinished in an inferior fashion,\nthough they have been opened,\ngenerally speaking, on time\n(though this was to a somewhat\nrevised target).\nWhy the difference? Primarily\nbecause the Guilds' buildings,\nbeing labs, and teaching facilities,\nhave to be considered as highly\nessential equipment which must\nbe opened on schedule, and there\nexists a bonus for the contractors\nif they can do it. So a different\nset of what can only be described\nas malpractices is carried out,\nnamely that of skimping the work\nin order to finish on time and, as\nalready pointed out, to save\nmoney.\nPAUL CARTER TONY HALL This article was condensed\nfrom a longer one, and there is\nmuch more information available.\nThose interested please contact\nthe authors.\n\n"

Newcomers to the College\nlike myself do not want the matter\nto be closed; here from my experience is the case for entry.\nThe National Union of Students\nis the only national organisation\nfor students in this country, and\nrepresents some 80 per cent, of\nthose in full-time higher e duca tion. It exists to further the welfare and promote the interests of\nits members; policy is determined\nby student union delegates at\ncouncils and is carried out by an\nexecutive and permanent staff.\nPolitical independance is maintained by limiting discussion and\naction to matters directly affecting students.\nThe facilities that N.U.S. offers\nto individual members can only\nbe widely known and used if the\nUnion co-ordinates and publicizes\nthem. Some of these are: cheap\ntravel abroad, individually and\nin organised holidays; the International Student Card, providing\nmany concessions at home and\nabroad; and a wide variety of vacation jobs and working holidays.\nThese benefits can save a student\npounds in a year.\nN.U.S. speaks out and acts for\nits members. It negotiates details\nof grants both as a whole and for\nindividuals, and has had a large\nmeasure of success. N.U.S. is\naccepted as the representative\nvoice of students, and thus we in\nI.C. are effectively unrepresented\noutside College.

Faced with the prospect of\na cold and lonely week in a shabby bed sitter, some are asking\nwhether the college authorities\nare fully aware of the plight of\nforeign students in London who\nhave no family or relations to go\nto. Others, under pressure from\ndwindling financial resources to\ncomplete their research as\nquickly as possible, are annoyed\nthat they are to be prohibited\nfrom working for such a long\nperiod.\nIt is believed that one of the\nreasons for the long closure is\nthat the college authorities wish\nto give postgraduates the opportunity of taking a holiday which\nthey might not take if they knew\nthat some of their colleagues\nwould be working. Pressure to\nconform to patterns set by the\nmost consistent attenders does\nimpose strains on some students.\nYet the time of year seems to be\nill chosen. Given a Christmas as\ncold as the last one, most people\nprefer to stay indoors. With\nT.V., friends and family this can\nbe enjoyable ; with none of these\nit is dubiously so, especially to a foreign student without Christian\nbeliefs and some research work\nto finish in a hurry.\nDepartmental\nDoes colour vision deteriorate\nwith age? This question was\nposed recently to the Technical\nOptics department of I.C. by the\nMedical Research Council. Apparently, the \" committee on human factor in railway accidents \"\nhave been wondering for some\ntime why locomotive drivers\noccasionally go past red lights.\nAnyway, Professor Wright's department did an experimental\nsurvey and came to the conclusion that colour vision doesn't deteriorate with age, which is\nhard lines for the committee on\nhuman factors in railway a cci dents.\nLIQUID OR SOLID ?\nThings are not what they seem\nwhen viewed through an electron\nmicroscope. Professor M. Blackman's Department of Electron\nDiffraction have discovered that\nwhen a thin solid film of silver or\nlead is being deposited on a sur-face, the crystals behave as if they\nwere anything but solid. A cine-film taken through the microscope\nshows that when two crystals\ntouch they join together in a way\nwhich is remarkably similar to\nbinary fission of an amoeba in\nreverse. Explanation anyone?\nOther investigations in this department include a study of the\ncrystal structure of solid neon and\noxygen at liquid helium temperatures using electron diffraction\nmethods; also a study of superconductivity in various substances.\nA current-carrying superconductor is remarkable in that there is\nno magnetic field produced external to it. Some materials (e.g. lead) can be superconducting in\nsome sections of their length while\nnot in others. Where they are not\nsuperconducting they produce a magnetic field. An overall picture\nof such materials can therefore be\ndeduced by observing the deflection due to such fields, of an\nelectron beam.\n\n"

    "content": "12 FELIX NOONEY ACQUITTED\nSQUARE MEAL MOONEY\nA barrage of criticism has been directed at Mr. Moeney this\nterm (as in every term), via the J>ou th side Suggestions Book. When\ninterviewed by Felix, however, the Refectories Manager had a reply\nto nearly all his critics. Suggestions do not go unheeded and modifications are not impossible.\nCharged with dirty cutlery and unclean glasses, Mr. Mooney\nreplied that the modern South Side washing machines handle 3 to\n4,000 pieces of cutlery, 2,000 plates, 500 glasses, etc.,. per day, so it\nis unavoidable that an Odd one or two should appear unsatisfactory.\nCutlery is dried by hand to ensure cleanliness, but all plates and\nglasses are dried by machine. So blame the scientist, not the Refectories Manager.\nOn the suggestion that South\nSide should run on a flow tech-ni que,( serve oneself with woman\nreplacing dishes), Mr. Mooney\nthought this was a distinct pos-sibi lit y. He was waiting for \" the\nmen\" to modify the hot plate\nrail (the one in a direct line of\nsight between you and the beans),\nthen each student could carry his\nplate down the line, being loaded\nwith ' peas, beans or greens \" as\nit went, thus encouraging a greater rate of service.\nCharge Two: Cold food. In the\nLower Union the hot plate runs,\nat 140\u00b0 whereas in South Side it\nwas designed for 115\u00b0. However,\ncool food is largely a result of\npoor ventilation, and this problem\nhas been inspected and will be\nremedied.\nCharge Three: 6.00 p.m. lack\nof choice. Here, we must decide\nwhether it is better to have a full\nmenu up to 6.30 with food re-main ing,e sul ting in increased\ncosts, and im ce, prices, or leave\nthe situation as it stands. The\ndemand varies in South Side by\nabout 40-50 meals per evening so\nnumerical predictions are impossible. Suggestions that the Snack Bars\nof last term should re-open were\napplauded by Mr. Mooney. It\nis, however, a matter of College\npolicy that eating places should be\nsituated apart from academic\nbuildings, so we must manage\nwithout, but not on Mr. Mooney's account.\nCharge Four: Late evening\nservice. Suppers are served until\n8.00 in Weeks Hall, but due to the\ninconvenience of cooking there, it\nis hoped that it will be replaced by\nall or part of the Staff Dining\nRoom, also serving till 8.Q0. If\nclosing times were put back, students would still dawdle along\nwith five minutes to spare, so a balance must be struck between\nconvenience to the student and the\ncost of keeping a refectory open.\nThis balance lands on 6.30.\nCharge Five: Queues. The\nposition has definitely improved\nsince the start of term. At present,\nwithin five minutes Of 12.30 or\n1.00, some 1,000 ravenous gentlemen demand a meal. Thus, about\n200 people per refectory, moving\nat a service of seven per minute,\na fair figure, would still result\nin a half-hour's queue. Two\ncashiers have helped the situation,\nbut with the present number of\nrefectories, it is physically impossible to improve the situation very\nmarkedly. How many times do\nyou help by having the right\nmoney?\nIn future, let those who have\nnever catered for three be less\nsevere on those who bear the responsibility of catering for 3,000.\nConstructive criticism is welcome\nscorn is not.\nSHORT TAKES\nThe Vice-President of City\nand Guilds fell down a London\nTransport escalator while walking up it. At the time the offending escalator was going down.\nHe went to hospital later, but returned with a Stick and a twisted\nankle.\nA MUST FOR BEGINNERS\nAH those interested in people\nand reality must see - the film\n\"Cry the Beloved Country,\" to\nbe shown in General Studies on\nThursday, December 12th. A must for beginners, and who after\nall can claim not to be a beginner ?\nTOUCHSTONE, NOV. 30th She speaker will be Professor\n(charity before chastity) Carstairs.\nHis topic will be \"The psychological consequences of rapid social Change.\"' Prof. Carstairs was\na Reith Lecturer in 4962, and\nthis weekend promises to be a good one.\nFor details see notice boards.\nI.C. PLANS\nSURVEY\nPublished, we hope, by the end\nof this term will be a survey of\nthe university advice received in\nschools by students now at four\nof London's colleges. The survey started a year ago within I.C. Socialist Society and was\nprompted by a uniform lack of\ngood advice at school. The connection with the failure rate\nseemed fairly direct but no sociological work had been done in\nthe field; as-a result, and with\nthe assistance of a research assistant at L. SJE. (now at the Home\nOffice) a questionnaire was devised and circulated in a limited\nway within I.C. The results were\ntat tt ali singly inconclusive on the\nnarrow sample taken; hence a1 in 3 sample of all Britisheducated freshmen at I. C.,U.C.,L. S.E., and Bedford was planned\nand the questionnaire refashioned. We were extremely fortunate\nthroughout for the support we received\u2014from other helpers inside\nthe Socialist Society, from professional sociologists, from the registrars of the four colleges themselves and, very important, from\nN.U.S. financial support and\nfrom a computer company for\nthe free processing of all our,\ndata.\nAll that remains to be done\nnow is to form our conclusions\nfrom the computer\u2014a first taste\nfor Felix when they are ready.\nDAVID LARBALESTIER.\nWHITHER FOR XMAS ?\nWhere are you going for\nXmas ? Home ? Lucky you. Nowhere to go ? Parents overseas ?\nWould you like to spend Xmas\nin an English home ? This can\nbe arranged if you think about it\nearly enough. If you seriously\nare interested in this scheme then\ncontact Peter Riding as soon as\npossible through the Union\nRack.\nFIND THE ZEBRA\nThere are 5 different coloured houses. The 5 occupants are of\ndifferent nationality, and each smokes his own brand of American\ncigarette, drinks a different beverage from the other and houses a different pet. Now, who drinks water, who owns the zebra?\u2014\n15 clues.\nThere are five houses.

Union for passing the\nmotion which condemned the\nSouth African Government policy\nof apartheid in Education, and\nwhich instructed the executive to\nset up a fund towards the education of the non-whites in that\ncountry. The last gesture is worthy\nof great commendation indeed.\nI.C. has shown that she has not\nonly got a voice of her own, but\nthat she is capable of positive\naction as well. And I feel\nthat somehow this show of\nstrength is not unconnected with\nthe reappearance of \" Phoenix.\"\nIt is, however, important to be\nsure that the support for the\nmotion came from the conviction\nthat apartheid in education was\nabhorrent, and not out of sent i ment. An amendment to the motion suggested the removal of the\nlast portion. This conveyed nothing but the attitude of the landlady who says to the negro stu-dent, \"I have nothing against you,\nbut I'm sorry I don't give rooms\nto blacks.\" In plain terms, it is\nhypocrisy, and it was gratifying\nthat this amendment was rejected.\n\" Do something in the motion, or\nthrow ft out\\ \", one true l.C. man\nsaid.\nSouth Africa has had over half\na century to improve on her racial\npolicies, like another Western\ncountry, and if the world outside\nthese countries does not act now a lot of blood which is neither white\nnor black will be shed. For even\na rat, when driven to a corner will\nturn back and bite, and man, it\ncan do some damage.\nCynics are beginning to say that\nthe good which Christianity and\nWestern preachings of democracy\nhave for the non-white races is\nreflected in the way these races\nare treated in South Africa, and\nmany of the so-called Christian\ncountries.

    "content": "FELIX3 AT THE PLAY THE LARK UNITY Is Church unity possible and\ndesirable? These are questions\nmost Christians are facing at the\npresent time, especially Anglicans\nand Methodists.\nRepresentatives of the two\nChurches officially met together\nto discuss this problem, and since\nthey began their conversations in\n1956 they have published two reports on the subject. The first\nwas an interim statement published in 1958 and the second was\nthe final report suggesting ways in\nwhich unity could come about.\nThe two Churches have decided\nto study and discuss these reports\nover the next two years before any\naction is taken.\nHere at College these important\ndocuments have not escaped the\nnotice of either the Anglican\nChaplaincy or Methodist Society.\nBoth societies are studying the\nreports of the \" Conversations \"\nseparately, and also together. A series of joint meetings have been\narranged at which speakers from\nthe Anglicans and Methodists\nwill be giving accounts of their\nChurches, their beliefs, and their\nattitudes to the reports.\nTwo such joint meetings have\nalready taken place, one last term\nand the other last Monday, This\nlatter meeting was addressed by\nRev. Neville Ward, the Methodist\nchaplain, who based his tat kf on\nthe similarities between the two\nChurches. He later answered\nquestions, with Father Ivor, about\nthe Methodist Church, and episcopal ordination.\nAn attitude of shyness and\nuncertainty still prevails at these\njoint meetings, with one side not\nwishing to offend the other. However, as \u00b0time progresses it is\nhoped that they will prove very\nprofitable in introducing Anglican\nbeliefs to Methodists and vice-versa. The next joint meeting will\nbe held on Monday, November\n4th( at 5.15 p.m. in the upper\nlounge, South Side), when laymen\nfrom both Churches will be speak-ing.\nWho or what is the Larkl\nNow it can be revealed.\n\" The Lark \" is the next production by the Imperial College\nDramatic Society. This play by\nJean Anouilh, translated by\nChristopher Fry, tells the story of\nJoan of Arc. Her story has been\nused many times, but it has been\nwritten that this version is \" the\nbest play about Joan of Arc\nwhich the English Theatre has\nseen.\"\nThe play is written as a series\nof flash backs into Joan's past,\ninterwoven into her trial as a witch. These continual changes\nof /scene (mean that the set is\nsimple and symbolic, consisting\nmainly of rostra and drapes.\nThe conflict between Joan's clerical judges is introduced; between Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who sym pathis es with Joan\nand the French cause, and the\nInquisitor and Promoter, who\nconsider her the instrument of the\ndevil. Also present is Earl of\nWarwick, representative of the\nEnglish King, who merely wants\nCharles, King of France, discredited through Joan.\nThrough this mass of intrigue\nand hatred, Joan emerges as a simple peasant girl, not a saint or\na warrior maid. She firmly believes in her capture and abandonment. Warwick describes her\nas \" a lark singing over the heads\nof the French army.\"\n\" The Lark \" is an exciting and\ninteresting play and should not be\nmissed. The performances are on\nDecember 3rd,4 th,5 th, and 6th and tickets are on sale in the\nUnion Entrance Hall at 3/- and\n4/-MICHAEL SMITH\nGenerous Earnings for\nPart time work offered\nby-CAMPER TOURS LTD.\nHartlip,\nSittingbourne, Kent.\nAPPL* IN CONFIDENCE\nAT THE FILM\n'THE TRIAL'\nbased on Kafka's novel of the same title.\nIn his film \" The Trial,\" Orson\nWelles once again displays his\ntremendous technical ability.\nAnd for this reason alone it is\nworth making the journey to the\nCameo-Poly. Unfortunately the\nacting doesn't measure up to\nWelles' direction. Antony Perkins, in the lead, is too stylised\nand mannered for the difficult\npart of Joseph K, and since the\nfilm revolves about K, many of\nthe finer points of the original\nnovel are lost. Even so the basic\npoint of Kafka's story, the existence of a man with his guilt con-science, is made clear, although\nmuch of the symbolism has been\nbrought up to date.\nThere are good performances\nby Romy Schneider, Akim Tamiroff, and Welles himself as a decadent advocate, resplendent for\nmuch of the time in a huge\nbaroque bed.\nThis film is worth seeing not\nonly because of Welles' superb\ncreation of atmosphere, but also-because Romy Schneider is as\nbeautiful as ever.\nC.B. LESS TALK\n\u2014MORE ACTION\nThe Anglican Chaplaincy ? It\nused to be called the Church\nSociety. The new name is more\nappropriate. Here you will see\nthe Church getting on with its\njob\u2014-not just being intellectual\nand talking about it. Plenty has\nbeen going on this term\u2014besides\nthe usual Sunday and weekday\nservices, there has been hospital\nind parish visiting. It makes you\nrealise how well off yOu are. We\nhave had a day conference on\nMissionary Work, too. There\nwere addresses from a fellow\nfrom India, and from one who\nhas lived and worked with the\nAfrican people. A lot of our\nwork, both practical and financial, is in support of Missions.\nWe have had three meetings\nwith the college Methodists since\nthe recent report was published\noutlining possible ways towards\nUnity. Each has much to offer\nthe other, and we are learning all\nwe can about our two Traditions.\nWe are not just talking\u2014-we\nmean business !! Why not come\nto the next joint meeting on Monday, December 2nd? Our Annual Dinner was on\nNovember 11th, and Mr. Mooney\nexcelled himself-. There were 125\npeople there, and we had a great\nevening. The Guest speaker was\nMiss Balerie Pitt, who is known\nas \" That Woman \" in her parish,\nbecause she stirs !

Mr. Kaye has been a barber since 1926, and for\nthe last 12 years has been providing, in his own words, \" an excellent\nservice \" for the College. During this period, Indians, Chinese, in\nfact all the straight-haired races have benefited from it, but Africans\nhave been politely turned away. \"Nobody's made any trouble until\nnow ; it's just this one individual.\"\nWhy isn'ta note put on all barber shop notices warning\nAfricans ? \" That wouldn't look good would it ? Much better to\ntell them to their face.\" Why wouldn't Mr. Kaye let Apeji have\ninformation about hair-clippers a year ago when he asked for it ?\n\"The Union would never allow that (the Hairdressers Union, pre-sum ably).
