    "content": "West End Shows\nIt is the first week in August,\nand all over Edinburgh teams\narmed with scaffolding and\nscrewdrivers are attacking\nchurch halls, assembly rooms\nand even crypts. In a space of\nless than seven days all will be\ntransformed from empty\nrooms into fully operational\ntheatres and auditoria. Garish\ncircus tents will appear in\nparks and gardens all around\nthe city. Buskers and street\nartists converge on squares\nand outside galleries. Venues\nrange from the dingy depths\nof Cepha's Cellar \u2014 where a dud seat can land you behind\na pillar, unable to see the\nstage \u2014 to the cavernous\nspaces of the Assembly\nRooms in George Street.\nHowever, all are part of the\nEdinburgh Fringe Festival.\nWhile the 'official' Festival rolls\non with its military tattoos and\ntraditional concerts for the\ntourists, the Fringe takes care\nof the new ground in theatre.\nLast year, the Fringe fielded\nsomewhere in the region of\n900 shows, and is expected to\ngo up by 10% this year, to give\nwell over a thousand. It has\nreached a point where the\nFringe is better known across\nthe world than the festival\nwhich gave it a reason to\nexist. Edinburgh has become\nsynonymous with outrageous\nstreet theatre and\nundecipherable plays. The\nFringe is coordinated from a small office in a road running\nbetween the Castle and\nHolyrood Palace, known as\nthe Royal Mile. There are two\npermanent staff, assisted by\nThe Edinburgh Festival is probably th j largest arts festival of its kind \u2014\nknown more for the antics of the Fringe than for its traditional concerts.\nImperial College is itself a major contributor, present not only as an acting\ncompany, but as one of the more important venues: Venue 126 \u2014 Theatre\nWest End.\nvolunteers and part-timers.\nTheir job is to offer help to\nboth acting groups and the\npeople who run venues, and to\nproduce a96 page brochure\ndetailing every show in the\nthree weeks of the festival to\ngive away to the crowds of\ntourists and theatre-goers that\npack the doorway of the ticket\noffice.\nImperial College itself\ncontributes, both to the acting\nside and to the less glamorous\nside of running a theatre for\nthose three weeks. The Dramatic Society operates\nunder the name of Theatre\nWest End, running a venue in\na church hall at the west end\nof Princes Street, overlooked\nby the Castle itself. Since its\ninception in 1983, T WE has\ngrown to become one of the\nlargest venues on the Fringe\nin terms-of the number of\nshows it stages, competing\nwith semi-professional\ncompanies like Tic Toe and\nthe Pleasance Theatre.\nThe Theatre itself consists\nof two auditoria, one in the\nchurch hall itself which seats\n120; and a smaller evening\nvenue downstairs, seating 50,\nconverted from its daytime use\nas a cafe, known as the\nCornerstone.\nAlthough Theatre West End\nexists as a venue for only\nthree weeks, the job of\nrunning it lasts for nearly a year. Just before the end of\nthe autumn term, in\nDecember, the four members\nof the Executive, who have the\ntask of creating the theatre for\nyet another year, have to be\nelected. The Exec consists of\nan Administrator, a Treasurer,\na Technical Co-or d in at or and\na Publicity Officer. The\nAdministrator has the\nunenviable job of negotiating\nthe contract for the rental of\nthe premises, dealing with all\n21 of the individual companies\nwanting to hire slots and on\ntop of that find somewhere to\nlive in Edinburgh for the entire\nstaff. The Treasurer's job is\nfairly self-explanatory \u2014 the\naccountant and signer of the\ncheques. The Technical Coordinator has to organise the\nfitting out of both theatres\nwith lighting, sound and even\nseats. The Publicity Officer's main task is to produce a brochure detailing all the 26\nshows to be performed at\nTWE.\nThe first job of the Exec is\nto produce a prospectus to be\nsent out to the theatre-groups\naround the country who are\nlooking to go to Edinburgh.\nThe selling of slots is\nreinforced by the monthly\nFringe meetings which begin\nin January. Taking place at\nthe Donmar Warehouse in\nCovent Garden, the first two\nare reminiscent of cattle\nmarkets as venue managers\nare paraded before their\npotential sub-lets.\nSoon, after various changes\nas groups drop out and are\nreplaced, the slots are all\nfilled. Once this is done,\ntickets can be ordered and the\ndetails sent off to the Fringe\nOffice to be included amongst\nthe incredible array of groups\nat other theatres in the Fringe\nGuide.\nDuring May, the sub-lets are\nchased up for their brochure\nentries and for their special\ntechnical requirements. Where\nReminiscent of a cattle market\ndo they want the slide\nprojector? How many red\nlanterns?

The aim of the\neditorial was not to criticise\nCarl Burgess, Dave\nKingston or Pete Wilson for\nexpressing their views. I can hardly criticise people\nfor that when I write an\neditorial ever week. My comments were aimed at\nthe whims of a few Union politicos. This essentially\nmeans that if cuts are to be\nmade, its the clubs,\nsocieties and CC Us who have to be cut. The Union has no policy on what\ncriteria should be used to\nmake these cuts. For the\nlast two years transport has\nbeen picked upon as an\neasy target. When you cut\ntransport no club is seen to\nbe savaged so each of the '\nmeans other clubs close.\nThe Union can not be\nexpected to support every\nclub.

    "content": "A Sideways\nLook\nSaturday in August, the van is\nloaded up and driven along\nthe M1 on its way to Scotland.\nMeanwhile, the Exec and the\nstaff, the people who have to\nbuild the theatre out of an\nempty church hall crowd onto\ntrains and coaches to meet\nagain, early on Sunday\nmorning. When they finally\na rive, tired and hungry, there\nare just four days left to\nconstruct both auditoria.\nArchaic verse...to\nmodern farce\nOriginally the hall is just a long empty room, with a pile\nof chairs in one corner. Into\nthis space is built a scaffolding structure to hold\nup all the lanterns to light the\nstage. The chairs themselves\nare taken and nailed down to\nrostra to give three raked tiers\nof seats.\nMeanwhile, for the\nCornerstone, a lighting rig is\ndevised which can be erected\nin les than an hour each night\nafter the cafe closes. Direction\nboards are constructed and\npainted so that people can\nfind the venues which are\ntucked behind the Church\nbuilding itself.\nWork eventually finishes on\nThursday with the first of the\ntechnical rehearsals and the\nfire inspection. Before any\naudiences can be allowed in, a licence has to be obtained\nwhich requires that the teatre\nobeys all the fire regulations.\nThe main problem is that the\nfire officers have another 150\nor so venues to inspect in just\na couple of days. It is quite\nremarkable how such a small\ndepartment can cope with the\nenormous workload.\nAfter all this, shows can\nbegin to be performed at TWE.\nIn all, 26 shows will be staged\nthis year, the same as 1985's total, ranging from the archaic\nverse of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge's 'Rime of the\nAncient Mariner'to the\nmodern farce of Dario Fo's 'Accidental Death of an\nAnarchist'. Most, especially in\nthe first week, will be\nsubjected to the almost\narbitrary hands of reviewers\nhauled in by the Scotsman,\nthe largest daily north of the\nborder, and Radio Forth,\ntogether with cameo\nappearances from Time Out\nand City Limits.\nEventually, with the end of\nAugust, the festival grinds to a halt, and Theatre West End\nmust be emptied in less than\nhalf the time it took to build,\noften with far fewer than the\nset-up \u2014 the 'strike', as it is\nknown, is far less glamorous.\nThe hall is cleared out and\ncleaned up, ticket money\nallocated to the sub-lets and\nthe long process of tidying up\nall the accounts begins; all\nready for the next year.\n(Warning: the opinions\nexpressed herein are not\nnecessarily those of the\nFELIX Editor or of the\nauthor even. This does not\ndetract, however, from the\npossible veracity of the\narguments put forward).\nAt this time of year,\nabounding, as I'm sure\nnobody needs reminding,\nwith exams, a strange\nprocess takes place. While\nwaiting outside exam\nrooms you meet people\nyou've never seen before.\nNo, that's not quite\naccurate. They may have\nbeen glimpsed in the front\nrows of lectures, or found\nin libraries late at night\npouring over problem\nsheets and coursework, but\nthey hardly have a high\nprofile within department,\nhall or club. They might be\nTHE RATIO...\nSo now, with some\nconstructive action being\ntaken on The Ratio by\nCollege, Department and\nUnion alike, will the future\nbe rosy, with a more\ninvolved Union and a better\nsocial life for everyone,\nincluding these faceless\nworkers? As far as the\nsocial life goes, yes, things\nwill definitely get better,\nbut there will be side\neffects. The effect the\nRector hopes to produce\nby increasing the male:to\nfemale ratio is to reduce\nthe amount of beer-swilling\ndebauchery that happens at\nthe moment. This will\nalmost certainly happen,\nand IC's bad reputation will\ndecrease. However, there\nwill be other effects. When\nthese newly involved\n...a better social life for everyone,\nincluding these faceless workers?\nmembers of one or two\nclubs, usually departmental\nclubs like MOP SOC or\nChem Eng Soc, or societies\nlike Wellsoc that demand\nno heavy commitments, but\nthey never spend more\nthan one night a week\naway from work. You find\nthe same people ens cons ed in their rooms, if you ever\nhave the misfortune to take\na questionnaire around a Hall of Residence, sitting at\ntheir desk beavering away.\nYes, these are the people,\nfrequently described as\nboring and apathetic, who\nform an underlying and\nubiquitous foundation to\nthe departments of IC. The\ntr ad ged y of it is that\nhowever much they get\ns lagged off by the rest of\nus for failing to take\nadvantage of the unique\nfacilities available during\ntheir time at College, they\nall do well, get excellent\ndegrees through hard work,\nand find good, if boring,\njobs after. And what do the\nquestionnaires taken round\nto these people show?\nThey slag IC off for\nproviding a lousy social\nlife. The reason they\nsuggest for the bad social\nlife? That much vaunted\nand discussed item:\npeople are social ising, for\nexample, they will not be\ndoing the work they would\nbe without the improved\nsocial atmosphere.\nAs a result of this their\ngrades will suffer, worse\ndegrees will be acquired,\nand the good part of the\nCollege's reputation will\ndecrease as well.\nIs this all so much errant\ntwaddle put together to\nbring a little needless\ncomplexity into your lives,\n< or is there some possible\nevidence for this? The little\nevidence I do have is that\nsingle sex schools seem in\nmany cases to do better\nacademically than coeducational establishments\n(this is particularly true of\ngirls schools), and that the\nsingle sex Oxbridge\nColleges do have excellent\nacademic records. (Philby,\nBurgess and Maclean\nthough came from one of\nthese as well). Pretty weak\nevidence I know, but who\ncan tell? Perhaps a better\nsignature for this article\nwould be a Cassandra, the\nTrojan seer whose\nprophecies, though\naccurate, nobody ever\nbelieved.

A seventy\neight year old ex-rose\ngrower, she was deeply\ncommitted to the peace\nmovement and dared to\nspeak out about what she felt. The Tricycle in\nassociation with The\nSheffield Crucible present\nChris Martin's investigation\ninto the death, and events\nsurrounding the death of\nHilda Murrell.\nThere is no plot in the\nconventional sense, this is\nnot a conventional play.\nKey dates are used to\nstring the various different\naccounts and pieces of\nevidence together. Hilda\nMurrell, her nephew Robert\nGreen( a retired Royal Naval Commander involved\nin intelligence), a reporter,\nMP, police spokesperson, peace campaigner and\nnuclear scientist form the\ncore of the characters\ninvolved. Each speaks out,\nsometimes in the form of a dialogue, sometimes to the\naudience directly. The place and time of each line\nof thought varies but is\ndefined by the character(s) in question. Act1 and most\nof Act2 examines the\nevents surrounding Hilda\nMurrell's death from every\nangle, and details large\namounts of information.\nThe end of Act2 draws\nthe known evidence to a close. This is followed by\nan epilogue where it is\nrevealed that the text of the\nplay, whilst in the care of\nthe Post Office, had been\nopened between sender\nand receiver by some person(s) unknown. This\nparadoxical event serves to\nexpose the 'State' still\nfurther, for the big question\nthat this investigation poses\nis whether or not the death\nof this old lady was a 'State\ncrime'. No fingers are\npointed. Chris Martin\navoids the pitfall of\none sided ness, but then\nwith the evidence to hand,\nno fingers need to be\npointed. The investigation\nis painfully factual and the\naudience is left to decide for itself as to the causes of\nHilda Murrell's death.\nWho killed Hilda Murrell\nis a very important play, it\nraises various questions:\nthe power of Whitehall over\nParliament, the secrecy of\nour society, the basis of\nour democracy. For people\nwho care about these\nthings and what they\nencompass, Who Killed\nHilda'Murrell should be\nseen; Political drama at its\nbest.\nSimon Lewis.\n\u2022Annie Raitt as Hilda Murrell gives a fine performance at The\nTricycle Theatre and captures the fire and passion of this highly\nmotivated lady.\nSociety's Debt.\nThe Almeida Theatre until\nJune 7th Creditors, written in 1888\ndeals with the timeless\nproblems of relationships,\nspecifically those between\nmen and women. The\nhundred years separating\nthe first performance of\nCreditors in a small\nexperimental theatre in\nCopenhagen, and its latest\nrun at the Almeida have no\neffect on the potency and\nease with which the\naudience can relate to\nStringberg's misogynistic\nand confused words.\nSet entirely in the public\nroom of a seaside B&B the\naction falls neatly into three\nscenarios:\nInitially Adolf, a painter\nturned sculptor, is found\nwith the manipulative and\nscheming Gustav,\nsuperficially just another\nguest of the hotel. They spend some time\ndiscussing Adolf's disabilities. His neurosis\nwith regard to his wife\nTekla, who he suspects is\nbeing unfaithful, and her\nunnamed first husband, referred to as being\nsomething of a fool. Gustav\nmanages to convince the\neasily led Adolf that his\nwife is the worst possible\ncure for his physical and\nincreasingly mental\nailments:\n'For a woman, loving\nmeans taking..this woman has eaten your soul, your courage..'\n'I gave and gave and\ngave until I had nothing\nleft..'. Gustav leaves having\ns own the seed of doubt in\nAdolf's mind.\nTek la enters\nunsuspecting, and\ngradually as she and Adolf\ntalk, his jealousy and fear\nabout losing the woman he\n'worships like a god' 'who\nhas destroyed my faith in\nmyself unwinds.\nThroughout this ensuing trauma, Adolf becomes increasingly ambivalent\ntowards his wife as the\nre membre n ce of her feeling\nfor her first husband\nunfolds. Adolf leaves in a rage.\nAs if by some magical\ncoincidence, Tekla's first\nhusband enters, and not\nsurprisingly he and Gustav\nare one and the same! At\nfirst Gustav attempts to\nwoo his ex-wife and\nappears to have genuine\nfeeling for her. However, as\nTekla realises that Adolf's anger has been caused by\nGustav's intervention,\nGustav shows his true self,\nfor he is the Creditor who has come to collect his\ndebt of honour by\ndestroying Adolf and Tekla.\nAdolf has been listening\nthroughout this bout of\nhard truth, and finally he\nstaggers in, pale and\nshaking, collapses and\ndies. Tek la embraces his\nlimp body. Gustav stands\ntrui mph ant. The performance of Ian\nMcDiarmid was particularly\nmemorable. He truly\ncaptures the cynicism s and\nmanipulative qualities of\nGustav.\nCreditors has been\ndescribed by many as\nbeing largely\nautobiographical. Indeed\nthe play's involvement of\ntwo men with one woman bares a striking\nresemble n ce to\nStrindberg's own life.\nCreditors is confusing but\nin a sense it sets out with\nthis end in mind. Ultimately\nrelationships are far from\nsimple. Perhaps Creditors\ndeals with the ambivalence\nof men towards women, Gustav and Adolf represent\nthe two opposite sides of\nthe coin:' I need her to worship\nlike God...I can't live\nwithout something to\nworship.'\nSimon Lewis.\nFELIX Friday 30 May\n\n"

    "content": "But is it good for you?\nIt seems like this year is health\nconsciousness year. The papers are\nfull of fad diets and alternative\nmedicine articles. Every nutritionist\nstresses the need for a healthy diet,\ndaily relaxation and physical fitness.\nSo why does Joe Student ignore\nthis bombardment and continue to\neat those stodgy puddings and jam\ndoughnuts.\nMany people think that healthy\neating means forfeiting all their\nI favourite foods and having to chomp\nion boring or tasteless vegetables.\nOthers disregard healthy food\nbecause they believe it to be difficult\nto prepare and time consuming. It's much easier to open a packet of\ncrisps and a can of cola than to\ncreate your own minestrone soup.\nThe proportions of the different\nkinds of food are very important. A healthy body needs five parts of\ncarbohydrate to one part of protein\nand one of fat. If you upset your\nbalance then you've got no cause to\ncomplain when you keep on getting\nthose recurring colds. As carbohydrates are the principle\nsource of energy it is quite easy to\nsurvive on just a diet of white sugar\nand water but this doesn't keep your tissues healthy and functioning\nproperly. It's much better to derive\nyour energy from the starch in\npotatoes or the natural sugars in\nfruit.\nFor proper functioning of the\nintestines you need fibre. It is\ncomposed of complex w carbohydrates which the body\ncannot digest so that it passes\nthrough the body unchanged, trapping saturated fats, reducing the\nabsorption of cholesterol and\nswelling up in water to give that full\nfeeling. Most refined foods have all\nthe fibre removed so it's essential\nthat you either add bran to your diet\nor start eating whole meal foods.\nFats are completely unnecessary after the first six months of life as a healthy liver produces suffice nt cholesterol for all the body's needs.\nIt is known now that high\nconcentrations of saturated fat in\nthe blood stream are closely\nassociated with heart disease. For\nthis reason the danger foods are\nthose containing animal fats which are mostly saturated. If your diet\ncontains large amounts of fatty\nmeats, butter and cheese then you should think seriously about\nsubstituting margarine for butter,\nolive oil for lard and low fat cheeses for those tasty full-fat soft ones.\nRemember that the secret of healthy\neating is balance and the occasional indulgence is easily corrected in the\ndays that follow.\nWhat you should be!\neating i In October1983 the National\nAdvisory Committee on Nutrition\nEducation( N ACNE) published\nrecommendations for british eating.\nIn a lengthy report it did not suggest\nradical changes in diet but gradual\nmovement away from fat and\ncarbohydrates to a higher-fibre diet\nand smaller portions of the danger\nfoods.\nIt suggested the following\nguidelines for eating:\nFAT You should try to reach a fat\nconsumption of no more than 30%\nof your total calories. That's a target\nof about 90 grams. Only30 grams should be saturated (fats from meat,\npastry, cheese, milk and chocolate).\nSo, no more Mars bars today!\nSUGAR The suggested target is\nabout 20kg per year (which may\nsound an awful lot but the current\nconsumption is around45 kg per\nhead). Try cutting down that white\nsugar in tea and coffee or changing to brown sugar if you feel you can't do without it. Most of the sugar consumed is in manufactured foods\nsuch as baked beans and tinned\nsoups. OTHER CARBOHYDRATES55% of the calorie content of your diet should be contributed by\ncarbohydrates. If you're cutting\ndown on the 'bad' carb s then it\nmeans boosting the ' good' ones such as fruit sugars and starch. So eat more bread, potatoes, fruit and\nvegetables.\nFIBRE Essential. At least 30 grams of\nfibre a day which means lots of\nwhole meal bread and pastas.\nSALT At present Mr Average\nconsumes812 g per day which should be reduced to 5-7g. Friday 30 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Nightline Credits\nDear Hugh, I noticed that Nightline was\n, mentioned in the Union Annual Reports. This year\nhas been a hard one for\nNightline in that I have had\nto constantly campaign to\nsecure its future. This battle has now been won, as the main schools of\nLondon University have\nagreed to contribute to\nNightline at a rate of 30\npence per student. This campaign would not have\nbeen possible without the\nsupport which we received\nfrom the administration of\nImperial College over the\npast year, and I would like\nto take this opportunity to\nthank them. I would also\nlike to thank Pete Wilson i for the active support that\n[| he has given me this year,\nhand I commend him for the\nI enthusiasm which he\n! brought to the post of\n: Welfare Officer.\nNightline has-been saved\nI in order to provide a: service for London' s;i student and I urge every\nI student who reads this to\nI remember that if they\n;: would like some} information or a chat we\ni are only a phone call away.\nI Yours sincerely\nIj Anne Cox\nII Nightline Director\nFELIX Credits\n, Dear Hugh, j Being a student residing at\nSil wood Park Iam very\nj rarely up at South Kensington. As with most\nSil wood residents I have a sense of detachment and sometimes complete isolation from the events\nand happenings up there.\nHowever your FELIX publications have made up\nj for this by being an\nexcellent source of\ninformation on the activities\nof the College, Union or\notherwise.\nI do not think the paper\nhas been 'filled with\nincomprehensible and\n\\ esoteric articles'. Indeed a I great deal of them have\nli been interesting and I' worthwhile to read and1 your editorials have been\n1 cleverly written and to the\n| point. I would therefore like\n1 to congratulate and thank\n| you for your first rate\n|| efforts this year and hope\nyou or your succes or carries on the good work.\nYours\nNeville Bainbridge\nSilwood Park\nps I hope a great many\nstudents have responded to\nthe vindictive criticism\nlevelled at you and others\nby the sabbaticals. Even if\nthe AGM passes the report\nI think it would be a sad\nloss if you were to resign\nfrom your position.\nUFC Attacked\nDear Hugh, I was not surprised by the\nresults of the emergency UFC on Friday, where a general and rather untidy\ntrimming process was\napplied across the board,\nrather than one or two high\nspending clubs being\ndisbanded. Nobody would want to disband clubs and such action is always easy\nto condemn, but difficult to\nsupport. General cutbacks bring their own problems,\nthough, and all clubs have\nsuffered such cuts over the\npast few years. The problem we have now is\nthat most of the dead wood has been removed, and any\nfurther cuts will curtail\nmany clubs' activities. It is\ntime that College realised\nthat having a strong and\n' well funded Union with a large range of activities is\nalmost as important a draw\nfor students as having\ngood, relevant and interesting courses, or\nhaving a more normal male\nto female ratio. The new\nRector has started to act on\nthe latter problems, he\nmust now do something about Union funding, or the\nstrains from lack of funding will severely damage the\nUnion structure. Indeed\nsome of the strife seen\nwithin the Union this year\nmay well be due to the\nopposing factions fighting\neach other for more money,\nwith the Exec caught in the\nmiddle in an impossible postion.\nThere are two other\nthings which may be done by the Union to ease the\nsituation. Firstly, it can make obtaining\nsponsorship by clubs a worthwhile activity, and secondly something should be done about the\nridiculous spending sprees\nthat the MSC' s are\nencouraged to indulge in\nas a result of un spent money reverting to the\nUnion at the end of each year. As we stand at the\nmoment, if a club can gain\nsponsorship, that money will be removed from their\ngrant, so that the Union and not the club benefits.\nThe problem with this is\nthat those working for a club see the time spent\nlooking for money as wasted since they do not\nfinancially benefit in the\nend. A more equitable\nsituation, helping all\ninvolved, would be to take\nonly half the funds raised\nfrom a club's grant, so that\nboth Union and club are\nbetter off. As for the\nclaw back of funds, again\nsome divison of the money left over would act to\nreward those who have\nsaved money rather than\npenal is e them as now occurs. The arrangements\nfor this would have to be\ncarefully tailored to the\nneeds of the particular\nMSC' s, since ACC has\nrather different\narrangements to S CC for\nexample. This process would not be easy to work\nout, but would bring about\nmore encouragements to\nsave money. I would\ntherefore suggest that next\nyear's exec think deeply\nabout such matters over\nthe summer, and, hopefully,\nbe able to propose some plan at the start of next\nyear that is more\nreasonable than the current\nsituation. It should also be\nmade clear to College that\nthe Union is not a body whose funds can be cut\nindefinitely without some serious repercussions for\nthe rest of IC.\nDave Clements\nSCC Misc Clubs Rep\nMy girlfriend's walked out on me.\nI think I'm pregnant.\nI'm locked out.\nWhat's the number of Falmouth Hall?\nI want to change my course.\nWhere's Scanners showing?\nWhat's the number of Victoria Station?\nI'm stranded, are there any late-night buses?\nHow can I get hold of the Health Centre?\nI'd like to be a volunteer.\nI'm lonely.\nWhat's on at Chelsea College tonight?\nWhere's the nearest Barclays Bank?\nMy landlord's hassling me.\nWhere's the nearest all-night chemist?\nAre there any parties at IC tonight?\nI 've taken some pills.\nHello, Nightline, can I help you?

    "content": "Snip,\nUnion Finance Committee has\ndecided on a programme of\ncuts to save \u00a32,650 from the\nproposed Union budgets for\nnext year at a meeting last\nFriday. The cuts are needed\nbecause one Union's proposed\nexpenditure for next year\nexceeded expected income by a substantial amount.\nUFC have:\n\u2022 Cut contingency from \u00a36,000\nto \u00a34,000\n\u2022 \u00a3 3 0 0 0 has to be found from\nthe current transport budget of\n\u00a38000 to contribute to the new\nminibus. This will result in\nincreased hire charges next\nyear.\n\u2022 Cut almost all of the Union's subsidy of alcohol. There will\nbe no subsidy for the\nConstituent College Unions( CC Us) to buy beer, no subsidy for Real AleS oc to buy beer\nand Wine Tasting Soc's subsidy of wine will be cut to 20%. This will save \u00a31500.\n\u2022 Decided the Union should budget for a deficit of \u00a32000\u00a33000 which they hope will be\nmet from increased bookshop income and money un spent at\nthe end of this year,\n\u2022 agreed that Canoe Club should cut its budget by \u00a3650.\n\u2022 Cut the CC Us by \u00a31500. It has\nbeen suggested that most of\nSnip,\nthis money should be raised by\nthe closure of the C CU rifle and\npistol clubs.\n\u2022 Cut the Major SubCommittees( MSC) by \u00a3500. \u00a3150 of which Dave Kingston: 'The meeting\nwent fairly well'\nwill be cut from Recreational\nClubs Committee( RC C), \u00a3100\nwill be cut from Athletics Clubs Committee( ACC) and\nPublications Board and \u00a350 will\nbe cut from the other MSC s. \u2022 Cut the other Union committees (including welfare,\nSnip\nexternal affairs, rag, etc) up to\n\u00a3500.\nIt had been initially suggested that UFC might decide to\ncompletely cut several high\nspending clubs. A number of\nclubs under threat were asked to justify their spending to the\nmeeting. Royal School of Mines Union( R SMU) president Dave\nPearce proposed that yacht,\nballoon and gliding should be\ncio sed. Social Cultural and\nAmusements Board(S CAB) Chairman Nick Shackle y proposed that the meeting\nshould go into closed session while Mr Pearce's proposal was\nbeing discussed. It was finally\ndefeated although the vote was\ndescribed as being fairly close.\nDeputy President Dave\nKingston told FELIX that the\n'meeting went fairly well'. He said that it had adopted the\nmost business like approach of\nany Union meeting this year.\nThe members of UFC went in\nwith the attitude that they had\nto decide there and then where\nthe cuts were to be made.\nRecreational Clubs Committee Chairman Tim Palmer said that the meeting\nwent far better than it could have. 'I was very pleased that\nthey didn't start cutting clubs' he said.\nSecond Time Around\nDepartments have been asked to introduce September res its for second years. In the first\nreport of the Undergraduate\nStudies Committee. The report,\nwhich will be presented to the\nBoard of Studies on June25 th, contains a number of other\nrecommendations for major\nchanges in the way\nundergraduate courses are run.\nThe Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee, which includes\namong its members academics, ICU president Carl Burgess and\nthe C CU A A Os, was set up to\nlook at ways of improving\nundergraduate education.\nThe report says that 'many\nstudents whores it in September after 'failing' their first year\nexaminations, subsequently\nachieve a creditable honours degree. It concludes that the\nlack of second year September res it examinations leads to\nunnecessary failures and also\nwastes students' time.\nEngineering departments\nhave been asked in the report to\nlook at ways of reducing failure\nrates. It recommends the\nengineering departments look at\nways of adopting a course unit\nsystem similar to that adopted\nin many science subjects this\nWould mean that students were\nnot required to pass every\nsingle part of their course.\nThe total work load placed on\na student should be limited to\nabout forty hours a week-according to the report which suggest that organised learning\ntime should be around twenty\nhours and students should be\ndoing about ten to fifteen hours\nof solid work such as writing\nessays.\nOther recommendations of\nthe report include:\n\u2022 The introduction of a certificate of teaching\nexcellence that would be\nawarded annually to not more\nthan 30% of academic staff and\nthat would be an important\nfactor in promotion.\n\u2022 The introduction of courses in\nlearning skills\n\u2022 The introduction of a College wide rating of teaching.\nICU President Carl Burgess de sci bed the report as the best\nthat could be achieved in the\ntime available. ' Some of the\nproposals are fairly radical' he\nsaid 'but they are necessary'. He predicted that there would be a lot of heated discussion at\nBoard of Studies. He hoped,\nthough, that 'reason will win\nout'.\nICU Academic Affairs Officer\nJ Martin Taylor said that the\ncommittee recommendations 'seem like good common sense\nproposals that should have\nbeen adopted years ago.

    "content": "Test Cases\nIn a bid to improve the diets of the\naverage IC student, I picked four\npeople and asked them to list all\nthat they had consumed in the\nprevious 24 hours\nCharles, a first year Physicist\nBreakfast\nOrange\nCornflakes, milk, no\nsugar\n2 pieces of toast with\nmargarine and\nmarmalade\nOne cup of tea.\nLunch\nDinner\nOthers\nMinestrone Soup\nTwo slices of white\nbread.\nOne lamb chop\nRice\nSweetcorn.\n1 packet of crisps\nCan of coke.\nHugh, a fourth year Chemical\nEngineer.\nNo set meal times.\nOlive\nBread and Pate\nPasty\nA Southside pizza\n3 cans of Fosters\n2 pints of Castelmaine\n1 tea\nChris, a first year Computing\nscientist.\nBreakfast\nNone\nLunch\nHam Bap\nDinner\nTwo packets of crisp\n2 pints of Directors.\nDave, a third year Mechanical\nEngineer\nBreakfast\n3 Weetabix and milk\n2 cups of coffee\nLunch\n1 tin of sardines on 2\nslices of toast\n2 oranges\nDinner\n1/4 lb cheeseburger\nand chips\n1/2 packet of crackers\n1 tomato juice and\nWorcester sauce\n1 pint of Guinness.\nMy first reaction was how on earth\ndoes Chris survive? Secondly it\nconfirmed all my fears about IC's average consumption. Charles diet\nis reasonable. He has 3 square\nmeals a day but it's high in\ncarbohydrates and low in fibre. He\nneeds to substitute a good\nwhole meal bread for that white stuff\nand perhaps a high fibre cereal\ninstead of cornflakes. Minestrone\nsoup has a high sugar content as\ndoes tinned sweet corn and that can\nof coke. His fat intake, though, is\nfine as he uses margarine and has\nabout half a pint of milk.\nHugh's diet, however, is sadly\nlacking in most of the essentials.\nPate and cheese are both high in\nsaturated fats as is the pastry in the\npasty. Biscuits and bread are high in\ncarbohydrates and contain little\nfibre and that pizza, although\ntopped with various vegetables,\nprovides very little nutrients in\nproportion to the number of calories\nit contains. The average adult\nshould consume one pint of beer a day but Hugh has far exceeded this.\nTheir is no nutrition in a can of\nFosters but loads of lovely calories\nand that alcohol overworks the liver.\nMy advice to Hugh is to think about\nwhat he is eating and not to treat\neverything he consumes as a convenient filler. He needs to eat at\nleast a piece of fruit a day and a good helping of greens which are\ngood sources of riboflavin, folic\nacid, and iron, magnesium and\ncalcium. As with Charles, he needs\nto boost his fibre intake. You must\nhave bad bowel problems Hugh! If\ntime is money then bread, rice and\npasta all contain certain amounts of\nfibre. Cut down on the fast foods\nand alcohol and if the nearest food\nis in the Union Bar then nothings\nbetter than a packet of peanuts for\nadded protein.\nThere's little I can say about\nChris' diet the only protein has been\nderived from the ham in the bap. He\nneeds more fruit, vegetables, breads,\ncereals, fish, nuts, and poultry\nbecause he's lacking fibre, vitamins\nA,B,C, and D, iron and trace\nminerals such as magnesium and\npotassium.\nDave's diet has to be one of the\nbest (for a student). His fibre is\nderived from the Weetabix, toast and\ncrackers, his vitamins from the fruit\njuice, oranges and fishes, his protein\nfrom the sardines and burger and\niron in his Guinness. The only bad\npoint is the lack of vegetables and\nthose chips with his cheeseburger.\nDeep fat fried food is definitely out!.\nAll of these diets show that a busy\nSouthside student relies heavily on\neasy-to-prepare or fast food.\nPerhaps this is a case for better\nkitchen facilities? Even so, this is no\nexcuse for the unhealthy diets\nprevalent at this college.\nHere's how my hypothetical,\nstudent would eat.\nBreakfast\nBran flakes, sultanas\nand milk\nWholemeal toast and\nmagar in e One cup of tea.\nBaked potato and\ncottage cheese\nServing of raw\nmushroom or peppers\nOne cup of coffee or\napple juice.\nChilli pot (see recipe)\nFruit or yogurt\nFruit juice\nPeanuts\nOat crunch ie bar.\nLunch\nDinner\nSnacks\nChilli Pot (serves 1)\nCalories 310\nPreparation 5 mins\nCooking 45 mins.\nContains red kidney beans which\nare extremely high in fibre and very\nlow in fat. Both beef and beans\ncontain a variety of B Vitamins.\nIngredients\n1 small onion, chopped finely\n4oz lean minced beef\nGarlic to taste\n1 teaspoon chilli power or to taste\n3 teaspoons tomato puree\n4fl oz chicken stock\n2 chopped tomatoes\nchopped green pepper\npepper, to taste\n1 can of red kidney beans rinsed and |\ndrained\nMethod\nPlace the onion and minced beef in\na saucepan over medium heat and\ncook without adding extra fat until\nevenly browned. Add garlic chilli,\ntomato puree, stock, tomatoes,\npepper and green pepper. Bring to\nboil, cover and simmer for 35 mins\nAdd beans and cook for a further 5\nminutes.\nHealthy cooking isn't just a matter\nof using fresh, nutritious foods but '\nhow you cook them as well.\nBoiling Destroys vitamins and\nminerals such as B Complex and\nVitamin C. Frying Adds fat in most cases. The j best form is stir-frying which\ncombines steaming and frying. A j small amount of oil is heated\nintensely before pieces of chopped\nfood are added. This seals the food\nquickly and reduces the loss of\nvitamins and minerals.\nRoasting Particularly healthy as it\ndoesn't require additional fat. Always\ncover with foil to retain the moisture.\nSteaming Healthiest way of\npreparing fish and vegetables with\nlittle vitamin loss.\nMicrowave The shorter cooking time!\npreserves more of the vitamins and j reheated food loses fewer minerals.\nGood food can be tasty and quick tol\nprepare. All it takes is a little bit of\nthought and planning. Just\nremember that balance is essential\nand that you can still eat all those\nthings you really like in moderation.\nTake pleasure in what you eat but\nalways ask: It is good for you?\nFELIX Friday 30 May\n\n"

    "content": "I Eight Outstanding\nEight research subjects at\nImperial College are rated\nas outstanding by the\nUniversity Grants Committee. The University\nGrants Committee made\ntheir assessment as part of\ntheir process for fixing the\ngrants to be given to\nUniversities. The subjects\nrated as outstanding were\nBiochemistry, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics,\nComputer Science Chemical Engineering, Civil\nEngineering and Mechanical, Aeronautical and Production Engineering. Pure and\nApplied Biology, Electrical\nEngineering, Metalurgy and Management Science were\nrated as better than\naverage. Geology, Mineral Engineering and the\nresearch centres were rated\nas average. Humanities\nwere rated below average.\nThe UGC sent a detailed\nletter to all universities on\nTuesday night explaining\nhow they assessed the\nUniversity's grant. Included\nin the letter is an\nassessment of each department. This is based\non quality of research and\nthe amount of money the\ndepartment receives from\noutside the university\nsystem to support. It gives\nno indication of the quality\nof teaching.\nPro Rector Prof Alan Swanson told FELIX yesterday that the letter\ngiving details of our\nresearch rating and the\nearlier letter giving details\nof a1.3% rise in grant in\ncash terms (see last week's FELIX) meant the outlook\nwas not as bad as it might\nhave been. He said, though, the outlook was as bad as\nthe College had expected.\nThe College would, he said,\nlook for money from\noutside. This would be\nhelped by the high rating\ngiven to our research. It\nwould mean, though, that\nacademics would be\nrestricted to do the work\nthat their sponsors wanted\nthem to do.\nUnion President Carl Burgess said the below\naverage rating for the\nHumanities Department\nshowed there was\ninsufficient provision for\nhumanities.\nGotcha!\nThe victim of a callous criminal.\nUnion Hon Sec Quentin\nFontana had his teddy bear\nkidnapped on Sunday by a dangerous masked raider.\nThe teddy bear was held to\nransom by Rag. Mr Fontana told FELIX on Wednesday that he was\nvery upset by the kidnap.\nHe said that it had meant\nhe 'didn't have anything to\nsnuggle up to'. He said that\nhe had asked the masked raider into his room to give\nher coffee. He admitted\nthat although he didn't have any kidnap insurance\nhe paid the ransom i because he had to save\nteddy. He said he was so\nupset that he went to the\nCharles Wells brewery on\nTuesday to get 'pissed'.\nThe masked raider told\nFELIX that Mr Fontana had\npaid the ransom. She said\nthat she realised that Mr Fontana was attached to\nhis teddy when she saw\nhim 'sulking when ever\nChristine hit his head\nagainst the wall' so she\ndecided to kidnap it.\nIt is understood the teddy\nwas returned to Mr Fontana\nat 6 pm on Wednesday evening.\nClean-Up\nUnion Officers are worried\nthat the Union may have to\ntake resp on sibi l ty for the\ncleaning of the Union Building. At present\nCollege organise the\ncleaning of the whole of\nthe College centrally.\nCollege plan, though, to\nmake each department\nresponsible for organising its cleaning. The Union feel\nthat it would have problems\ndoing this and will ask the\nCollege personnel section\nnext week to exempt them\nfrom the new plan.\nWinners\nThe rag raffle for a guaranteed place in Hall\nwas won by ticket number432. The winner should go\nand see Student Services\nas soon as possible. Ticket\nnumber 806 won a meal for\ntwo. Ticket number804 won a haircut as did 133.\nTicket number63 won a2lb box of chocolates. All these\nprize winners should go to\nthe Union Office to collect\ntheir prize.\nASTMS\nSay No\nA group is being set up at\nImperial to collate and\nexchange information on\nthe Starwars program. The group will consist of the\nelectronics for peace\ngroup, the computing and social responsibility group and other interested parties\nin and outside of College. The group is being\norganised by John Fe camp the ASTM S( Association of\nScientific.Technical and Managerial Staff)\nrepresentative at Imperial\nMr Fe camp hopes that the\ngroup will provide\ninformation to enable\n'those with a political\npunch' to ask appropriate\nques it ions in Parliament.\nThe move follows the\nASTM S decision on the\n12th of May to campaign against Star Wars research\ncontracts, on the grounds that the money would be\nbetter spent elsewhere, and the SDI is likely to provoke\na Soviet first strike.\nGrounds Will\nBe OK\nWork on the extraction of\ngravel from the College's sports ground at Harlington\nis set to start as soon as\nthe cricket season has\nended. At the last meeting\nof Athletics Ground Committee College Groundsman Mick Reynolds presented plans\nfor pitches during the work.\nUnion representatives said\nthat they were more than\nsatisfied with the plans.\nThey said there were\nenough pitch s for the\nUnion's needs. Union Hon Sec Quentin Fontana said\nthat in addition the work\nwas likely to improve the\nquality of the pitch s.

As the article later\nsuggested, WBC originate\nfrom precursor stem cells\nin the bone marrow.\nUnfortunately this was not\nthe only example of\nmisleading journalism.\nCure versus vaccine? At\nthe present time trie\nadvances being made tend\nto suggest that a cure is\nthe more probable of the\ntwo. Various drugs that\ninhibit an enzyme (Reverse\nTranscriptase) specific to\nthe AIDS virus which is not\nutilised by the human\nmetabolism are undergoing\ntrials. However, it is very\nimportant to be aware that\na miracle cure is unlikely in\nthe near future.\nGovernment spending on\nAIDS and all its related\nproblems is minimal. One\npage advertisements in the\nnational press warning of\nthe danger of AIDS are not\ngoing to save lives.\nAlthough no figures exist,\na virulent strain of the virus\ncausing AIDS (HTLV III)\nhas claimed the lives of\nlarge numbers of men and\nwomen in central Africa .\nSince the virus is thought\nto have originated in this\narea of the world, it is likely\nthat the growth of spread\nof the disease is more\nadvanced than in the UK or\nthe USA. That could mean\nthat millions are infected.\nToo often articles on AIDS\nforget the Southern\nHemisphere.\nThe most well-informed\ngroup dealing with AIDS in\nthis country is the Terrence\nHiggins Trust (THT). The\nTHT was set up to: 'inform,\nadvise and help on AIDS'.\nAt the present time the\nTHT suggests the following\ndata: Between 20,000 and\n50,000 people are infected\nwith the AIDS virus in the\nUK. The number in the\nUSA is thought to be close\nto 2 million. 10 to 15% of\nthose infected go onto\ndevelop AIDS, and of these,\nclose on 100% die. 15% of\nthose infected suffer from\nAIDS related symptoms.\nThe remaining 70% are\nalive and well. This\ninformation raises three\nimportant points:\nFirstly, whether or not all\nthose infected are aware of\nthe fact and are taking\nnecessary precautions to\nprevent spread of the AIDS\nvirus.\nSecondly, how\nmeaningful any application\nof statistics can be when\nthe sample number is so\nsmall and thought to be so\nnon-random is ed. How\nmany married homosexual\nmen, bisexual men or men\n'secretly' practicing\nhomosexual acts are\ninfected?\nThirdly, the emotional\nsuffering of those people\nwho have been tested for\nthe presence of antibodies\nto the AIDS virus and are\npositive (infected), but are,\nto all intents and purposes,\nfit and well physically. Even\nif the percentage of these\npeople who go on to\ndevelop AIDS is small,\nthere is no way at the\npresent time that an\nindividual can know if s/ he\nwill fall within that group or\nnot. Living with this as a possible prospect has\nresulted in a great deal of\ntrauma.\nThe latest twist in the\ncomplexity of the AIDS\nviral infection is the\nrelatively new\nobservation/symptom of\ndementia and other brain\ndisease. How long does\nthis take to occur, and what\npercentage of pe op e will it\naffect?\nThe above deals with\nonly a fraction of the\nproblems AIDS has\nbrought.

    "content": "For the past eight years,\nTrevor Nunn has been\nartistic director of the\nRoyal Shakespeare company. It should come as no surprise therefore\nthat his first major feature\nfilm is full of some of this\ncountry's finest actors and actresses.\nThe film is set against a background of the\nReformation when a large\nnumber of individuals had\nacquired wealth and\nproperty by removing\nRoman Catholic monks i from their monasteries and were hence anxious to\nprevent the throne\nreturning to a Roman Catholic. To achieve this\nthe Duke of\nNorthumberland arranges\nfor the quiet scholarly Lady' Jane Grey to su cee d the\n' dying Edward VI and for\nher to marry his son, the\nI libertine Lord Guilford. The resulting piece is a| mixture between a well\ni illustrated history lesson\nI and a discourse on the\n] relationship between power\nand evil and a romance, and as such su cee ds rather\nwell on all levels. The nature of the relationships\nI requires some i concentration early on, but\nthe story is pretty straightforward after that, and the\nacting and the choice of\nlocations are excellent.\nSome of the humanist\nI tendencies of the young| couples are a bit labour ed, but ultimately it's a very\nenjoyable piece of\nentertainment.\nWhilst on the subject of\ntheatre, I'd like to mention\nthe marvellous The\nLightship. It's setting has\nthe same limited number of\nscenes as a play and it is\nthis claustrophobia that\ngives this film a lot of it's power.\nRobert Duvall plays the\nleader of a group of three\ncriminals who come to be\nstranded on Klaus Maria\nBrandauer'slight ship. There then ensues a battle\nof wits between the\nbrilliantly evil Robert Duvall\nand the pacifist captain.\nInitially the story contains a more detailed analysis of\nthe reasons for the\nbehaviour of the two\nprotagonists and the\nquestions thus prompted\nbut director Jerzy Skol mow ski has shrewdly\ndecided to concentrate on\nthe suspense and has\nmanaged to produce a very\ntense thriller without\nsacrificing depth of\ncharacter is ation. I didn't breathe properly for one\nand half hours; highly\nrecommended. Having mentioned the\nsecond best of this weeks films I may as well mention\nthe best, After Hours. It is a wonderfully imaginative\ncomedy about a computer programmer's disastrous\nnight out in Soho. Paul\n(Griffin Dunne, last seen in\nvarying states of decay in\nAmerican Werewolf in\nLondon) meets the\nattractive but distracted\nMarcy in a coffee bar one evening. She gives him a friends's number and when he pets home he decides to\ntry and contact her again. This leads him to a nightmare journey through downtown Soho when everything (and I mean everything) goes wrong. At\none point when he is being\nchased by a mob he sees a killing through a bedroom window and and comments 'They'll probably blame me\nfor that too'.\nDirector Martin Scorsese launches the audience straight into the breakneck\npace right from the\nopening shot, and then\ngoes on to make even the\nmost innocuous bunch of\nkeys a fearful object. The most imaginative and\nenjoyable film I have seen\nfor a long time; wonderful.\n'My Mom told me never\nto do this': C Thomas Howell's first line when he\npicks up The Hitcher,\nRutger Hauer. Believe me\nhis mum was right. Rutger\nHauer (in grave danger of\nbeing typecast) turns out to\nbe an Angel of Death who goes around killing people\n(as Angels of Death are\nwont to doI suppose) and\nasks our hero, Jim to help\nhim. Jim is then\nconsistently framed for all\nthe evil deeds and has a hard time escaping the\nauthorities and tracking\ndown the evil John Ryder( Mr Hauer), at the same time.\nIt's actually a very good film, and a debut worthy of\ncomparison with\nSpielberg's Duel, with\nsome superb photography,\nfrom John Searle who filmed Witness and some car chases that are not all\nboring. Worth a visit if\nyou've seen the other films\nmentioned so far.\nIn the 19th Century,\nanatomists were only\nallowed to work on the\nbodies of hanged\nmurderers. Therefore the\ndedicated Dr Thomas Rock, who felt that the end\njustified the means in the\nquest for knowledge, paid\nmoney for corpses, the\nfresher the better, leading\nFallen and Broom to\nmurder people to earn a comparatively comfortable\nliving.\nDoctor and the Devils is\ndirected by Freddie Francis\nwho was the cinema photographer on Elephant\nMan and Dune but who also directed a large\nnumber of Hammer Horror\nfilms. This background is\nunfortunately evident in\nthis latest film, and though\nit does improve it's difficult\nto shake off this initial\nreaction.\nJonathan Pryce and\nStephen Re a come across as a bit of a comedy duo as\nFallen and Broom and the\nfilm fails to address itself to\nDr Rock's obvious moral\ndilemma. Perhaps the\noriginal book by Dylan\nThomas is better.\nJim Clayden.\nFELIX\nFriday 30 May\nA Marriage\nOf\nConvenience\n\n"

    "content": "The Week In Science\nTime Out Meets Tomorrow's World\nSkills In Action\nThe City and Guilds of London Institute has an exhibition\nentitled Skills In Action at the Science Museum, running\nuntil 1 June.\nCity and Guilds, as well as its involvement with IC, also\nprovides curricula, examinations and qualifications to set\nstandards of knowledge and skills for trainees in jobs in\nindustry, commerce and the public services. City and\nGuilds courses and certificates cover technologies from\nagriculture, catering, construction, electrical and\nelectronic, mechanical and maintenance engineering, to\nvehicle and many other personal and scientific services.\nThe exhibition at the Science Museum aims to\ndemonstrate the range of industrial skills and technologies\non offer from C&G. Starting on the ground\nfloor, the exhibition kicks\noff with a massive bank of\nbuttons to press, a paradise\nfor schoolchildren. The buttons activate a computer screen, which gives\ninformation about the\ncourses and qualifications\nthat C&G offers. Also on the ground floor is a Prestel simulation\ncontaining the 60 pages of\ntele text that C&G has maintained for over three\nyears. These frames have\nbeen stacked on computer disc, so the possibility of\nschool kids, or IC students,\nrunning up massive\nScience Museum telephone\nbil s is eliminated.\nPick up a guide at the\nground floor stand, and this\nwill lead you to the first\nfloor exhibits. First are an\nindustrial lathe, and a desktop robot, being operated\nby students from the\nCrawley Training\nAssociation. The seven-axis\nrobot, called Neptune 2, is\ncontrolled by a BBC computer with a connection to the parallel\ninterface. This enables the\nrobot to be addressed as if\nit is part of the computer memory. Each axis of the\nrobot is controlled through\na rack-and-pinion system\nby double hydraulic\ncylinders containing water.\nComplementary to Neptune\n2 is a scaled down simulator, used for\nteaching. Users can guide\nthe robot arm,and movements are recorded\ndigitally by the computer.\nThe industrial applications\nare in paint-spraying and spot welding, but the\nscaled down version is\nshown packing eggs into\ncartons.\nNext is a video recorder\nassembly and repair\ndemonstration.\nRepresentatives from\nSouthgate Technical College and Radio Rentals\nstaff a display showing adjustments and fault\nlocation in modern video\nmachines.\nWeaving doesn't sound a very modern or high-tech\nactivity, but it is a very\norderly craft, which lends\nitself well to numerical\ncontrol by computer. As each weft thread is woven\nit must go over and under\nthe warp according to the\ndesigner's plan. The instructions to go over and under can be held in a computer memory, freeing\nthe designer from the\ntedium of the present\nmanual method. In the\ndemonstration, weavers\nfrom the London College of\nFurniture make up designs on the screen of a BBC micro, and then sample\nthem as cloth\u2014the micro\ncontrols the shafts on the\nloom for each pass of the\nthread. Designs can be\nchanged at the push of a button and, once the*\ndesigner has it right, the\nprogram can be sent to\nhigh-speed looms for full-scale production.\nOn the second floor, the\nmajor attraction is the\nelectronic composition and laser printing display by the\nRank Xerox information\ntechnology centre. The workstation combines word processor, typesetter\nand graphic layout artist,\nclaims Rank. Documents are created on a double page, high-resolution\nscreen controlled by\nkeyboard and a mouse^ a pointing device that allows\nthe user to move a point on the screen to pull down menus, draw figures, shade areas, etc. The workstation\nThe Neptune 2 in action\nis connected to a laser\nprinter, capable of\nproducing12 pages a minute, with a resolution of\n90,000 points to the square\ninch. Demonstrating the\nsystem are students from\nthe Rank Xerox information\ntechnology centre in\nSlough, where 16-18 year\nolds on Youth Training\nSchemes and disabled\nadults acquire IT Skills,\nleading to a C&G qualifications.\nSkills in action runs until 1\nJune, and then from 20\nOctober until 2 November at the Science Museum, open10 am to 5 pm Md n day to Saturday and2.30 pm to\n5 pm Sunday.
