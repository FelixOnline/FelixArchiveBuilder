If You Tolerate Shut Up!\nSo, what the hell Is happening In the music world this year? Felix took time out over the holidays and did some research into what's getting released and who's releasing it. Some of the big guns are getting their act together and the rest are ready to assault the shelves of your local record store. Let's have a look, shall we....\nT he best way to do this is probably in alphabetical order. So, let's cut out all the musical ba nter and get on with it. Take a deep breath....\nBeck is set to release his follow-up to Mutations\nsomewhere around June/July. Those not keen on Mutations because it appeared to be a 'scrapbook of patchy\nsongs written before his next major release' will be looking for a return to the fresh, innovative and slightly\neccentric Beck.\nBellatrlx are one of the new kids on the block. You'll\nfind a review of their eponymous ly titled mini-album in\nthis issue of Felix. They're from Iceland, they're made up almost entirely of women and hopefully they'll\ncome good in 1999. Thank God some record executive\nhas gone to Iceland!\nBentley Rhythm Ace will release their next album sometime in March. They don't have a title for it as yet.\nIn fact, they don't even have a working title. A few tracks have been named Am I Black Country Enough\nFor You?and Duck-web and Fish-lip. Strange pair of boys,\nthey are! Apparently, there are some interesting collaborations but that's all being kept a bit hush-hush.\nThe Beta Band are in the studio now. Expectations\nrun high with this band after the ' underground' success\nof their Three EPs compilation. In particular The Patty\nPatty Sound EP. which was championed by our own student radio station, ICRadio, caused a comfortable stir\namongst the listening masses. Their debut album is\nnearing completion and should be out in the first half\nof the year.\nBeth Orton's lovely single, Someone's Daughter\nand her guest vocals on The Chemical Brothers' Dig Your\nOwn Hole album helped to raise her profile in 1998.\nLet's hope she progresses further in 1999. Her new album features collaborations with Everything But The\nGirl's Ben Wyatt and Ben Harper. For those that liked\nTrailer Park, this album, Central Reservation, will be right up your street. She describes it as 'an extension\nof the first album, a refinement of that sound.' Bubble-gum pop artists Bis will release their next\nalbum next month. It's called Social Dancing and it looks\nas if the single Action and Drama will precede it. Expect\nthe same as usual from this lot. You either like it or you don't by now. BJork seems to be keeping herself busy during the first half of'99. She's releasing an album of love songs,\nof which some may be covers. She's also starring in and writing the soundtrack to the musical Dancer In The\nDark, which is on general release next year. She's also\nrecorded an EP with Digital Hardcore's Alec Empire. In\nthe midst of all this, she's hoping to start work on her\nfourth album proper. It's not easy being a popstar, you know. Blur are back in business on March1 with a new seven-minute-plus single. It's called Tender and will pre-cede their as yet untitled sixth studio album, which appears in the shops in the same month. This is their\nfirst release in over a year so all I can say is that it's about\nbloody time.\nThose cheeky Liverpudlians, Cast, return to the music scene after being away for just over a year with\ntheir new album. Midget Allah. It should be released\naround April. Track titles are typically in the John Power\nvein. Chasing The Day, Dreamer. one could goon. In fact, if you take the words dream, free, soul, shine,\nstar, away and day and construct a phrase of some sort,\nyou're well on the way to naming a Cast song. Seriously\nthough, it's the music that counts and I'm sure the v 'll\nbe pleasing punters at venues all over the country\nafter the release of Midget Allah.\nthrough the success of Mulder and Scully and Road Rage, last year saw the rise and rise of a female-fronted Welsh band that went b v the name of Catatonia. The photo-ability of one Cerys Matthews might have\nbeen a factor but you can't argue with the fact that they\nmanaged to shift shed-loads of units last year. Their new album will appear in late May or early April. There's no title to it as yet. How about Regional Cotton? [drum fill]\nAfter releasing their greatest hits under the name of Melting Pot, '98 seemed to be a bit quiet for The Charlatans. They should be releasing an album this year but\nno details are available as yet. This will be their first\nalbum without the sorely missed late keyboardist Rob\nCollins. I'm expecting The Charlatans to record an absolute be lter of a rock 'n 'roll record this year. Ihop eI'm right.\nThe private psychedelic brothers of the dance scene are set to let their long-player hit record shops across the nation around early summertime. The Chem ical Brothers' third album proper goes by the name of\nUnder The Influence Of Love. Apparently Noel Gallagher, the godfather of popular rock, will make another\nguest vocal to go with his last effort. Setting Sun. Unfortunately, Beth Orton will not be able to contribute\nbecause she's doing her own album.[ See above] Tsk!\nPop-stars today! They're so selfish! However, Jonathon\nDonahue, vocalist with current indie-fave s Mercury Rev, will be grabbing the microphone for one of the\ntracks. Under The Influence Of Love looks set to be one of the more promising releases of1999. Talking of collaborations, Death In Vegas have\nmanaged to drag in a few names off the street to guest\non their latest offering to the world, The Cantino Sessions. There's Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and age-old warbler Iggy Pop. There's also others that they've\napproached but they're not saying. Record contracts and\nall that nonsense! For the record, it should be out in a couple of months. There's no real album news on newcomers Gay\nDad. However, their debut single To Earth With Love has\nbeen pleasing the heterosexual and homosexual masses alike. I mention them only as a' one to watch\nout for this year.' Silly silly name! Felix Album of the Year winners, Gomez, will be bringing it on for a second time about halfway through\n'99 with Cod's Big Spaceship (working title.) It'll be very\ninteresting to see what they come up with. Their first\nalbum was( partly) recorded in Oily Peacock's garage\nand that sounded innovative ly quirky. God knows what\nthey'll do with a24 track studio and some highly paid\nknowledgable producer ready to cater to their sonic\nneeds. This year can only sec them rise further. Good luck to the boys from ll k ley! Still squabbling over the title of the follow-up to\nDrawn To The Deep End, Gene will release their next\nalbum in February. Despite being proud of Drawn To\nThe Deep End, Martin Rossiter is reported to have\nbeen a bit disappointed with it: 'We just took too long\nmaking it. So this one we just sat down and did it in a month this one is a more optimistic, younger album.'\nJames' Best Of. compilation became one of last\nyear's biggest sellers. This year, Tim Booth and the rest\nshould be recording a new album and releasing it\nbefore the year is out.\nMuch maligned by the music press (probably\nbecause of Crispin's middle-class background) Kula\nShaker are back this year and will release their second album in March. It will be preceded by the single Mystical Machine Gun at the end of February. For the album, they've got Homo mGo wash warm i back to do some more vocals. He did the backing vocals for\nGovinda, by the way. Expect the usual eclectic gu bb in s and various mystic chants. They seem to be suffering\nfrom the same disease as most artists in that they can't decide on an album title. They have the working title\nof Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts but it might not catch\non. How about K2? [drum fill]\nLeftfield have taken their time to followup their\ngroundbreaking and multi-unit shifting Leftism. A release date for the electro people is set for April.\nHowever, they've been threatening to release this their\nsecond album for along time now. Let's hope we get\nsome creative stuff from them this year.\nIndie favourites Mo gwa i will be releasing their seco nd album in March. It has what I think could be a solid\ncontender for Album Title Of The Year: Come On, Die\nYoung. Hopefully, it'll live up to the expectation of the title. Certain quarters of the band have described it as\na' bedroom Mo gad on whitey gay disco funk opera sound' Easy to define, it is not. Interesting to listen to,\nit probably will be. There will be new material from New Order this\nyear once people have finished their side projects,\nwhich include Electronic, Monaco and The Other Two.\nThere will also be a box set of singles being released.\nThat should look nice on my shelf alongside my Mas sive Attack and Nirvana singles box sets.\nLast year, Noel Gallagher said on radio something to the effect of, 'There will be no new Oasis material\nuntil the year 2000.' Well, true to his word, Oasis look\nset to release a single in September with an album rapidly snapping at the heels of it. He also said that what\nhe does write will be different from anything that has\ngone before. It's obviously this side of his prediction that\nhe's concentrating on! Mentioning a big one like Oasis, I feel duty bound to mention a less large band that are worthy of at ten tion. One Lady Owner cut through the music scene with\ntheir turbo charged and fully revved up debut single,\nWheelkings 19/3. The next and current single, I Do\nNeed You, shows a lighter side. It'll be a crime if we don't get to see an album released from this lot this\nyear.\nThose orchestral trance-y types in Orbital are back\nwith some new music after releasing a Greatest Hits\npackage at the back end of last year. Paul Hartnoll has\nsaid, 'We're calling it Middle Of Nowhere because it's a hard place to be. Everywhere is somewhere, no matter where you're standing and no matter how hard you try to get away from things.' There will be a single in\nMarch and a tour to follow.\nOver in the US, Pavement are gearing up for the release of their latest offering in April. It's being prod u ced by Nigel Godrich, he of Radiohead fame. In fact,\nJonny Greenwood may even play on it. Steven Mal km us gave his view on the album: 'The sound of the album so far is something we're calling Trip Metal but with the\nusual Pavement vibe to it.' Look forward to some experimental stuff!\nRumours are abound that Primal Scream are recording their next album, the follow up to the critically\nacclaimed Vanishing Point. Nothing firm has been reported, just yet, though. The Propellerheads are also rumoured to be following up Decksanddrumsandrockandroll later on in the\nyear.\nAfter hanging out in LA with people like Money Mark and Ben Stiller, Reef have almost finished their fol-low-up to Glow. The album has the working title Reef\nOn A Fresh Tip but is likely to change. There should be a single out from it in February and then the album in\nMarch. An extensive tour is probably on the cards as\nthey tend to tour like proverbial bastards.\nAfter a while away from the musical limelight The\nSeahorses will return and release an album in the sum mer. It's either going to be called Minus Blue or Motorcade. According to John Squire, the ratio of songwriting\nwith respect to himself and Chris Hcl me is still roughly\nthe same as it was before. Recording of the album will\nactually start this month although a lot of the songs have\nbeen tried and tested in front of live audiences so concert goers should recognise some of them. Tracks so\nfar include Petroleum, Pi, Dolphins, Into The Light,\nPacific Blue and Tomb Raid.\nThe Stereophonies will release the follow-up to their debut Word Gets Around. Entitled Performance\nand Cocktails, it promises to be a raucous rock and roll\naffair. For the record, it hits the shelves at the start of March. The Super Furry Animals will release their third\nalbum proper early in the summer. Their collection of oddities, Outspaced, is in the shops now and has been received very well, critically and amongst the fans.\nThere should be a single out in April to coincide with\nthe tour. They haven't managed to decide on a title yet\nso I guess the 'Animals Don't Give A you get the\npicture.\nFeeling like they rushed things a bit last time,\nSupergrass do not want to make the same mistake\nagain. They're taking all the time they need to make sure everything'show they want it. The album known as Cocked should be ready for release in the summer. Confirmed track titles are as follows: Out Of The Blue,\nPumping On the Stereo and What Went Wrong In Your\nHead? Danny Goffey's commitments to Lodger will\nobviously be taking a back scat this year as the 'Grass\nwill probably want to canvas the UK with a massive sellout tour.\nfj\nBrett Anderson and the boys have a new album recorded and ready for release in February. In comparison to Coming Up, certain quarters of the band have\ndescribed the sound as 'not as poppy. It's probably\ncolder sounding and a bit harder-edged. It's very var-i ed, much more than anything we' ve ever done.' The\nSuede crew have teamed up with Steve Osborne( Paul\nOak enfold's remix partner) for the production. The\nalbum looks set to be a raw and Trash-y affair. Forgive\nthe pun! I ran Healy and the motley crew should be kicking\noff a new set of tours in 1999. They've almost finished\ntheir second album which has the working title Final\nTimes but will not be officially released under that\nname. Travis have opted for Mike Hedges and Nigel\nGod rich[ Sec Pavement] to produce. Set to hit the music shops in May, a few tracks have confirmed titles: Why Does It Always Rain On Me? Flowers In Fhc\nWindow and As You Are. Hardly All I Wanna Do Is Rock,\nis it?\nWhen you're scanning through the AZ of Rock/Pop\nin your HMV/ Our Price/Virgin you'll be pleased to know that in March when you get near the end of the aisle\nUnderworld will have a new record out. The reason that\nthey haven't really been hanging round these parts\nlately is that they wanted to take some time out and get\nsome perspective after the Born Slippy explosion. Entitled Beaucoup fish, it's likely to be a tighter album than\nSecond Toughest In The Infants.\nWell that seems to be your lot. I'm sure there's plenty more stuff out there. Keep your eyes on Felix for\nany new hotshots. If you would like to review music for\nFelix, come along to the meetings at Felix on Fridays.\nThings usually kick off at around one-thirty but it's best\nto be there a few minutes beforehand. I look forward\nto seeing the old faces and some new ones. Thank you for your time.\nDennis\n\n"

    "content": "News 11 January 1999\nBeer Fest Foiled\nExtensive union effort has all been to no avail as the Beer Fest is still homeless and now apparently cancelled. Due to the disruption it would cause, the event was refused its usual venue the JCR, and has\nbeen in trouble ever since. Union President Dave Hellard attempted to salvage\nthe situation, proposing the Southside\ngym as possible premises to stage the event.\nUnfortunately this suggestion has\nbeen refused by college, as it was assessed to be \"inappropriate due to\nfire regulations to have a beer fest lasting two or three days\" according to Chief\nSecurity Officer Ken Weir. The beer fest\nhas been organised for RAG by the RCSU\nBy Andrew Ofori\nvice president for Clubs and Ents Bob Walker. The Head of Catering and Con ference Services, John Foster, supplied a wealth of explanations as to why the\ngym proposal was a non-starter. Looking\npast the fact that the venue was grossly\nundersized, he explained there existed\n\"a number of sensitive issues concerning\n[Southside's] neighbours\", for instance a late night event causing late night disturbances could jeo pardi se IC's prospects\nfor building developments in that area.\nFurthermore the festival requires an occasional licence from a justices committee that only meet at certain times in the year; even if the application was made on time there would be no guarantee of approval.\nMr Foster felt the fate of the beer\nfest is now in the hands of the union and was of the opinion the event was \"Post-pone d rather than cancelled\"; he suggested DB's or Olady's at St. Mary's as\npossible alternatives. Various union members v ie w the latest developments as the end of this year's beer fest; \"It's just\na shame, that's all\" commented the dejected William Bentley VP (Finance).\nSarah Coburn, RAG Chair, mirrored his\ndisappointment, commenting\" I'm not\nimpressed\".\nissue 1131\n11 January 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films:David Roberts\nNews Editor: Andy Ofori\nMusic Editor: Dennis Patrickson\nArts Editor: Helena Co che me Games Editor; Gary Smith\nDelivery last issue: David Roberts,\nAndy Ofori & numerous others whole anta hand at the end of term.\nCheers.\nTres Cher, Chez Harrods CCUs In Trouble\nBy Helena Cocheme\nAccording to the advertisement, 'There\nis only ONE sale'. The annual opening of the Christmas sale at Harrods, which clocks up on average a phenomenal million pounds per hour, is a distinguished\nritual. It seemed as if the crowd started\ngathering at dawn on Wednesday6 January, because by half past eight in the morning, the pavement was packed. Eager shoppers and dedicated celebrity\nwatchers jostled to claim a prime vantage\npoint by the entrance.\nstar had been expected to conduct the ceremony last year, but she pulled out\nunexpectedly after the death of her ex-husband Sonny.\nCher was greeted by Mohammed Al\nFayed, who gave her the customary floor\nby floor tour of the department store,\nwhilst her latest single 'Believe', which topped the1998 charts, boomed on every loudspeaker. In a sensational publicity stunt, the entertainer was bombarded by questions (she apparently ate\nnothing for breakfast according to her\nresponse to one exuberant reporter)\nThe honour of inauguration rested\nin the capable hands of Oscar-winning\ndiva Cher, whose arrival coincided some what ironically with a brass band rendition of' When I'm Sixty-Four' by the Beatles (to be fair, she's only 531). The\nprocession was rounded off with pomp and circumstance by horse-drawn carriages and a trio of bag pipers. The super-Al Fayed 'Cher's a moment with the star\nand hounded mercilessly by the paparazzi. She posed beside brass door-knobs, admired a linen display and grasped a china plate, by which time she was extremely irritated with the persistent media attention, exhausted from\ntottering around in her high heels,\nblinded by glaring flashlights and probably quite peck ish. By David Roberts\nICU President Dave Hellard has come under attack in his attempt to re-organise\nthe Constituent College Unions. Senior\nsources in all four Unions have spoken out\nagainst what they see as an attempt to\nundermine their \"identity and substance\".\nSome have even seen this as a first move\nin an attempt to completely disband the\nCCUs.\nMr Hellard first outlined his plans to\nmove most C CU clubs into direct ICU control at the December meeting of ICU Council, since when the storm clouds have slowly\ngathered and opposition to any per cie ved attack on the power of the Constituent\nUnions has mobilised. However, as Mr Hellard has been on holiday for the last\nfour weeks, he has been unable to react\nto this criticism, or comment in his defence.\nThe most vocal opposition to Mr Hellard has come from Royal School of Mines\nPresident Alistair I ox, who has written a point for point re-buffa l of Mr Hellard's proposals, which he believes \"had no factual basis other than what would appear\nto be general sweeping innuendos\". He also feels that some of the comments Mr Hellard made in Felix at the end of last term\n\"suggest that the C CU Presidents are people of substantially lower character who cannot be relied upon\" and is un sur pris ingly annoyed by this attitude. He concludes that \"the underlying reason for the\nsuggested change... is the abolition of the\nCCUs themselves\".\nIn the other CCUs, opposition to Mr Hellard's proposals also face stiff (if less\nvocal) resistance. Will Bentley, Royal College\nof Science Union Vice-President, expressed\nhis concern with the methods Mr Hellard\nplanned to use; \"If the clubs were to be\ngiven the choice of whether or not to\nmove I would be in favour of the proposal,\nbut forcing them to move is clearly wrong\".\nSenior figures in the Med School and City\nand Guilds Unions have also pledged to\noppose the scheme.\nThe real question, however, is still\nover Mr Hellard's long-term intentions, but\nwith Mr Hcllard due back from holiday\ntoday, and a meeting of ICU Council due to take place tomorrow night, his true\nmotives should soon become apparent.\nThe Week Ahead\nMonday\nGames Meeting 12.30pm Film Meeting 1pm News Meeting 1.30pm Tuesday\nNews Meeting 12pm Wednesday\nNews Meeting 2pm Friday\nArts Meeting\nMusic Meeting\n12pm1.30 pm Felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel; 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.lc.ac.uk/Fellx E mall: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at M CP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 - 16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Telix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

    "content": "12\nBLONDIE\nMusic 11 January 1999\nNo Exit\nA long time ago In a galaxy far far away..\nM any of you may have thought that Blondie\nwere some band from the seventies. You're\nwrong. They're actually a fresh new band\nready to attack the music scene with some innovative\nsonic musings. Seriously, though, this is the band that\naround fifteen years ago were one of the most influential bands around. There's a terrible stigma attached\nto bands that reform years after their prime. They tend\nto be seen as milking past glories. A Greatest Hits\npackage last year could lead people to think that this\nis what they're doing. That's far too cynical, though. You get the feeling that this is actually for real. What\nactually happened was in the spring of1998 the four\noriginal members met up and decided to let past differences lie. They entered the studio and this is what\nthey managed to come out with, No Exit.\nThe question is whether it's any good. Album opener. Screaming Skin, sounds promising. There's a Madness-like guitar riff jolting through the intro and then we hear Debbie Harry's familiar voice getting carried along by what can only be described as a reggae\nquickstep rhythm. This is a red herring, though. No th ing else on the album sounds remotely like it. Forgive\nand Forget opens with what is surely a rip-off of a New Order riff. Unfortunately, what follows is not a New Order song. It's just an average throwaway song something more suited to ab side or perhaps even an\nalbum filler! The problem with it is that there is no spark\nand this is what is missing from several songs on the\nalbum. It's a running theme that should have been stopped in its tracks before the songs were committed to tape.\nThe title track opens with some classical music\nthat I'm sure others will be able to recognise instantly\nbut the name of it eludes me. Anyway, from there\nthings really go downhill. It can only be described as very\npoor. What we get is Debbie Harry trying to rap! I mean, for Christ's Sake! I know critics tend to slate old\nartists trying new things because they see it as an\nattempt to win over the young audiences oI decided to listen to it again with a more open mind and my fears\nwere confirmed the title track is terrible! No question.\nI think the problem may have been that they tried\nto get everything on to record without filtering out the\nduffers. There are actually a handful of decent tracks\nbut once you experience the crap ones, you don't have the heart to slog through and find the gems. Nothing Is Real But The Girl is reminiscent of the Blondie of old - that's a good thing, by the way. Double Take is also\ngood because you can hear the band gelling together\nrather than Debbie' s voice pervading all. It's the sort of mature track that they should be writing now. Obviously\nit's not going to turn the kids on but at least this way you don'tend up embarrassing yourselves.\nI like the Blondie of old a lot which is probably why I'm being a tad harsh on this their 'modernisation.' The\nfact remains that once your fire's gone out, there's no point rekindling it unless you're going to make it burn\nbrighter. And burn brighter, No Exit does not. d Dennis\nMOJAVE3^ Out Of Tune\nThis Is what the album cover looks\nlike. Don't say you couldn't find it.\nW ell well, this turned out to be a nice little\ngem of an album. I think the trick is simplicity itself. It's only nine songs long, loo often,\nbands just tack an extra couple of tracks on to make their album the 'right length.' Size isn't everything,\nyou know. What we' ve got here is a collection of acoustic based tracks that range from upbeat to, well,\ndownbeat. I admit that at times, the vocalist slips into\na Bob Dylan sound but that's just splitting hairs.\nOpener, Who Do You Love, strums itself into a lovely song that asks you to look at yourself: 'Would you like who you were if you met them someplace? Would you recognise the lines on a stranger's face?' I know all this soul-searching turns people off because they sec it as part of the pre-millen i al packaging that musical\nartists and others alike are trying to cash in on. How ever, Mojave3 come across as very genuine and not in\nthe least contrived. That's a commodity that people try\nvery hard to create without success. Mojave3 seem to\nachieve it effortlessly.\nThe lyrical content of the album is mostly relationship based. Give What You Take is your basic love\nsong: There'sa light in your eyes that fills me with life.\nThere's a lovin' in you that makes me wanna fly.' Again,\nI know it sounds cheesy but when you hear it, you know it's for real. Some Kinda Angel echoes the same sort of\n'love is the ultimate salvation' theme:' And you were some kinda angel, you took me aside, said hey never-mind, I 'll make you feel better.' In contrast there are\nmore bitter pills in the album. Yer Feet sees the singer\ncontemplating the aftermath of a failed relationship: T need something solid I can hold like a dog that comes when I call but I don't need you.' The strength of Mojave3 is in the beauty of their\nsongs. The sound is simple. Organs and pianos accompany an acoustically strummed rhythm section. There\nare no electric guitars or funky loops zipping in and out\nof tracks so if you're after musical ex hi li ration you've\ncome to the wrong house. If, however, you're looking\nfor musical salvation, Out Of Fune is an open house waiting for you to come in. Quietly brilliant. CI\nDennis\n\n"

The clairvoyant accurately predicted many facts about his life\nwith the exception of a single detail - forecasting an untimely death. He actually celebrated his 90th birthday last year! As a tribute to this most distinguished of photographers, a series of events was s ched \"Taking photographs\nis to place the head,\neye and heart in the\nsame line of sight.\"\nu led in 1998 to display\nthe highlights of his pro-if ic career.\nThe exhibition at the\nV&A, which concludes the commemorative pro-gram, complements the\npresentation tu rope an s previously shown at the Hayward Gallery. As the\ntitle suggests, Elsewhere\nfocuses on images from\nthe American continent\n( Mexico, the USA and Canada) and Asia (India,\nSri Lanka, China, Indonesia and Japan).\nThe collection of50 prints was selected\nby the photographer himself from the museum's archive.\nHenri Cartier-Bress on travelled extensively and was a pioneer in the field of\nphotojournalism, witnessing decisive historical and political\nmoments such as\nGandhi's funeral or the Kuomintang gov-ern ment' s demise. He also documented the struggle for independence in former colonies. However his ultimate aim was not the impartiality of a reporter,\nbut the subjective\ninterpretation of an\nartist. His perception\nof the United States\nin 1947 for instance\nis particularly severe\nand critical; perhaps\nunsurprising considering his socialist ten-den cie s. He was described as a \"pissed-off photographer looking at the results of\npost-McCarthy capitalism\".\nWith the curiosity . .\nof an ethno graph er, \u00bb]\nCartier-Bresson explores\ncultural and religious\ndiversity, establishing a, fascinating illustrated\nchronicle of the20 th century.

    "content": "16 Games 11 January 1999\nHalf-life (PC)\nSierra \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPhew, failing to get into the Christmas\nedition means that I can miss out the obvious 'Cracker' and' Sleighing the opposition' puns. If you own a semi-decent PC machine and have not played\nor bought the game then you have managed to miss one of the most brilliantly\nunder hyped and understated games. The games community might have\nraved about it, but that's been the end of it. Perhaps it's the rather un sexy male lead character - a postdoc Physics worker\nhas not really sent the popular press Into\na spin in the same way that a large\nbreasted heroine might. Could it be the\ncold clinical lab environment that the\nlead character has to fight his way out of\nfollowing a spectacularly crocked experiment? A blown fuse in lab equipment or\na dod gy test probe has nothing on managing to open dimensional portals to\nother worlds brimming with harmful and horrific creatures. Is it the fact that most\nof the tabloid reviewers were not able to\ncope with the introduction sequence?\nThere is no simple video introduction in\nthis game as you wander along, travelling\nto the lab complex on the monorail picking up the rather useful\nhazard suit. The suit\nmanages to double as\na protective layer\nbetween the nice, soft,\nbut easily crumpled soft\nbits inside and the harsh alien 'eat human' world outside. Or is it\nthe slightly disturbing\nway the hero handles a crowbar? So for the popular press to like it\nthey need a large\nbreasted lawyer, or\njournalist, who battles\nthrough an easy-on-the-eye office complex\nintroduced using full\nmotion video or ani-mati on, oh yeah and her crowbar action is\nless frantic.\nBut despite the lack of popular press\nsupport and IV, Cine ma and Billboard ads,\nit has been one of the big hits of the\nChristmas season purely because it is\njust an excellent game. Taking the quake\n2 graphics engine, and bolting to it a story line and some quite clever Al, Valve\nhas taken the shooting game another\nstep forward.\nGraphically and sonic ally the game hasn't moved the genre forward too far.\nThe soothing voice of the hazard suit\nwarning system is a nice touch, and the introduction of music to emphasised a nger or excitement gives the game a more\nfilm like touch. The Al of the characters\nfound in the game, both friendly and hostile, also helps reinforce the movie experience. Talk to some of the scientists\nand security guards and they'll follow for\na while. The security guards carry some firepower of their own which definitely\nis an advantage, while the science staff\nhelp out by opening doors and keeping you up to speed on the story line. The\nenemies also react to your actions. No more will the enemies perform suicidal\nruns at the player. L ne my grunts will try\nto clear the area by lobbing grenades\nrather than running into ambushes. If\nthey get exposed to suppression fire\nthey will run and hide. It is just a very\ngood3 D first person shooting game. Let's hope that Valve get to work on more of these.\nGary S. Western Front (PC) Links LS '99 (PC)\nTalonsoft\nTalonsoft are the masters of hex based\nwargames for the PC, with their Battleground series, Norm Koger's Operational\nArt of War and Eastern Front (a world war\nII campaign). Their latest release. Western Front, is effectively Eastern Front but\nshifted west a few hundred miles. You can play any one of a huge series of historically accurate scenarios in the W. European, Mediterranean or North African theatres, or as a campaign of interlocking scenarios.\nAs expected, everything is detailed\nto an incredible degree of accuracy. The scale of the game is around battalion\nlevel - you don't decide the strategy for\nthe whole of the Allied forces for exam ple, but are involved in small scale skirmishes and battles.\nThere is a large, well\nmassive, number of units, which all play\nrealistically. Of course,\nI don't knowhow realistic this is as Iam not\na WW2 veteran, but\nthere is no point where you scream at the computer after an unrealistic battle result. There is\na lot to appeal to diehard war gamers, but\nthere is also something\nin here for everyone( well'almost every-one. Or more accurately - more than\ncould be expected given the nature of the game). It does not take long to get\ninto it, especially as the scenarios are all\ngraded. The training missions are quite\nsimple and get you to use your units\nintelligently and as a team rather than\nallowing the enemy to pick them off\none by one. The presentation, especially for this\ntype of game, is extremely good. The\nmusic is atmospheric and quite exciting\nwhen played loud. The graphics are also\nvery good and clear. This is certainly one of the best wargames available. Highly\nrecommended. OVt\nAccess\n\u2022 \u2022*\u2022\nlli ril t lli In the world of the Golf Simulator the various makers all aim their games at different ends of the serious simulation\nspectrum. At one end there is the jokey\nSensible Golf simulation, in the middle is the slightly more serious Act u a Golf 3,\ndesigned for the PSX market and agen tle introduction for the casual user. In the\nhard user corner is definitely Access'\nLinks LS 99.\nHere is a game that takes itself so\nvery seriously. There are three different\nways to use the mouse to whack the little virtual ball along the green grass stuff.\nThere is even a control method that\ninvolves rolling the mouse in a pretend\nswing. It is a game that allows the screen\nresolution to be so high that only the\nfinest quality screens from Yokohama and the keenest video cards from Munich can handle it without breaking\ninto tears. What wc have here is a very\nserious Golf game for the very seriously\nrich Golfer. But don't let that put you off,\nthere are amazingly a few fun features\n- well fun for Golf. Compete in a tour-name nt and crowds will cheer you on, all while the occasional balloon or jet\nflies into view. Miss a shot and try to get\nyour computer player to swear. All possibly clean fun. but is it really all that\nenjoyable ?\nDeep within Felix Towers LS '99 was installed in an attempt to prevent Christmas burnout occurring among the crack\nteam of writers. Us success is measured\nin human lives saved from madness and bedlam. The News team has reported\nthat even the Arts Ed was seen trying to\nget dug into the sandy St Andrews' bunkers. So thanks to Access and Links\nLS '99 Felix can publish again, what better recommendation than that can we give.\nGary S. "

    "content": "11 January 1999 Travel 9\nBrightening Prospects\nSee the world, make a difference. Improve your CV and clear your conscience\nCan travelling really be worthwhile? At\nsome point we all decide we want to see\nthe world, but even if we do actually go\nanywhere only a few of us will ever do\nanything useful. According to Claire Bayntun, it doesn't have to be that way.\n\"I'm going travelling\" is a claim made regularly amongst\nstudents in the university bars. We're all a well intention ed lot, but the truth is that only one out of every\nfive that talk about it actually get to the point of filling\nin their luggage labels. Why is that?\nNoone denies that going overseas and experiencing a different culture is a good thing. In fact, the\nconsensus is that you are likely to have an outrageously fun time, your mind will be opened, your\ncharacter enriched... and of course, our elders will all\nchant \"...Do it now while you still can...\" And in that they\nhave a fair point.\nSo if you are determined to be one of the ones that actually gets to hold the boarding pass in your\n(presently clean) hand, there remain two routes of overseas experience for you to chose from. You have the option of bumming your way around hostels, getting smelly, stoned and progressively lazy.\nOr at least that is fast becoming the perception of employers on reading\"... been travelling...\" on an application form. And it is, let's face it, very often a fair\ndepiction of those months away. \" Who wants a job any-way\", will be being uttered by those who have spent\ntoo many weeks on the Thai Islands... goatee beard,\nno doubt, in place. It's not until you return home, having forgotten your mum's birthday, dogs funeral, and little sister's confirmation, that you start to wonder whether you actually 'lost' your soul in the blissful haze\nof beach and hammock, rather than 'discovering it' as\nyou had meant to!\nThere is another way to soak yourself within another culture, while keeping-up-appearances for\nyour future prospects.\nTeaching Abroad and Projects Abroad are an organisation which allows your time overseas to be structured\nand worthwhile, both to yourself (building up your CV,\nmaking clearer judgements on your abilities and intentions in life), and to the community to which you choose to go. They have arranged over 3000 voluntary\nwork placements in India, Ghana, Mexico, Brazil, China,\nTibet, Ukraine, Siberia and Russia. You are provided with\nfood and accommodation with a local family, immersing you within the culture and community. The most popular placements are teaching conversational English in schools, to a range of ages( no\nTEFL qualification required - which saves hundreds, if not\nthousands, of pounds), conservation projects, and( lis-ten up Medics yet to arrange your Electives) work in hos-pital s. Additionally, there is a stock of limited placements\navailable in areas such as journalism, accountancy,\nlaw, engineering, FT., and hotel management... There\nis the option of combining programmes, and whatever\nyour placement, you chose the dates that you want for\nyour travel and program, with placements possible\nfrom one month up to a year.\nAs with any trip overseas, you have to provide\nyour own funds, but in paying for all your essential\nexpenses up front (food, accommodation and in sur ance) you do not have the difficulty of budgeting while\non the road. You have the security of paid staff in your\ndestination for backup and welfare, along with the\nassur it y of meeting up with other like-minded volunteers. Generally good sorts!\nAs for where you are going THEY NEED YOU. One volunteer who was recently working in a remote village\nin Ghana was made a Tribal Chief, such was his impact\n(as covered by The Daily Express, Sky TV and This Morn ing). You will receive a heart felt welcome from the local\ncommunity that you live and work with; they are grateful for your voluntary contribution, as they can not\nafford to pay you. Everyone gains from the cultural\nexchange, and in staying in one place you get to build\nup relationships and knowledge that would be impossible to achieve by simply travelling thr ough. Ihe benefits are long term as well as short term - something that should help your family and friends accept that you are going. As you arc only committed to working18 hours per\nweek( Monday to Iri day) you have plenty of free time\nto tour around your region, and indeed, to discover your\nsoul! And I suggest that you goon to travel more on completing your placement, either alone or with other\nvolunteers, safe in the knowledge that you have some thing highly regarded on your CV. Each destination\noffers a feast of sights and different cultural experiences\nfor you to explore that must not be missed.\nIf this does whet your appetite, and makes the\nimportant difference between talking about it and actually going to be part of these exotic places, then\ncontact Dr Peter Slowe at Teaching Abroad, Gerrard\nHouse, Rustingdon, West Sussex, BN16 1 AW. Tel: 01903\n85991 1 or mail to:info@t caching abroad.co.uk\nCheckout the web site for more information, and for contact numbers of people who have just returned;\nwww.teaching-abroad.co.uk Ask the Careers Office to\ncontact Teaching and Projects Abroad if you want a presentation from the organisation.\nAnd now you have got something to talk about in\nthe bars. Make your move. "

    "content": "6 Columns 11 January 1999\nRight Angles To Reality\nShampoo\nU se separate shampoo and conditioner? Take two bottles into\nthe shower? - well, surprisingly,\nthe answer seems now to be yes. In the most shocking split since Sonny and Cher went their separate ways, the boys\nat Vidal Sassoon - who only a few years\nago were spending millions of pounds extolling the virtues of the dual action\nshowering experience to the point of questioning the mental well-being and sexual prowess of those members of the community who had been irresponsible enough to opt out of this, the personal hygiene happening of the decade have discovered that mixing shampoo and conditioner in one bottle\nis about as wise as putting male and female gerbils in the same cage. I can clearly remember the first emergence of the products in question into the public\ndomain and I still bear the mental scars\nthat resulted from my father's refusal to\nallow his family to experiment with \"that\noverpriced mixed together rubbish\".\nFor those of you who grew to adult-hood in this mobile phoning, internet-browsing, Eurostar-riding decade that is\nthe 90's, and whose cultural values were therefore\ngained from Chan nel 5 magazine programmes about\nsnowboarding presented by middle-class twenty-somethings\nin baggy trousers\nand baseball caps\nworn back-to-front,\nrather than by watching Roy North and Basil Brush; it is impossible to appreciate\nthe social stigma that one brought on oneself back then by continuing to take\ntwo bottles into the shower. As a vulnerable and sensitive teenager I was painfully aware of the terrible risk I was running and tried for weeks to disguise\nmy lack of auf a it ness with this revolutionary hair washing experience. I learned to bluff my way through intricate\ndiscussions of the many different preparations available and their relative merits and demerits, all the time living in\nAnne Frank esque fear that my guilty\nsecret would somehow come to the knowledge of my peers. Classmates would endlessly argue over hair types\nand whether they were Normal, Greasy\nor Flyaway. The common consensus was that I was Dull and Lifeless - but that was probably more a reference to that disappointing episode with Trudi Wallace in\nthe cricket pavilion where I completely\"... it is impossible\nto appreciate the social\nstigma brought by\ncontinuing to take two\nbottles into the\nshower...\"\nfailed to bowl a maiden over.\nI managed to keep up the pretence of understanding up for\nalmost a fortnight, but, in the words of\nmy hero Hercule Poirot - the most\nfamous Belgian since Merge introduced\nTin-Tin to an expectant\nworld - ze tr use 'as the' a bit of mek king itself\nk ner n.On a routine\nshopping trip with my mother at Gateway one weekend, I accidentally bumped in to\na classmate who' d begun a Saturday job there as a first-three-biscuits-in-the-pack-breaker, and when he spotted the bottle of V05 shampoo in my mother's trolley I knew that it was Game Over. By Monday, it\nwas all round the cloakroom and my credibility never recovered. Even Trudi\nWallace deserted me and she never\noffered to whip my bails off again. Eventually however, the brouhaha over \"Wash\nand Go\" subsided and I was rehabilitated, only to be sent back to the Gulag when the combined washing powder and fabric softener craze hit our school, and someone let on that my mother only used\nDreft.\nBut with the birth of this new concept \"Wash\nand Go\" without the conditioner, I feel a great weight lifting from my shoulders. \"Solo\" - as this\ncounter-revolutionary hair treatment is\ncalled - represents the sort of U turn of which politicians can only dream and is\nmarketed in away that would cause\nPeter Mandelson to stifle moans of ecstasy (which is fine by me as long as\nit doesn't affect his ability to do his job).\nIf the issue in question were a political\npolicy rather than a personal hygiene\nproduct, Vidal Sasoon would be ripped\nto shreds by the media. Even the youth ful, f olli call y disadvantaged leader of Her\nMajesty's Opposition, who usually displays all the political acumen of a sheet\nof grease proof paper, couldn't fail to\nmake political capital out of such a blatant turnaround. One can't help but wo nder what Jeremy Paxman would make of this if he could get the head of the Con sumer Bamboozling Department at Vidal\nSassoon in front of the cameras:\nPaxman: \"Yeeesssss. But isn't this\nMatt Salter\n\"Take two bottles\ninto the shower? The\nanswer would now\nseems to be 'Yes'.\"\nmove a complete reversal\nof your earlier One Container Two Detergent pol-icy? I mean, it's a bit of a bloody cheek isn't it?\"\nWorried ad-exec \"No, no. Not at all.\nThe central principle of unitary cleansing\nis still very much there.\nThe name itself - \"Solo\"\n- clearly underlines that point....\"\nPaxman. \" Oh come on, Mr. Earnalot,\nsurely this is a blatant\nattempt to encroach on the cosmetic territory of your competitors, who have long maintained that the distinction between the role of the cleaning agent on the one hand, and the conditioner on the\nother should be clearly defined. Isn't this just a case of goodbye Vidal - Aloe Vera?\"\nEarnalot: \"I prefer to think of it as\n\" New Lather - New Bathtime\" Jeremy. No but seriously, I'd like to evade that question in two ways if I may. Firstly, We have always maintained that in order to\ntackle follicle\nun cleanliness you must have a long-term strategy in\nplace that deals with the root cause\nof the problem. Look, the latest\ntwo-wave approach\ndoes not damage the very close and important ties that\nshampoo and conditioner have with each other, it is merely\na move towards devolving cleaning power and giving the two ingredients\ngreater autonomy within the bathroom as a whole.\"\nPaxman: \"But Mr. Larna..\"\nEarnalot: \"If I might be allowed to fin-ish. Secondly, there is the question of consumer choice. Being in manufacturing means that you have to be prepared\nto take tough decisions, and it maybe that there is a case for looking at the whole concept of universal scalp bene fit. I have instructed my team to un think the think able.\" Paxman: \" How do you answer the charge made by some of your com pet i tors, and you've no doubt seen the ads,\nthat this latest about face marks a do facto return to a more traditional style of hair-washing and will inevitably lead to\na move back to the use of older, less\nmild-acting sur fact ants in the products\nconcerned. And the worry is that this\n\"...I was rehabilitated,\nonly to be sent back to\nthe Gulag when the\ncombined-washing-pow\nder-and-fabric-softener\ncraze hit our school...\"\n\"Back to Caustics\" campaign will lead to\nan increase in the number of reported\nincidences of split ends, follicle damage and less efficient cleansing overall.\nIt's nothing more than two tier cleaning\nby the back door isn't it?\"\nEarnalot: \" No,no. Let me make it\nquite clear. There is no threat to the quality of the product as a whole and to\nsuggest that there is, is simply irresponsible scare mongering. Our position remains as it has always been; there will\nbe no drop in cleansing power we are\ntough on grime, tough on the causes of\ngrime.\nPaxman: \" Do you envisage a time\nwhen the two constituents might be reunited?\"\nEarnalot: \"If such a move occurs,\nand it's a big if, I think that it's some way off. Although we are not opposed to the\nidea of a reunification in principle, we feel that the current situation - with\nshampoo and conditioner working in\nclose partnership, with the help of the\nlemon shower gels - is right for our company. We would only move into a Single\nCombination when it was right and prudent to do so.\"\nPaxman-. \"So\nrather than \"Wash\nand Go\", it's more a case of \"Wait and See\". Mr. Earnalott hank you. Well,\nthe first editions of\nsome of the mor ning papers are in\nand\" Or something of the sort. How ever, the marketing boys are rarely subjected to the same kind of scrutiny as our\nelected representatives. If they were,\nthey might have been pushed rather\nharder to explain the process whereby using Flash on your filthy kitchen floor\nnot only results in your lino coming up\nsparkling clean but also leads to the\nwhole room being redecorated and floral curtains being hung at the windows. Similarly, perhaps Kotex would have\nbeen called to account for why menstruating women suddenly get the urge\nto wear white trousers and run along a beach with long, loping strides being pulled along by two Golden Retrievers.\nIn the face of such relentless invest iga tion, Vidal Sasoon might even be forced\nto explain why the instructions on an\noriginal bottle of no-fuss, one-stop \"Wash\nand Go\" advised you to apply the product to \"wet hair and work up into a lather\" then rinse and then \"repeat as\nnecessary.\"\n\n"

    "content": "11 January 1999 Music\nAlbums\nBUILT TO SPILL\nKeep It Like A SecretE\nT he media splurge reads some thing like this: 'Built To Spill's last\nalbum, the epic Perfect From\nNow On, must surely stand as one of the decade's finest guitar albums , a monumental testimony to the power of the rock tradition. Fact.' Well, if that is to be believed then their follow-up album. Keep It Like A Secret must surely stand\nas one of the decade's most mon u mental comedowns. Fact. I'm not saying that t hey're crap. It's just that\nthey're not really the saviours of the rock tradition. A half decent rock band is what they are - plain and simple.\nAnyway, that's all based on what the music press says and who reads that\nnowadays, eh?\nWeighing in at a fairly lightweight\nfifty minutes Keep It Like A Secret contains eleven tracks with only one track\nover six minutes long. They are pretty\nmuch all pop songs and the band's pop sensibilities work well with the vocalist's distinctively American twinge. The rhythm guitar work is fairly solid throughout while the lead is quite often stratospheric prompting a quick burst of the old\nair guitar routine.\nYou Were Right is probably the standout track on Keep It Like A Secret. Much like the rest of the album it doesn't follow the usual verse-chorus-verse tradition\nthat rock trios tend togo for. They're a rock trio, by the way. Just in case you were wondering. The song basically\ntrawls out some old rock lyrics and forms\nthem into a song: 'You were right when you said that all that glitters isn't gold.\nYou were right when you said that we're\nall just bricks in the wall. You were right\nwhen you said that you can't always get\nwhat you want. You were wrong when you said that everything is gonna be alright.' For the record, they originally\nbelong to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones( I think that's wrong, though. Answers on a postcard to Felix\nplease or else it'll bug me for ages) and The Beatles respectively. Strangely, this\nis one of the longer songs. That isn'tan endorsement of the lengthier variety as\nmost of the decent tunes are the shorter\npop pier ones. All together, however. Built To Spill\nfall short of being something special.\nThey're a bit average. Keep It Like A Secret is good but it can get very dull\nquickly. There's definitely promise here\nand the whistling at the end of the album is enough to make you laugh. It's alright but that's it. CI\nDennis\nBELLATRIX\nF act one: Iceland's women far out-number its men. Icelandic\nwomen are apparently generally\nOK with men who double-date because not so many of them are in circulation\nanyway. Fact two: Bellatrix is a five-piece\nall-girl Icelandic band that is very good at the usual pop music routine of catchy melodies and nice vocals. From\nfact two we can deduce that they are\ndestined for success. Keeping fact one in mind, can we then hazard a guess that this is all but a subtle ploy to find\nthemselves a wider choice of men? Bcllatrix employ all sorts of pop music tricks to make their music and songs interesting. The screeching gui-tars, the violins, the whirling synthesis er sounds, the chunky beats, and not least,\na good lead vocalist (Bjork-esqu c?) are all\nused to good effect. The fact is, had I been inclined to dismiss the m,I wouldn't have been able to say they are bad imitators of others.\nThe opening track Silvcrlight is a nice smooth introduction to the album with its searching guitar chords and vocals. Lyrics like T don't have any answers and I cant see far ahead' are\nominously prophetic. Perhaps they know they could be marketed well and this is\na huge disclaimer in that they have no masterplan whatsoever. Another dimension is a cheerful song full of sweeping fast beats and many a chorus line. This\nis the sort of stuff that makes you start\nto have a bit more faith in the new music\nthat's coming through nowadays. A Sting\nstarts with a very nice chorus and goes on to create the 'rollercoaster ride' effect\nthe lyrics sing of. Great Expectations\nmixes pile-driving guitars, quick beats,\nand folksy violins into a good song.\nThe trouble with bands like this is it'll\ntake along time for them to get recognised, loo often today we just plump for\nthe names we know when we're trawling the record shops. I don't knowhow long it will take for Bellatrix to be well-known, if ever, but I think they are as\ngood as anything out there, and hope fully can only get better. CI\nAhmed\nSingles\nSebadoh - Flame\nAmerican rock seems stuck in the mixture of chirp y optimism and pounding guitars that is sometimes called\npost-grunge. Sebadoh are no exception. They've got the\nvocal sound spot on( Imagine the blok e who sang Knock On Wood) but luckily a stomping drum beat pulls\nthe song round to make an enjoyable listen.\nThe Levellers - One Way\nOriginally recorded in 1991, this re-recorded version\nechoes the baggy sound from that era, with nice new percussive bits to bring it up to date. The track serves\nas a Sweetest Thing style taster for the Greatest Hits\nalbum that is out at the moment. The Mutton Birds - Pulled Along By Love\nA bit singer-songwriter-ish. A bit Crowded House; they\ncome from New Zealand. A bit roots y bluesy-trying-not-to-be-pop-while-st ll l being-mainstream. Not a bit orig i nal.\n@to mika Dead Flowers\nDon't you just hate bands with clever smarmy names like that? Their song better be rubbish. Oh good, it is.\nIt's like those Guide To Being A Rock Star lot trying to\nsound like Hanson trying to sound like Nirvana. Not going to work, is it?\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Lowcraft- One Of Us\nA rare treat - an American band playing a twisted concoction of glam rock and psychedelia. Comparisons will\nbe drawn with Placebo and Suede, but that docs little\nto describe the spectral tower of sounds in this song,\nwhich draw from the best of Ziggy-era Bowie.\nRegular Fries - Fries Entertainment\nApparently supporting the Lo-Fidelity Allstars on a LJ.k. tour, Regular Fries can expect to receive a certain\namount of critical acclaim. The sound is the usual wash\nof ambient and big-beat sounds that helped their headliners gain success last year. You will be hearing more from these guys in the future, I promise. Liberty 37 - Revolution\nAn enthusiastic hard rock group from Swansea, Liberty\n37 escape from the confines of metal by adding seductive melodic twists onto the thumping raw power of this\ntheir second single. CI\nEdJ\nMusic Meetings\nThe first meeting of term will be held\nat one-thirty in Felix on Monday. That\nshould actually be today if you pick this up\non the day of release. From then on, it will\nrevert back to the usual time of one-thirty\non a Friday. We look forward to seeing you\nall there. Thank you for your time.\nJason and Dennis\n\n"

The social workers look into the case in\nresponse, and discover that the eight\nyear old twins, never having been outside their own home, behave in a very\nstrange way. Thus, their father is told\nthat he must let them out if he doesn't want them put in a home. From here\nbegins the parallel story of the girls integration into society and their fathers\nstruggle to satisfy the opposing demands of the social workers and his\nneighbours - who want the girls to live a life outside the gates of their home and their blind mother who is terrified\nof her children being exposed to what lies beyond those gates.\nThis is a highly symbol li c film about\nwomen's position in Iranian society.\nSince the revolution in 1979 Iran has accepted women's rights to education, work and voting, and therefore sees women playing a key role in everyday life\n(represented by the social workers and the neighbours). However, there is a Subtitles will appear here.\nremnant stream of strong Islamic t radi tion, which still believes that women must be kept at home until marriage,\nwhilst society is controlled by men( the\nviews expressed by the girls parents). A man with traditional beliefs will consequently try to obey the rules and his\nsense of duty as a father, but will\ninevitably run against the modern trend.\nBeyond this clever and interesting\nsymbolism, the film features a good sense of humour; approaching both the\ngradual emancipation of the girls and the\nsubsequent acceptance of this new situation by their father in a very funny way.\nThe characters are immediate upon their first words you warm to them( even\nwhen reading the subtitles). The scenes\nare colourful, even artistic (but always\nbelievable as a part of everyday life) - yet\nthe director is only cig h tee en years old.\nFinally, apart from everything else\nthe film has to offer, it is a wonderful opp our t unity to visit warm, dry Tehran\nwhilst in cold, wet London. Q Natalia\nSee Psycho& Meet Joe Black for free with the KENSINGTON\nOne of the most eagerly awaited films of the year (if you don't count Star Wars) has\nto be Gus Van Sant's copy of the Hitchcock classic Psycho. Critically lambasted\nwell in advance of its release, Van Sant\nhas made the bizzar e decision to reproduce the bleak 1960 thriller shot for shot.\nIn other words, almost every scene will\nlook and feel exactly the same except\nfor the addition of colour and, of course,\nan all star cast, featuring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche and Julianne Moore. So, will it work? At present, who knows - but you could have the chance to find out for free, by simply answering the following question: Who played Norman Bates In the\noriginal movie?\nNext up is Meet Joe Black, which sees Brad Pitt cast as Death. Leaving\nscythe and cloak at home, he decides to\ncome to Earth to discover what being human is all about. He moves in with\nabout-to-be-deceased Anthony Hopkins,\nand( surprise surprise) falls in love with\nhis daughter, Claire Forlani.\nDespite the slightly cheesy (if off-beat) premise, Meet Joe Black has gone down a storm with both the critics and US audiences, and there is talk of impending Oscar nominations. To see the movie for free - and pick up a plethora of Joe Black related merchandise just answer this question:\nIn which recent movie did Brad Pitt\nplay a German mountaineer?\nThanks to those nice people at the\nOdeon Kensington (you friendly local\ncinema \u2122 , situated at the far end of Kensington High Street), we have five\npairs of tickets to give away, plus a wealth\nof other goodies, including Psycho\nshower curtains and Meet joe Black p aja mas.\nEmail your answer to either (or both)\nquestion to film.felix\u00ae ic.ac.uk before\n6 pm on Tuesday to be in with a chance.\nWinners will be drawn at random from\nthe virtual hat.\nThe winners of issue 1130's Dead\nMan's Curve, A Life Less Ordinary and The Game competitions should all have\nbeen notified by email - please drop into\nthe felix office to collect your prizes.\nLA Confidential\nUniversally acclaimed as one of the best\nfilms of the decade, LA Confidential is\nperhaps the most perfectly made film\nnoir of the last forty years.\nIt's a dark, tough thriller, that tells\nthe \"real\" story of50' s boom-town LA,\nwhere the gangsters buy the DA over\ndrinks, and every other cop is on the take. Its a time when celebrity cops like\nKevin Spaccy can make a fortune, whilst\ngood-guys like Guy Pearce are used\nand abused by all around them. But,\nwhen events conspire to bring these\ntwo together, alongside vicious cop Russell Crowe, nothing can prevent them from finding out the truth - no matter\nwhat the cost.\nCop Land\nAfter dozens of false starts, Sylvester\nStallone finally proves to the world that\nhe really can act - and with Hollywood\nlegends Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Robert\nDe Niro on screen alongside him, that's no mean feat.\nCop Land is another brood y, hard-nosed thriller, based in a world of corrupt cops and high-powered cover ups.\nSly is the sheriff of a small New Jersey\ntown that many NYPD officers call\nhome, but his weak-willed nature means\nthat he simply looks after the menial\npolice tasks, while the residents break\nthe law as they see fit. However, the arrival of de Niro, investigating the cover-up of a suspicious death, results\nin Stallone's decision to find out the truth for himself.\nThe Jackal\nRemaking The Day of the Jackal with\nBruce Willis and Richard Gere probably\nseemed like a really good idea at the\ntime, but thanks to a strange re-working\nof the plot, which eschews acting, directing and even morality in favour of explosions and hilariously crap disguises.\nWillis is the eponymous Jackal, an assassin that no-one can identify who has been employed to kill a high-rank-ing member of the US government. Richard Gere is the convicted IRA terrorist who promises to help track him down, in return for his freedom, from there on, the predictability meter goes\noff the scale. \u2022\nDave\n\n"

Equal Ops - the New Sexism?\nThe ' Women in Science' article (page 8)\nhas started me thinking. Why should\nwomen enter science? The basic\nassumption being made in all the arguments is that women arc just as suited\nto science as men. It may be unfashionable to question this assumption, but\nI wear an Oxfam jacket, so question it I shall; women do think differently (not\nbetter, not worse) than men. If it is true\nthat there are some skills that show a gender bias, are we right to expect equal\nopportunities, which often translates as\n50:50 ratios?\nMore interestingly, if women do possess different mental abilities to men, it seems to mel hal the cause of 'West-ern' sexism is clear. Our society undervalues those skills possessed mostly by\nwomen, and thus discriminates against\nwomen in general. Rather than pre-tending that there are no( mental) differences between the sexes, and hiding them under the 'Equal Opportunities' banner, wouldn't it be better if we concentrated on changing our society's values instead?

The men gagged and bound the lady before making off with\na substantial amount of money from the premises. The incident took place on Tuesday\n15 December sometime between5.00 and5.30 pm. The two men. aged between20 and22 years, entered the JCR and attacked the lady while she was in her office. After tying her down they stole an undisclosed sum of money, believed to be at least several\nhundred pounds, and left the premises via the fire escape stairs leading to the\nBy Ed Sexton\nmain dining hall and Queens tower.\nOn their way they did, however, drop a rucksack full of coins taken from the\nJCR.\nThe lady involved in Ihe incident\nwas physically unharmed, but was described as \" extremely shaken and distressed\" by Chief Security Officer Ken\nWeir. She has since taken an extended amount of sick leave to recover from the ordeal. Descriptions of the two men have\nbeen circulated around the college;\nThe first suspect is described as\npossibly Arabic, with along skinny face\nand long nose. He has shoulder length,\nblack, greasy hair and is abou l510\", with a slim build. Me was wearing along knee length black leather coat, a black jumper, black trousers and black\ntrainers.\nThe second suspect is white, with\naround chubby face and is about5'8\" in height, lie was wearing a red and white vertically striped hal,a black bomber jacket, black trousers and red\ntrainers with white stripes.\nAlthough some forensic evidence has been recovered from the scene, police are eager to talk to anyone who may have more information. Anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have information that could help\nthe police should contact\nDetective Inspector H anton(01713216732) or Detective Sergeant Wisem an(01713216874). Ihe incident is not believed to be\nrelated to the thefts in Beit Hall, the\nUnion, and Llectrical Engineering that\noccurred in the previous week( Felix\n1130). An investigation into these thefts\nis still ongoing, with Ken Weir commenting that \"the police are following up forensic evidence\". He also stated\nthat \"enquiries are becoming more pos-it ive\". College Behind Medical Union's Cash Chaos\nBy David Roberts\nClose investigation of the Union accounts has shown that the \u00a355 000\nwhich has gone 'missing' from the Med School reserves over the last six months was the result of a series of College accounting errors.\nWhen the IC School of Medicine Union( ICSMSU) accounts were converted from College to ICU control last\nJuly, the reserve account was \u00a355 000 in\ncredit. Without proper accounts to check\nthrough for the previous year it was thus\nassumed that this money was available,\nand could be utilised for helping to establish the new ICSMSU, equip their new office and overcome any teething problems which arose. However, as a result\nof a series of large payments over the last\nterm this money has now disappeared completely, and the reserve account is\nnow effectively empty. This has led to\nserious questions being asked of Med School President Wade Gaye d and was one of the contributory factors behind the series of resignations that plagued the ICSMSU Exec last term.\nA fuller investigation of the accounts,\nhowever, would seem to have cleared\nMr Gayed of any responsibility for vast\nmajority of this expenditure. Firstly, none of the clubs based at Charing Cross\nreceived any funds from College last\nyear, t very club ran up a debt, whilst all\nthe money which should have gone into\nthe club accounts ended up in the Med School reserves. Consequently, ICSMSU\nwas forced to clear this debt - totaling \u00a328\nof writing the total cost cannot be ascertained - although it is known to run to\nseveral thousand pounds. Furthermore,\nthe money raised by last year's Charing\nCross rag was credited to the reserve\nWade Is enjoying his new-found 'stress free' existence\n000 - at the start of the year, halving the\nreserves over-night. Secondly, a series of\nunpaid bills have come to light, many left\nover from the period when ICSMSU ran\nthe Charing Cross bar. Invoices continue\nto arrive for beer, staffing and bar equip-ment( including a \u00a31500 cash register\nand a \u00a3700 ice machine) and at the time\naccount, rather than given to the charities concerned, and the \u00a32317 'profit'\nfrom the bar at last year's Charing Cross\nSummer Ball had to be returned to two\nof the organisers who lost several thou sand pounds on the event.\nOnce all of these items have been accounted for, approximately \u00a39000\nremains, of which \u00a36000 was spent on\ncomputers and equipment for the new office in the BMS building. The final\n\u00a33300 was lost when the planned Graduation Ball was cancelled only a few days\nbefore it was due to take place - and is\nthus the only part of the initial \u00a355 000\nwhich has actually been 'lost'.\nInside..\u2022\nEditorial 4\nColumns 6\nWomen In Science 8\nTravel Feature 9\nMusic 10\nFilm 14\nComputer Games 16\nArts 18\nCrossword 20\n\n"

Too much required knowledge( of characters or previous events) will alienate the masses s, whilst starting from scratch will\nresult in death threats from obsessive\nfans. And the ultimate example of this\ndichotomy lies in every new Star Trek\nmovie.\nAs a result. Insurrection avoids any required knowledge of previous plotlines (unlike its predecessor. First Contact)\nand instead throws the intrepid Enterprise crew up gains ta new enemy, the Son'a, on a new world populated by the peaceful Bak'u( as ever, all Star Trek\nnames have that faint air of stupidity\nabout them). Consequently, all you really\nneed to know is that there's a bunch of men and women, who fly around the galaxy in a spaceship called the Enterprise, doing good and being brave. And surely everyone in the Western world knows that?\nInsurrection is also a lot lighter in\ntone than First Contact, thanks to a lot of tongue-in-cheek playing from the cast\n( including one great sequence when Picard rescues Data by singing Gilbert &\nSullivan). There'seven a few romantic\ncnt a glc mc nts this time around, with\nPicard falling for one of the( seemingly\nhelpless) Bak'u. What results is thus a good old fashioned piece of Star Trek, blending action,\nadventure, romance and pure fun, carefully controlled by actor/director t rakes, who seems to have a great sense of which buttons to push. Thus, just when the story seems to be becomming just a little too sentimental, he t how s in a gag,\nand when you begin to worry that the the situation isn't being taken seriously\nenough, along comes a perfectly chore-o graphed action sc en ce( and some very\nnice effects) to put you back on the edge of your seat.\nIndeed, the plot itself screams Star\nTrekal every turn. What other sci-fi adventure would see ou r heros battling their\nown top-brass and a hideous race of dying aliens, to protect a planet which holds the key to eternal youth? More importantly, who else would manage to\npull-off such a tale with any credence of be liev ability? But of course, in the Star\nTrek universe, that just represents\nanother day at the office for the crew of the Enterprise.\nAs long as you're prepared to accept\nthe cheesy philosophy and moral ising that goes hand-in-hand with Gene Rodenberry's creation then you're almost\ncertain to enjoy Insurrection. First Contact\nit certainly isn't, and if you're looking for\na similar gritty, effects laden action er then look elsewhere Insurrection\nchooses to mix a decent plot, a few jokes and a very sixties live-and-let-live\nattitude in with the all-important action.\nRoll on Star Trek 10. \u2022\nDave\nEnemy of the State * * * *\nStarring : Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Jason Robards, Jamie Kennedy, Tom Sizemore\nDirector: Tony Scott\nSatellite surveillance. Cool. Pretty useless when Its cloudy though.\nn the last few years, the number of genuine, sure-fire hit movies has slowly dwindled away. Just because your movie has massive amounts of computer generated effects, stars Arnie\nor has a gargantuan budget, you can no-longer be guaranteed to turn a hefty\nprofit. Once in a while, however, a movie will still appear that has\" box office gold\" written all over it - and Enemy of the State is a prime example. Put together Will Smith, the star of the biggest movies from'96 and'97( Independence Day and Men in Black),\nand Jerry Bruckheimer, the most lucrative producer of all time( Con Air, The\nRock, Armageddon, Crimson Tide, Top\nGun....) and massive audiences will\nundoubtedly come your way.\nThis time around, however, Bruckheimer has put away his pyrotechnics\nand Smith has left his trademark comic expressions and timing at home. Instead,\nEnemy of the State is a high-class, high tech thriller, in the style of seventies conspiracy classics All the Presidents Men,\nThe Parallax View and The Conversation.\nMoving those paranoia-laden classics\ninto the nineties, Smith is a lawyer who is targeted by NSA top-brass (Voight)\nafter unwittingly coming into possession\nof an incriminating videotape. Cue a procession of amazingly high-tech bugging equipment and even satellite sur veil lance, as Voight attempts to destroy Smith's reputation. All seems lost until\nhelp arrives in the shape of former N SAman Hackman...\nIn effect, rather than the standard\nseries of massive set-pieces, Enemy of\nthe State is one long chase, whose pace\nnever flags thanks to fast edits and some neat camera effects. Moreover, it's a chase that's more cerebral than explosive\n- with Smith and Hackman constantly\nforced to think their way around problems (after all, you can hardly take on the\nentire NSA in a gun fight). This, of course,\nputs a lot more pressure than normal on Will Smith's acting talents, yet he comes away a bigger star than before, avoiding\nhis usual charm and humour in favour of\na perfectly balanced rendition of a man whose life is dissolving around him. Plus,\nthere are very few people in Hollywood who can look cool running through Washington in rush-hour, wearing nothing but a dressing gown and a pair of boxers.\nIf you're prepared to accept the Xfiles/Oliver Stone conspiracy theory view\nof the world, and join in with the para-noi a, then you'll find Enemy of the State\nis the kind of superior action blockbuster\nthat we' ve all been looking for.

Unfortunately the game had a dark side, a rather\npoor and annoyingly frustrating series of single person stages where one mistake\nwould force you back to restart the whole10 minute level.\nSomeone back at LucasArts had obviously been listening to the cries of anguish from the poor tortured souls\nand decided to take all of the flying ele-ment s, mix a bit of 3 D card light side of\nthe force' magic and release Rogue Squadron. Rogue Squadron is not going to give any of the secrets from the up and coming 'Chapter One' film as it is set\njust after the Death Star got its just\ndeserts and before the Empire struck\nback. You get to play Luke who together\nwith Wedge Antilles has just set up an elite squadron who get to take on all the\nnasty and difficult missions. Missions that\nwill involve you flying the classic Y wings,\nX wings, A wings and Snow Speeders along with a very fast and very easy to\ncrash V Wing.\nThis game is not an X wing, Tie-fighter or X vs Tie game. Pretty\nmuch all of the miss ions take place very\nclose to the ground and expecting a nice\nsoft landing is not at all\npart of the game plan.\nSo attack your targets\nfrom as near the ground as possible by all\nmeans, but try not to leave\nbits of your craft behind. Another change is the standard camera angle; it's positioned just behind the craft\nand although some of you might switch to the internal\nview camera immediately it is\nnot all that clever an idea as the ground from the internal view rushes into view a little too quickly.\nSo apart from feeling like an arcade or\n-pardon my words a console game, how good actually is it? Well the graphics with\na decent 3 Dfx card and a pretty poor processor are very impressive. It's not\nquite the 'float my boat' level that Wargasm managed to pour into my eyes but\nit passed the flinch test -1 lean t into most\nof the turns. The sound is also fairly - well\nhow else can it be described - sound: A John Williams derived CD etched by as cries of engine, gun and missile sounds.\nThe actual game play is good shoot, missile (guided, though usually un guided), even tangle your enemies with the help\nof the computer controlled wing men before they manage to kill you or stop your\nobjectives being completed. Ihe problem\nis that it all starts to get a bit predictable and\nsame y. Perhaps they make it a little bit\nmore difficult by placing you in as now speeder rather than a proper fighter as you\nattempt to take on enemy fighters, but\nthey arc still enemy fighters following the\nsame predictable path with little in the way\nof evasive man oe uv ring. It is anAl problem and when played next to something like Half-life a very obvious problem. Still\nif you loved Incoming from last summer or 3D flight Arcade games it will entertain\nfor many hours as the levels become progressively more difficult. Star Wars obsessives will have probably already completed\nit over Christmas.\nGary 5.\nTurok 2 - Seeds of Evil (N64)\nAcclaim\nAnother sequel of a game launched at\nthe dawn of the N64. Turok : Dinosaur\nHunter was the top dog of the console3D first person shooter for ages. Only O olden eye managed to match and beat\nit in the eye candy stakes. Turok 2 is\nattempting to take this mantle back.\nI his time Turok is back helping humanity by fighting intelligent Dinosaurs and their masters\nwhile preventing the opening of Ba dimensional prison, which should it open would wipe our\nuniverse out - oh well I suppose two decent story lines in a week would be spoiling me. Turok has\nmanaged to get his hands on some nice weaponry including\nthe cerebral bore - a weapon that homes on to a bad dino's head and docs a nice job in instant\ntre panning nice. As well as a single\nperson game they have also included a multiplayer option which divides the TV\nscreen into halves and quarters much in\nthe same way as Golden ey c. Unfortunately the multiplayer and the single\nplayer are not as good as they\nshould be. The first gripe is\nthe control method. This ability to look up, down and around at the same time as\nrunning forward, backwards\nand sideways is all fine and dandy except that the num ber of keys needed to do so starts to require finger gymnastics of Olympic winning quality. The\nmultiplayer games become a mass of expletives, most of them concerning 'what key does that' and' how close they\nwere when it did this'. Also without the RAM pack the graphics arc not a huge step forward, the buildings appearing very 2 D when close up. In a Christmas\nexperiment using four students it was only five games before the cerebral bore\nbecame boring and a potential uprising\nwas quelled using fresh drinks and multiplayer Goldeneye whoever says Christmas is a time of peace was not present.\nA year or so later and what have we got - not all that much of an improve-ment really. Not as much fun as Goldeneye and not as involving as Zelda...oh\nwell perhaps Turok 3 might be better.\nGaryS.\nNew Year News\nLara on your back\nIn her bid to take over the world only currently surpassed by the Virgin train controller, Richard Branson, Lara has taken time off from exploring and launched a range\nof clothing and accessories. Everything from skinny T Shirts to Dressing-gowns can\nbe purchased over the net and via their 24-hour credit card hotline. (Lara herself\nanswers from5 pm9 am). So it is true. You can have Lara on your back, wrapped round your wrist, against\nyour naked ski a. ooh err perhaps I should just stop now. iMac notebook ? (possibly maybe, probably yes)\nfollowing on from their form over function runaway success in the iMac( which will\nsoon come in a series of five different colours - tangerine mouse with puce moni tor case anyone?), the Apple press are gently hyping the iMac styled portable - which is rumoured to be called Web Mate. All this despite Apple not giving it a showing at\nthe MacWorld expo. Knowing Apple, expect it to look s imu lar to the old eM atc, with\na clam-shell case and a release date sometime before June/July ( though if they start\nto do these in tangerine it might lead to several fashion-rage murders).\n\n"

As with last term, coding will\ntake place in the main Sherfield foyer\n(level 1). Security have asked anyone who wants to get their bike coded to\narrive early in the day, to avoid the queues that were present in the after-noon last term.\nImperial College Union has finally been granted a new public entertainments licence. The new licence allows the\nUnion to take advantage of the increased capacity afforded by the dBs\nextension, completed in September1998, and will result in less students being turned away at the door on Wednesday and Friday nights.\nOriginally the Union had hoped that the new licence would be\napproved by Chelsea and Westminster Council in time for the start of the new academic year. A succession of problems concerning the exact type of licence needed for the venue, how ever, delayed proceedings and meant that the Union had to operate at its prev io us capacity of700 for all of the Autumn term. The Union's Ents and Marketing Manager commented that it\nwas \"very frustrating\", especially as\nthere was only one Friday night all term\nwhich didn't sell out, and people had to be turned away week after week. The new licence was granted on the final Friday of term,18 December, just in time for the carnival. This\nallowed200 extra carnival tickets to be\nsold on the Friday, and in the end the\nBy Ed Sexton\nUnion filled its new1250 capacity.

The Ents and Marke ting Manager hoped that the increased space would encourage more people to come to the Union this term; \"it's been a pain for us... we know we' ve been turning people away. The problem was we were misinformed.\" Imperial College Union is now the biggest\nstudent union venue in central Lond on, with a greater capacity than Kings'\nand UCL's unions. It seems likely, however, that the\nbar will continue to close at 1am on carnival nights. In previous years the\nUnion had to apply for a separate licence for each event, including Wednesdays and Fridays, which allowed occasional late bar licences until 2 am. The Union now has a public entertainments licence, which guar-an tees Wednesday and Friday night\nbar extensions( until 1 2 amand1a m respectively), but which does not allow\nfurther extensions on carnival nights. A later licence was opposed by local res-ident groups and other influential members of the council. Given that\nthe Union is in the heart of a residential area, the guaranteed bar extensions and increased capacity ICU now has are indeed a welcome triumph for\nUnion staff.

    "content": "s Opinion - Women in Science 11 January 1999\nWhy Should We Even Bother?\nSusannah Humfrey wonders if science has anything to offer the fairer sex\nT he gender balance in science and technology is\nnot reflective of the population. This is extremely\nobvious in this college. If you're female in certain\ndepartments you can feel a little, well, conspicuous. The\nCollege runs endless recruitment drives aimed at 6th form girls under the auspices of WISE and has started\nto spread its gospel to year 9 girls (the year they choose their GCSEs). It seems to be taken for granted that more\ngirls should enter science. The question of why still\nremains.\nA classic example of the folly of positive discrimination\nThere are two main lines of argument over why increasing the numerical proportion of women in science is beneficial. The first is concerned with numbers. If you exclude half the population you exclude half of all potential scientists. If the pool of talent from which scientists are drawn is half what it could be, the overall quality of the scientists trained is similarly reduced. Therefore if more women are entering science that\nmeans there will be more good scientists. If there are\nmore good scientists there will be more good science.\nThe second line of argument is that women think\nin a different way. This different mode of thought leads\nwomen to have special skills. If women enter science\nthen they will bring these special skills to science.\nThese special skills are generally lumped under that\ndelightful term feminine intuition (thinking by another\nname?). This feminine intuition is thought in some way to enable better science to occur.\nThese arguments explain suggest why having more women would be good for science. They fail to explain\nwhy studying science is good for women. Girls tend not to choose science, the programmes run by WISE\nseem to exist to entice women into the subject. Girls\nare being actively persuaded into science. What is it\nabout science that is so unattractive to females? It is\nunattractive to enter and apparently unpleasant to\nwork in given by the rate of women leaving the sub-j ect. It appears that there is something more fundamentally wrong. It appears that the entire edifice\ncalled Science is unsuited to most women. This un suit ability is contained in the set up of the institutions of\nscience. The universities, research institutes, publication methods, grant awarding bodies and the way in\nwhich scientific knowledge is presented. This is not\nunlikely, after all science was set up by men for men, in an age when women were excluded as a matter of course. If science is a male construct and it is unsuited\nto women, why are we press u rising girls to take science?\nIt seems to me that the main reason for encouraging more women to enter science has been the belief\nthat equal opportunities is the same thing as numerical\nrepresentation. If fifty percent of undergraduates entering science are female then there is no discrimination\ngoing on. Ido not believe this is true. Even if half the\nundergraduates were to be female Ido not believe they\nhave equal opportunities while the structure of science\nis such that most of them end up leaving the field. There\nare very few women in the higher echelons of science.\nThis is unlikely to improve while science remains a subject in imi cable to women. To have truly equal opportunities in the realm of science there needs to be a dramatic\nchange to the institutions of science. Without an equal\nopportunity to succeed, without an equal opportunity to\nget the very grant that enables us to carry on working in\nthe field there will be never be a substantial number of\nwomen in the field. Unless the current situation in science is changed there is little point in trying to recruit more\nLady Ada Byron Lovelace: I bet she would use LINUX\ngirls. Io actively e nc our age girls into a field that slams a door in their face once they have got there is not only a perverse desire but a sadistic one. We are lying to girls\nabout the wonderful time and careers they can have in\nscience. We are actively encouraging them to waste their\ntime on a pipe dream. If the field is intrinsically biased\nagainst us, why should we bother with science?\nSubliminal messaging? Or are those women In the background for a more Innocent reason?

    "content": "11 January 1999 Columns\nThought for the Day\nAbsent Friends\nI can categorically state, deep from the\nI vaults of my not inconsiderable personal experience, that the Christmas\nterm always goes badly. I once read\nsomewhere (and do you know, I think it\nwas in Felix) that Siberians frequently\nsuffer depression brought on by... dark-ness. Once those clocks go back, there's no escape; we are condemned to spend\nmonths attempting to thrive on eight\nhours of daylight, paling and decaying\nlike e tio late d plants. When it gets dark,\npeople get anxious, lonely and downright fed up; and when people get fed\nup, people split up. It's almost like the 'flu\ngoing round.\nDespite having been single since...\nbear with me (rustle of paper) - ah yes;\nFebruary 1772,1 was still affected by this\nChristmas madness. The only reason I managed to get out of bed at all in the\nlast few weeks of term was to make the\nlongest obscenity I could out of the\nCountdown letters games. I didn't even\nneed to get up to watch the cricket: hot\nchocolate, nice warm bed, Radio Four.\nIt also seems that I was not the only\none who was far from relishing going back home\nfor Christmas. A proportion of fresher s are no doubt wondering\nwho took all their interesting school-friends away and replaced them with a bunch of selfish, immature. Northern\ndegenerates. (Hey, don't worry. I'm sure\nthey all feel the same way about you.) A self-indulgent orgy of complaints cascaded against my poor, influenza-stretched eardrums: \"I don't want to go\nhome for Christmas. I 'll have to sit and\nlaugh at Aunt Hattie's jokes, and all the\ntime I 'll be dying for a reefer.\" Hmm.\nScrooge never thought of that one.\nI bit the bullet eventually, of course,\nas did everyone else, as the population\nof IC disgorged itself all over the UK, and\nbeyond. Things were no better on the\nmotorway; the middle lane, as usual,\nwas full of idiots doing sixty. Sixty? In the\nmiddle lane? Sitting in the back seat, it\nwas hard to express my disgust without\nresorting to colourful language. These\npeople possess cars with 1.2 litre\nengines, listen to Tina Turner, like their\nsteaks done medium.\nAll Campbell drink shandy and, a decade ago, would doubtless have been voting SDP.\nDespite the black ice, gale force\nwinds and poor lane selection, I got back\nto Liverpool eventually. Chip shops were\n40% cheaper, and didn't serve soggy\nchips; haircuts cost \u00a33.70; the 86 bus still\nwent the same way as it always has,\ncosting a measly 60p for students, and\nthe beer was seriously cheap.\nIt's Christmas Eve. While it's likely to\nbe freezing in metro centric London, I 've\ncome to the pub in just at shirt. It's9:30p.m.. and the place is simply packed\nwith people I used to know. Well, that's not exactly true, but I'm hoping someone\nmight turn up later. And turn up they do.\nIn no particular order: some drunken\nlads (mates from times long gone); three\ngirls from school who utterly failed to\nrecognise me for ages; the guy I used to\nsit next to in English, who once again had\nme giggling nervously behind my textbook (actually, it was a pint), somebody's once-sweet little brother who is now 18,\nhas a skinhead, and smokes like a bas-tard; and three of my best friends from\nhalcyon days, one of whom is now at IC.\n(All right, Dave?!) And suddenly, it hits\nme: this is what it's all about. My Christmas shopping is done, tomorrow is\nChristmas Day; and I'm back in the local\nwith the best of friends. The everyday\ntribulations of dirty, polluted London are\nirrelevant. There's a bunch of people\nplaying on a giant Connect Four board,\nand frankly, I can't contain a giant sigh\nof relief.\n(Enter moral of story, stage left,\nclutching stomach.) It's not surprising\neveryone's a bit disgruntled at this time\nof year; life gets so boring if you let it.\nLondon alone contains six million odd\ninhabitants; how many of them do you\nknow? There's a whole world out there;\nopportunities, experiences, people to be\nmet. Don't come complaining to me if\nyou spent the whole year stuck in your\nbedroom.\nTelevision Renaissance\nWhat's going on at\nSTOIC?\nSTOIC is the ICU television society, and\nwe are based in a Studio Complex on the\ntop floor of the Union Building. We\nhave everything here to produce live\nand edited television programmes. Catch\nus in the JCR and around the Union Building.\n^ Schedule ^\nTuesday\nIC you The show all about ICU's many clubs\nand societies.\nThursday\nSTOIC live\nOur eclectic, lively magazine pro-gram me, where we show you all the\nstuff we couldn't fit in anywhere else.\nFriday\nSomething for the weekend\nAll that's happening in London this\nweekend. Nightbus not included.\nOver the holidays\nwe have gutted the\nplace, integrating the\nlatest in digital editing\nand mixing technology.\nShuffling everything\naround has also given\nus much more space\nto sit about and talk -occasionally even\nabout programmes.\nLast term was the\nfirst time in two years\nthat STOIC produced\nregular programming,\nbroadcasting two lively\nshows each week. Building up the\nschedule after such a lengthy period of\ninactivity has not been easy, but our\nshows are now quite good - even if we\ndo say so ourselves. This term we intend\nto produce three live programmes a week and supplement our output with\nshort, recorded films. When we're not\nshowing live or recorded programmes\nthere will be our continuous text ser-vice, letting you know what's happening\naround college.\nIn the past significant effort was\nneeded to maintain professional video\nequipment and an eager team of b of fins stoic\nworked round the clock\nto keep STOIC up and\nrunning. This effort is\nno longer required, with\nreliable equipment\navailable at high street\nprices.\nThis year we have\nre-aligned STOIC, with\nless emphasis on technical wizardry, and\nmore opportunities to\nlearn how to make TV.\nOpportunities for people like you. We\npromise not to baffle\nyou with cries of XLR's, redheads and\nUmats - instead we'll help you to make\ngreat television which, secretly, haven't we all wanted to do? Don't let all the\nstairs put you off, there is a lift, so why\nnot pop by at lunchtime or on a Wednesday afternoon. Or drop us an email, our\naddress is below.\nEmail: stol c@ lc.ac.uk\nTel: (0171 59)48104\nWhat can STOIC do for\nyour club or society?\nThere's a whole heap of stuff that STOIC\ncan do to help publicise ICU societies.\nWe'll be in touch with societies soon to\nexplain in more detail (via the pigeon\nholes in the resource centre).\nIf you let us know about upcoming\nevents, we can advertise them on our\ntext service. This is a really easy way to get\nyour message to people around college,\nwithout any photocopying and blut ac. This term we are producing a series\nabout clubs and societies, we want to\nprovide all clubs with the chance to\nexplain what's going on and what they've\ngot coming up. Also if you are holding a special event, you can talk to us on our\nmagazine show - STOIC live. Alternatively, we will help you to produce a short video about your club.\nIf you are organising a big event,\nSTOIC can film it and duplicate tapes for\nsale. We normally only charge for the\ntapes, subject to agreement of a minimum tape order. If there is anything that\nwe can do for you, please do get in\ntouch.\n\n"
