    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\n10\nFreethinking\nDear Editor,\nIn the midst of the surging religious\nactivism on campus I would like\nto draw attention to an emerging\nICU club called the Freethinking\nCommunity.\nOver recent weeks the college\u2019s\noveractive religionists have been\nin full swing, plastering the noticeboards with posters advertising\nnumerous lunchtime debates. In a\nparticularly controversial event, one\nmember of the Christian Union presented a long monologue in which he\nmade a sweeping attack of Atheism.\nIn another event, people were invited to \u201cgrill a Christian\u201d, and cannibals of the college rejoiced.\nIn response to such radical out-bursts, some fellow non-believers\nhave begun to speak out against the\nbarrage of proselytising; in a previous letter one person even stated\nthat the religious zealots present a\n\u201cfarcical appearance\u201d, but in this\nletter I would like to express some\nsupport for the college\u2019s religious\ngroups. Although their diverse\nsupernatural beliefs are unconvincing to me, I am impressed by their\ncommunity spirit, their positive\noutlook on life, and their considerable generosity. It is high time\nthat \u2018non-believers\u2019 of the college\nunited in such a way, and I think the\nFreethinking Community provides\nthis opportunity.\nThe new club will not simply be\nantagonistic to religious believ-ers. Instead it has been given a\nbroad remit, allowing it to explore\nany challenging issues that interest freethinkers of the college. The\nCommunity could broach many\npressing topics, and perhaps it could\nhelp revive the college populace\nfrom its near-fatal state of apathy.\nAll the best,\nMarcus Ellington\nPhD Computing\nhttp://www.conversewith.me.uk/\nTraditions\nDear Dave,\nApologies in advance for being a\nwhiney old fart, but does anyone else\nfeel as I do about the current state of\nthe Union Pots?\n\u201cPots\u201d (the beer tankards behind\nthe Union Bar) are an important\nembodiment of the history of the\nUnion and a valuable historic record.\nThey catalog notable members of\nUnion folklore for the past century.\nMy complaints:\n1) The valuable historic record\nis not being maintained: I know of\nseveral pots which have not been\nengraved for more than a year\n(Council Chair being a notable\nexample).\n2) In my day, were you not to\nreturn a pot to the bar at the end\nof the night, you would be subject\nto the most serious sanctions. One\nDeputy President, who as the only\ncurrent 2 year DP should remain\nnameless, has taken to storing the\ntankard relating to his Office in his\noffice, in contravention of accepted\npractice.\nI feel it proper to remind this\nparticular sabbatical, that the pot\nbelongs not to him, but to the Union\nand all other names engraved\nhence. Should he persist in the rather ungentlemanly practice of guarding the pot thusly, he risks the wrath\nof countless predecessors, some of\nwhich are quite sturdy and formi-dable.\nSo let\u2019s treat this valuable archive\nas such; keep it on display in the bar\nfor all to enjoy and maintain and\ncherish it as it so richly deserves.\nOr else.\nLove and Hugs,\nAn Old Fart\n(Name and department supplied)\nTo publish or not to publish\nDear Editor,\nI was disappointed to read Iain\nHeaton\u2019s letter last week in which\nhe attacks your editorial skills and\nthe article that was published on\nconstruction projects. Quite frankly\nI find his letter \u201cnot that interesting\u201d, and suggest he disappears off\nto run the election campaign for\nhis friend, instead of wasting much\nsought after space in your quality\nnewspaper, with his drivel.\nYours sincerely,\nBob the Builder\n(Name and department supplied)\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk by 10pm Monday. Letters may be edited for\nlength but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nMaking poverty history\nBy Fen Beynon\nLast Thursday saw Nelson Mandela\nin Trafalgar Square, giving a speech\nto over 22,000 people. The former\nSouth African President, 86, recently\nannounced that he was retiring from\npublic life but said, \u201cas long as pov-erty, injustice and gross inequality\npersist in our world, none of us can\ntruly rest\u201d.\nMake Poverty History, the UK\nfaction of the Global Campaign for\nAction Against Poverty, had donned\nthe front of the National Gallery with\na huge white sign to set the stage for\nthis event, to which they invited Bob\nGeldof, Oxfam\u2019s Adrian Lovett, South\nAfrican Kumi Naidoo of the World\nAlliance for Citizen Participation,\nband Frititi, singer Jamelia and TV\npresenter June Sarpong.\nMr Mandela, jailed for 27 years\nunder South Africa\u2019s apartheid laws,\nthanked the people of Britain for\ntheir support and help \u201cconsigning\nthat evil system forever to history\u201d\nbut followed on to point out that millions of people were still \u201ctrapped\nin the prison of poverty\u201d. The ways\nin which we can help these people,\naccording to Mandela and the worldwide campaign, are to ensure trade\njustice, end the debt crisis for the\npoorest countries and deliver more\nand better aid.\nThe Millennium Declaration in\n2000 had several aims. One of these\nwas \u201cto halve, by the year 2015, the\nproportion of the world\u2019s people\nwhose income is less than one dollar a day\u201d. This year, in September,\nworld leaders will gather to measure the progress they have made\non the Declaration. Mandela stated\nthe obvious: \u201cthe promise is falling tragically behind. Those leaders\nmust now honour their promises to\nthe world\u2019s poorest citizens.\u201d Kumi\nNaidoo pointed out, with a great\nresponse from the crowd, that world\nleaders could find billions of dollars\nfor an unjust war in Iraq but could\nnot honour their commitment to give\n0.7% of their nation\u2019s wealth in aid.\nThe Make Poverty History cam-paign, a UK alliance of over 200\ncharities, trade unions, campaigning\ngroups and celebrities, believes that\n2005 offers an exceptional opportunity for the UK to take a lead in\nturning things around. This is due\nto the combination of heading the\nEuropean Union and the hosting of\nthe G7 finance ministers meeting\nand the G8 summit.\nThe Group of Eight (G8) nations\nbegan in 1975 when the French\nPresident invited the leaders of\nJapan, the USA, Germany, the UK\nand Italy to discuss the economic\nproblems of the day, later expanding to include Canada and Russia.\nIt is up to the country holding the\nPresidency to set the agenda and\norganise the annual summit which\nwill be held in Gleneagles, Scotland\nin July this year with the main\nthemes being Africa and climate\nchange.\nCampaigners will surround the\nsite, as 70,000 did at the Birmingham\nG8 in 1998, demanding an end to the\ndebt crisis. This public show led the\nUK Government to make a significant advance. All of the debt owed\ndirectly to the Government by many\nof the world\u2019s poorest countries was\ncancelled and funding was given by\nthem to help some other countries\ncancel some of their debt too.\nThe day following the Trafalgar\nSquare rally, Mandela met the G7\n(G8 without Russia) ministers, the\nfinance ministers of the world\u2019s\nseven richest nations, who have\nbacked UK Chancellor Gordon\nBrown\u2019s plans to cancel \u201cthe vast\nbulk\u201d of money owed by the poorest countries. Mr Brown said that it\nwould be remembered as \u201cthe 100%\ndebt relief summit\u201d and also wants\nto provide $10 billion a year for a dec-ade, but needs G7 backing in order\nto borrow the money up front on the\nfinancial markets.\nThe UK also plans for an\nInternational Finance Facility (IFF)\nto help deal with debt, but the US\nwill not support it because of its\n\u201clegislative process\u201d according to\nUS Treasury Under-Secretary John\nTaylor, although they are \u201ccompletely committed to poverty reduction\nand providing financing to do that\u201d.\nThis seems to be a hopeful start,\nbut Mandela calls for \u201caction, not\nwords... with courage and vision\u201d.\nDespite the many promises from\nrich countries, many of the poorest\ncountries are becoming still poorer.\nMuch of this is due to the fact that\nthey have to spend so much on paying back the interest on their debt\n\u2013 in many cases, more per year than\nthey spend on health or education.\nThe Global Campaign for Action\nAgainst Poverty calls for these problems to be rectified by trade justice,\nrather than free trade, and a much\ngreater emphasis on giving more\npower to the poor countries in making decisions that will affect their\nfuture.\nNelson Mandela believes that poverty is not natural, just as apartheid\nand slavery were not and that overcoming it is not an act of charity, but\nan act of justice.\nFor more information on the campaign and forthcoming events, visit\nwww.makepovertyhistory.org. Show\nyour support by wearing a white\nwristband, available from Oxfam\nshops.\nA Make Poverty\nHistory banner\nis draped over\none of the lion\nstatues in Trafalgar Square,\nwhere Nelson\nMandela gave\nhis support to a\nglobal anti-pov-erty campaign\n\n"

And\nnow, well, it looks like things\nare going to get a lot better for Mr Blair. Love him\nor loathe him, he\u2019s a smooth\npolitical operator, and the\nGovernment may have just\nscored one its biggest tri-umphs: the democratic elections in Iraq.\nIt appears the largest Shia\nparty has won the majority\nof the votes, with the current\n(interim) Prime Minister\u2019s\nparty in second place.\nAnd the pro-war lot are\ncrowing. \u201cA beacon is lit in\nIraq. But not in your names,\nRobin (Cook), Douglas (Hurd)\nand the BBC,\u201d shouted The\nTimes, taking the argument\nto this conclusion: if you were\nagainst the invasion of Iraq,\nagainst removing Saddam\nHussein, then you are also\nagainst these elections and\nthe freedom now enjoyed in\nIraq. The paper takes the\nsuccess of the elections (with\na turnout beating that of\nBritain, by some accounts) as\nvindication for supporting the\nwar: \u201cIt is only by securing a\ndecisive shift towards democracy across the region that\nthe Middle East\u2019s peoples can\nbe relieved, and the threat to\nthe rest of us brought to an\nend.\u201d\nThe Telegraph compared\nthe violence currently erupting in Iraq, slightly dubiously\nbut with great effect, to South\nAfrica. \u201cCompare yesterday\u2019s\nreportswiththosebythesame\ncommentators during South\nAfrica\u2019s first democratic elec-tion. Then, too, there were\nmany technical problems:\nvoters who were not properly\nregistered, voter intimida-tion, long queues. But these\nthings were set in their proper context as the backdrop\nagainst which the moving\ndrama of people casting their\nfirst ballots was being played\nout. No-one suggested that\nthe clashes between IFP and\nANC supporters in Zululand\nundermined the whole proc-ess. No-one argued that the\nbacklash by a handful of black\nhomeland chieftains and Boer\nirreconcilables made South\nAfrica unfit for democracy.\u201d\nIt may be, as David\nAaronovitch, the only pro-war writer on The Guardian\nstaff, believes, that people\nhave got themselves onto a\nhook where they are unable\nto celebrate the return of\ndemocracy to Iraq because\nthey are still so furious with\nBush and Blair.\nAaronovitch claims that\n\u201copposition to the actions of\nBush and Blair has become\u2026\nan utter failure to identify\nwith those extraordinarily\nbrave Iraqis who are fighting\nfor democracy.\u201d He encourages British liberals to move\non. \u201cNow is all that matters.\nNot whether you were for or\nagainst the war, for or against\nBlair, for or against Bush. Are\nyou for or against democracy\nin Iraq? The rest is air.\u201d\nSince the elections, this has\nquieted down slightly. News\nof more car bombs has lessened the hysteria, and Bush\u2019s\ninauguration speech has\novershadowed everything\nelse. But beware, woolly liberal readers: you are now more\nunfashionable than ever.\nIraqi democracy\nA triumph for Bush and Blair?\nImperial students chosen for\nsport scholarship scheme\nFive Imperial students have\nbeen selected for the government funded Talented Athlete\nScholarship Scheme (TASS).\nThe programme awards\nscholarships and bursaries\nto talented athletes who are\ncommitted to combining\nsport with their education.\nIt aims to reduce the dropout rate of gifted athletes\nfrom sport, and supports and\ndevelops the talent of today\nfor sporting success in the\nfuture.\nRhonda Sturley (judo),\nTristan Lane (fencing), Robin\nNicholson, Chris Archer and\nSimon Hislop (all rowing) will\nall benefit from the scheme.\nFor further information on\nTASS and details on eligibility\nto apply, please contact Nick\nGore, the College\u2019s Sports\nDevelopment Officer, on\nn.gore@ic.ac.uk or 020 7594\n1164.\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nFelix can reveal that the\nImperial College Union shop\nand newsagent are, once\nagain, selling three Cadbury\u2019s\nCreme Eggs for just 90p.\nThe shop and the newsa-gent, located on the Sherfield\nWalkway, expect to be inundated by crazed students desperate for the fondant-filled\ntreats over the coming days.\nDefying inflation, shop managers have decided not to\nraise the price after the eggs\nproved so popular last year.\nWill Dugdale, assistant\nmanager of the Union shop\nand a former editor of this\nnewspaper, said: \u201cFollowing\nlast year\u2019s debaucherous\negg-related behaviour from\nthe students of Imperial\nCollege, I\u2019d like to take this\nopportunity to deny rumours\nthat we\u2019ll be hiring Renegade\nSecurity staff as a precautionary measure.\u201d\nPhil Stewart, a former\nnewsagent supervisor, told\nFelix: \u201cI do admit I fear the\nreal possibility of a Great\nCreme Egg Rush once word\nhas got out.\u201d\nCreme Eggs were first sold\nby Cadbury Brothers in 1923,\nbut the eggs as we now know\nthem were not produced until\n1971.\nInterestingly, the Cadbury\nSchweppes website claims\nthat \u201cthe Cadbury Creme\nEgg plant at Bournville can\nproduce more than 1.5 million\neggs per day\u201d. It is unclear\nwhether the word \u2018plant\u2019\nrefers to a factory or some\nsort of magical photosynthetic organism.\nCadbury\u2019s Creme Egg is the\nUK\u2019s best selling confectionery item between 1 January\nand Easter. Over 200 million\nof the eggs are sold annually\n\u2013 that\u2019s three for every UK\nresident.\nThe \u201chow do you eat yours?\u201d\nadvertising campaign is now\nsynonymous with the eggs,\nwhich have been promoted\nwith great effect in recent\nyears by the likes of George\nDawes and the characters\nfrom Spitting Image.

After considering this, I\nhave come to the conclusion\nthat I don\u2019t have anything startling to reveal (well, legally\nanyway) and that being witty\nis difficult when challenged,\nas people who know me are\nvery much aware.\nTherefore I will start the\narticle like this: those who\nare disappointed can send a\nstamped self-addressed envelope with \u00a310 in used notes\nto me and I will send a written apology. And with that,\nhere\u2019s this weeks topic of\nminor insanity \u2013 the Ultimate\nWheel!\nThe Ultimate Wheel is the\nideal thing for people who\nthink unicycling is for wus-sies. If you can unicycle, the\nmost obvious thing is surely to\ntake the seat away for added\ndifficulty, right? You wouldn\u2019t\nthink it is possible, but some\nsanity-deprived individuals\ncan actually transport themselves on this device, which\nbasically consists of a wheel\nwith two pedals and nothing\nelse. Only the mentally disturbed need apply.\nIn order to ride this lunatic\ncontraption, the first step is\nto put your feet on it. Our\ncarefully selected model (no\nexpense spared) demonstrates [see picture 1].\nThe next thing to do is\nmount the Wheel properly\n[see picture 2]. Thankfully,\nthe pedals are quite sticky so\nyour feet don\u2019t fall off, unless\nyou crash, in which case they\ntend to sever your tendons.\nJust consider it fair warning.\nYou can either mount with the\nassistance of a wall or lamp-post, or free mount which is\nharder \u2013 you just jump on and\npray. See the Big Red Ball\nepisode for more information\non the importance of prayer.\nAfter that, pedal. Try to\nkeep the Wheel upright [see\npicture 3]. I appreciate that\nthis is probably obvious,\nbut the faster you go, the\neasier it is to keep going. If\nyou have done this indoors,\nyou\u2019re about to find a small\nproblem with the Ultimate\nWheel...\nChanging direction. You\u2019re\nprobably quite pleased that\nyou\u2019ve not suffered major\ndamage by now, but this state\nof affairs is about to change\nunless you move away from\nthe looming wall. In order\nto achieve this, wrench your\nhips in one direction, hard,\nand put your weight slightly\nover to that side [see picture\n4]. Now push your vertebrae\nback into place.\nFinally, you\u2019ve got to get\noff. I recommend falling \u2013 it\u2019s\neasier and almost a foregone\nconclusion after a while.\nAlternatively you can step off,\nbut the net effect is much the\nsame [see picture 5].\nWell, that\u2019s it. If anyone\nhas an Ultimate Wheel that\nthey didn\u2019t know how to use,\nthey do now. If, for whatever\nreason, you don\u2019t have one\n(and lets face it \u2013 why not,\ndammit?) you can always use\nours.

Simple!\ns\n1 2 3\n4 5\n(Instru)mental was created\nlast October with the aim of\ngiving me an opportunity to\ntake the music I listen to and\npresent it to anyone who is\ninterested. The emphasis is\non the tougher varieties of\ndance music, in particular\nhard house and hard trance.\nThe basic structure is an\neclectic first hour, with a\nbroad spectrum of dance\nmusic, followed by a live mix\nin the second hour, where I\npick the latest hard dance and\nput it alongside some older\nmaterial, all for the listening pleasure of anyone who\ntunes in.\nAlthough the above is a\nfairly accurate description\nof my show, I think it fails\nto capture the real spirit of\nIC Radio. I\u2019m certainly not a\nprofessional, and although IC\nRadio does produce shows of\na high quality, the emphasis is\nmuch more about having fun\nthan producing something\ngroundbreaking.\nFor most of the shows I do,\nI simply arrive with a stack\nof vinyl and a rough idea of\nthe order I want to play it in.\nI think this is typical of most\nof the specialist music shows\non ICRadio \u2013 there is a strong\nfeeling amongst us that it\u2019s\nthe music that matters, and\nthat too much preparation\nsomehow spoils it all!\nAlso typical is that I play\nwhat I want to. There are\nplenty of opportunities for\npeople to come in and play\nmore mainstream music,\nor even do news and current affairs, but the brilliant\nthing about IC Radio (or\nindeed any student radio) is\nthat we are your radio sta-tion, and part of the reason\nwe exist is to let students\nof all musical tastes share\ntheir passion. The chances\nare that at university you will\nalways find someone whose\nmusical tastes are similar to\nyours, and specialist music\nshows are about presenting\nthat music both to people who\nknow and love it, and also to\npeople who might not have\ncome across it before.\nIt\u2019s easy to get bored with\nthe music policy of the Union.\nR\u2019n\u2019B and drum and bass are\nalright, but the Union really\nlacks the variety of specialist\nmusic that student radio can\noffer.\nAs I fade out the latest Short\nCircuit promo and switch\nback to our sustain service,\nI can\u2019t help but wonder why\nmore people don\u2019t do what I\ndo. The opportunity to play\nthe music you love on air is\nvery rare outside university.\nLocking up the studio for the\nnight, I walk out of Beit Quad\nand pass some people leaving\nthe Union. I can\u2019t help but\nthink they are missing out.\nIC RADIO\nI\u2019m special too\nIn the first of a series of articles, we showcase one of IC Radio\u2019s many specialist music shows\n(Instru)mental\nPresented by: Anno Domini\nStyle: Hard dance\nWhen: Wednesdays\n10pm-midnight\nHow to listen:\nwww.icradio.com\nCurrent big tunes:\nBK & DAVE the drummer\n\u2013 Riot EP4\nDave Holmes \u2013 Samsara\n(Nick Sentience Remix)\nChris C & Madam Zu meet\nBen Kaye \u2013 Rock The Target\n(Barely Legal Remix)\nIC Radio: turn it up!\n\n"

    "content": "Columns felix@ic.ac.uk\nCharity shops are where it\u2019s at. That\nand the Apple store. You see, as a\nstudent, you should be minding the\npennies, as apparently most stuff\ncosts money. Like food, washing\nproducts (the stuff your mum gets\nyou for Christmas) and most importantly beer, clothes and tickets.\nIt\u2019s hard being a student, because\nwhilst sleeping is cheap, and very\neasy to do, interesting stuff usually\ncosts money. Now there\u2019s no way\naround this, especially as shoplifting is usually frowned upon (except\nin BHS where they\u2019re just glad to\nsee the stock out of the door at\nlast). So how do you cobble together the money to afford that latest,\nmust-have pair of shoes? Or that\nextra pint, or that pizza? By saving\nmoney on the rest of your clothes\nof course!\nUniversity is the only time when\nit\u2019s acceptable to wear old, not-quite-retro-cool clothes and look\nlike a bedraggled sheep. You can\neither buy the aforementioned stuff\nin a \u2018trendy\u2019 shop for \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s or you can\nbuy it in a charity shop for only \u00a3s.\nThe best thing about living in\nsouth west London is that the quality of clothing in the charity shops\nis much better than average. It\u2019s\npot luck admittedly, but quite often\nyou can find Ralph Lauren shirts\nand so on mixed in between the\nold ladies\u2019 bras and massive pants;\nthough this is not a task for the\nfainthearted. The more you look,\nthe more you\u2019ll find treasures such\nas an original Elton John LP\n, or a\ncrushed velvet suit for \u00a315. The idea\nthat you are wearing someone\u2019s\ndead grandfather\u2019s kecks only troubles you slightly for approximately\nthe rest of your life. Until you wash\nthem.\nThe best thing is that it\u2019s all for\ncharity \u2013 like RAG. In other words,\nyou get to enjoy yourself and get\na fantastic bargain, whilst helping\nout the unfortunate. Of course it\nwould be better just to donate, but\naltruism really is dead nowadays.\nAmongst those with no money of\ncourse. Bill Gates loves donating,\nbut then he does still get all his\nclothes from charity shops, so it\u2019s\nkind of obligatory.\nSo next time you want clothes,\ntake a gander at the fabulous stuff\nin a charity shop (NB: Notting Hill\nCharity has better stuff than Oxfam)\nand amaze friends by your knowledge of fashion trends when that\n1920s tux you\u2019ve been wearing for\na year suddenly comes back into\nfashion. Another plus point is that\nyou can get absolutely trashed in\ncharity clothes and not give a toss\n\u2013 it\u2019s not like you paid \u00a3120 for a pair\nof orange trousers that melt when\nyour mum \u201caccidentally\u201d irons\nthem. Do it, it\u2019s for a good cause,\nand because no-one likes seeing\nyour bum.\nOne man\u2019s rubbish is another man\u2019s\ncharity is another man\u2019s treasure\nby TRISTAN LANE\nSuccessive rejections can only make\n\u2018Her storminess\u2019 stronger. That\u2019s\nhow I, the recipient of such declarations to the point where they merge\ninto one, have got to a position at\nwhich I find said experience comi-cal, to say the least!\nThe performances put before me,\nby these substandard village drama\nsociety actors in the film reel of\nuniversity life, are comparable to\nmovie-oke (think karaoke in front\nof a silenced movie picture) performers break-dancing to a boudoir\nscene. They compel me to laugh\nout loud as yet another guy whose\nintimate company I\u2019d previously\nenjoyed declares himself \u201cnot ready\nto have a relationship\u201d.\nThe giggling continues in order\nto make him feel presumptive and\nused, for assuming that I was so\nenthused by his company that I\ncouldn\u2019t live without it! Believe me\nguys, \u2019tis wiser not to flatter your-selves, as not every Asian female, or\nfemale full stop for that matter, who\ntakes an interest in you is looking to\ntrap you into eventual matrimony, a\nharem of children and the obligatory\nweekend IKEA expeditions. Most of\nus would rather (sensibly I might\nadd, given the quality of Imperial\nmen) play the field until someone\nfitter, richer or more stimulating\ncomes along!\nThis brings us neatly to the subject\nof this week\u2019s column, entitled \u2018aesthetic admiration of a sexual nature\u2019,\nor \u2018perving over computer room\nguy\u2019. Perving is certainly an activity\nwe all partake in, especially if we fit\nneatly into the two groups I relate\nthe best to \u2013 the single (I haven\u2019t\nhad a boyfriend for three years, an\nalmost unachievable feat in a 70%\nmale institution) and looking (hav-ing your two best friends fall in love\nwith capable, emotionally supportive\nmen, is definitely envy-inducing in a\ngirl who can\u2019t keep a guy interested\nin her for more than four hours).\nPerving takes place on three levels\n\u2013 the scan (to find whether there is\nanything worth staring at), the purely physical (on the guys you find aesthetically perfect, but lacking in per-sonality) and the holistical (where\nintellectual and emotional attraction\ninteract with the physical). I\u2019m sure\nwe\u2019re all guilty as charged.\nThe ultimate form of superficial\nflattery (from the beholder) is a great\nway to make that essay in the computer labs complete. Incidentally,\nI have three guys who make my\nmornings pass quicker (holistically,\nof course; I don\u2019t purely lust over\nmen with nicknames such as \u2018the\nbody\u2019) in said location.\nOne is cute and funny (I\u2019d overheard him conversing with others\non a number of occasions \u2013 very\nfine dry sense of humour there!)\nwith very bad teeth, hence better\nviewed with mouth closed (if blond\nsurfer guys take your fancy). I\u2019ve\nbeen admiring him from afar for a\nyear or two \u2013 especially shocking\nwhen you realise he\u2019s a medic, and\nmedics are generally conservative\nto the point of stone dullness.\nOne day, the very day I acquainted\nmyself with him, I overslept and\ndidn\u2019t make it in to a lecture. Rather\nproductively, I decided to go and\nwork on my essay instead. I didn\u2019t\nget any work done, since said guy\nwas surfing rathergood.com and\nrealised I needed to burn my essay\nonto a CD, since I\u2019d recklessly\nbroken my A-drive whilst getting\nbusy on my desk with the conquest\nresponsible for the best movie-oke\nperformance the previous week. I\nfind younger men tend be better\nlooking, more passionate in bed, and\nfar more authentic in their blub-bering, so I tend to seek these out\nfor a quick fling or ten. Back to the\npoint of interest, who, incidentally,\nhappens to be a second year student\n\u2013 computer room guy.\nScary, but true: I didn\u2019t know how\nto burn a CD off a university computer at that point. Perfect, convenient\ntiming to pounce on my prey \u2013 the\nonly other person in the room.\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019ve been trying to\nburn a CD, but the drive doesn\u2019t\nread. Do you have any idea what I\u2019m\ndoing wrong?\u201d\n\u201cShow me what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\nI bent over, leaning over him so my\nbreast barely touched his shoulder,\nand showed him exactly what I\u2019d\ntried. He tried figuring out what to\ndo, whilst attempting to chat me up.\nExcellent.\n\u201cWere you at the Velvet Revolver\ngig on Tuesday?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes, thought I\u2019d saw you there.\nAmazing wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, brilliant stuff. Didn\u2019t think\nScott had it in him at this age.\u201d\n\u201cWho did you go with? My mate\nsaid she\u2019d seen you with an older\nwoman.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s my mother. She thought\nshe\u2019d take me out to dinner... and I\nhad a spare ticket. She had a wicked\ntime.\u201d\nHe blew it then and there. This\nwas too wrong to be true \u2013 nobody\ntakes their mother out for a night of\ncomplete decadence and debauch-ery. I looked at him, shocked beyond\nbelief, and he smiled, in the mistaken belief that I\u2019d find such a\nrepulsive concept adorable, revealing the dirtiest mouth I\u2019d ever seen\non a non-pensioner. I didn\u2019t want to\nhang around to find out whether his\nbreath was similarly odious.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to fix this for\nyou. How about you go to the technician\u2019s room?\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a plan. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you around sometime,\nyeah? My mate\u2019s band is playing a\ngig next week \u2013 I\u2019d love to catch up\nwith you again.\u201d\nOh shit. He fancies me.

So many students are members of clubs and it\u2019s\na fantastic service. The Union has\nto be there to handle the bureaucracy and make sure the clubs can\ndo what they want to do. Having\nbeen involved on the club side, I also\nwanted to be involved on the Union\nside and put something back in.\nIf you\u2019re elected, how will you\nmake a noticeable difference\nto students\u2019 lives at Imperial?\nMy main aim is to be there for the\nclub officers. Hopefully if I do my job\nwell, the students should know nothing about me. If I\u2019m working effec-tively, they shouldn\u2019t have any cause\nto moan and won\u2019t hear about me.\nWhat\u2019s your view on the\nredevelopment of Beit Quad\nand its effect on clubs and\nsocieties?\nSome proposals have been made\nto change the nature of the Union\ngym, and this concerns me a lot,\nespecially as we\u2019re going to be closing Southside in July and the Sports\nCentre potentially could be late. I\ndon\u2019t think we should change the\nnature of the gym until we know for\nsure we\u2019re going to have somewhere\nto put all the clubs.\nDo you think there should be\na separate sabbatical officer\nto deal with sports clubs?\nThat\u2019s a very interesting issue,\nbecause obviously the sports clubs\nand the non-sports clubs have a lot\nof differences. I don\u2019t think we need\nanother sabbatical officer to deal\nwith clubs. The CSC chairs have to\nwork very hard to do the jobs that\nthey do, but I think they do them\nreally well.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nI think its important that we have\ncontinuity. That\u2019s why, in my\nmanifesto, I\u2019m not really saying\nthat I\u2019ll try to make huge changes.\nBut the one thing we really need\nis online forms, online documentation \u2013 it would be so much more\nefficient.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of Simon or RON?\nSimon says he\u2019d like to make sure\nthat every club or society has a\nhome. This just isn\u2019t a feasible aim.\nWe only have a limited amount of\nspace and we have to make the\nbest of what we\u2019ve got. I want to\nrun an organised and efficient system to represent the clubs so that\ntheir problems are dealt with swiftly\nand they\u2019re not waiting around for\nthings to get processed or to get\nanswers.\nJAMES THATCHER\nWhy are you standing?\nMostly because it seems like a fairly\nnatural progression. I started off\nas treasurer of the Science Fiction\nsociety, and then I took over the\nSCC treasurer role because it was\nquite frankly crap and I thought I\ncould do the job better. Then I took\nover the SCC Chair role, so I\u2019ve just\nbeen moving up, so to speak, getting\nthings better organised and making things better for everyone else\naround.\nWhat\u2019s your view on the\nredevelopment of Beit Quad\nand its effect on clubs and\nsocieties?\nIt gives us a good opportunity, but\nobviously we need to be careful,\nbecause there\u2019s going to be a big\nproblem with gym space. At the top\nof the building, we could make much\nbetter use of the space up there, and\nrenovation will give us the opportunity to do that.\nDo you think there should be\na separate sabbatical officer\nto deal with sports clubs?\nI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s needed. I\nthink if you have a separate sabbatical for sports you\u2019re just going to be\nduplicating work and people aren\u2019t\ngoing to be working as efficiently\nand effectively. Possibly you might\nwant some extra support to help\nthe ACC exec organise things, but I\ndon\u2019t think we need an extra sabb.\nOne of your goals is to \u201csee\nevery club have a home\u201d. Is\nthat realistic?\nIt\u2019s not entirely. It\u2019s what my dream\nwould be, so to speak. Even if it\u2019s\na room shared between five or ten\nclubs, having a home just gives you\nthe stability so you can work with\nyour members and get them more\ninvolved.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nPersonally my goals are to make\nan immediate impact and improve\nthings like room bookings, communication between clubs, and get the\nwhole system working smoothly.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of James or RON?\nVoting RON is a bad option because\nit just means that the elections have\nto happen again, you\u2019re unlikely to\nget any new candidates, and you\u2019re\njust backing yourself into a corner\nand making things worse. As for\nJames, the big difference is our\nbackgrounds \u2013 he has very limited\nand narrow experience, whereas\nI\u2019ve got a much better track record\nof getting things done and a much\nbroader experience of things around\nthe Union.\nSIMON MATTHEWS\nWhy are you standing?\nI\u2019m standing because I\u2019m eager to\nhave an input in the Union. I\u2019m an\ninternational student myself, I\u2019ve\ndepended quite a lot on the services\nof the Union, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sensitive to students\u2019 needs in general,\nconcerning their welfare and their\neducation. I\u2019ve been a rep, and I\nthink students have the right to be\ninvolved and say what they think.\nHow would you address the\nrecent problems with exam\nand lecture timetables?\nConcerning exams, the problem this\nyear was mainly with aeronautics,\nbecause the exams were straight\nafter the Christmas holiday, which\nwas really short. I can make changes for the future, but not for the next\nfew years because term dates have\nalready been set, As for lectures\nbeing at the wrong time of day, I\nthink this is an issue that has to\nbe dealt with. It\u2019s important that\nstudents get a break during the day,\nand I\u2019m sure there\u2019s another timeslot apart from lunchtime that can\nbe used.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents?\nI think hall rent increases have to\nbe fair, and my vision of fair is that\nall halls should increase in the same\nway. I think students should have a\nsay on whether they want an expensive or a cheap room.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nI want to galvanise the dep rep\nscheme.\nHow would you do that?\nFirstly I need to make sure that dep\nreps are enthusiastic about being\ndep reps, because their job is to get\nfeedback from students. Students\naren\u2019t really that responsive, sometimes they\u2019re shy, so I think it\u2019s\nimportant that dep reps go up and\nask them and make sure everything\u2019s OK, otherwise they won\u2019t get\nthat feedback.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of Aleks or RON?\nBecause I think I am determined\nenough, I\u2019m a very friendly and outspoken person, and I think people\nneed to have a connection with the\nperson doing that job.\nSARAH KHATIB\nWhy are you standing?\nI\u2019ve used the welfare system before,\nand I\u2019m quite confident so I know\nwho to talk to. Not everyone is confi-dent, and not everyone knows what\nis there. I want to make people more\naware, and I think I can do that.\nYou say you \u201cwould like to\nsee more subjects introducing reading weeks\u201d. Why?\nI think people might pick up on that\nwrong. What I really meant was not\nnecessarily a reading week as such,\nbut more time to prepare for exams,\nbecause you can\u2019t do well in exams\nwhen you haven\u2019t got time to prepare for them. That affected me this\nyear, and I was just outraged.\nIf you had a reading week,\nwouldn\u2019t you have to lose\nsome lectures as a result?\nNo. If the lecturers plan their time\nwell, then there\u2019s no problem with\nit, surely.\nIf you\u2019re elected, how will you\nmake a noticeable difference\nto students\u2019 lives at Imperial?\nHaving more time to do their work\nwould make people less stressed,\nand they\u2019d enjoy themselves more.\nPeople need to realise that the\nUnion is there for them.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents?\nI think the students should be able\nto choose what price bracket they\u2019re\nin. Costs should be different across\nthe halls, but rents shouldn\u2019t be\nbased on students\u2019 ability to pay\n\u2013 there are so many grants out there\nfor students if they need them.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nI\u2019d like to see more awareness for\ndisabled people and people with\nlearning disabilities, because it\u2019s\npushed under the carpet a bit. I\u2019d\nalso like to get more postgrads\ninvolved within the Union.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of Sarah or RON?\nI\u2019ve been working at the Union for\nfour years and I know a lot of different people throughout the College\nto talk to, not just students. They\nshould vote for me because I\u2019m going\nto be better! I\u2019ve got fantastic people\nskills and I\u2019m well organised.\nALEKS CORR\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (EDUCATION & WELFARE)\n\u25cf The DP(E&W) is responsible for promoting important welfare issues and safe-guarding the education of students\n\u25cf There are 2 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)\n\n"

I\u2019ve taken an\nactive role in clubs and societies,\nand I have management experience\nfrom summer placements working\nin industry. Also ICU is a big team\noperation, and I\u2019m able to motivate\nstaff and fellow student officers.\nWhat\u2019s the single most\nimportant thing a students\u2019\nunion can do for its\nmembers?\nRepresentation, because nobody\nelse can do it. The Union is the only\nbody charged with that responsibil-ity.\nShould Imperial College\nUnion be campaigning to\nfree Babar Ahmad?\nPersonally I think it\u2019s an issue of\nconscience. If the majority of students are in favour of it, then we\nshould go for it.\nWhat about other political\nissues, such as \u2018stop George\nBush\u2019 or pulling British troops\nout of Iraq?\nPersonally I think it\u2019s a great idea,\nlet\u2019s go and campaign for every-thing... but it comes down to a question of resources, and we have to use\nour resources in the best interests\nof the students. At the end of the\nday, you have to do the sums, and\nit might be better to put money into\nstaff than campaign against George\nBush.\nThe current President\nclaimed to work 100 hours\na week during the autumn\nterm. How would you manage\nthe workload?\nIt comes down to prioritising.\nThere\u2019s an awful lot of work that\nlands on the President\u2019s desk,\nand a lot of it is important, but I\u2019m\nsure some of it is not important.\nIt\u2019s a case of choosing those things\nthat you actually need to do and delegating the rest as appropriate.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents? Should they be based\non students\u2019 ability to pay?\nFrom the Union\u2019s perspective we\nneed to argue for equality, and I\nthink in these terms that means\nequal rent for equal accommoda-tion.\nIn your manifesto, you say the\nCollege must put students\nfirst. How will you make sure\nthey do that?\nBy working with them, not against\nthem. I don\u2019t think confrontation\nbenefits the students. We also need\nto show them what we can do for\nthem \u2013 it\u2019s not a one-way game. The\nCollege need to put students as their\nfirst priority but also need to understand the Union can do things for the\nCollege that the College can\u2019t necessary do as well for themselves.\nHow will you make your\nmanifesto pledges happen?\nFirst of all, persuade people within\nthe current Union structure that\nthese pledges are worth delivering\non, then following through to make\nsure they happen.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nNot to change anything unless I had\na good reason. I think, particularly\nwith the strategic review, there will\nbe a lot of changes arising, not necessarily done in the best interests of\nthe students. It\u2019s important to think\nabout whether changes will help\nstudents before we make them.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nI\u2019m competent, capable and committed to doing the job. What I think\nsets me apart from the rest are my\nskills as a leader, communicator and\nteam worker.\nJAMES DEVINE\nWhy are you standing for\nPresident?\nI want to get a Union that the students are proud of. I\u2019ve got the\nexperience and the knowledge from\nbeing a Deputy President this year.\nI want to make sure that clubs and\nsocieties don\u2019t have the ridiculous\nhassle of paperwork that we put on\nthem \u2013 it should be done online. I\nwant to ensure that the Union continues with the projects it\u2019s started\nthis year, such as the refurbishment\nproject and the strategic review.\nWhat\u2019s the single most\nimportant thing a students\u2019\nunion can do for its\nmembers?\nGive them what they want, and\nserve them in the way they want to\nbe served.\nShould Imperial College\nUnion be campaigning to\nfree Babar Ahmad?\nI think if students have a passion\nfor something then they should be\nencouraged to follow that passion.\nSo if they have a passion for this\ncause, they should be given advice\nand helped to follow it. However, I\ndon\u2019t feel that Union backing actually improves the situation in this case.\nI don\u2019t feel that having a Council\nmotion actually helps this cause.\nWhat about other political\nissues, such as \u2018stop George\nBush\u2019 or pulling British troops\nout of Iraq?\nAt the end of the day, if students\nhave a passion for something, they\nshould be supported in terms of\nadvice and ideas, but the students\u2019\nunion needs to be dealing with students\u2019 issues primarily.\nThe current President\nclaimed to work 100 hours\na week during the autumn\nterm. How would you manage\nthe workload?\nI\u2019ve already been a Deputy, so I am\ncapable of doing it, and I do spend\na lot of time working this year. The\nfact that I have the experience and\nthe knowledge of deputising this\nyear means that I don\u2019t need to\nspend the time learning the job.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents?\nWe need to ensure that the price of\naccommodation doesn\u2019t deter students from living in our halls or coming to our university. We also need\nto ensure that there\u2019s sufficient help\nfor students who can\u2019t afford our\nprices, such as by making sure there\nare always options available to share\nrooms to reduce the cost.\nShould rents be based on\nstudents\u2019 ability to pay?\nI think we need to look at the students\u2019 ability to pay, but we also\nneed to look at the bursaries and\nhelp that are available.\nBut should richer students\npay more for the same quality\nof accommodation? Yes or\nno?\nOne thing I\u2019ve found is that the\npeople who lose out in the system\nare just on the borderline, paying\nprices that are high and they just\nabout can afford. I think the issue is\nthat we need to ensure that financial\naid is available for students who are\nunable to pay the higher prices.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nImprove the communication,\nmaking it a more approachable\nand proactive Union that\u2019s positive\nin getting things done and making them happen. I want it to be a\nstudents\u2019 union that students are\nproud of.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nBecause I\u2019ve got the experience\nand the knowledge to make changes\nhappen. I\u2019ve already proved myself\nby fulfilling most of my manifesto\npledges from last year, even though\nI\u2019ve still got six months in office\nleft. I\u2019ve played a leading role in big\nprojects that this Union is under-taking, like refurbishment and the\nstrategic review. We need someone\nwho can hit the ground running and\ncontinue these projects, rather than\nhaving to learn them.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nWhy are you standing for\nPresident?\nI\u2019m standing because I want to make\na difference. Over the last three and\na half years that I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve\nfelt that people don\u2019t get involved\nenough with the Union, and I think I\ncan change that.\nHow?\nFirst of all, I think the website and\nFelix are underused for two-way\ncommunucation. I think the sabbs in\ntheir regular inputs to Felix should\nmake it clear what they\u2019ve done\nover the past couple of weeks, so\nstudents know. Also, with the web-site, it would be so easy to create\na forum where students can post\ntheir comments and questions to the\nsabbs. It wouldn\u2019t take long to reply,\nand I think it should be demanded\nof sabbs to take 15 to 30 minutes to\nsit down and answer questions from\nthe students, so people feel that\ntheir queries are being answered.\nWhat\u2019s the single most\nimportant thing a students\u2019\nunion can do for its\nmembers?\nI think it\u2019s got to be the represen-tation, which I think is especially\nimportant for our union. Not enough\npeople are interested, and the Union\ncan\u2019t represent students\u2019 views to\nthe College or cater for their opinions and demands if students don\u2019t\nget involved.\nShould Imperial College\nUnion be campaigning to\nfree Babar Ahmad?\nIn my opinion, no. I think political\nissues that deal with things that\nare directly relevant to students,\nsuch as top-up fees and hall rents,\nare issues where the Union should\ncampaign on behalf of the students.\nBut on other political issues such as\nBabar Ahmad and the war in Iraq, I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the Union\nto have a stance, because it would\nseem that the Union was dictating\nto the students what their opinion\nshould be. It should be the role of\nthe Union to ensure that people can\nexpress their views and act within\nthe law to support those views, such\nas through demonstrations.\nThe current President\nclaimed to work 100 hours\na week during the autumn\nterm. How would you manage\nthe workload?\nIt\u2019s a good question... I think everybody at some point will have worked\nthat amount for their degree, if\nyou\u2019ve got lots of coursework due in\non one day, or in the last few weeks\nbefore your exams. I\u2019ve worked that\nhard some weeks for my degree and\nnever buckled under the pressure.\nThere will be weeks when you can\ntake it slightly easier.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents? Should they be based\non students\u2019 ability to pay?\nI can see the logic behind standard-ising all hall accommodation, but at\nthe end of the day, there are people\nwho aren\u2019t able to pay \u00a3150 a week,\nso there should be cheaper rooms\nthat cater for what people are able\nto pay.\nYour manifesto promises to\nmake the Union \u201ca venue that\ncaters for everyone\u201d. How\nwill you achieve that?\nAt the moment, what hits you when\nyou walk in is the bar, basically. We\nhave late licences on Wednesdays\nand Fridays, all broadly based on\na European mentality of going out.\nBut at the moment we have 40%\noverseas students, people who come\nfrom a culture that doesn\u2019t involve\ngoing out for a pint, and I think they\nshould be catered for. I think the\nsuggestion of having a coffee bar\nin place of Da Vinci\u2019s is one of the\ngreatest suggestions made by the\nUnion this year \u2013 somewhere people\ncan go where there\u2019s no suggestion\nof alcohol consumption around them\nand where they can go and sit in the\nafternoon.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nI think it\u2019s the kind of person that\nI am, I\u2019m a lot different to the\nPresidents that we\u2019ve had recently.\nNot to say anything bad about them,\nbut I think I\u2019ll be more approach-able, and I think people will actually believe I\u2019m representing their\npoints of view.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nPeople should vote for me if they\nthink I\u2019m the best candidate, and\nif they think I\u2019ll be able to do the\nthings that I promise to do. But the\nmost important thing is to vote.\nMORTEN OLESEN\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005 9\nDepressing hustings highlight\nUnion\u2019s inadequacies\nThis week\u2019s sabbatical election hustings served as an uncomfortable\nreminder of the failings of Imperial\nCollege Union.\nThe President, Deputy Presidents\nand Felix Editor hold some of the\nmost important roles at this College.\nTheir positions are the most powerful within the Union, and those\nelected have a huge responsibility to\nimprove and enhance the \u2018Imperial\nCollege experience\u2019 for the student\nbody. Yet, out of over 11,000 students,\nless than 100 were present at Da\nVinci\u2019s Bar in South Kensington to\nhear what this year\u2019s candidates\nhad to say.\nShould hall rents be based on students\u2019 ability to pay? Do you think\nthat a sabbatical officer serving a\nsecond year would be \u2018out of touch\u2019\nwith the students? Should the Union\ncampaign to pull British troops out of\nIraq? How can we cut out bureaucracy and make clubs and societies\nmore enjoyable? How important is\n\u2018fun in Felix\u2019 as opposed to a candidate\u2019s editorial experience?\nI\u2019m sure most of you have a view on\nall these issues. It is the sabbaticals\nwho will make the big decisions and\ninfluence Union and College policy,\nbut, for whatever reason, nine out\nof ten students won\u2019t bother to vote\nbetween tomorrow and Tuesday.\nHow can the Union call itself a\ntruly \u2018representative\u2019 organisation\nwhen only 10% of students will vote\nin its biggest elections and only 5%\ntook part in its strategic review?\nI won\u2019t labour this point any fur-ther, as there are still other matters to discuss \u2013 the poor turnout\nwas just one of many things that\ndisappointed me as I sat through\nfour miserable hours of hustings on\nMonday night.\nThe vast majority of people in\nattendance were either candidates\nor their friends, and it was sickening\nto see them take little or no interest in proceedings when other people were under the spotlight. Some\ncandidates were heckled \u2013 loudly,\nrudely and without any good reason.\nPeople asked ridiculous questions\nabout fruit, animals, sex toys and\nimpersonating motor vehicles. What\nwas the point? How was that going\nto improve our students\u2019 union?\nOne member of the audience, who\npointed to the low turnout and asked\ncandidates whether the elections\nwere really relevant, was jeered and\nheckled. Any candidate with a real-istic, serious message was derided\nas \u201cboring\u201d and shouted down in\nfavour of catchy slogans, empty\npromises and pledges about \u2018fun\u2019.\nThat is not the way to a better Union\nor a better student experience here\nat Imperial College.\nSome candidates were victimised,\nas people \u2018bent the rules\u2019 by asking\nquestions that may have seemed\n\u2018addressed to all\u2019 on the surface but\nwere clearly aimed at certain individuals in particular.\nI haven\u2019t decided who to vote for\nyet. But, regardless of the failings of\nour students\u2019 union, I will certainly\nbe voting tomorrow, and you should\ntoo. It will take you 15 minutes,\nat most, to read the candidates\u2019\nmanifestos and interviews [see\npages 13-18 of this newspaper] and\nvote online at www.union.ic.ac.uk/\nelections. As improbable as it may\nsound, the people you elect can\nchange your life for the better.\nSo if a candidate stands for something you feel strongly about, make\nyour voice heard and hopefully\nthey\u2019ll be able to address that issue\nin a positive way next year. But\ndon\u2019t just look at their promises \u2013\nwhat evidence is there that they can\ndeliver? What have they done in the\npast that will make them capable or\nincapable of doing the job? Who has\nthe most relevant experience? Who\nhas the best ideas? Who is in touch\nwith what the students really want?\nWho sets realistic, achievable, sensible goals? On the other hand, who\ndoesn\u2019t quite know what they\u2019re\ntalking about? And who is just doing\nit for CV points? It\u2019s important that\nyou vote. It\u2019s equally important that\nyou vote for the people who can really improve your Union, your College\nand your life.\nThe final indignity of Monday night\ncame when the hustings drew to a\nclose and the Presidential candidates were \u2018asked\u2019 to down a pint of\ntheir choice. Call it fun, call it tradi-tion, call it what you like, but if you\u2019d\nrather watch six people drink a pint\nthan find out about how they can\nimprove your life at Imperial, then\nperhaps you don\u2019t deserve a good\nstudents\u2019 union after all.\nOPINION\nFURIOUS GEORGE\nThe joy of... elections\nSabbatical elections\nUnless you are walking around with\nyour eyes closed, you will have heard\nabout the sabbatical elections. We\nhave 16 candidates standing this\nyear for the five sabbatical posts,\nso it promises to be the most hotly\ncontested and exciting set of elections in recent memory. For more\ninformation, turn to pages 13-18 of\nthis newspaper or check out www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nThe Union is the recognised voice\nof Imperial College students, and\nconstantly strives to improve their\nlives and look after their education-al, social and welfare needs. The\npeople you elect will lead the Union\nnext year, so make sure you vote!\nQAA student written\nsubmission\nI have informed you of the role of\nthe Quality Assurance Agency in\nmonitoring higher education, and\nthe College\u2019s impending institutional audit, in previous issues, so\nI shall not bore you again here. The\nStudent Written Statement, which\nI produced on your behalf, was\napproved by the Union\u2019s governing\nbody (Council), and has now been\nsent off to the agency. It can be read\nat www.union.ic.ac.uk/qaa. It has\nraised a few issues that the Union\nwill be looking to resolve through\ndialogue with the College.\nGet on your bike!\nLast Friday\u2019s bike auction was\na great success, with around 50\npeople braving the January drizzle,\ntaking about 35 bikes off our hands\nand raising over \u00a31000. The money\nwill be used for the benefit of cyclists\non campus in the future. If anyone is\ninterested in setting up a co-opera-tive to help cyclists maintain their\nbikes, and represent cycling issues\nto College, please contact benjamin.\njefferys@imperial.ac.uk.\n\u2018Entertain\u2019\nThere will be a massive charity\nball on Saturday 26 February, 7pm\n\u2018til late. Held in the Great Hall,\n\u2018Entertain\u2019 will feature live bands\n(including the Big Band) and some\ngreat DJs. Tickets cost \u00a310, and\nevery penny will go towards the\nredevelopment of those areas\naffected by the December\u2019s tsunami\ndisaster.\nTickets are available from Union\nReception and the Reynolds Bar.\nFor more information, please see\nwww.entertain-event.co.uk or email\ninfo@entertain-event.co.uk. Please\nsupport this worthwhile event.\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nDay of disobedience\n15 February 2005. That is the date\nto keep in your head if you oppose\nthe ongoing war and occupation in\nIraq.\nThere are many reasons to oppose\nthe occupation. They include the fact\nthat over 100,000 Iraqis have been\nkilled so far, mostly in air strikes.\nThey also include the increasing\nnumber of casualties and fatalities amongst British and American\ntroops, a large number of whom\nare economic conscripts \u2013 soldiers\nwho joined for financial reasons,\nand not explicitly to be sent to kill\nand destroy in an illegal war. Then\nthere is the increasingly widespread\nuse of torture used by British and\nAmerican forces on Iraqi prisoners\n\u2013 torture that seems to be part of\nthe very way these armies are working in occupied Iraq.\nAnother reason is the fact that\nthere simply can be no democracy\nunder occupation. The recent \u2018elections\u2019 in Iraq have been spun as the\nbirth of democracy, and indeed it\nwas extremely uplifting to see the\nemotion on the faces of Shias voting in what they believed to be free\nelections. But it looks increasingly\nas if all those Shias who voted did\nso to try to end the occupation. And\nwhat about the Sunnis, who boycotted to try to end the occupation?\nOr the fact that the elections were\nheld under a state of emergency,\nsome parts of Iraq did not even have\npolling stations, many of the candidates\u2019 identities were kept secret,\na US-controlled body had ultimate\ncontrol over who did and did not\nstand... the list goes on.\nGiven that the \u2018coalition of the\nwilling\u2019 never, even in their words,\nwent to Iraq explicitly to bring\ndemocracy, it is unlikely that they\nwill listen to the wishes of the Iraqis\nand get out. And so, with the 16\npermanent bases they are building,\nwith large parts of the economy privatised with all profits going to US\ncompanies, and with still very little\nprovision of water, electricity and\nfuel, resistance to the occupation\nwill continue. This is a resistance\nwhose active members number\nover 200,000 according to the CIA,\nwell above the number of British\nand American troops there. Clearly,\nthose who have passive support for\nthe resistance much higher.\nBut the reason I ask everyone\nto oppose the occupation is for the\nsake of Babar Ahmad, as this is an\nissue that our own students\u2019 union\nhas passed policy on. As long as\nthe \u2018war on terror\u2019 continues, the\nvictimisation of minority groups at\nhome, and Muslims in particular,\nis going to continue. To support\nBabar\u2019s case is also to oppose the\nbrutality of what is taking place in\nIraq.\nSo, I\u2019m asking everyone to\ntake part in the national \u2018Day of\nDisobedience\u2019 against the occupation on 15 February. It will start at\n9am with a three minute silence in\nremembrance of all those killed in\nthe war and occupation. At 12.30pm,\npeople are meeting on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn for on-campus protest and\ndemonstration. And then at 3pm, we\nare meeting in Beit Quad to march\ndown to Parliament Square and join\nstudents from across London in a\n\u2018die-in\u2019. These events have all been\norganised in the run up to the major\nnational anti-war demonstration on\n19 March.\nFinally, the next stage of Babar\nAhmad\u2019s extradition hearing goes\nto court on 2 March, and his family and supporters will gather outside the court in London in protest.\nWe hope to send a large delegation\nfrom Imperial. Anyone interested\nin any of these issues should email\nme at cs602@ic.ac.uk, or look out\nfor posters that will be appearing\naround the College soon.\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\n6\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAlthough we know that right\nand left-handed people have\nco-existed since the Upper\nPalaeolithic era (15\u201310,000\nBC), little is known about the\ndistribution of left-handed-ness or why the trait persists.\nWhile scientists believe handedness is mostly inherited, it\nis not so clear what the evolutionary advantages associated with being left-handed\nare. A new study recently\npublished in Proceeding of\nthe Royal Society (Biological\nSciences) may offer a piece of\nthe puzzle.\nResearchers Charlotte\nFaurie and Michel Raymond\nof University Montpelier in\nFrance claim that there is\na strong, positive correlation\nbetween the frequency of left-handers and the rate of murder in traditional societies.\nThe study draws on previous results from sports\nstudies in Western societies,\nwhich show that left-handers\nhave an advantage in confrontational sports, such as\ntennis, fencing, baseball, but\nno in non-interactive sports.\nFurther, this advantage is\nfrequency-dependent, meaning that left-handers enjoy a\ngreater advantage over their\nopponents when they are in\nthe minority.\nSince physical sports can\nbe seen as a modified form of\nfighting, a wider ethnological\ninterpretation may be made\nthat links handedness to\naggressive behaviour. Faurie\nand Raymond speculate that\nbeing left-handed in a violent\ncontext would be advanta-geous, therefore there would\nbe a higher frequency of\naggressive left-handers.\nThe research supporting\nthis hypothesis is comprised\nof studies of several so-called\ntraditional societies (like\nCameroon, Burkina Faso,\nGabon). In each case observations were made on the\nhand preference for activities\nsuch as holding a machete\nor knife and bow-shooting,\nwhich were correlated with\nhomicide rate data. Western\nsocieties were not considered\nbecause the violence in these\nsocieties mainly involves the\n\u201cuse of long-range and powerful weapons\u201d which are not\nthought to offer left-handers\nan advantage.\nWhileFaurieandRaymond\u2019s\nresults support their hypoth-esis, it is clear the studies\u2019\nscope is not sufficient to draw\nany definite conclusions.\nBesides, as the authors con-cede, homicide rate is not the\nbest estimator of the prevalence of one-to-one fights.\nIt would also be interesting\nand more authoritative to\nsee the research extended to\nWestern societies with larger\ntest samples.\nThe study does, how-ever, highlight the potential\nimportance of violence in\nunderstanding handedness\nin humans. Since most left-handers are male, it seems\npossible that there may be\na \u201cfighting advantage\u201d associated with left-handedness,\nwhich would confirm that the\ntrait is preserved. Yet this\nneed not be the only advantage in the handedness bal-ance.\nDuring the 20th century\nthere was a popular theory\nbacked by a number of studies that related left-handed-ness to creativity. Having had\nthe opportunity to verify this\ntheory with a sample of my\nown in a high school science\nproject, I wonder whether\ncreativity may be one of those\nother benefits. Although such\ndifferences due to handedness are well-known, their\ncauses, thought to be related to the organisation of the\nbrain, are still unclear.\nHopefully, Faurie and\nRaymond\u2019s study is a step\nforward in our understanding of left-handedness and\nits perseverance as a trait.\nBut one should be wary of\ncorrelations. The two studies\ncould, for instance, be interpreted together to prove the\nexistence of a positive correlation between creativity and\nhomicide.\nLeft-handed psychos? Clockwise from top left: Jack the\nRipper the Boston Strangler (top right), Uri Geller and\nNapoleon Bonaparte\nMurder of a sinister nature\nA new clue as to why some people are left-handed? Alexander Antonov\nreports on new research suggesting a link between left-handedness and murder\nNews\nin brief\nAir force war game\naims to test space\ntechnology\nThe US military launched a\nfive-day war game last week\nto see how space-based\nassets like satellite communications and precision bomb\nguidance systems would fare\nin a war against terrorism in\n2020. Over the past decade,\nthe US military has come to\nrely heavily on satellites to\nrelay communications, transmit high-resolution imagery,\ntrack US forces, spot enemy\nmissiles and guide precision\nmunitions to their targets.\nLife flourishes at\ncrushing depth\nTiny single-celled creatures,\nmany previously unknown,\nhave been found at the deepest point in the world\u2019s oceans,\nalmost 11km down. The soft-walled foraminifera, a form\nof plankton, were recovered\nby the Japanese remote submersible Kaiko. Yuko Todo\nand colleagues report that\nthe organisms have become\nadapted to the crushing pressures (about 110,000 kilopas-cals) that exist in a location of\nthe Marianas Trench known\nas Challenger Deep.\nNanotechnology\ntakes aim at\ntransistors\nUS scientists have made\nnano-scale devices they claim\ncould one day replace current\ntransistor technology. The\ntiny devices known as \u201ccrossbar latches\u201d are made up of a\ncombination of crossed-over\nplatinumwireswithstericacid\nmolecules set at their junc-tions. The Hewlett Packard\nresearchers said they could\npotentially do a better job\nthan current transistors, dramatically improving the performance of computers.\nDyslexic drivers\nslower to react\nDyslexia slows a driver\u2019s reaction time as much as moderate drinking, a report claims.\nA Norwegian study on 17 volunteers found dyslexic drivers\ntook 30% longer to react than\nothers. Driving over the UK\nalcohol limit slows reaction\ntimes by 10%, according to\nNew Scientist. Charities said\nthe report was alarmist and\noffensive, and that quick reaction times do not necessarily\nmake good drivers.\nBy Darius Nikbin\nScience Editor\nThe news this week: man\nconvicted of assault after\nbrawl with Egg McMuffin,\nRussian combat jets scrambled to repulse cloud, image\nof Jesus seen in frying pan,\nteenager who sent 100 texts\na day unable to move thumb,\nand, finally, nude jogger\ncaught and locked up for one\nyear.\nNew technology may now\nmean you can carry out your\nlab work in the comfort of the\nUnion Bar. Imagine it: while\nyour supervisor\u2019s running\naround like a headless chicken trying to find where you\u2019ve\ngone, you will be in the pub,\nsipping a pint of your favourite ale, playing Who Wants\nTo Be A Millionaire and\nmonitoring your experiment\nby mobile phone. Smoothly\ndoes it.\nThis is exactly what\nchemists in Southampton\nUniversity have been doing\nas part of a national e-Science\nproject (except I don\u2019t know\nwhether they were drinking ale). Sensors in the\nlaboratory pick up sudden\nchanges in experimental conditions and relay the information to scientists\u2019 mobile\nphones. In this way, experimental conditions are constantly monitored so that\nanomalies in temperature,\nfor example, are duly taken\ninto account.\nIt might be a long time\nbefore experimental conditions can be completely controlled remotely, but the new\ntechnology sounds promis-ing. Having once spent three\nhours a day for several weeks\nstaring at a read-out from a\nGeiger counter, this reporter\nwould welcome any technology that would relieve the\nboredom during the long lab\nhours some experiments\nrequire.\nMore seriously, this week in\nFelix Science we have a feature by Gaetano Mancino on\nthe Hubble Space telescope.\nLooking back on some of the\nimages Hubble has produced\nover the past decade, one\ncannot fail to be stunned. It is\nalmost impossible to comprehend or appreciate the sheer\ndimensions of the universe as\nrevealed by Hubble. We are\nused to lifetimes of around\n70 years, and the most we\ntravel to go anywhere on\nholiday is a few thousand\nkilometres. For us, 50 minute\nlectures can seem like a life-time, and a short trip through\nLondon\u2019s traffic can feel like\nan endurance test. If Hubble\nhas taught us anything it is\nthat we are nothing in the\ngrand scale of things. So it is\na shame that this revolutionary apparatus of science is\nbeing abandoned when it is\nstill producing such amazing\nimages.\nAnother article by Alex\nAntonov looks at the possible link between aggressiveness and left-handedness.\nAlthough his article refuses\nto accept the findings, you\nwill read some interesting\nconclusions about the question of whether correlation\ncan prove causation. A few\nof my friends are left-hand-ed, and I can vouch for them\nthat they are not overly vio-lent, although they are quite\ncreative.\nGiovanna Larice looks at\nthe important issue of nipples this week.

One nation\ncontrolled by the media\u201d.\nThe crowd seems just as excited\nby the following Jesus Of Suburbia,\na nine minute epic, and one of the\ntwo pieces of cross-track storytelling which have left traditional three-minute punks suspicious of the new\nalbum. When the classic material\nstarted flowing (Longview, Basket\nCase, Brain Stew, Hitchin\u2019 A Ride,\neven 2000 Lightyears Away) it was\nheart-warming to hear that most\nof the evenly mixed 14 to 40 crowd\nknew all the words to both the old\nand new songs.\nWhat raises a Green Day concert above the pop-punk competition is the band\u2019s tireless commitment to entertaining their audience.\nThe band never let the pace drop,\nwith water pistols, pyrotechnics,\nsing-alongs and even getting the\naudience up on stage to play. For\none and a half hours, Billie Joe\nclimbed speaker stacks and charged\nthe length of the stage, seemingly\ntrying to engage every one of the\ncapacity crowd with his trademark\ncrazy-eyed stare.\nPresumably as a treat for us Brits,\nKing For A Day was merged seam-lessly into Lulu\u2019s Shout and the show\nwas finished with a brilliant cover of\nQueen\u2019s We Are The Champions.\nAs the words \u201cWe\u2019ll keep on fighting till the end\u201d flashed up on their\nmassive dot-matrix backdrop, this\nsong seemed a perfectly appropriate choice. To Green Day, punk isn\u2019t\njust a phase you go through as a\nteenager, but a philosophy for life.\nAnd the way Billie Joe tells it, his\nfight now is against America\u2019s neo-conservatives for our freeedom as\nindividuals. His take-home mes-sage: \u201cDon\u2019t let the powers that be\ntell you how to live your life... Listen\nto your heart and to your mind!\u201d\nGood advice indeed.\nFinally we were left with Mr\nArmstrong alone on the stage, playing a stirring solo electric version of\nthe truly anthemic Good Riddence\nand sharing the wish: \u201cI hope you\nhad the time of your life.\u201d After a\nshow like that, who wouldn\u2019t have?\nEd Hunt\nAmerican idiots? Apparently not\nGreen Day have been playing their brand of melodic pop-punk for what seems like forever.\nNow they\u2019ve caught a dose of politics, bringing their new material to the UK for the first time\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\n26\nGreen Day: you\u2019re not punk unless your guitar hangs at least to your knees, and Billie Joe knows it\nThe good, the bad and The Game\nFelix presents you with the hotly anticipated new single from The Mars Volta, Fatboy Slim\u2019s\nambitious cover, and some other stuff you might like\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nNorman Cook and Bootsy Collins\nhave reunited for this ambitious\nremake of the Steve Miller Band\nclassic The Joker.\nFatboy enlisted Bootsy\u2019s magic on\nthe inspired Weapon Of Choice on\nhis last album in 2001, and The Joker\nis the lead single from his latest\noffering Palookaville. This is definitely a controversial track \u2013 Steve\nMiller fans will likely loathe it, or at\nleast loathe to like it, while Bootsy\nfans will gush about his masterful\nvocals and witty improvs. Love it or\nhate it, this song will get your foot\ntapping with its catchy riffs, reggae overtone and infectious sense\nof fun.\nI rather like this song \u2013 it is quite\nsimply as silly and absurd as Bootsy\nhimself. He drenches it with his contagious outrageousness that cannot\nfail to make you smile. The Joker is\nreleased on 28th February. Fo shiz-zle ma nizzle. Ben Ramadan\nQuestion: what do you get if you mix\nfolk music with some hip hop beats\nand a sprinkling of a kids\u2019 chorus?\nAnswer: the debut single from one\nof the most hotly tipped artists of the\nyear, Jem Griffiths.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of this 29-year-old Welsh singer songwriter,\ndon\u2019t worry, you definitely will soon.\nShe has already managed to captivate American listeners with her\nconsiderable talents \u2013 her music\nhas been used on US series Six Feet\nUnder and she made a special guest\nappearance in the season finale of\nhit US teen drama The OC.\nSo, does she have the songs to live\nup to the acclaim? On this evidence\nshe certainly does. Kicking in with a\nstrong hip hop beat and incorporating elements of Prelude In F Minor,\nby a certain Mr JS Bach, Jem certainly shows no fear in mixing styles\nto define a sound which is so infectious it will no doubt burrow its way\ninto your head within minutes of\nyour first listen. Say hello to 2005\u2019s\nnext big thing. Dom Wong\nThe Game, aka Jayceon Taylor, has\ninduced a lot of excitement in hiphop\ncircles.\nDescribed as \u201cthe new future of\nhip-hop\u201d, he turned to rapping after\nwaking from a coma and shedding a\nshady past of dealing and robbery to\ntry his luck in a world where bullet\nwounds get you noticed.\nHow We Do is the first single from\nhis debut album The Documentary,\nwhich has had nods of approval\nfrom Kayne West, Timbaland, Mary\nJ Blige and Eminem. It\u2019s a top notch\nDre tune, featuring vocal subsidies\nfrom 50 Cent \u2013 you get the impression Game is being led by the both\nhands into the hip-hop world.\nIt works. The tune is both simple\nand catchy, and while Game\u2019s lyrics\ncould be more original, he lives up to\nDre\u2019s quality production. The spare\n808 beat and fifties influence are sure\nto make this a dancefloor favourite.\nListen out for this tune after the single\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day release, and be\nprepared to hear a lot more from G\nUnit\u2019s latest prodigy.\nBen Ramadan\niTunes is selling half a billion songs a\nyear; it is an all powerful marketing\nmachine which iPod users (about\nthe whole world) are all too familiar\nwith. Notably, it has an uncanny ability to classify almost any song, and\nwhen its pushed to the limits (such\nas Kid Symphony) it just shoves\nit in the \u2018Unclassifiable\u2019 genre. So\nafter reading an interview with\n(ex-At The Drive In, and now) The\nMars Volta vocalist, Cedric Bixler\nZavala, describing how the Volta try\nto break down labeling of genres, I\nwas surprised that their new single\nThe Widow was popped into the\n\u2018Alternative\u2019 tab \u2013 I am sure he\u2019s not\npleased.\nAs the first single from their\nnew album Francis The Mute, The\nWidow is another trip down wierdo-prog lane. Once more, strange lyrics\nflow out of the sharp-tongued mouth\nof Cedric throughout the operatic track, which opens with unforgettable wailing vocals before the\nstart of the trademark eerie guitar\nused extensively on their debut LP\n.\nListening to the single, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp feeling a Muse influence, the\nvocal and instrumental tracks swell\nand die out to a slow beat, with epic\nintensity, shredding and horns.\nThe lyrics on their debut album\n(De-Loused In The Comatorium)\ndescribed the world dreamt up by a\ncoma victim but take a different turn\non Frances The Mute, animating the\njournals of Volta\u2019s lost friend Jeremy\n(Ward, died of a heroin overdose \u2013\nEd). Whilst the video depicts a death\ndealer trawling the streets of a wasted city, the anger and stress within\nthe song is notable, with imagery of\nbroken men and rampant fear \u2013 a\nslow ballad, Mars Volta style.\nStrangely, the song seems overly\nfamiliar (and immediately identifiable as the Volta\u2019s). Whether it\u2019s\nbecause of their desire to cast off\nany label, or the epic concept album\nfeel their songs have, the new,\nrefined Mars Volta sounds like a\nsecond take of their first attempt\nand not the innovative, progressive\nband they claim to be.\nNick Simpson\nFatboy Slim\nThe Joker\n(Skint)\nHHHII\nJem\nThey\n(Ato)\nHHHII\nThe Game\nHow We Do\n(Interscope)\nHHHII\nThe Mars Volta\nThe Widow\n(Island)\nHHHII\nGreen Day\nBrixton Academy\nHHHHH\nThe Mars Volta: experimental, strangely funky, and very, very good\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "It has produced remarkable images from the depths of the universe for over a decade.\nGaetano Mancino looks at why the Hubble Space telescope is to be abandoned\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005 5\nThe Hubble Space Telescope,\narguably the greatest scientific instrument in the history\nof space exploration, may only\nhave three years of life left\nafter plans to mount a rescue\nmission were recently shelved\nby the US government.\nA combination of safety\nissues associated with a\nmanned rescue mission and\na change in US space policy\nwere cited as the two main\nreasons why the US will\nallow Hubble to naturally\nwind down.\nThe next servicing mis-sion, scheduled for 2008, was\nintended to upgrade Hubble\u2019s\nbatteries and gyroscopes,\nallowing it to function for\nanother eight years. Manned\nrepair missions are not new\nto the telescope, with three\nsuccessfully completed since\nits launch in 1990. However,\nin the wake of the Columbia\ndisaster, NASA grounded all\nthreeofitsremainingshuttles,\nputting the shuttle flight to\nservice the telescope on hold.\nNASA contemplated using\nrobots to carry out the repairs\nand, until recently, plans were\nbeing developed in collaboration with the Canadian Space\nAgency to launch a robotic\nservicing mission in 2007.\nLast month, however, the\nUS government refused to\nrelease the $1 billion needed\nfor the upgrade. As a result,\nthe Hubble space telescope\nwill continue to function normally in the short term, but\nwithout the repairs to its batteries and gyroscopes it will\neventually wear down in three\nyears.\nThe decision not to extend\nHubble\u2019s life beyond 2008 has\nbeen seen by many as rash\nand unnecessary. The information provided by the telescope during its distinguished\ncareer has contributed massively to our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the Solar\nSystem, the Milky Way and\nother more distant galaxies.\nThe staggering beauty of the\nimages obtained by Hubble,\nranging from kaleidoscopic\nswirls of gas to jaw-dropping\npictures of the birth of stars,\nhave become ingrained in the\npublic consciousness. This\ninformation has also allowed\nus to probe deeper and ask\nmore questions than anyone\nthought was possible when\nHubble was first sent out on\nits journey of exploration.\nEven now Hubble continues\nto amaze, with the recent discovery of 100 new planets in\nthe centre of our Milky Way\ngalaxy, doubling the number\nof planetary bodies known to\norbit stars similar to our own\nSun. Not wanting to rest on\ntheir laurels, NASA was planning to extend Hubble\u2019s capabilities by adding several new\ncomponents during the next,\nand now cancelled, upgrade.\nOne of these new components\nis a camera designed to detect\na particular type of faint UV\nlight that acts as a signature\nfor trace gases present when\nthe universe was still young.\nIt is against the backdrop of\nthis impressive list of achievements that the discussion of\nHubble\u2019s fate is being con-ducted.\nNaturally, the decision has\nprovokedstrongopinionsfrom\nthose passionate about saving\nHubble. The pro-Hubble campaign is being championed\nby a wide range of people\nand interest groups, including the influential American\nAstronomical Society (AAS),\ntheNationalResearchCouncil\n(NRC) and genuine grassroots Hubble enthusiasts who\nhave set-up websites such\nas www.savethehubble.com.\nThis website and numerous\nones like it are scoring huge\nnumbers of hits, a testament\nto the telescope\u2019s popularity.\nAs a result of this pro-Hubble pressure and numerous online petitions, NASA\nasked the NRC to investigate\nways in which the Hubble\ncould be rescued. Late last\nyear the NRC reported back\nand came down in favour of\na manned shuttle mission,\nasserting that it was the only\nway to accomplish all the necessary repairs with minimal\nrisk to the crew. According to\nthe NRC, the current state of\nrobotic technology is not up\nto the job and could be more\nrisky to the Hubble itself. The\nstudy concluded that robots\nshould only be used to de-orbit\nthe telescope at the end of its\nworking life, by which time\nrobotic technology should be\nadvanced enough to carry out\nthe task. In the meantime,\nthe NRC, the AAS and others\nare concerned that a premier\npiece of astronomical real\nestate will be cast off while\nstill in its prime.\nArguablythemostimportant\nfactor influencing the decision\nnot to save Hubble is the current US policy towards space\nexploration. Lying at heart\nof this strategy is President\nBush\u2019s desire to send men\nand women back to the Moon\nand, eventually, to Mars. The\nso-called \u201cmoon-to-mars initiative\u201d requires enormous\nfunding and will take several\nyears to implement. President\nBush has already asked NASA\nto re-allocate $11 billion for\nstart-up costs, with an extra\n$1 billion to come from the\ngovernment.\nThe International Space\nStation (ISS) will play a key\nrole in the \u201cmoon-to-mars initiative,\u201d mainly as a refuelling\ndepot for the longer journey to\nMars. The space shuttle programme will also be crucial\nin this respect, at least until a\nnew generation of spacecraft\nis developed. NASA already\nplans to send the first shuttle\nsince the Columbia tragedy\nto the ISS later this year, a\ndecision which is causing confusion among those wanting\nto keep Hubble operational:\nIf NASA is content to send\nshuttles to the International\nSpace Station, why are they\nso reluctant to use them for\na tried-and-tested journey to\nthe Hubble?\nIf the US government sticks\nto its decision to veto funding\nfor a Hubble repair mission,\ntheobviousquestionbecomes,\nwhat, if anything, will one day\nreplace Hubble?\nCurrently, no earth-bound\ntelescope is capable of emulating the sheer image quality Hubble routinely produc-es. Interestingly, plans are\nunderway to build a space-bound successor to Hubble,\ncalled the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST), which is\ndue for launch in 2011. The\nJWST\u2019s primary goal is\nto peer back to events that\noccurred not long after the\nBig Bang, specifically when\nearly galaxies started to form\nand evolve.\nAnother important objective\nof the JWST is to determine\nthe nature and amount of\ndark matter in the universe.\nDark matter is the mysterious\nsubstance that cosmologists\nbelieve accounts for the discrepancy between the amount\nof matter we can detect and\nthe total amount that must\nexist to create enough gravitational force to prevent the\nuniverse from flying apart.\nDespite the impressive ambitions NASA has for the JWST,\ncritics still argue that the\ndelay between the expected\nend of Hubble and the launch\nof the JWST will be too long.\nIt is generally accepted\nthat Hubble cannot continue forever, and that more\nadvanced telescopes like the\nJWST will eventually replace\nit. But many are convinced\nthat the decision to effectively\naxe Hubble is premature and\nunwarranted. In the eyes of\nastronomers, this decision\nis being made by faceless\nbureaucrats sitting behind\ndesks who are unaware of\nthe potentially great science\nthat Hubble could still achieve\nwith just a little fine tuning.\nUltimately, the decision will\nrest with those in control of\nthe purse-strings, but it is possible that support from grassroots fans, as well as influential astronomical organisa-tions, will make NASA and the\nUS government think twice\nabout axing the telescope.\nIn the meantime, Hubble\nwill continue to enthrall us.\nHow sobering it is to think\nthat those beautiful, ethereal\nimages that we seem to take\nfor granted may, in as little\nas three years, be a thing of\nthe past.\n\u201cThe decision not to\nextend Hubble\u2019s lifetime beyond 2008 has\nbeen seen by many as\nrash and unnecessary\u201d\nHubble\u2019s future in serious trouble\nAn astronaut carrying out repairs on the Hubble Space telescope.

But enough of the fri-volities, down to the game.\nThe team were psyched for\nthis game, mainly because\nmost of us thought it was LSE.\nBut Barts turned up, so we\nthought: what the hell might\nas well give them a game. And\nwe did. Slick passing flowed\nlike syrup from the mid-field,\nleading to many breaks and\nmore chances than we\u2019ve had\nthis season. Unforunately,\nwe could only convert four\nof them with Terry\u2019s poaching skills finely honed. The\nfirst half was essentially one\nway traffic, with wave after\nwave of attacks foundering\nupon either astute defender,\nor the inability to hit the\ngoal. But eventually the pressure had to tell, with a fine\nshot from Avi being stolen\nby Terry after it had already\nbeaten the goalkeeper. A rare\nBarts attack was broken up\nby Ahran (a rock at the back),\nwhose finely placed through\nball confused and delighted\nboth sides as it rocketed to\nTerry, who calmly fended off\nattention and slotted our second just before half time.\nThe second half began in\nconfusing fashion for Barts.\nOur champagne hockey\nforced them to conceed a silly\nfree hit outside the D. Harry\npummelled in the dead ball,\nand a gentle flick from King\nthe skipper took the ball into\nthe net via the goalie\u2019s hel-met. Yet another 3rds goal\nworthy of the scrap book. The\nfinal goal of the game, how-ever, was something special:\na tantalising run by HK from\nend to end past six players\nended with a generous pass\nto Rao, who spanked our\nfourth goal.\nRarely has it been seen for\na side to dominate a game\nquite so easily, but our champagne tactics and promises of\nSecrets as a reward for good\nplay means its going down\nwell for the 3rds.\nICSM Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nGKT Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nGKTs. The grudge match.\nGKT 2nds. The hard grudge\nmatch. And this time it was\nto reach the BUSA play-offs\nat the expense of: Yep, you\u2019ve\nguessed it, GKT 2nds. Every\nsingle person in our team was\npumped for the match, especially after last week\u2019s drinking massacre. None more so\nthan keeper, Rao, who had\ndecided to add to his injury\ntally by fracturing a metacarpal on a kebab. This meant\nthat he was relegated to ref-eree, and Biscuit became the\nman of the moment.\nGood job too, frankly, as we\nwere a bit rubbish. In fact,\nfor the first half, we played\nappallingly. Fortunately, we\ndragged our opposition down\nto our level, and no-one beats\nus in an unfair, home advantage street fight. It was heart-ening, at least, to know that\neven at about 25% of maximum we were still able to\nbeat a \u201cbetter\u201d GKTs side.\nThe first half was quiet, with\nno goals, but some good runs\nfrom both sides. Their front\nfour were quite adept and\ngave our defence a bit of a run\naround, but, fortunately, their\nmidfield had forgotten to turn\nup, so there was no setting\nup for the killer blow. Instead,\nit was route one at various\nangles, which, whilst tricky,\nhad none of the difficulty of a\nwell worked move. Best of all,\non the few occasions when\nit did work, or they actually\npassed, Biscuit was there to\nassuage all doubt. It wasn\u2019t\nall one way stuff in anyway\nthough, with some cracking\ncrosses being dummied and\nmissed all over the shop and\na couple of speculative shots\ncreeping wide (though, to be\nfair their keeper, did do quite\nwell a few times). The majority of time was spent in their\nhalf, although nothing made it\ninto the net.\nThis left us in a quandary at\nhalf time. 0-0. What do we do?\nFortunately, we remembered\nsome more hockey skills, and\ndecided winning was the best\noption. Again we tried wave\nafter wave of attack, but this\ntime the half chances turned\ninto full chances, with crosses\nbeing met and their goalie\nentertained. Finally, our persistence paid off, with Terry\ntidying up and slotting the\nball home after a messy goal\nmouth fandango. But 1-0.\nNever enough in hockey, especially not in a grudge match.\nBack they came with vigour,\nand Biscuit was again tested,\nbut proved worthy. Gradually\nwe regained authority and\ngently ran down the clock\nwhilst sending out a few break\nout counter attacks. The killer\nblow was dealt with exactly\none minute left on the clock.\nTerry pounced again to guide\nthe ball in from one cm, following cracking play by King\nand Harry in an intense short\ncorner session. But there\nwas still time for the most\namazing goal avoidance ever.\nHarry, having made a clean\nbreak through, went one on\none with the keeper, and gave\nGKTs their only cheer of the\nmatch as the keeper won with\nease. Still, by then it was all\nacademic.\nICSM Men\u2019s 3rd 5\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nYet another double-header\ngrudge match. This time\nagainst LSE. The grudge was\nfurther stoked by last year\u2019s\ndefeat in snowy Battersea. It\nwas cold this year too, but\nwe made the most of a bad\nsituation by out-classing the\naccountants and clerks to\nwithin an inch of their lives.\nBut in a nice way. Perhaps.\nAs per current tradition,\nwe turned up a good half\nhour early to warm up the\nmagical hockey skills that\nthe thirds currently seem to\npossess. As a tribute to past\nglories, Frankie \u201cthe cock\ndoc\u201d McDermott returned\nfrom the heady world of\nactual work to spearhead the\nattacking line-up. We started\nin fine fettle, ready to take on\nthe world and possibly even\nLSE. Unfortunately, most of\nthe game\u2019s events have long\nsince passed into the steamy\nalcoholic memories, but some\nthings have remained.\nOnce again, we dominated\nthe game from start to fin-ish. From the off, we pillaged\ndeep into enemy territory,\npinning them back in their\n22. Following many different\nattacks, with the ball pinging\ninto the D from all angles\njust begging for a tap-in, we\nwon a couple of short corners,\nand Kumar managed to slip\nthe final one into the back\nof the net. Despite a spirited\nfight back that lasted all of\nabout thirty seconds, we ran\nstraight back into their half\nand thought about tightening our stranglehold with a\nsecond goal. This would have\nbeen a great time to score,\nbut instead LSE hit back with\na cheeky little strike from a\nshort corner, which, despite\nRao\u2019s commendable efforts,\nresulted in a goal. This levelled things up to 1-1, and a\nproper match looked in the\noffing. Fortunately, we struck\nback decisively soon after\nwith another bit of Kumar\nand Triscott magical inter-play, leading to another vir-ginity-shattering goal. 2-1.\nAnother bit of delivery from\nKumar gave us a half-time\nscore of 3-1.\nA quick team chat and a slap\nto wake up goalie Rao set us\nupforthesecondhalf.Wewere\nready for a hard retaliation,\nand so it proved. They poured\nforth onto our defences, looking for a crack or an easy way\nthrough. Fortunately, we held\nfirm, with the midfield commendably taking the brunt\nof it. Eventually, we started\nto break out, and forced a\nfew errors, which eventually\nled to a most entertaining\ngoal. Following an alterca-tion, their players completely\nstopped, despite an amazing\nlack of whistle, which allowed\nTerry, sharp as a ferret, to\npounce and snaffle up a goal.\nIt made the score 4-1, but\ncompletely knocked the stuffing out of them, leading to\narguments and general dis-cord. Another run forward by\nKumar made the score 5-1.\nGame over. Yet there was still\ntime for a shock consolation\ngoal. A cheap free hit outside\nthe D in the dying moments\nof the game shot through a\npack of players and glanced\noff a stick to loop over Rao in\nthe goal mouth and plop into\nthe goal. But no-one really\nminded as the final whistle\nblew, and we had beaten yet\nanother team.\nHOCKEY\nA feast of hockey\nSponsored by\nImperial 1st 43\nKing\u2019s 1st 33\nBy Erika Kennington\nAnother Wednesday, another\nBUSA fixture for the firsts.\nThis time we were at home\nagainst King\u2019s, who are in\nabout the same position as\nwe are in the league, having\nwon and lost to all the same\nteams. So, it was set up to be\na close game.\nAfter last week\u2019s \u201ctoo\nclose for comfort\u201d win over\nGoldsmiths, we knew we\nwould have to step up the\npressure if we were to secure\nthe points. Fortunately, we\nhad actually had a training\nsession before this match, and\nit meant there was a much\nmore cohesive performance\nfrom the team as a whole.\nWe got off to a flying start\nin the first quarter, breaking\nKing\u2019scentrefourtimeswhilst\neasily holding our own, which\ngave us a seven-goal lead by\nthe break. Even a forced substitution for a twisted ankle\ncouldn\u2019t stop us, and our newest recruit Sotonye fitted in\nstraight away, getting some\nawesome interceptions within\nminutes of coming on court.\nKing\u2019s tightened their play\nin the second quarter, but\nwe battled on, and our newly\nrehearsed tactics (cunningly\ndevised ten minutes before\nthe match) paid off and saw us\nextend our lead to nine goals.\nWe kept the defence tight in\nthe third quarter, whilst continuing to test theirs. Sam\u2019s\nshooting was on top form and\ndeservedly gave her man of\nthe match.\nAnd so to the final quarter,\nwhich, up until this game, had\nalways been our weak point.\nBut no more. Precision passing and some great set-plays\ncombined with sheer determination meant that King\u2019s\ncouldn\u2019t make any impact\non our lead. This is our best\nscoreline to date, and a very\npositive result because we\nwon all four quarters. Next\nweek, UCL and LSE.\nNETBALL\nFirsts beat King\u2019s\nThe netball first team\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nWe pulled up to Fabric at 11.15 to\nfind a queue snaking miles around\nthe block. We immediately knew this\nnight was going to be a little bit\nspecial.\nFor once, we didn\u2019t have to worry\nabout the long wait in the cold and,\nthanks to Nightlife editor Simon,\njoined the much less daunting guest\nlist queue. A touch of blagging\nwas in order to extend my spot to\nthree people, but the chick with\nthe clipboard was won over by my\nwinning smile and we ventured\ninside.\nThe night was getting more and\nmore promising when we swiftly\nbypassed about 40 people in the\ncloakroom queue, though I\u2019m not\nsure why \u2013 I was slightly dazed\nand being led by the hand at this\npoint. We checked our coats and\nthat moment of imminent clubbing\nexcitement and nerves was upon\nus. For those of you who know the\nclub, we came down the back stairs\ninto Room 2 \u2013 you really come in on\na high because the music is already\ncranked and the crowd is dancing. I\nwas struck by how empty the place\nwas compared to the hundreds\nwaiting outside (over-enthusiastic\nbouncers as always) but immediately headed to the bar to get things\nrolling.\nI\u2019m not much of a drum and bass\nfan, but I love my breaks and I was\nthere to check out the much lauded\nAustralian breaks wizard, Phil K.\nDistinctive Breaks were doing their\nmonthly spot in room 2, and Phil K is\ndoing the next in their excellent Y4K\ncd series, which has seen the likes of\nHybrid and DJ Hyper produce quality mixes.\nEvil Nine were doing the warm-up\njob and were banging it out a little\ntoo early, in my opinion, their excellent heavy guitar mix of Alex Dolby\u2019s\nHazy Way straining the speakers at\n11.45. There was little movement\non the dance floor and I was disappointed by an act that I had heard\nmany good things about.\nA few drinks later and 1am had\narrived. A feeling of expectation\nswept the floor and the stuttering\nbeats of the Melbourne maestro\u2019s\nfirst tune hit the speakers. The\nlasers came on and the party was\nin full swing.\nPhil K is regarded as one of the\nmost talented DJs around and now I\nknow why: layer upon layer of filthy\nbreakbeat shuddered the Fabric sys-tem. Not a single missed beat or still\nmoment, just cranking it up tune\nby tune. The basslines and hi-hats\nkept us hypnotically on the floor,\nboogieing away. Then he dropped\nProdigy\u2019s Spitfire and the crowd\nerupted. If you haven\u2019t heard the\ncaustic breaks of the Prodge\u2019s new\nalbum, check it out!\nThe next hour or so went in a bit\nof a blur and, before I knew it, Phil\nK was winding things up with the\nresonant, Jimmi Hendrix-esque guitars of Andy Page\u2019s Serpent \u2013 check\nhis Y4K for a choon and a half!The\nrest of the night was spent equally between Hybrid, who were also\nexcellent, room 3 for a bit of the UK\nhip-hop of Rodney P and Skitz, and\nthe stairs for a bit of breather! I met\nmany new and old faces and generally had my best night for a while.\nCosmo Shield\nDefective Defected\nDefected Records is one of the hottest house labels around,\nbut all was not well at their album launch on Saturday\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFabric Live\nFabric\n\u00a312\nHHHHI\nCLUB REVIEW\nThe first thing I have to make clear\nis that I didn\u2019t get in to Defected, as\nthe security were being twats with\nthe guest list, but I do have some\nrecommendations to anyone who\nwants to go.\nDefected used to be at Ministry\nof Sound once a month, then it had\na break over the summer. It went\nback before Christmas, but there\nwas numerous problems. These\nwere mainly due to the huge turnouts \u2013 the place was apparently\nrammed. Therefore, when they\nmoved to Pacha (a smaller venue)\nfor their album launch, they knew\nit was going to be huge. And I mean\nhuge.\nI turned up at about 9.30pm, knowing there was going to be a huge\nqueue, even for the guest list. The\nmain queue at this point was already\nright round the other side of the\nbuilding, about 75m long. The thing\nwith the guest list queue that night\nwas that it wasn\u2019t just a guest list;\npeople who had tickets were there,\nthey had a paying guest, a house\nguest, the list went on. So, as you\ncan imagine, it was a complete free\nfor all. As the night was so popular,\nthey had decided to cut down the\npress guest list. This cut included\nme, so I wasn\u2019t best pleased. Even\nworse, instead of being given a\nstraight answer, I was just bumped\nfrom queue to queue.\nAnyway, enough of my whinging, I\nwasn\u2019t the only one this happened to.\nPeople who had tickets were experiencing the same problem, being told\nthey couldn\u2019t get in as there were\ntoo many people. It\u2019s acceptable, but\nirritating. You can cut the guest list,\nbut when people have paid money\nit\u2019s just not good business to turn\nthem away. These problems would\nnever have had occurred if they\nhad predicted the size of the turnout for the night. To make matters\nworse, the staff didn\u2019t seem to know\nwhat was going on either \u2013 there\nwere Defected staff and Pacha staff\nall being told different information\nabout lists and where people should\nbe and whether they were paying.\nThis review, if you can really call\nit that, isn\u2019t a bitter bitch about how\nI didn\u2019t get in, it\u2019s really just a piece\nof advice to the organisers: ensure\nthat all the staff know what they are\ndoing and don\u2019t employ people who\nare there on a power trip.\nDefected have become massive\nrecently, so any event they hold is\nsold out a few weeks if not months\nbefore the event. If you do have\ntickets, I recommend getting there\nearly. Not just 20 minutes, I mean\nat least an hour early. If you don\u2019t\nhave tickets but are going to queue\nto pay, I would say get there even\nearlier because there is going to be\na big crowd. As for the guest list, this\nis always a bane of every clubber\u2019s\nnight out \u2013 whether or not you are\nactually on the list, and if so, is the\nbouncer going to be a dick? Pacha\nhas this weird system of a house list\nand a club night list instead of just\nhaving one nice alphabetised list.\nIf anyone actually managed to get\ninto Pacha then I hope you had a\ngood time, as it was meant to be one\nof the biggest nights in the Defected\ncalendar. I would go again if they\nwere doing another party, but I\u2019d get\nthere two hours early with a thermos of soup, a ticket and perhaps a\nsmall child to entertain me through\nthe boredom of waiting. Or even a\nheavily overweight midget on a tri-cycle. Yodelling. You know it makes\nsense. Aaron Mason\nDefected in the House\nPacha\nHybrid\nBAR REVIEW\nI count myself very lucky to be able\nto live in such a nice area and be\nso close to bars and restaurants of\na high quality. Cactus Blue is one\nsuch place.\nLocated along the Fulham road\ntowards South Kensington station,\nit\u2019s got a kind of western (as in cow-boy) feel about it. It spans over two\nfloors, the upstairs being the restau-rant, which is nice but expensive.\nDon\u2019t expect change from \u00a320, but\nit is worth the money. It is an ideal\nplace to go if your parents are down\nand they are paying, or if you want\nto eat somewhere cool before going\nout into London.\nCactus Blue one of those places where you just have to ignore\nthe fact that you just spent \u00a37 on\na cocktail and soft drinks start at\n\u00a32. Champagne cocktails are also\n\u00a37 so it\u2019s worth just drinking those\nall night \u2013 it reminds you of what\nis was like to not drink snakebite\njust because it\u2019s cheap and gets you\nwasted.\nThe best thing about the whole\nplace is the fact that they have a tiny\nlift for glasses. It was a cage in the\ncentre of the bar, which I have to say\nhas entertained me numerous times\nwhen a little bit drunk.\nSomething else important is that\nthey ask for your credit card when\nthey take your order. This is for\nsecurity reasons, so if you\u2019re thinking of doing a runner, don\u2019t. The only\nreason I say I this is because I have\nthought whether it\u2019d be possible to\nrun and grab my card and make it\nout of the door. It\u2019s not.\nAaron Mason\nCactus Blue\n86 Fulham Road\nHHHHI\nFabric\u2019s breaks beat the rest\nEvil Nine\nFile under:\nBreaks\nIf you like this, try:\nChew The Fat @ The End\nFile under:\nBalls up\nIf you like this, try:\nStanding outside in the cold for a\nlong time\nA defective house.

Please, let me explain.\nMy family has always had a rough\ntime of it, with people gossiping\nbehind our backs, calling us names,\nthat kind of thing. My parents had a\nmessy divorce, as they\u2019d both been\ncheating on each other. A few years\nlater, my mum died.\nEvery since it happened though,\nmy little brother just hasn\u2019t been the\nsame.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nA band consisting of only two blokes\nand a pink album cover adorned with\ntheir heads and modified phallic-trunk-noses immediately conjures\nup the \u2018two puffs and a keyboard\u2019\ngenre of music we all hoped was\nbanished to the eighties. Thankfully,\nDeath From Above 1979 are not\nyour average two man ensemble but\ninstead are out to insult, expose and\neducate you.\nViolent music has been about for\nyears, well honed in electronica (the\nProdigy\u2019s new album a prime exam-ple) and metal, but it has never\nreally been expressed alternatively.\nPerhaps indie kids don\u2019t want it, or\nperhaps no one can provide it, but\nthe Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the closest\nband in sight to mildly assault your\nears.\nSo are Death From Above the\nanswer? Yes, not only do they fill the\nvoid, they kick you in the teeth and\nare the embodiment of the innovation and class that has been lacking\nfrom today\u2019s new acts. Listening to\nthe album, I could only be inspired\nby the bass lines exceeding the\nscope of many modern guitar parts,\nwhilst Sebastien Grainger provides\nnot only original drumming but lurid\nvocals of women and love. Perhaps\nit\u2019s the fact they are ex-convicts who\nmet in a sleazy Toronto jail, or their\ninsatiable desires for the opposite\nsex, but the energy of their performance is outstanding, picking up from\nwhere everyone else has left off.\nFrom the start of You\u2019re A Woman,\nI\u2019m A Machine, their debut LP\n,\nDeath From Above capture your\nattention with the fast paced Turn It\nOut, followed by Romantic Rights;\na summary of Grainger\u2019s rampant\nlibido and his favourite chat-up line\n\u201cI know you love me you don\u2019t know\nwhat you like.\u201d Never letting up,\nJesse Keller powers out blistering\nbass riffs to put Lemmy to shame.\nThickening the mix with imaginative\nsynths, the backing complements\nthe hollow vocals, with tracks such\nas Go Home, Get Home, introducing\ncatchy, melodic undertones whilst\nkeeping the amps on 11.\nI would love to find a bad word to\nsay about the overuse of distorted\nbass or the at times substandard\nsongwriting, but Death From Above\ncapture your heart and fly away\nwith it, leaving a shrivelled shell of\nthe person you once were. Looking\naround, I\u2019m not the only one praising the band, as it appears they have\ninstilled fear in fellow musicians and\nawed their audiences around the\nworld. I doubt any significant success will come from such an outstanding and rule-breaking LP\n, but\nwhen has anything groundbreaking\nbeen out in the mainstream? Hell,\nthey don\u2019t even have a guitarist,\nand unlike Keane there are no extra\ndubs sneaked in in the studio. There\nis no doubt this album is paving the\nway for something big.\nAfter listening to and reviewing\nYou\u2019re A Woman, I\u2019m A Machine, I\nam left with a sense that this is what\nany other new band has to live up to.\nGrainger claims \u201cI wanna show you\nhow I handle business\u201d in the smoldering finale to a hectic album (Sexy\nResults), and some would say he\nalready has. I would like to feel that\nthis is just the beginning; guitarists\nneed not apply.\nNick Simpson\nI have to admit here \u2013 I never really\n\u201cgot\u201d Electric Six. When they broke\nout a few years ago with their hit\nDanger! High Voltage!, and the now\nomnipresent anthem Gay Bar, the\nsix-piece from Detroit came bursting\ninto action and were hailed as one of\nthe most exciting bands to come\nout of the New Rock Revolution\u2122,\ndespite only really having a few retro\nriffs with some catchy tunes.\nSo it\u2019s with some trepidation that\nI approach their follow-up album,\nSe\u00f1or Smoke. Billed as their \u2018darker, macabre\u2019 follow up to Fire, I\u2019m\nglad someone told me about this, as\nI couldn\u2019t hear it at all from listening to it. Don\u2019t listen to the PR sell\n\u2013 it\u2019s just more of the same silly\ndisco tunes, and I literally mean\nthat. Every tune is pretty much\nidentical \u2013 some electric riffing that\nwill have ACDC\u2019s lawyers knocking\non the door, followed up by some\nof Dick Valentine\u2019s repetitive baritone (\u201cIt\u2019s torture, it\u2019s torture, you\nscorcher, you scorcher!\u201d he bellows\non Be My Dark Angel), then a dodgy\nkeyboard solo, then repeat for a bit.\nLast time they were perilously close\nto becoming a joke band, but they\navoided it \u2013 with this album they\u2019ve\nbecome a self parody, which is quite\nan achievement considering their\nnon-serious approach.\nGeneral piss-poor writing doesn\u2019t\nhelp either. Every other song has\nDance in the title, which would tire\nout even the mighty Bez whilst high\non a bag of sherbet. Lyrically, it\u2019s\na case of throwing together known\nwords which rhyme (\u201cCan\u2019t sit down\n\u2018cos I\u2019m a dancer / And you know I\nhave the answer\u201d is a prime example in the closer, Future Is In The\nFuture), which stinks of laziness.\nThe attempt at satire and humour is\nweak as well: the opener Rock And\nRoll Evacuation wins the award for\nthe most hilariously bad political\nstatement ever, with \u201cMr President\nmakes a little money sending people\nyou don\u2019t even know to Iraq / Mr.\nPresident, I don\u2019t like you, you don\u2019t\nknow how to RAWK!\u201d Some people\nmight defend this, citing that it\u2019s\nmeant to be intentionally camp. I\nhope to God that they\u2019re not seri-ous.\nThere are some good tunes to be\nfound here though, which remind\nus what made them big in the first\nplace. Vibrator, which was free\nto download, is a decent piece of\nnew-wave rock, and the cover of\nRadio Ga-Ga, despite coming from\none of the world\u2019s most overrated\nbands, power chords itself along\nwell enough.

    "content": "14 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\nPRESIDENT\n\u25cf The President is the figurehead of Imperial College Union, with ultimate responsibility for all its activities\n\u25cf There are 5 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)\nSIMON RAWSON\nCOLIN SMITH\nWhy are you standing for\nPresident?\nWell, I\u2019ve been involved with the students\u2019 union for the last four years\nnow, since I\u2019ve been at Imperial\nCollege, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve\nthoroughly enjoyed being involved\nin. I\u2019ve got a lot out of it, and in the\ncorny sense of the word it\u2019s time to\nput something back into it. I also\nfirmly believe I\u2019ve got something\nreal to give to the students\u2019 union,\nin terms of my leadership, my ideas,\nand my passion for the Union.\nWhat\u2019s the single most\nimportant thing a students\u2019\nunion can do for its\nmembers?\nActivities, identities and services\nare three core areas, but if I had to\npick one I\u2019d pick representation.\nShould Imperial College\nUnion be campaigning to\nfree Babar Ahmad?\nIn my opinion, no. I personally\nbelieve that he should be freed and\nI support the campaign, however\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of the\nUnion. I see ICU fighting directly for\nstudents on issues that affect students here and now, and I think it\u2019s\nstretching that definition quite far\nto say that the Free Babar Ahmad\ncampaign affects the students right\nnow.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents?\nI feel that it\u2019s important that the\nCollege offers a range of accommo-dation, and a high standard. Rents\nat the moment are getting towards\nextortionate levels, and I would like\nto see them held for the next few\nyears. When the new Southside halls\nare built in a few years\u2019 time, I do not\nwant to see rents shoot through the\nroof like they have done in Beit.\nShould rents be based on\nstudents\u2019 ability to pay?\nShould richer students pay\nmore for the same quality of\naccommodation?\nNo.\nYou say in your manifesto\nthat you support moves to\nmodernise Beit Quad. Which\nmoves in particular?\nAs I said, I think the current moves\nto modernise the Quad are excel-lent, and I am fully behind them.\nHowever I wouldn\u2019t let anything go\nahead that would jeopardise club\nand society activities. In particular\nI\u2019m thinking about the Union gym\nand some of the meeting rooms.\nIn my opinion, the plans for the\ngym and some of the meeting rooms\nhave not been thought through fully,\nand we\u2019d be putting ourselves in a\nseriously difficult position in terms\nof clubs and societies. However I am\nfully in favour of modernising the\nground floor. I think the main foyer\nis grotesque and needs completely\noverhauling and modernising, our\nentertainment venues could do with\nmodernising, and there\u2019s no doubt\nthat the catering facilities in Da\nVinci\u2019s need to be brought into the\n21st century.\nYou also mention your\n\u201cinvolvement with ICU at\nevery level\u201d. How would that\nmake you a good President?\nWell initially I got involved in a\nhandful of clubs and societies in\nmy first year, as I think most people did. I went on to be chairman\nof Musical Theatre Society, before\nbecoming chairman of the Arts and\nEntertainments Board this academic year. I\u2019ve also been involved as\nsenior part time staff in the ents\ndepartment for the past two and a\nhalf years. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed\nworking for the Union, and I think\nthat having seen both sides of the\nUnion does make me a better candi-date, as I have a realistic impression\nof what goes on. Working as a volunteer officer you can get a very idealistic viewpoint of what you should\nbe achieving, but working as staff\nyou get a much more realistic idea\nof how things actually work. I\u2019ve\nthoroughly enjoyed being behind the\nscenes, not just being a person who\nsays how they want it to be, but\nbeing a person who actually makes\nit happen.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nAs I\u2019ve said, I have got a broad level\nof experience from different points\nof view, the inside and outside, as a\nstudent and a staff member. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a fair argument to say\nthat a newcomer to the post would\ntake months to get to grips with\nit. In actual fact I will say explicitly now that I am against two-year\nsabbatical positions. Sabbaticals are\nthere to give the ideas, the representation and the leadership, not\nto do the day-to-day work. After\npeople become removed from the\nstudent body, they become removed\nfrom student opinion. I believe that\nI offer a realistic outlook for the\nUnion. I\u2019m talking real things, real\nachievements, sensible ideas, not\ncampaigns to save the world or stop\nthe war in Iraq.\nWhy are you standing for\nPresident?\nFor a lot of reasons really. One of\nthem is that I\u2019m sick and tired of the\nway the Union\u2019s been run over the\nlast couple of years \u2013 basically I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a representative or democratic organisation in any sense of\nwhat those words should mean. So\npart of why I\u2019m standing is because,\nif elected, I would make a number of\nchanges to make the Union far more\nrepresentative of the student body,\nsuch as moving from the enclosed,\nbureaucratic Council system to the\nGeneral Meeting system where it\u2019s\none student one vote, and any student can vote on Union policy.\nWhat\u2019s the single most\nimportant thing a students\u2019\nunion can do for its\nmembers?\nRepresent them, that\u2019s the most\nimportant thing. I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s\ngot their own idea of how they want\ntheir Union to be, but representation is the key issue.\nShould Imperial College\nUnion be campaigning to\nfree Babar Ahmad?\nThe Union should most definitely\nbe campaigning for his release. I\nbelieve we should have campaigned\nfor his release even if he had no\nconnection with Imperial, but since\nhe does have that connection it\u2019s\nunquestionable. As a Union we can\nhave a real influence in the campaign as we\u2019re his former College, so\nit\u2019s important that we get involved.\nWhat about other political\nissues, such as \u2018stop George\nBush\u2019 or pulling British troops\nout of Iraq?\nObviously it comes down to what\nthe student body as a whole want,\nand that\u2019s part of opening the Union\nup to the students. I believe that\nthe majority of people would want\nto take those steps, partly because\nthey\u2019re enormously important\nissues on a global scale and it would\nbe stupid to ignore them. I think\nImperial is far too isolated and we\nneed to address these issues. Also I\nthink it would strengthen the Union\nif we did campaign on issues that\npeople care about, because it would\ninvolve them in the process and give\npeople more confidence and more\nfaith in the Union if it\u2019s being seen\nto fight on different fronts. Look at\nLSE, they\u2019re taking a stance on the\nwar and they regularly have three\nor four hundred people at general\nmeetings discussing these issues\nand others.\nCan the Union really make a\ndifference on those issues,\nor would it be better to spend\nthe time and resources on\nclubs and societies?\nI don\u2019t think it would detract in any\nway from clubs and societies \u2013 I\nthink our Union can do both. Actually\nit would help clubs and societies\nbecause we would draw more students into meetings to make decisions on clubs and societies and on\nother issues.\nThe current President\nclaimed to work 100 hours\na week during the autumn\nterm. How would you manage\nthe workload?\nI think Mustafa complains a lot, but\nI do understand it is an extremely\ndemanding job. I\u2019m very politically\nactive as a person, I spend most\ndays, nights and weekends doing\nstuff politically as well as doing my\ncourse, so I think that would be good\npreparation. I am involved in a lot of\nthings across the board, and I think\nPresident would be a good step up.\nWhat are your views on hall\nrents? Should they be based\non students\u2019 ability to pay?\nMy stance is that rents should be\nbased on students\u2019 ability to pay\n\u2013 richer students should pay more\nfor their accommodation, subsidis-ing those who can\u2019t afford it. Within\nthat, it should be random which hall\nyou get. I also think that hall rents\nshouldn\u2019t be increasing every year. I\nunderstand that College Residences\nhave to be self-funding by law, so I\nthink we should be campaigning for\nthis to change. We know how much\nmoney the College has, so there\u2019s\nenough there to make sure that\nrents don\u2019t have to increase.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to\nImperial College Union?\nMost people would see the biggest change as a drive to General\nMeetings, one student one vote,\ninstead of Council meetings. I think\nmost students would see that as a\npositive change.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nI think there\u2019s a similar thrust to\nwhat the other four candidates\nare saying. They want to basically\nmaintain what\u2019s happening at the\nmoment and make minor changes,\nbut I think change is what we need,\nto make ICU a fighting students\u2019\nunion.\nELECTION INTERVIEWS elections@ic.ac.uk\nMAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD\nVote online Friday 11 \u2013 Tuesday 15 February\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/elections\n\n"

    "content": "A day in the life\nNicolas Osman extols the virtues of an epic 20th century novel. It\u2019s even better than revision\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\n30\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPut away your notes. Turn off the\ntelevision. Put the textbooks back on\ntheir shelf. Find a copy of Ulysses,\nand read it now.\nI admit that this is a slightly odd\nopening, but I would really recommend reading this book. I can\u2019t really describe it, I don\u2019t understand it,\nit\u2019s just absolutely brilliant.\nMost book reviews would cover\nthe plot. I can do that in a sentence;\nUlysses is about a man, who gets\nup, goes to work, wanders around\nDublin, and goes home. That\u2019s it. 24\nhours in the life of a certain Leopold\nBloom, on 16 June 1904. Now, you\nmight think that this makes for\na dull book (especially as this is\nspread over 900 pages). However,\nUlysses shouldn\u2019t be read for the\nincredible plot; instead, it is the way\nit is written that is to be enjoyed.\nWe are used to reading novels where characters are forced\nthrough a series of quite extraordinary events by god-like authors.\nJames Joyce, on the other hand,\ntakes the role of neutral observer\nrather than director. The novel is\na verisimilitude, like an intricately\ndetailed picture taken from nature,\nwhere every brushstroke is loaded\nwith meaning.\nHowever, there is a definite parallel between the novel and its all-action predecessor, the Odyssey.\nEach chapter of Ulysses is a retelling of an episode of the Odyssey:\nthe aged professors at the library\nare Scylla and Charybdis; the Sirens\nbecome barmaids, and a nationalist citizen takes the place of the\nCyclops. As well as this, Ulysses is\na physical novel \u2013 each chapter has\nan associated piece of the anatomy,\nand these disparate chapters all\nadd together to make a functioning whole. Also, each chapter is\nassigned a colour and a field of\nstudy; although none of this is mentioned explicitly, Joyce used these\nthemes as blueprints for this massive novel.\nUlysses reflects the fact that Joyce\nsees his language as dying out. Not\nonly is the Irish language giving\nway to English, but English is giving way to \u2018electrical English\u2019, the\nlanguage of cinema, gramophones\nand wireless. And, as such, Ulysses\nis a novel to end all novels.\nTaking the starting point with\nthe ancient tradition of poets passing down their epics, Joyce seems\nto move through every conceivable mode of written English.\nOne chapter is written in Middle\nEnglish; another is written as a play.\nThe most striking chapter is the\nNausicaa chapter, in which Bloom\nfantasises about a young girl on the\nstrand before him. The language\nis flowing and poetic, building up\nto a climax, when Bloom suddenly\nrealises that the girl is lame. At this\npoint, the language collapses into a\nmess of the incomplete sentences\nand intangible thought processes\nthat are so common in the rest\nof the book. Although this writing\nstyle seems overwhelming, it does\nindeed seem that we are reading\nthe mind of the protagonist. As an\nexample, consider the lines:\n\u201cPerfume of embraces all him\nassailed. With hungered flesh\nobscurely he mutely craved to\nadored\u201d\nTo most people, it seems that the\nwords are random. In fact, Joyce\nspent an entire day on these two\nsentences alone. His English seems\nto be teeming with life and beauty,\nbut only because the words are in\nexactly the correct order. At times,\nentire sentences are repeated in a\ncompletely different order, to show\nthe fluidity of language. And the\ntheme of language is an important\none; Joyce shows how language\ndefines the way we think, and the\nway that we see the world.\nThe novel was written in the\nearly part of the 20th century and,\nlike most creative art from that\nperiod, it deals with encroaching\nmechanisation. Bloom sympathis-es with the machines, thinking in\ntheir terms and giving them words\n(\u201cSllt\u201d, \u201cGurrhr\u201d and \u201cfrseeeeeeeefronnnng\u201d are all words assigned\nto inanimate objects). Indeed,\nBloom himself seems an automaton at times, following strings of\ninstructions, with little apparent\nmotivation. As well as seeming to\nbe part-machine, he seems to be\npart-female as well. One charac-ter, Stephen Dedalus, sees heaven as a place where \u201ceveryman is\nhis own wife\u201d; Bloom takes this to\nextremes, both physical (masturba-tion in the Nausicaa chapter) and\nmental. Indeed, reference is made\nboth to Bloom\u2019s foreskin and (dur-ing a particularly odd episode) his\nvulva, showing his struggle between\nmasculine and feminine. Perhaps\nJoyce saw that man and woman\nwould eventually become completely indistinguishable, as humanity\nand the inanimate coalesced.\nOneofthemostfascinatingaspects\nof Ulysses is the range of references\nit makes. As well as Shakespeare\nand Chaucer, Joyce includes some\nsurprising pieces of information,\nincluding astronomical classifica-tions, historical events, and entire\npieces of legend. A small section\nis devoted to an Irish warrior, who\nbears images of \u201cIrish heroes and\nheroines of antiquity\u201d; these include\nCaptain Nemo, Alessandro Volta\nand (for fans of Saint-Sa\u00ebns) The\nMan Who Broke the Bank at Monte\nCarlo. This dense layering of cross\nreferences means that its hard not\nto realise that you recognise some-thing, although, at the same time, I\nwas always wondering what I wasn\u2019t\npicking up while reading.\nI will admit that, for the most\npart, I didn\u2019t have a clue what was\ngoing on in Ulysses, but then again,\nit isn\u2019t always necessary to understand something to enjoy it. If you\napproach it without trying to dissect\nit, it\u2019s really enjoyable. The problem\ncomes later on when you start to\nthink like bloom yes and stop using\npunctuation like the last 60 or so\npages and everything becomes like\none big sentence which is a brilliant ending very upbeat yes and the\nparagraphs go awol as well but the\nword limit approaching how many\nwords did he say seven hundred yes\ntoo late for that and yes to write yes\nand will I stop now Yes\nUlysses\nby James Joyce\nHHHHI\nUlysses.

This was not\njust a record for the com-pany, but also a record for any\nBritish business, ever.\nThe most significant contributor to Shell\u2019s profits\nwas the continued high oil\nprice during the last year.\nThe war in Iraq, problems in\nVenezuela and Nigeria, trouble at the Russian oil firm\nYukos and high demand from\nChina all contributed to the\nhigh price of oil. The OPEC\ngroup of oil producing nations\nalso reached maximum oil\noutput rates and so could not\nincrease supply to reduce\nprices. These factors led to\nan all time record price of\nover $55 a barrel.\nWhen oil prices are high,\nShell and other oil companies\nmake more money even if they\nkeep their profit margins the\nsame. Indeed, this has been a\ngreat year for the energy sec-tor, with Exxon Mobil making\na record $25.3bn profit and\nChevron Texaco doubling its\nforth quarter profits.\nShell\u2019s recent troubles\nHowever, what is surprising\nabout Shell\u2019s record profit is\nthat the company has been\nthrough a lot of difficulties\nrecently. Just under a year\nago, Cairn Energy announced\nthat it had found major oil\nreserves in the Rajasthan\narea of India, and the news\nof the discovery rocketed\nCairn into the FTSE top 100\ncompanies. This was a major\nembarrassment for Shell, as\nthey had sold the oil field to\nCairn for only $7m. It is now\nvalued at $500m.\nWhile Cairn was making\nhuge finds in its oil reserves,\nShell began announcing to\nthe stock market that it had\noverestimated the amount\nof oil it thought it had left\nunder the ground of the fields\nit owned. It has now re-evalu-ated its oil reserves five times\nin just over a year, which has\nresulted in it losing a third of\nits projected total.\nThis scandal has resulted\nin Shell being fined \u00a382.7m\nby the US and UK financial\nregulators. The scandal also\nresulted in the departure of\nthree top executives and an\nend to the company\u2019s historic\ndual board system, where it\nhad one board in the UK and\none in the Netherlands.\nAlthough it announced\nrecord profits, Shell\u2019s share\nprice fell 1.7% as investors\npredicted a tough year ahead\nfor the company. It only has\nnine years\u2019 worth of projected oil reserves left, and only\nadded the equivalent of ten\nweeks\u2019 worth of oil production in 2004. This compares\nbadly with Exxon Mobil, who\nhave 14 years of oil reserves\nleft and found enough new oil\nlast year to make up for what\nthey sold. Essentially, at this\nrate, Exxon Mobil have the\nreserves to keep on going, but\nShell may not last ten years.\nWindfall tax\nShell\u2019s record profits have\nbeen called \u201cobscene\u201d and\nhave led to new calls for a\none off \u2018windfall tax\u2019, which\ncould be used to improve\nGovernment spending or to\nboost pension funds. This\nhas happened before, in 1997,\nwhentheLabourGovernment\ntaxed privatised utility companies \u00a34.8bn extra to fund\nthe \u2018welfare to work\u2019 scheme.\nAlthough they complained,\nthe utility companies paid up\nin the end. Shell, however, has\nthreatened to reduce North\nSea Oil production, and thus\ncut UK jobs, if it is taxed\nfurther.\nAlthough a tax may look\ntempting, we need to remember that a company exists\nto make profits, and to tax\nthem extra may deter them\nfrom engaging in business\n\u2013 what\u2019s the point of working\nhard to make money if the\nGovernment is just going to\ntake it from you?\nSecondly, this profit is just\na one-off and is not caused by\nShell ripping off its customer,\nbut rather by high oil prices.\nThe Government wouldn\u2019t\neven think of subsidising\nShell if it were making a loss\nbecause oil prices were low.\nIf the Government were to\ntax Shell, it would be on international profits, not just those\nearned in the UK. This could\nbe challenged in the courts, or\nmay lead to retaliatory action\nby other nations, which would\nbe bad for British business.\nEnvironmental concerns\nEnvironmental groups want\nto tax Shell for different reasons to consumer groups and\ntrade unions. Friends of the\nEarth (FoE) argue that Shell\nonly makes so much money\nbecause other people are left\nto pick up the cost of its pollu-tion. The gas burnt when oil\nis drilled from Shell\u2019s Nigeria\nplant produces more greenhouse gases than the whole\nof sub-Saharan Africa com-bined. FoE wants Shell taxed\nto help pay for s the environmental damage caused by\nenergy companies.\n\u201cIf Shell had to pay for the\ndamage being caused by global warming, these figures\nwould not look so good. Shell\nshould seek future profitability in clean and sustainable energy, not the fossil\nfuels that now endanger our\nplanet,\u201d said FoE.\nThe Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell announced record profits of \u00a39.3bn last week, mainly due to the high price of oil from refineries like this\nShell\u2019s \u00a39.3bn\nprofit\n\u25cf \u00a39.3bn is a record British\nprofit (at least until Vodafone\nreleases its figures in April)\n\u25cf It\u2019s equivalent to \u00a325m a\nday or \u00a31m an hour or \u00a3295\nper second!\n\u25cf If it was stacked in \u00a350\nnotes, it would reach twice\nthe height of Everest and\nweigh more than two blue\nwhales\nShell CEO, Jeroen van der Veer, presents record profits to\nstakeholders\n\n"

This was handled\nbeautifully by the stunningly\nfit (in more ways than one)\nand agile IC ladies.\nLibby, the brave Brummie\nin goal for the first time,\nshowed us her hidden talents\nby making some spectacular\nsaves from fast, unpredictable shots. Kathy (who can do\namazing things with her legs)\ndefended brilliantly down\nthe right and smelt very nice\nwhilst doing it: strawberries.\nGuiles, our centre defender,\nkept us in line and made some\namazing sprints and tackles,\nwhich kept Sussex\u2019s strikers\nat bay.\nOur team captain, Poppy,\npicked up on a free-kick and\nsprinted fast for something so\nsmall in the distance: Sussex\u2019s\ngoal. After dribbling past their\ndefence, Poppy executed a\nshot that just nudged their\nkeeper. They had learned to\nfear us! And so they should\nas Chlo\u00e9, our left winger, did\nnot allow anyone down her\nline. When she had the ball\n(Zidane-like, French genes at\nwork) she always managed\nto find Poppy or Joe and tri-angulate their way forward.\nThe right side was held by\nJoe, who, during one of her\nmany forays back to defend\nthe goal, pulled off such a\nperfect tackle that she got\ncongratulated by the girl she\ntook down. Courageous Alex\n(the birthday girl) ran left and\nright with amazing defending\ntactics and skills and, along\nwith Guiles and Kathy, held\nthe line tight. She was challenged by a girl three times\nher size in the second half\nand still managed to save the\ngoal.\nThe whistle blew for full\ntime and the game ended at\n8-0, but the IC ladies can hold\ntheir heads high because we\nplayed fantastically with only\nseven players and each player\ngave a great performance!\nThe score wasn\u2019t that important in the end because so\nmuch fun was had by all. And\nnot just on the pitch but by\ncelebrating with some burgers and chips in Brighton! IC\nladies... shaking that ass!\nFOOTBALL\nNo victory but best effort award to Imperial ladies\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 3\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 2\n(after extra time)\nBy Oliver Wright\nImperial\u2019s flagship football\nteam returned to Shenley to\navengethesemi-finaldefeatof\ntwo years ago. Admittedly, we\nwere playing UCL Seconds,\nand a win should have been a\nformality for such a talented\nbunch of individuals, but as\nwe all know, anything can\nhappen in the cup!\nThe game kicked off, and\nwith Imperial sleeping, UCL\nwasquicktocapitalise. Firstly,\na blistering strike from a UCL\nmidfielder seemed to be firing into the top corner until a\nflying Peruvian by the name\nof Carlos Alberto Vasquez\ndiverted the danger. What a\ngoalie!\nThe pressure persisted,\nhowever, and after a neat\nbuild up, their striker (who\nwas smelly) fired past the\non-rushing keeper. One-nil.\nUberbeef! The troops rallied and, following a Chris\nWoodcock free-kick, T found\nPat Farr free in the box to\nequalise. One-one. Back of\nthe net!\nThe goal seemed to inspire\ntheteamtoproducesomesex-ual football. One such piece of\nerotic play saw Timur combine brilliantly with Javier to\nslot calmly past the \u2018keeper.\nEat my goal! Imperial began\nto dominate, with a thunderous effort from Berksy arrow-ing just over, but the third\ngoal remained elusive.\nThe second half started\nmuch the same as the first,\nwith sloppy Imperial defending and gifting their smelly\nstriker a second goal.\nAgain Imperial responded\nin the best possible way, creating numerous chances, but\nour luck wasn\u2019t in. Javier was\npulling the strings in the mid-dle, and a couple of his efforts\nnarrowly missed the target.\nAs full time approached,\nJR, T and Mathan all had\nchances to win it, but last\nditch defending saved UCL.\nFull time, two-two!\nA rousing team talk by the\nhamstrung badger breathed\nlifeintoachinglimbs.Imperial\nagain looked the most likely\nto win the game, but they\nhad to rely on the agility of\ntheir South American stopper to keep them in it. In the\nfinal moments of the game,\nWoodcock whipped in a dangerous corner, and Pat Farr,\nwho\u2019d been a rock in defence\nall game, rose to power in the\nwinner. GET IN! His second\nof the game brought ecstatic\ncelebrations and a huge sigh\nof relief.\nSpecial mentions must go\nto Carlos and Berksy who\ncovered every blade of grass,\nand man of the match Pat\nFarr. A tough tie against LSE\nFirsts now beckons in the\nquarters, as Imperial hunt for\nthe ULU Cup.\nFOOTBALL\nPatsolutely Farrbulous\nBy Jaidip H Patel\nInthefashionofDiscDoctors\u2019s\n(dD) attempt to dominate the\nsports pages, another match\nreport is brought to you for\nyour perusal, even if it only\ngets read by those of you at\nhome sat on the bog!\nLast week dD took a timely\ntrip to Falmer (Brighton) to\ntake on two teams in a match-day hosted by University\nof Sussex\u2019s own team,\nMohawks.\nFirst a bit of background\nwork: In the run-up to the\nregional play-offs in six weeks\ntime it had been taken upon\nthe South East teams to go\nhead-to-head against as many\nteams in as many matches as\npossible in order to feasibly\nseed 30+ teams that would\nbe competing for a place in\nthe nationals. Does that make\nsense? Basically, this means\nthat various teams would play\neach other to see where they\nranked (roughly) in the region\nto ensure that they got a fair\nfight at the actual regional\ntournament. And so the \u201cladder system\u201d was born. This\nmeans that teams gained\npoints (and thus rank) not\nonly by playing matches, but\nalso for going against better\nteams on their home ground\neven if they lost! Genius.\nAnother reason is to increase\nthe profile of student ultimate\n(as it\u2019s called by those playing Ultimate Frisbee) in the\nSE region, which lacks good\nstudent teams despite having the best open Mens team\nnationally. Proudly, dD\u2019s own\nstar mid-receiver, Kris Wong,\nplayed a vital role in devising\nthe ladder system.\nEnough of that technical\nbabble. dD showed up with\nseven players and three\nrolling subs in Brighton\nsuited and booted who were:\nEmmanuel \u201cI can\u2019t catch, but\nI\u2019m still President!\u201d Bennett,\nNeville \u201cCaptain Canadian\u201d\nDubash, Chris \u201cThose big red\nballs cost \u00a3120!\u201d Rowlands,\nIan \u201cMunky\u201d Ballantyne, Jee\n\u201csmallbutcool\u201dKwan,George\n\u201cGordan\u201d Brownbridge,\nLaurie \u201cI always get the\ngirl\u201d Fischer, Stas \u201cCTAC\u201d\nParpantel, Nathan \u201cI\u2019m the\nbest\u201d Muir and yours truly.\nAlthough this wasn\u2019t the\nentire first team, as scheduled dD were ready to take on\nthe regions best and worst. In\ntotal six teams showed up to\nplay two matches each and\npick up some well-earned\nrank points: Under Cover\nLovers (UCL), Mohawks\n(SussexUni),Brunel(that\u2019sit;\nthat\u2019s their name), Holloway\nHammers, Surrey Scorpions\nand dD. Our first match was\nagainst Brunel:\nDisc Doctors 1\nBrunel 11\nHaving convinced us of their\nability at indoor regionals last\nterm, both teams wanted to\nprove their outdoor worth for\nthe first time on the field.\nWith their full 1st team,\nBrunel lined up ready to take\non dD and, unperturbed, we\nthrew a zone play (imagine\na wall of three players marking the player with possession of the disc) as a defensive tactic for the first point.\nAs it turned out, their main\nreceiver and \u201chucker\u201d was\nable to break this with huge\nthrows up either side of the\npitch to a skilful, high-jump-ing receiver and managed to\nbeat any of our deep defend-ers. Quite annoying really.\nThen, to make matters worse,\nthey threw their own defensive play that comprised of\none player trying to cut out\nany open-side passes (a.k.a\na \u201cpoach\u201d) merely by guarding close open space usually\nleft clear for cutters. Brunel\ncontinued to dominate the\nmatch with precision and skill\ndespite Manny\u2019s committed\nlay-out (equivalent to a diving\nheader with your hands to\ncatch the disc) to deny Brunel,\none of the points. Just when\nwe had got used to breaking their defence with some\ngreat passes and expert flow\nto allow Stas to score, Brunel\ntook the match comfortably. I\nguess we didn\u2019t \u201csuck it up\u201d\nenough, dammit!\nDisc Doctors 11\nUnder Cover Lovers 2\nDown, but not out were\nNeville\u2019s (ye old Club Captain)\nwords of wisdom that ensured\nlessons were learnt. The next\ngame was to be a whole different story. Unfortunately, UCL\ncould only field six players\n(short by one) and so were\noutnumbered for the duration\nof the match. But that didn\u2019t\nstop them from scoring on us.\nWith myself and Chris leading from the back with some\ngood flow and up-field passes\nto the mid player receivers\n(Manny and Munky), dD took\nquick charge of the game.\nDue to being outnumbered\nUCL could only try clever for-mations, sacrificing players\ninto a zone-type play. But dD\nhad practiced against much\nof this in the preceding weeks\nand easily broke UCL\n\u2019s strategy with impressive points\nfrom Manny, Stas and George.\nDespite long-field hucks and\nend-zone hammers by \u201cEasy\u201d\n(UCL), dD proved their merit\nby taking the game well within\nthe 40 minute time limit.\nI hope most of that made\nsense folks, and if it didn\u2019t,\nwhy not come along to a practice sometime? Practices are\nnearby in Hyde Park next to\nthe tennis courts. Just look\nout for the flying discs! All\nlevels of ability are welcome,\nand no previous experience\nis necessary. You could make\nthe first team in less than a\nyear!\nKeep it real y\u2019all. Track dD\u2019s\nroute to regionals here in the\ncoming six weeks.\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nDisc Doctors battle SE teams\nIC Ladies: a fantastic performance with only seven players\nSpectacular stuff: Gif launches himself to catch the disc\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005 31\nStyle, glamour, the most beautiful\nlocations in Europe and some of the\nbiggest names in Hollywood have\nall been packed into this new film\nby Steven Soderbergh. It\u2019s the big\nbudget sequel to Ocean\u2019s Eleven,\nthe aptly titled Ocean\u2019s Twelve.\nAdding in the promise of a little\nintrigue, a dash of romance and a\ntwisty plot, you might think that\nSoderbergh would have produced\na really great movie, but unfortunately Ocean\u2019s Twelve never quite\ndelivers the goods.\nSo Danny Ocean and his boys are\nback. At the end of the first film, his\nnew-age gang of thieves disbanded\nand went their separate ways after\nstealing $160 million from lecherous\ncasino boss Terry Vincent, played\nas slick and menacing by veteran\nAndy Garcia. Now, three years later,\nVincent has tracked down all those\nwho stole from him and he wants\nhis money back, with interest, in\njust two weeks. With no time to\nspare, Ocean rounds up his old crew\nand they head for Europe to steal\nenough to save their lives.\nWhat follows is a whirlwind of\nplanning and execution, as they\ncome up with inventive and original ways of stealing their proposed\ntargets. At the same time, howev-er, they are being watched by a\nmysterious figure \u2013 the Nightfox\n\u2013 a master thief himself, who could\nturn out to be either friend or foe.\nAlso in pursuit of Ocean et al is\nIsabel, a brilliant Europol investiga-tor, who is determined to catch the\nslippery boys in the act and send\nthem all to prison. She also has\nto contend with ex-boyfriend Rusty\nRyan (Brad Pitt) who uses his considerable charms to try to get the\nbetter of her.\nGeorge Clooney reprises his role\nas Danny Ocean, and brings class\nand boyish charm to the lead. Brad\nPitt plays his right hand man to\nperfection: making him the suave, if\nslightly arrogant, master con artiste\nand point man he needs to be. A couple of other well-known names such\nas Matt Damon and Don Cheadle\nare thrown in as well, with British\nactors Eddie Izzard and Robbie\nColtrane in special guest starring\nroles.\nThe ladies of this film, do their\nvery best to balance out the almost\noverwhelming levels of testosterone\npresent, whilst also bringing a lot of\nglamour to the screen. Julia Roberts\nis Ocean\u2019s long-suffering wife Tess,\nwho gets in on the action this time\naround; and Catherine Zeta Jones\nis the enigmatic Isabel.\nThe cast is, without a doubt, full of\nfirst-rate actors, but with so many\nstars present the film seems to be\ncluttered with lots of two-dimen-sional characters. This includes\nMatt Damon, who comes across as\nterribly inconsistent and is nowhere\nnear believable as Linus Caldwell,\nthe young pickpocket trying to prove\nhimself. The American comedian\nBernie Mac also appears, but his\ncomedicgeniusiscompletelyunused\nby Soderbergh as Mac\u2019s character is\nleft to languish in a Dutch jail for\nalmost the entire movie.\nAs the story progresses, we are\ntaken across the continent from\nAmsterdam and Rome to the shores\nof Lake Como, and all is done in lavish style. The European backdrop\nprovides the film with the elegance\nthat is not often found in many of\ntoday\u2019s Hollywood offerings. The\nsoundtrack skips from contemporary to classical with a bit of late\nsixties retro thrown in to perfectly\noffset each scene.\nSoderbergh has wonderfully succeeded in choosing the perfect backdrop for the story and the action that\nis meant to follow; but it is here that\nthe film lets itself down \u2013 the plot\nmore or less sucks. It isn\u2019t terrible,\njust extremely weak \u2013 an initially\nconfusing plot eventually gives way\nto some very predictable final twists,\ntaking two hours to do so. The end\ndragged on miserably, attempting to\ntie up all loose ends.\nThere was also hardly any tension\nthroughout the film, which is unusual in this kind of production. And\nthe meticulous preparation for the\nheists, which was what I had come\nto expect from Ocean\u2019s Eleven and\nhad made it that much more inter-esting, was simply skimmed over\nthis time. It was also disappointing that the few action scenes were\nerratic and short-lived.\nWhilst there are some enjoyable\nscenes in the film and no one part\nof it is too terrible, it just seems to\nlack any real substance and comes\nacross as no more than an excuse to\nget a lot of famous friends together\nin one movie. The cast is definitely\nthe main draw of the film, as any fan\nwill tell you. It was, in a word, fun,\nbut not something to write home\nabout.

Coincidentally, the National\nFilm Theatre are now screening\nScorsese\u2019s 1976 masterpiece next\nweek, giving fans an opportunity to\nwatch it on the big screen.\nThis is a film about a lonely\nVietnam veteran, whose antipathy towards the decadence in the\nstreets around him drives him to\nundertake a violent mission to rid\nthe city of \u201cthe scum, the dogs and\nthe filth\u201d.\nTaxi Driver was Martin Scorsese\nand Robert De Niro\u2019s second\ncollaboration after the superb\nMean Streets. Thanks to its suc-cess, the two went on to make a\nseries of legendary films such as\nRaging Bull, Goodfellas, and\nCasino. This is, without doubt, a very\nimportant film.\nTaxi Driver is one of those rarities \u2013 an art-house movie that was\na complete critical and commercial success. Nowadays, no matter how good a film is, it will not\nreach a massive audience unless\nits release is preceded by several\nmonths of costly marketing and\nadvertising. Unashamedly commercial films such as Ocean\u2019s Twelve\nmake money and dominate the cinema listings because of huge marketing campaigns that condition\naudiences into knowing what to\nexpect. Ocean\u2019s Twelve is a good\nbet for mindless entertainment,\ntherefore, it is a bankable movie for\na Friday night. Taxi Driver is the\nopposite \u2013 your expectations will\ninevitably be shattered, and your\nresponse after seeing it will be\nunpredictable.\nTaxi Driver is a disturbing movie\nin which every scene is designed to\ncapture the lead character\u2019s oppressive loneliness. Its famous \u201cYou\ntalkin\u2019 to me?\u201d scene, where De\nNiro\u2019s character has a gunslinging\ncompetition with his own reflection,\nhas been referenced in movies such\nas La Haine. The film ending and\nplot has even influenced recent box\noffice hits such as Bad Santa. Most\nfamously, perhaps, there were calls\nTaxi Driver to be banned after the\nfilm inspired a real-life assassination attempt on the life of Ronald\nReagan in 1981.\nIn the current commercial climate\nin the movie industry, I would not\nbe surprised one bit if they made\nTaxi Driver II. A sequel to such an\ninfluential film is guaranteed to be\na massive commercial success, and\nnowadays, that in itself is a good\nenough reason to make it.\nDarius Nikbin\n\u201cIt is here that\nthe film lets itself\ndown \u2013 the plot more\nor less sucks...\u201d\nListings: page 22\n\u201cTaxi Driver is one of\nthose rarities \u2013 an arthouse movie that was\na complete success\u201d\nTheir expressions look as bland as this film\nOUT NEXT WEEK\nReleased on Friday 11 February at\nVue Fulham Broadway:\n\u25cf The Mask 2:\nSon of the Mask\n\u25cf Spongebob\nSquarepants\n\u25cf The Sea Inside\n\u25cf The Magic\nRoundabout\nVisit www.myvue.com/student for\nmore details.\nVue Fulham Broadway are giving\nyou the opportunity to win merchandise for the week\u2019s new releases.\nJust answer this question:\nWho is the odd one out and why?\na) Jim Carrey\nb) Leonardo DiCaprio\nc) Matt Damon\nEmail your answers and which merchandise you would like to win to\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk.

If you are a registered student but do not have an\nIC login (for example, because you\nare studying a joint course between\nImperial College and another institution such as the Royal College\nof Art), please email elections@ic.\nac.uk to arrange to vote by email.\nAll Union elections are carried out\nby Single Transferable Vote (STV),\na system that has been developed\nto give the voter more power than\nin the traditional \u2018first past the post\u2019\nsystem favoured in UK General\nElections. STV is a form of preferential voting, which means that instead\nof casting a single vote for a single\ncandidate, a voter can express a list\nof preferences. Votes are cast by\nputting a \u20181\u2019 in the column next to\nthe voter\u2019s preferred candidate, a \u20182\u2019\nbeside their second favourite candidate and so on until they no longer\nwish to express a preference.\nWhen it comes to counting the\nvotes, a quota is calculated which\nsets the number of votes a candidate must attain to be elected. This\nis simply the total number of votes\ncast, divided by one more than the\nnumber of candidates to be elected,\nplus one vote. By following this for-mula, no more than the required\nnumber of candidates can reach\nthe quota. First, votes are counted\naccording to the first preferenc-es, and any candidates who have\nachieved the quota are elected.\nTo decide which of the remaining\ncandidates are elected, the votes\nare transferred from candidates\nwho have more than the necessary\nnumber to achieve the quota and\nfrom the candidate with the least\nnumber of votes. This means that\nwhere the first preference of a voter\nwas not able to be used to elect a\ncandidate (or not necessary, in the\ncase of a candidate who has reached\nquota), their subsequent preferences come into play. This process of\ntransferring votes continues until\nthe required number of candidates\nhave attained enough votes to be\nelected.\nThe main benefit of STV is that\nit avoids wasting votes in so-called\n\u2018safe seats\u2019, where one candidate\nmight be streets ahead of the others\n\u2013 in this case, the second choice candidates will make a real difference.\nOr, similarly, you may want to back\na candidate who ends up getting\neliminated \u2013 your vote would not be\nwasted, as your next preference will\nbe reallocated to a candidate who\u2019s\nstill in the race. All in all, it empowers the voter.\nFor more information, go to www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nCandidate interviews\nFelix has interviewed all the candidates for the 2005 Imperial College Union sabbatical elections.\nThe students you elect will take a year out from their degrees to occupy the most senior roles in\nyour students\u2019 union.

By\nre-running the election, we have\nthe added bonus off pissing off our\nesteemed President, Mustafa Arif.\nVoting RON sends a message to\nthe candidates that we are no longer\nhappy to accept mediocre sabbati-cals; we only want the best.\nIs a vote for RON a wasted\nvote?\nIt\u2019s not a waste at all. Not a single\nvote in these elections is wasted. By\nvoting RON, you are sending a message to those standing that they\u2019re\nnot good enough.\nWhy would voting RON make\nthe Union better?\nThe Union is going through a time of\ngreat upheaval. We need sabbaticals\nwith a clear, powerful vision, with\nstrength and determination to see\nthings through.\nWe need Deputy Presidents\nwho are capable of supporting the\nPresident in his or her role.\nLooking at the Presidential candi-dates, some of them have a distinct\nlack of exp in high-profile roles. And\njust because a co-pilot has seen a\npilot fly a plane once, that doesn\u2019t\nmean they\u2019re capable of doing\ntheir job.

    "content": "16 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 February 2005\nELECTION INTERVIEWS elections@ic.ac.uk\nWhy are you standing?\nI\u2019m standing because of the fact that\nI feel it\u2019s a job I can do. I\u2019ve always\nbeen involved in the Union since\nI first came to the College back in\nOctober of 2001. This is something\nthat I feel I\u2019m actually quite good at,\nand I can use the abilities that I have\nnaturally to give something back to\nthe students.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on\nmodernising Beit Quad?\nIt\u2019s a double-edged sword really.\nComing from the position of Equal\nOppportunities Officer this year, I\ncan see that there is some modernisation needed in order to comply\nwith legislation that will be coming\ninto force towards the end of this\nyear. Ultimately this Union needs\nto give the members what they\nwant, and if we\u2019re not doing what\nthe members want, then we should\nchange what we\u2019re doing. However\nif the members are happy with the\nbuilding, we should keep it as it is,\nbut still remembering the new legislation that\u2019s coming in.\nHow can the Union improve\nents to attract more\nstudents?\nAgain, it\u2019s a double-edged sword\nthere. You get many people within\nthe College who like the ents that\nwe have. Wednesday nights, for\ninstance, have always been popular\nwith sports clubs. Basically it comes\ndown to finding out what the students want, and then doing it so you\nactually get feedback.\nWhat do you think they want?\nCheap beer, good music and the\nability to go somewhere with their\nfriends where they feel safe.\nDo you think the Union\nwastes money?\nYes.\nWhere, and how will you stop\nit?\nFor one thing, we do a lot of duplica-tion. Lots and lots of paperwork gets\nduplicated. I know this from being a\nclub officer, we have to pay for these\nthings to be printed and processed,\nand what\u2019s the point? We can do\nall these things on the web, using\nthe data from College. We might as\nwell use it to implement a system\nwhereby club officers can use it in a\nway that they want to. We may need\n25 different forms, but we don\u2019t need\n25 different bits of paper. Also, one of\nthe things that\u2019s really got my blood\nboiling is the fact that about \u00a337,000\ncurrently needs to be accounted for.\nThat\u2019s a lot of money.\nYour manifesto says \u201cmore\nmoney for clubs & societies\u201d.\nWhere will it come from?\nWe need to prioritise properly. It\u2019s\nnot that difficult. Money will still\ncome from the block grant from\nCollege, but also by looking at our\ncommercial outlets, things like\ncatering, bars, the shop and the\nnewsagent. If we give our members what they want, they can go in\nand buy it, and we can recycle that\nmoney back to them via their club\nor society.\nWhat\u2019s the one biggest\nchange you\u2019d make?\nThe bureaucracy. I cannot stand it;\nit\u2019s overbearing on our officers. I\u2019d\nchange it by simplifying it, moving\na lot of it online, making things so\nmuch easier and better for the ordinary students on the ground who\nget involved in clubs and societies.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nI\u2019ve been involved in this Union for\na fairly long time. I\u2019ve got one of the\nmost wide-ranging sets of experiences within the Union, not just one\nparticular pathway. I also have the\ntrack record of doing what needs to\nbe done. A lot of the positions I\u2019ve\ntaken, there\u2019s been no-one else to\ndo them, so I\u2019ve stepped into the\nbreach, I\u2019ve done the job and then\npassed on the mantle to another\nstudent officer who\u2019s taken up the\nreins. To be frank, I\u2019ve lost more\nelections than I\u2019ve won, but I\u2019m still\nhere, I\u2019m still fighting, and it doesn\u2019t\nfaze me any more.\nEDWARD PIGGOTT\nWhy are you standing?\nI feel that I\u2019d be good for the job\nbecause I have experience in running lower level clubs and societies\nin the treasury department and also\nthe chair department. I know how\nhard it can be for treasurers to do\ntheir job, and I feel I can do something to make their jobs easier. Also\nbecause I like this place, I think I\u2019d\nbe good for the job and good for the\npeople.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on\nmodernising Beit Quad?\nWe do need to review the amount\nof space that different clubs and\nsocieties get for storage purposes\nand just for general meetings pur-poses. Rooms like the Union Dining\nHall are nigh on impossible to book\nsometimes. We need more room for\nclubs and societies, because there\nare something like 250 of them\nhere. The ideas of having a dedicated Council chamber or a whole\nset of new offices are probably not\nnecessary.\nWhat about having a coffee\nbar instead of Da Vinci\u2019s?\nDa Vinci\u2019s, from what I know, doesn\u2019t\nhave a huge amount of trade and\nUnion ents aren\u2019t that well attended.\nThat\u2019s something that I\u2019d like to\nsort out to begin with. Some people\nmight think that having three bars\non the same floor is excessive, but\nthey all serve different purposes,\nand you can get a coffee just about\nanywhere around here.\nHow can the Union improve\nents to attract more\nstudents?\nAsk the students what they actually want, using an incentive-based\nsurvey. What I really liked about the\nlast series of elections was the ability to donate 25p to a club or society\nof the voter\u2019s choice, so if we could\ndo that with a survey, I\u2019d like to.\nDo you think the Union\nwastes money?\nAny institution wastes money, it\u2019s\njust a case of how much. Nothing\nis entirely efficient. I personally\nhaven\u2019t had chance to look into\nthe Union\u2019s finances in detail,\nbut I\u2019d like to review the funding and subsidies given to clubs\nand societies. Arts clubs are\nhorrifically underfunded. I feel\nthat at an institution where\nwe don\u2019t have any taught arts,\nit\u2019s very important to have some\narts through the Union, so we\ncan be recognised for having a fantastic Symphony Orchestra and a\ngood Big Band that enters competitions and wins things. The Big\nBand had to put in a contingency\nclaim for a competition last year,\nwhereas sports clubs get something\nlike \u00a31000 for that. I\u2019m not saying we\nshould cut funding for sports, but\nwe need more money for arts and\nentertainments to level the playing\nfield.\nYour manifesto promises\n\u201cmore support for clubs and\nsocieties\u201d. How will you\nprovide that?\nI plan to be available five or\nsix hours a day. I still have the\nidealistic view that I can spend\ntime in my office, so people can\ncome up and ask me questions and\nI can help them. I would plan to\nbe around almost all the time for\npeople.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nI feel I have the experience at the\ngrass roots level. It\u2019s people at that\nlevel who have a thankless task,\na huge workload put on them and\nvery little training. They need the\nhelp from someone who has done it\nand knows about it.\nROBIN AVERY\nWhy are you standing?\nBecause it\u2019s my final year and I\u2019ve\nbeen involved with the Union back\nand forth every year that I\u2019ve been\nhere. I\u2019ve had experience on both\nsides of finance and services, working in the bars, participating in\nclubs, and I\u2019ve been active amongst\nthe Union and on the committees\nas well.\nWhat qualities can you bring\nto the role?\nA lot of experience that comes with\nparticipating, being a member of\nstaff, having good working relation-ships, and generally having a good\nfeel for what people want in the\nUnion.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on\nmodernising Beit Quad?\nI think it\u2019s a good idea and it\u2019s probably something that\u2019s been overdue\nfor a while now. I think it needs a\nlittle more thought, it needs more\nconsultation of students as to what\nthey actually want, such as the coffee style venue and non-smoking\nareas.\nMore consultation than the\nstrategic review, which has\njust taken place?\nYes, I think we need more detailed\nreviews on specific aspects of it.\nDo you have any ideas of your\nown about modernising the\nUnion building?\nFrom what I know, I haven\u2019t heard of\nanybody trying to integrate together\nbars and catering into one unit. That\ncould bring a lot of savings in terms\nof staff time, and also efficiency and\nquality.\nYour manifesto says that\nWednesday and Friday nights\nat the Union have \u201cfallen\nbelow par\u201d. How would you\nimprove them?\nI think it\u2019s very important that we\ntry harder to tap student groups\nwho don\u2019t particularly have any\nreason to come into the Union\non Wednesday and Friday nights,\nsuch as most of the overseas\nstudents, the Europeans particular-ly. The Asians seldom come into the\nUnion unless it\u2019s one of their own\nevents. I don\u2019t have any clear cut\nidea on how to attract those groups\nen masse \u2013 I\u2019d have to consult with\nthe line managers and see what was\npossible.\nDo you think the Union\nwastes money?\nI don\u2019t think it wastes money per\nse, but I think in some parts it runs\nwith a certain degree of inefficiency.\nBy taking closer looks at parts of the\nUnion, parts of the process, you can\nfind a lot of inefficiencies and make\nthe place run smoother and at lower\ncost.\nShould clubs and societies be\ngiven more money?\nIn principle yes, because my origins come from clubs and societies.\nBut you have to look at the bigger\npicture and see where the money\u2019s\ngoing to come from. Obviously we\nhave the subvention from College\nwhich goes towards pretty much\neverything in the Union. In principle it is definitely a good idea, but\nyou have to look carefully at where\nthe losses are going to come from.\nIf there was no increase from the\nCollege or trust funds or anything,\nI\u2019d have to look towards outside\nsources of income, possibly blanket\nsponsorship, but that\u2019s a long way\ninto the future.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates?\nBecause, unlike both the other can-didates, I have constantly sought\nbigger challenges, and succeeded\nat what I\u2019ve tried to do. If you look\nat Robin, he\u2019s done one club, I\u2019ve\noverseen 45. I recently sat on the\nfinance review group of the Union,\nwhich looked at club and society\nbudgeting as a whole, and I\u2019m very\nkeen to continue that, something\nwhich neither Robin nor Edward\nhave done. I think my experience on\nboth sides of the bar brings me out\nas a stronger candidate on the services side than both of them.\nTIM APLIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (FINANCE & SERVICES)\n\u25cf The DP(F&S) is responsible for all the Union\u2019s finances and commercial services\n\u25cf There are 3 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)\n\n"

Everyone\nwanted to show up for some\npaddling on different dates,\nand drive to Yorkshire from\ndifferent Christmas holiday\nlocations. Chaos\nTo make matters worse,\nthose club members who normally take up the organisational challenge decided they\nwere fed up of it and went on\nstrike, leading to a bizarre\nsituation in which Harry was\nlabelled \u2018the most organised\u2019.\nHarry responded by throwing\ntechnology at the problem.\nLudicrously complex spreadsheets and wiki websites\nwere put in place, and eventually we all came together...\nTheo, Nick and Jeurgen\nwere the only ones driving up\nin the minibus from London.\nUnfortunately they never\nquite made it, after toppling\nover on the M1 in Derbyshire.\nLuckily the only injuries\nwhere to Nick, his laptop\nand a throwline. The police\nobligingly rescued the cans\nof beer, which had rolled out\nof the broken rear window all\nover the motorway. Tim\u2019s dad\ncame to the rescue, complete\nwith a trailer for the boats.\nThey all spent the night in\nDoncaster watching DVDs\nand reducing the volume of\nthe rescued beer bucket.\nAlice also never quite made\nit, electing to drive up with Jon\nthe next day instead. Claire\nand Robin were a little late,\nso the only one who actually\nmade it to the agreed meeting place on time was Harry\n\u2018the most organised\u2019, who\nwas delighted to be spending\ntime in a pub, so all was well.\nThe afternoon paddling plan\nwas abandoned due to lack of\nboats and paddlers, so Harry,\nClare and Robin checked into\nthe hut.\nOn Tuesday morning, everyone finally met at Kettlewell\nto paddle the Wharfe. Well,\nnot quite everyone. Alice and\nJon didn\u2019t believe that we\nwould put in at 10am, so they\nmissed the boat. The water\nwas cold as predicted, and\nAlexa kicked off the swim-ming, but a pleasant paddle\nwas had by all. Theo and\nTim ran Linton Falls at the\nTakeout with many specta-tors.\nAs we went to the car park\nto get changed, we were\ngreeted by Alexa\u2019s dad, Jim,\nwith a huge fully equipped\nmotor home, providing shelter from the rain and cups of\ntea.Whatluxury!Themonster\nvan was thereafter referred\nto as \u2018Mission Control\u2019. And it\nseemed we would be needing\n\u2018Mission Control\u2019 assistance\na little longer, because in the\nevening we discovered that\nthe RAC would not be providing a replacement van on the\nUnion breakdown insurance,\nbecause they\u2019d got us on a\ntechnicality. Thanks a bunch!\nThe next day, everyone met\nup at the Young Offenders\nInstitute in Barnard Castle at\n9am. We didn\u2019t see any young\noffenders, but Jim P showed\nup, released on parole from\nhis girlfriend. In the car park\nClaire had a quick driving\nlesson, then Theo, Jon, Jim,\nJuergen, Alice, Alexa, Claire,\nRobin, Tim and Harry ran\nthe Tees from Barnard Castle\nto Wiston Bridge. Alexa had\na swim and decided to get\nout at Whorlton, the halfway\npoint where \u2018Mission Control\u2019\nhandily intercepted her.\nAfterwards we drove back\nup and Theo, Tim, Jim and\nClaire ran the upper section from High Force to Low\nForce. This should have been\ncalled \u2018gale force\u2019, as we\nwere blown down the river.\nInteresting bits included the\n\u2018dog leg\u2019 grade four rapid\nand low-force itself (a 10ft\nwaterfall). Everyone ran the\ndrop, with Jim experiencing\ncomplete submergence and\nClaire playing with the stopper for extra excitement.\n\u2018Mission Control\u2019 ran out of\ndiesel, but thanks to some\nnavigational genius involving autoroute express, Nick\u2019s\nbattered laptop and a digital\ncamera, Jon was able to get\nto Darlington in the nick of\ntime to rent a new van.\nOn Thursday, we paddled\nthe Ribble, Helwith Bridge\n(where we were staying)\ndown to Settle. Robin, despite\nhaving very little paddling\nexperience, had managed\nthe previous day\u2019s paddling\nswim free. His luck ran out\nat the start of this river. The\nmore technical sections\nabove the \u2018two bridges\u2019 rapid\ncaused him three swims in\nshort succession, culminating in a nasty tooth chipping\ninjury. Stainforth force presented a rather forceful looking towback, and so only Tim\nattempted it.\nMuppetry meant we had\nonly one and a half throwbags\n(with the M1 having eaten\nat least a half), but luckily they weren\u2019t needed. As\nTheo didn\u2019t realise his digital\ncamera didn\u2019t compensate\nfor daylight saving hours, he\nsent Tim frantically paddling\nahead thinking he would miss\nthe last train from Settle to\nLeeds. Harry had forgotten\ndry clothes, and so we slung\nhim in the back of the van\nwith all the other wet gear.\nHe sat in pitch blackness,\nand only after the journey\nrealised that the van had an\ninside light.\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve we\nheaded over to the Duddon, in\nthe west Lake District. This\nwas worth the drive, as it\u2019s\none of the few English rivers\nwe have ever seen with crystal clear water and grassy\nbanks. Emily got down everything with good high braces\nand handrolls.\nAfter the river Rob unfortunately ran over Nick\u2019s foot.\nPerhaps he decided that it\nwould be compassionate to\nTheo to have a little accident\nof his own. Nick was left hob-bling, but nothing was broken\n(it turns out just torn) and it\ngave him a good excuse to\nstay off the dancefloor that\nnight.\nNew Year\u2019s Eve celebrations took place in the\n\u2018Helwith Bridge\u2019 pub, where\nthe local people made us feel\nmost welcome (a nice change\nfrom Wales). In fact, Theo had\nan interesting time with the\nbarmaid. The less said about\nthat the better. Suffice to say\nhe was glad Harry didn\u2019t have\nhis camera.\nThe next day, we did a lot of\nfaffing around before finally\nending up at the put-in for\nthe Lune, at Teebay. \u2018Mission\nControl\u2019 got a bit of scrape\non the way down the dangerously narrow lanes. Near the\nend of the river, we encountered carnage on the strid,\nwith Robin deciding that\nswimming the rapid would be\nfar more exciting than paddling it. But no one was paddling to full ability, due to the\nhangover. A very pretty river\nthough.\nOur final day\u2019s paddling\nwas the Kent, where we met\nTim, Amie and Tim\u2019s Dad,\nNic. The water was cold but\nthe levels were OK and everyone bimbled down most\nthings successfully. Theo\nwas comically backlooped in\nthe gorge section, but if he\ninsists on paddling a stupidly\nsmall boat, things like that\nare almost inevitable!\nRight at the end of the trip\nwe all did Force Falls blind\nfor comedy value. After the\nriver, some set off on the long\njourney home whilst Theo,\nTim and his Dad sneaked in\na quick descent of the nearby\nLeven. The highlight of this\nwas backbarrow falls \u2013 a big\ngrade four that drops away\nunder a low bridge. Theo\nmade up for earlier muppetry\nwith the best line of the day.\nThey did get stranded at the\ntakeout for a while as Jeurgen\n(driving the minibus) missed\nthe turning for the takeout\nand tried to do a scenic tour\nof the lakes.\nBig thanks to Alexa\u2019s dad\nand Tim\u2019s dad for lending\nsubstantial vehicular sup-port, without which we would\nsurely have made a disaster\nout of a crisis. As it was, we\nall enjoyed an excellent week\nof Yorkshire paddling!\nCANOE CLUB\nMessing about on the river\nClaire takes on a 10ft waterfall\nCanoeist Emily stays afloat whilst enjoying the picturesque Yorkshire surroundings\n\n"

So I feel it\u2019s something\nthat I\u2019d be very passionate about\nand spend a lot of time on, and I\u2019ve\ngot the experience to do it.\nWhat is Felix\u2019s role?\nConstitutionally, Felix is supposed to\nprovide students with College and\nUnion news and that kind of thing.\nBut I think Felix would be better\nserving the students if it not only\ngave them the facts, but also some\ndifferent opinions about the events,\nand why things going on at Council,\nfor example, are relevant to them.\nWhat writing and editing\nexperience do you have?\nThis year I\u2019m pleased to say that I\u2019ve\ntaken the books section from nonexistence to a regular feature. I\u2019ve\nalso edited Broadsheet, the Faculty\nof Physical Sciences newspaper.\nHow would you attract more\ncontributors to Felix?\nThe thing to do is start off well. You\nneed to have a good base of writers at the beginning of the term,\nto fire people up and kick-start the\nopinion column process and the\ncomment section. I can use the network of writers I\u2019ve built up through\nBroadsheet, Felix books and other\nareas. There\u2019s nothing quite like\nbeing invited to write something.\nWhich is more important:\ngiving students something\nto read or something to\ncontribute to?\nI think it\u2019s more important that Felix\nis there for people to express their\nviews and develop some writing\nskills. You can contribute in a lot\nof different ways, whether it\u2019s car-toons, photography, reviews...\nWould you go back to the A4\nmagazine style?\nI\u2019d certainly be tempted, because\nit had some advantages, but I\u2019d be\nmore than willing to subject it to a\nsurvey over the summer and see\nwhat people think.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates or RON?\nWell, RON certainly doesn\u2019t have any\nexperience in Felix, and I\u2019m not sure\nthat Rupert does either. The other\ntwo candidates have Felix experi-ence, but perhaps they don\u2019t have\nwider editorial or financial experi-ence. I\u2019m the only candidate who can\nprovide Felix experience and wider\nexperience, through Broadsheet.\nI\u2019ve got the clearest policies and the\nmost attainable vision, and I\u2019ll make\nFelix into a newspaper that people\nwant to read and want to write for.\nMARTIN SMITH\nWhy are you standing?\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed writing for Felix,\nediting and just being involved in\nthe thing. I\u2019ve realised that there\u2019s\nscope for improvement. As you can\nsee in my manifesto, I think I can\ncontinue to push things forward in\nFelix.\nWhat is Felix\u2019s role?\nFirstly it\u2019s there to inform and entertain the student body. It\u2019s also there\nas a medium for freedom of speech,\nso people can express themselves\nthrough Felix. It also has a central role in communicating what the\nUnion is doing for the students, and\nespecially in communicating what\nclubs and societies are doing.\nWhat relevant experience do\nyou have?\nIn terms of Felix, this year I\u2019ve been\nmanaging and editing the science\nsection, last year as well, and previously the film section. Also I\u2019ve\nbeen involved recently in managing\ngroups of writers for a new spinoff\nfrom Felix in the future.\nHow would you attract more\ncontributors to Felix?\nWith the science section we\u2019ve had\na very wide range of contributors.\nI\u2019ve organised that through weekly meetings, encouraging people\nto express their views in an open\nforum. As Editor I would generally try to engage the student body\n\u2013 if students find something in Felix\nthey\u2019re really interested in, they will\nrespond. It\u2019s about being in touch\nwith the student Zeitgeist and the\nissues of the day.\nWould you go back to the A4\nmagazine style?\nI think the decision was originally\nmade not just on the format but on\nfinancial considerations as well. If\nI was to make that decision in the\nsummer, I\u2019d look at the finances and\nthen decide. I think the newspaper\nformat has gone down surprisingly\nwell.\nWhich is more important:\ngiving students something\nto read or something to\ncontribute to?\nI don\u2019t think you can really compare\nthe two.\nWhat\u2019s the single biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to Felix?\nThe single biggest change is that I\nwould encourage a broader group of\nwriters to write more humorously. I\nthink a phrase I\u2019ve used was to be\nmore relevant in content and more\nirreverent in humour.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates or RON?\nFirst of all I\u2019m the most experienced\nsection editor on Felix, so I\u2019ve got\nmore experience than the other can-didates. I think my aims are more\nrealistic, and I\u2019ve got a proven track\nrecord of delivering both humour\nand serious content.\nDARIUS NIKBIN\nWhy are you standing?\nMainly because I want to give something back to the students, and also\nbecause I think Felix needs improving \u2013 more fun, more comedy, more\nserious news and more opinions to\nrepresent what the students are\nthinking. Also because I want to be\na journalist and this would be great\nwork experience.\nWhat is Felix\u2019s role?\nTo inform the students about stuff\nthat\u2019s going on in College and also\nstuff that\u2019s going on in the world\nthat\u2019s relevant to students, and to\nexpress students\u2019 views.\nWhat relevant experience do\nyou have?\nI\u2019ve written one front page story for\nFelix, and I\u2019ve also been published\nin local newspapers and had work\nexperience at The Guardian. I\u2019m a\nreally sociable person, unlike some\nat Imperial, so I think I\u2019d be good at\nmanaging people.\nYou\u2019ve had three years at\nImperial... what\u2019s your opinion of Felix during that time?\nI really liked last year\u2019s Felix. It was\na bit more light-hearted, and I really\nliked the \u2018Ash\u2019s Voice of Reason\u2019 column and the page 3.\nWhy have you never been involved with Felix regularly?\nI was so busy with other uni\nstuff, and I didn\u2019t realise that it\u2019d\nbe something I\u2019d like to do until\nmore recently. I haven\u2019t contributed\nrecently because I\u2019ve been ill a lot so\nI haven\u2019t been in College.\nWould you go back to the A4\nmagazine style?\nI personally don\u2019t really have a preference \u2013 I think it would be up to the\nstudents to decide, using a poll at\nthe end of this year.\nHow would you attract more\ncontributors to Felix?\nI think if we had a special \u2018come\nand write for Felix\u2019 day, people\ncould pop in throughout the day,\nsee what goes on, do whatever they\nlike, and if you get people interested\nearly enough, quite a lot of them\nwould carry on.\nWhich is more important:\ngiving students something\nto read or something to\ncontribute to?\nI think it\u2019s much more important\nto give people something to read,\nbecause there are more people in\nthat category.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates or RON?\nI think people should vote for Darius\nif they like the science section and\nwant more science. If people are\nscouts or they like origami then perhaps they\u2019ve got other people to vote\nfor. I seem to be the only one who\u2019s\nhad actual newspaper experience.\nRUPERT NEATE\nWhy are you standing?\nI think there\u2019s a lot that I could bring\nto the position. I\u2019ve been involved\nwith Felix for a while, and I\u2019ve\nalways enjoyed working on it. Felix\nis good at the moment, but there\u2019s a\nlot of potential for expanding it and\ncovering a lot more things that matter to the students.\nWhat is Felix\u2019s role?\nTo inform and entertain the stu-dents, and allow them to tell one\nanother about what they\u2019re doing\nand what\u2019s going on within their\nUnion. Also to give people something to get involved in, because the\ncontributors can get a lot out of it\nas well.\nWhat writing and editing\nexperience do you have?\nI\u2019ve been writing for Felix since I got\nhere. I\u2019ve been editing the nightlife\nsection this year, which has involved\nediting, layout and getting people to\nwrite for me, trying to get as many\npeople involved as possible. I also\nproduced a Scouts newspaper last\nsummer.\nYou\u2019ve had three years at\nImperial... what\u2019s your opinion of Felix during that time?\nIt\u2019s developed from being an entertaining magazine into a full-blown\nnewspaper, and I\u2019d aim to carry that\non and make it even better.\nWhat\u2019s the single biggest\nchange you\u2019d make to Felix?\nI\u2019d like to see articles by or about as\nmany different people from around\nthe College as possible. There\u2019s\nhuge diversity here, and at the\nmoment Felix doesn\u2019t really cover it\nall, for whatever reason.\nWould you go back to the A4\nmagazine style?\nI\u2019d like to re-run the survey from\nlast year. Subject to that, my personal preference would be for keeping it as a newspaper. I know there\u2019s\na Union rule about having news on\nthe front page, and I don\u2019t think that\nwould look particularly good as a\nmagazine.\nWhich is more important:\ngiving students something\nto read or something to\ncontribute to?\nGiven that there are a lot more\nreaders than contributors, I\u2019d\nprobably say something to read,\nbut they are both very important\nthings.\nWhy should people vote for\nyou ahead of the other\ncandidates or RON?\nI\u2019m in touch with the students, probably more than the other candidates,\nand as such in a better position to\nget more people involved, get more\ncontributions, and cover more of the\nCollege community.\nSIMON CLARK\n\n"

Ever had trouble\nwith a product that has caused damage to your house? Ever bought\nsomething that has turned out to be\nunsafe?\nI am sure that some of these statements will ring a bell with some of\nyou out there. Buying goods of any\nkind is often enjoyable, but there\nare times when you buy something\nand it goes wrong. In this situation,\nit always good to know what your\nrights are and what action you can\ntake to get your money back.\nThe Information and Advice\nCentre can help in this situation,\nby making you aware of what you\ncan do. We can also act on your\nbehalf if the people you bought the\nfaulty product from are treating you\nunfairly.\nIf you buy anything from a shop,\ncatalogue or even the internet and\nthere\u2019s something wrong with it,\nyou\u2019ve got a right to do something\nabout it. But this doesn\u2019t apply to\nchanging your mind when you\u2019ve\ndecided you really shouldn\u2019t have\nbought a minidisc player when your\nrent is due any day now.\nWhat does the law say?\nOne of the most important laws governing your rights as a consumer\nis the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Like\nmany laws, it has evolved to keep\nup with changes in society so the\nAct now includes \u2018amendments\u2019\ncalled the Sale and Supply of Goods\nAct 1994 and the Sale of Goods\n(Amendment) Act 1995.\nThis is a wide-ranging piece of\nlegislation that applies to both new\nand second-hand goods.\nIt protects consumers by ensuring\nthat goods are:\n\u25cf of \u2018satisfactory quality\u2019 \u2013 products\nmust last a reasonable time and be\nfree of defects\n\u25cf \u2018as described\u2019 \u2013 a trader or advertisement must honestly describe the\nproduct. If, for example, you buy a\nCD that turns out to be counterfeit\nthen you have a case against the\ntrader that sold it.\n\u25cf fit for purpose \u2013 products must do\nwhat the supplier says they do.\nIf you buy something that doesn\u2019t\nmeet any of the conditions stated\nabove, it\u2019s your right to demand your\nmoney back from the trader (the\nperson/shop who bought it from),\nnot the manufacturer, wholesaler or\nimporter.\nTraders also have a duty to\nsupply products that are safe. If\nthey knowingly supply unsafe\ngoods, they are committing an\noffence. If you buy an unsafe prod-uct, contact your local Trading\nStandards Office, who will investigate the matter and prosecute the\ntrader if necessary.\nIf the faulty goods cause injury to\nyourself or damage to your property\nof more than \u00a3275, you may be able\nto claim against the manufacturer\nor importer under \u2018product liability\u2019 rules set out in the Consumer\nProtection Act 1987.\nJust as importantly, you have no\ngrounds for complaint under these\nterms if you:\n\u25cf were told about the fault when\nbuying the product\n\u25cf inspected the product and should\nhave noticed the fault\n\u25cf damaged the product yourself\n\u25cf bought the product by mistake\n\u25cf have changed your mind.\nServices, such as those provided\nby tradesmen and professionals, are\ncovered by the Supply of Goods and\nServices Act 1982. Service providers\nhave a \u2018duty of care\u2019 to those they\nwork for and work carried out must\nbe \u2018to a reasonable standard at a\nreasonable cost.\u2019\nIf you feel you\u2019ve been over-charged, you have a right to pay\nwhat you think is a \u2018reasonable\nprice\u2019 (what you would expect anybody else to do the job for), although\nyou may be sued for the full cost by\nthe provider.\nBuying goods from home\nYou\u2019re protected under consumer\nlegislation wherever you choose to\nshop, but there are specific rules\nthat affect products you buy from\nyour home.\nIt\u2019s much easier now to buy things\nfrom home, compared to the past.\nBesides catalogues, mail order firms\nand buying online, you can be visited\nby salesmen selling everything from\nvacuum cleaners to double glazing.\nYou can\u2019t always see what you\u2019re\nbuying, so the need for an effective\nway to sort out problems is probably\nmuch greater than when you shop\non your local high street.\nYou have special rights as a home\nconsumer under the Consumer\nProtection (Distance Selling)\nRegulations 2000.\nYou are entitled to:\n\u25cf Clear written information on products before placing an order\n\u25cf A \u2018cooling off period,\u2019 usually\nfive days, when you can cancel any\norder\n\u25cf A full refund if goods or services\naren\u2019t provided by an agreed date or\nwithin 30 days\n\u25cf Protection against credit card\nfraud\nIf you\u2019ve got a problem with something you\u2019ve bought, then:\n\u25cf Inform the supplier quickly and\nlet them know why you\u2019re complaining\n\u25cf Keep a written note of any phone\ncalls or emails.\nIf you feel that you\u2019ve entered into\na contract that, on reflection, seems\nto be unfair, you have protection\nunder the Unfair Contract Terms\nAct 1977 and the Unfair Terms in\nConsumer contract Regulations\n1994, even if the \u2018cooling off period\u2019\nhas expired.\nIf you receive unsolicited goods\n\u2013 items that you haven\u2019t ordered\n\u2013 you don\u2019t have to return or even\npay for them under the Unsolicited\nGoods and Services Act 1971.\nIf a trader demands payment for\nsuch goods, they\u2019re committing a\ncriminal offence under this law.\nThe goods in question become your\nproperty if you keep them for six\nmonths, or one month if you have\ncontacted the supplier. At this point,\nyou\u2019re probably hoping that someone sends you an unsolicited laptop\ncomputer!\nBuying online\nWhen buying online, you\u2019re entitled\nto the same rights covering any\nother home purchase.\nA website must display:\n\u25cf Clear information about goods or\nservices before you buy\n\u25cf Written confirmation of any order\n\u25cf A \u2018cooling off period\u2019 allowing the\nbuyer to cancel the order for any\nreason.\nOne exception to these rules are\nproducts purchased through an\nonline auction. Auctioneers aren\u2019t\nrequired to accept responsibility for\nthe quality of goods on sale, so extra\ncare should be taken when buying\nfrom them.\nIf you would like further information on this article or would like to\nmake an appointment, please don\u2019t\nhesitate to contact the Information\nand Advice Centre on 020 7594 8067\nor advice@ic.ac.uk.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into\ncrisis. Make the IAC your one stop\nshop for all your welfare issues.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nSorry for the somewhat random\ntopic this week but I\u2019ve been a little busy with the \u2018e\u2019 word that some\npeople are currently getting excited\nabout.\nI spent last night at the Silwood\nPark campus, where they were\nhaving a General Committee meet-ing. The meeting itself was quite\nvaluable for me, though attendance was somewhat thwarted by\nChinese New Year. It was also supposed to be an informal opportunity\nfor Silwoodians to meet sabbatical\nelection candidates. Unfortunately,\ninterest was quite low until later\non, by which time only a minority of candidates together with Sam\nRorke and myself had survived. And\nthat\u2019s when the fun started.\nWe joined some of the Silwood students in one of the (nicer) kitchens\nin the on-site accommodation. The\nvery nice Silwoodians offered us\nsome lovely pancakes, and Sam and\nsome of the Felix Editor candidates\nseemed to be thoroughly enjoying\nthemselves. I was floating between\nvarious students (both Silwood and\nSouth Kensington) answering questions on student finance, the Union,\nthe College, my pilot\u2019s licence\u2026\nPerhaps somewhat inevitably, the\nmost memorable part of the evening\nwas in the bar, for all the wrong\nreasons. No, there wasn\u2019t a strong\nrugby crowd getting undressed.\nThere was, however, a chap called\nGideon. I didn\u2019t catch his surname,\nbut he seemed to be a fan of mine.\nBeing President, you do get used\nto surreal experiences as a result\nof your minor \u2018celebrity\u2019 status.\nEspecially after 18 months. But\nsomehow I still found Gideon a little overwhelming. He kept telling\nme how great he thought I was\n(which is a nice sentiment but can\nbe overbearing) and wanting to\nknow who I thought he should vote\nfor. He also explained that he was\nthe oldest PhD student at Silwood\nand that he would be going back\nto Tanzania soon, where he was\nexpecting to be appointed Foreign\nMinister after next year\u2019s elections.\nApparently he isn\u2019t sure who the\n(Tanzanian) President will be, but\nhe\u2019s sure he\u2019ll be the next Foreign\nMinister. He said he would then\ndrive the Tanzanian President to\nSilwood to show him where he used\nto study.\nI remember all this rather vividly\nbecause I ended up with Gideon\u2019s\narm around me at three separate\ntimes during the evening as we\nrepeated the same conversation.\nHe also kept pointing me out to\nother people and hailing me as a\n\u201cgreat man\u201d. He explained that he\nhad been worried he\u2019d never meet\nme. It seems that what he most\nliked about me was my Felix column\nwhich he would read, without fail,\nevery week.\nJust in case anyone is under any\nmisapprehensions, I did take a liking to Gideon; I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a very\nnice chap and he probably does\nhave a strong political pedigree\nback home. I think he\u2019d just had\na little bit too much to drink. (The\nvery nice barman explained that he\nis not unknown on the \u2018scene\u2019.)\nAnyway, I\u2019m supposed to be\nreminding you about elections. Vote.\nGo to www.union.ic.ac.uk/vote, from\nmidnight tonight until Tuesday 15\nFebruary. Vote. Or else I\u2019ll start talking about doughnuts again\u2026\nUnion Council update:\nStrategic Review\nAfter several months of hard work,\nthe Union Executive has now\nreached a unanimous agreement\non a draft Union Strategy to recommend to Union Council at its next\nmeeting on 17 February. I look forward to the debate, and its adoption\nas policy. It is vitally important that\nwe establish a consensus as to what\nthe Union\u2019s role and priorities should\nbe, so that student officers can focus\non getting work done rather than\nconstantly arguing about what they\nshould be doing. The papers for the\nmeeting will be at www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/meetings.\nThe next Council meeting will\nalso see by-elections for a vacancy\non the Council and for the post\nof Equal Opportunities Officer.\nAll registered Imperial College\nstudents may stand for election\nand vote.

However,\nthere\u2019s safety in numbers, and the\nblack-clad hordes descending on the\nAcademy up to three hours before\ndoors remained more or less unmo-lested. Some had come from as far\naway as Norway, so they had a right\nto expect a damn good time. They\nwere not disappointed.\nOpeners Apocalyptica were a rev-elation. Seated on angular metal\nthrones against a stark background,\nthey played the heaviest of heavy\nmetal on cellos from hell. Yes, that\u2019s\nright \u2013 cellos. Classically trained\nto a man, these Finnish maniacs\noffer a novel take on the archetypal hard-rocking metal usually\npurveyed by the likes of Pantera\nand Slayer, and it works surprisingly\nwell. Live, their purely instrumental\nrenditions of everything from the\nMetallica covers of their early days\nto self-penned anthems from their\nnewly released album, the self-titled\nApocalyptica, are like a window into\nanother world.\nThe rich, soulful tones of the cellos cut smoothly through your brain\nto clutch at your heart, contrasting beautifully and magnificently\nwith the jagged melodies coaxed\nfrom them. Combined with manic\nhead-banging that shouldn\u2019t be possible while sitting down and the kind\nof playing-from-all-angles antics\nthat wouldn\u2019t have disgraced Jimi\nHendrix, theirs was a set to remember and cherish. The audience\nlapped it up, going from what-the-hell-is-this bewilderment to jump-ing-up-and-down enthusiasm in\nseconds. They sang along to Enter\nSandman and roared their appreciation at every pause: a stunning\nresponse to a band that have nothing like the recognition they deserve\nin this country. The crowd even\ncheered and threw the horns for the\ntriumphant closer, Edvard Grieg\u2019s\nclassical masterpiece In The Hall\nOf The Mountain King; now that\u2019s\nwhat I call a crossover success.\nNo one knows how to put on a\nshow like Rammstein. Opener Reise\nReise began with clearing smoke\nrevealing the band posed on a giant\ntwo-tier stage of industrial-looking\nplatforms. The first deep, guttural notes of overpowering German\nvocals set the tone for what was to\ncome: an hour and fifty minutes of\ncomplete mayhem. The show really\nkicked off with third song Feuer\nFrei, when singer Till and guitarists\nRichard and Paul donned masks to\nbreath twelve-foot flames over the\naudience; the heat could be felt at\nthe very back of the venue. After this,\nnothing could be the same. Whether\nit be covering the crowd in red,\nwhite and blue confetti in Amerika,\nTill boiling keyboardist Flake in a\ngiant pot (heated, naturally, with a\nflamethrower) during recent single\nMein Teil, or Paul crowd-surfing\naround the auditorium in a dinghy\nfor final song Stripped, the Teutonic\nnutcases just kept on upping the\nante.\nThe crowd went wild when Till\nshot fireworks at them from a giant\ncrossbow and immense gouts of\nflame lit up the stage during Du\nHast; they laughed like maniacs when Flake rode around the\nstage on a Segway whilst playing\nAmerika; they whooped when various members ran around in suits\ncovered in fireworks. Let\u2019s face it,\nwho wouldn\u2019t?\nThe driving percussion, throbbing guitars and visceral vocals that\nhave hypnotised many a metal-club\ndance floor were all present in a\nset that covered most of the new\nalbum and all the old classics, from\nRammstein to Sonne and much in\nbetween, meaning that no one could\nleave dissatisfied. Their industrial-metal stylings have entranced millions across the world for years on\nrecord, but truly nothing can compare with them live. When your lead\nsinger had to become a qualified\npyrotechnician so that you could\nperform, that pretty much goes\nwithout saying.\nRammstein: if anyone knows a\nbetter way to have fun with six oiled\nGermans in leather lederhosen, I\u2019d\nlike to know about it.\nAnna Novitzky\n\u201cI collect badgers!\u201d beams frontman Dave Allen in the band\u2019s hotel\nbar \u2013 only he\u2019s pointing at circular logo-bearing pins on his bag so\nwe figure he\u2019s said \u2018badges\u2019 and\nquickly replace bewildered expressions with ones of glee and mutual\nbadge-appreciation. Amidst the confusion that follows, we accidentally\nconvince Dave that his band has\nbeen likened to Elton John in the\nmusic press, subsequently throwing\nin a \u2018gayness test\u2019, then suggesting\nthat he\u2019d like to interact with his\nown mother. All in all, a sober outing\nfor Felix.\nWe\u2019re back in Hal\u2019s hotel awaiting\nthe young Irish four-piece\u2019s arrival.\nDave\u2019s the first to stroll into the bar\nfresh from their soundcheck at the\nCamden Barfly. He\u2019s alone, expressionless and heading straight for\nthe gents. A minute later his three\nbandmates emerge, relaxed and\ncheerful. Dave\u2019s younger brother\nPaul, also the band\u2019s bass player,\nseems pleased to have spotted us.\nHe\u2019s gripping the note we left them\nat reception and tells us that the\nsoundcheck went well. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou interview him in the toilets?!\u201d\nsuggests a short-haired guy in thick-framed spectacles. It turns out this\ncharacter is Steve Hogan, Hal\u2019s\nfunny-man drummer, all but invisible in band photographs. When it\ncomes down to it, they all seem\nmore than happy to let Dave speak\nfor the band.\nWith Hal\u2019s virtual plot of cyber-space, Halmusic.com, promising a\nwealth of intriguing band news and\nlinks, only to deliver more \u2018coming soon\u2019 messages than a Friday\nnight visit to your local Odeon, we\ndecided to play an interactive game\nof \u2018human website\u2019 with Dave to\nfill in the gaps and find out exactly\nwhat\u2019s going on in the Hal camp.\nFirst up, we clicked on NEWS. Dave\nhappily obliges by informing us that\nhis day has been mostly comprised\nof badge-shopping in Camden. In\nthe joy that ensues, the one of us\ndressed in lady\u2019s clothing subjects\nDave to an in-depth showcase of the\ntwenty badges on her skirt. Dave\ntakes to the game of \u2018pick your\nfavourite badge\u2019 without even being\nasked. He likes the spotty one with\na dog on it, and then returns the\nfavour with a guided tour of his very\nown badge collection. Highlights\ninclude his \u2018Art Brut\u2019 badge, one of\na dog in American Indian headgear,\nand a lonesome \u2018Bloc\u2019 badge longing\nfor a \u2018Party\u2019 counterpart. Having\npurchased the badge at a Bloc Party\ngig in Sweden, he\u2019s eagerly awaiting\nreceipt of the \u2018Party\u2019 pin bought by\na friend at a Dublin Bloc Party gig.\nDave\u2019s a big Bloc Party fan. Now\nthat\u2019s news to us.\nNext up, SIGHT & SOUND. With\nHal\u2019s debut single entitled Worry\nAbout The Wind, we hilariously find\nout that Dave did in fact worry about\nthe wind once upon a time, and\nthat his favourite hurricane (but\nnot the band\u2019s namesake) would\nbe Hurricane Hal. The band are,\nin reality, named after Hal Blaine,\nDave\u2019s favourite drummer of all\ntime who played in every band in\nthe early 60s as far as we could\ntell, including the Ronnettes as well\nas on the Beach Boys\u2019 Petsounds,\nHal\u2019s mutual favourite record and\nundoubtedly their biggest influ-ence.\nThen t\u2019was time to navigate\nour virtual cursor to the \u2018HAL\n\u2019S\nFAVOURITE THINGS\u2019 link. Already\nfully aware of the badge obsession,\nwe were keen to find out what other\nunspeakable things Dave was into. \u201cI\nlike little funny things\u201d we\u2019re told. \u201cI\nchange my answer message on my\nphone once a month. I put myself in\na different imaginary scenario each\nmonth and that\u2019s the reason I can\u2019t\nget to the phone\u201d. Intrigued, we ask\nwhat surreal experience we\u2019d be\nexposed to if we rang him right this\nminute. \u201cI hate those McCafes, so\nI speeded up my voice on a dicta-phone so I sound like a chipmunk on\ndrugs, and I am apparently sitting\nshooting the breeze in a McCafe\nsomewhere in Dublin, thinking\nabout life, and someone rang me\nup two weeks ago and said change\nyour answer message, it\u2019s gay!\u201d At\nthis point we clumsily throw in a\n\u2018sexuality test\u2019 based on the length\nof Dave\u2019s index finger versus that\nof his ring finger, only to find that\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m definitely not that way\norientated at all... so I\u2019m going to\nchange my message on the first of\nthe month to something less gay,\nmaybe slow it down to sound like\nJohnny Cash!\u201d We feel enlightened\nand privileged but he still doesn\u2019t\ngive us his number.\nWhen we try to inform Dave that\nit\u2019s been suggested elsewhere in the\nmusic press that Elton John would\nprobably love Hal, he misconstrues\nwhat we\u2019re saying as, \u201cyou guys\nsound like Elton John!\u201d. We haven\u2019t\nthe heart to correct him and instead\nlisten to Dave sigh in shock and\nneedlessly defend his band\u2019s integrity by listing such great influences\nas Neil Young, his favourite track\nbeing Don\u2019t Let It Bring You Down.\nEventually, both Felix and Dave\nfeel so at ease with one another that\nwe ditch the \u2018clicking on links\u2019 metaphor and ask him what it was like\ntouring with label-mates Delays.\nWe discover that Delays\u2019 Gilbert\nbrothers were just like nurturing\nbig brothers to Hal\u2019s Allen brothers.\nSweet.\nOnstage it\u2019s a ten-track set, effectively a taster of Hal\u2019s forthcoming\nself-titled album, though current\nsingle and album-opener What A\nLovely Dance, described by Dave\nas \u201ca magical experience of falling in love\u2026 and then out of love\u201d,\nis saved for the all-important third\nsong slot. Mid-set we\u2019re presented\nwith a beautiful number, Keep Love\nAs Your Golden Rule, a song sounding not too dissimilar to the Beach\nBoys\u2019 God Only Knows. Debut sin-gle, Worry About The Wind is saved\nfor the end of the set and with it\u2019s\ngorgeous harmonica-laden endtro,\nis well worth the wait. Falsetto-delivered soaring melodies have been\ndone before \u2013 Geneva failed due to\nlead singer Andrew Montgomery\u2019s\nhideously grimacing face in per-formance. Dave Allen, on the other\nhand, appears onstage dressed all\nin white with the breathtaking voice\nof an angel, ensuring that Hal\u2019s sun-kissed Beach Boys-esque tunes will\nbe favourably received.\nCatch them on their \u2018back by popular demand\u2019 extra date at Rendition\nin London.

Moronic acid to\nbe precise. Apparently this is a triterpenoid organic acid that is found in Pistacia resin. No-one\nknow why it is called Moronic acid \u2013 its chemical properties share little in common with other\nmorons such as Pop Idol\u2019s Simon Cowell and crap Superman impersonator Alvin Joel.\nMoronic acid\nCowell: moron Joel: moron\nThere has been a lot of debate\nin science as to whether\nhuman anatomical features\nsuch as tonsils and appendices are indeed superfluous and simply not required\nfor survival. Wisdom teeth\nand the male foreskin are\nalso, arguably, unnecessary,\nredundant, and for many just\na cumbersome bother that\nhas to be removed.\nWhat about nipples? Both\nmen and women share these\ncomic looking appendages,\nyet what functions do they\nactually carry out in the male\nof the species?\nUnlike appendices, tonsils,\nand so on, nipples seem to be\nredundant only in males and\nare truly required, in terms of\nreproductive success, only in\nfemales. Yet all men proudly\nand pointlessly own a pair.\nMale nipples are far smaller than their female counterparts and are obviously not\nused for lactation (nor is there\nany evidence to suggest they\nhave been used for lactation\nin the prehistoric male). Yet\nthe temptation of classifying\nthem as simple protrusions\nwould not do them justice.\nThe male nipple is in fact\na fully equipped organ possessing all the usual apparatus of blood vessel, muscles,\nnerves and even oil glands.\nA thin muscle present under\nthe female nipple which upon\nstimulation projects the nipple for the baby results, in\nmales, in the flattening of\nthe puffed male nipple areola\n(the coloured ring around the\nhuman nipple). Furthermore,\nboth men and women can\nexperience pleasure thanks\nto the nerves that innervate\nthe areola.\nThe male nipple is not\ntherefore totally useless, yet\nmoderate tactile pleasure\nhardly justifies its presence.\nHumans are mammals\n(from the Latin mamma that\nmeans breast), hence, by defi-nition, we suckle our young.\nBut men do not suckle.\nHuman nipples appear in\nthe third or fourth week of\nembryionic development and\nboth female and male babies\nare born with nipples and\ntheir ducts intact. This is\nmade clear as during embryonic development differentiation towards a foetus which\nwill give rise to a girl or a\nboy takes place at around six\nto eight weeks after fertilisation (well after the appearance of nipples), when the\nmale and female hormones\nare activated. Dr Sherfey\nwrites in a paper published in\nthe Journal of Sexual Marital\nTheory that at this stage,\nin foetuses which will give\nrise to a boy, enough male\nandrogens (the male sex hor-mones) are produced to offset\nthe maternal estrogens (the\nfemale sex hormones) and\nmaleness develops.\nIn other words the hormone\ntestosterone is activated on\nthe Y chromosome that mas-culinises the embryo. This\nalters its physical development towards generating\nmale features and leading\nto the development of male\ngenitalia; it is however unable\nto reverse the nipple formation process that has already\ntaken place.\nThe human embryonic\npathway thus involves the\nearly presence of \u2018precursor\nnipples\u2019 (which appear before\nthe start of sexual differen-tiation) which may or may\nnot develop into future functional breasts; in essence,\nmales have rudimentary nipples because both sexes are\nvariations of a basic \u2018nippleequipped\u2019 design.\nMany take this as evidence\nof the fact that the natural\nform of all species is, physiologically speaking, female\nand those keen on dramatizing add (to the displeasure of all male chauvinists)\nthat males are thus merely\n\u2018mutant\u2019 females.\nSteven Jay Gould, in his\nbook Bully For Brontosaurus\n\u2013 Reflections In Natural\nHistory, explains why evolution has not changed this\nspecific male anatomical nipple feature. Gould argues that\nnature takes the path of least\nresistance so that anatomical\nfeatures are selected against\nonly if they are sufficiently\ndisadvantageous.\nAs Andrew Simons, journalist for the Scientific\nAmerican, aptly makes clear\nin his article on Why Men\nhave Nipples? the genetic \u2018default\u2019 is for men and\nwomen to share characters.\nNipples are consequently just\naccidental leftovers of our\nevolutionary past that persist\nsimply because of a lack of\nselection against them rather\nthan selection for them.\nBesides, men would look\nodd without them.\nJanet Jackson\u2019s famous nipple exhibition of 2004 will be on\nview at the Science Museum from June\nIt is obvious why women have them, but why do men have nipples?
