    "content": "Feature\nLloyd's List: the new and the old\nthe central floor are the three\nsymbols of Lloyd's that have been\nmoved from the Royal Exchange via\nLime Street to the present site: the\nLutine Bell, the Casualty Book and\nthe Casualty Board.\nThe Lutine Bell hangs in the\nUnderwriting Room and is used\nwhen important announcements are\nto be made: one stroke for bad news\nand two strokes for good news. The\nbell is not rung for every loss at sea:\nit was formerly sounded when an\nannouncement of an overdue vessel\nwas to be made, but is now sounded\nmost frequently on ceremonial\noccasions. The bell originally\nbelonged to a French frigate, the\nLutine, which was captured by the\nBritish in 1793 and used to carry\ngold and silver to Hamburg in 1799.\nIt was wrecked off the Dutch coast\nin a violent storm and the claim was\npaid in full by the Lloyd's underwriters who had insured it.\nThe bell was raised in 1859 and has\nhung in the Room for ninety years.*\nThe Casualty Book or Loss Book\ncontains details of all vessels,\nwhether insured at Lloyd's or not,\nwhich have become or are likely to\nbecome total losses. The entries are\nstill made by quill pen and represent\na unique history of nearly three\nhundred years of shipping. The\nsinking of the Titanic is recorded\nwith the words:\nTuesday 16th April:\nTitanic:\nisi British mail Southampton for New\nYork foundered April 15 about 2.20am in lat. 41.16 North long. 50.14 West\nafter collision with ice. Reported by\nwireless from Olympic si to the Cape\nRace wireless station. Further reports\nstate that the ios s of life is very great.\nThe Casualty Board contains the\nlatest casualty reports in all areas\nrelating to Lloyd's business. Marine\ncasualties are printed on yellow\nsheets, non-marine on pink and\naviation on blue. News of important\nworld events is also posted on the\ncasualty board.\nAnother source of information is\nLloyd's List. This is a daily paper,\none of the oldest still surviving in\nLondon, which is published by\nLloyd's of London Press. It contains\nshipping movements, marine and\naviation casualty reports and details\nof fires, strikes and riots. Regular\nreports also appear on ship sales,\nlaunching s and chartering s. There\nare several other publications which\ndeal in more specialist areas.\nLloyd's Register of Shipping is\nnot actually produced by Lloyd's, although its origins go back to\nLloyd's Coffee House and there are\nclose links between Lloyd's Register\nand Lloyd's of London Press. The\nRegister catalogues characteristics\nand construction details of\nindividual ships to help them in\ntheir insurance activities.\nWhat does Lloyd's insure?\nThere are four main areas, or\nmarkets, in which Lloyd's insures:\nmarine, non-marine, aviation and\nmotor. The marine market covers\neverything from oil production\nplatforms (such as Piper Alpha, see\nbox) to yachts. The non-marine\nmarket insures against such things\nas burglary, earthquake and loss of\nprofits due to fire. The aviation and\nmotor markets are offshoots of the\nmarine market. The aviation market\nwill cover Concordes to helicopters\nand passenger liabilities to communications satellites, while the\nmotor market covers every aspect of\nUK and Commonwealth road\ntransport.\nLloyd's has never been involved\nin life assurance; the nature of its\noperation makes it unsuitable for\nsuch long term risks and all life\ninsurance is carried out by private\ncompanies.\nLloyd's is also famous for its\nwillingness to insure almost\nanything. Strangely enough, most\nof the unusual risks are taken on by\nthe marine market. Past risks have\nincluded:\n\u2022 The 'Animal Magic' sea lion,\nGemini, for \u00a35,000. She was\nbrought to Lloyd's and filmed on\nthe box where her cover was\nunderwritten. Upset by all the fuss,\nshe escaped and bit a passer-by.\n\u2022 Forty members of 'The Whiskers\nClub' in Derbyshire insured their\nbeards for \u00a320 against loss or theft.\n\u2022 A grain of rice with a portrait of\nthe Queen and the Duke of\nEdinburgh engraved on it was\"\ninsured at Lloyd's for $20,000.\n\u2022 A whisky distiller insured his\nnose.\n\u2022 Famous people covered by\nLloyd's insurance include: Betty\nGrable's 'million dollar legs',\nChristopher Reeve, insured for $20\nmillion during the filming of\n'Superman', Bjorn Borg and Pele.\nMany English football teams are\ninsured at Lloyd's under a special\nscheme.\n\u2022 Companies marketing Royal\nWedding souvenirs were insured at\nLloyd's against financial loss\nresulting from cancellation of the\nceremony.\n\u2022 Stuntmen are often insured at\nLloyd's and actually represent a good risk because they take every\npossible precaution during stunts.\nFor the filming of one Cadbury's Milk Tray advert, champion skier\nJean-Claude Killey had to ski at high\nspeed down a mountainside,\npursued by a 'controlled' avalanche.\nHe found himself racing for his life\nwhen the avalanche was detonated\ntoo soon.\nLloyd's is not the only underwriting\nmarket in the world, or even in\nLondon, but it is the oldest and\nmost remarkable.\nHow to become a name\nUnderwriting insurance is obviously\nhighly profitable, but becoming a name is not so easy. To become a member, someone must be recommended by two existing Lloyd's members, undergo strict interviews\nby the Council of Lloyd's and prove\nthat they are worth at least \u00a3100,000,\n60% of which must be in liquid\nassets such as shares, cash or gold.\nThe other 40% may consist of\nproperty or land, but not the\ncandidates home. If things go\nwrong, members can lose everything they own, but the rewards for\nsuccess are high.\nMembers are not only at risk from\nclaims by policy holders. An underwriter has recently been\ncommitted for trial on charges of\nfraud and mismanagement of\naffairs, and, until outlawed quite\nrecently, it was common for\nunderwriters to have small, personal syndicate, called 'The\nBaby' for which they would take say\nVi% of a risk they felt was a good\nbet.\nLloyd's of London proves that\ninsurance is a gamble for high\nstakes. It is unique in its history and\nthe personal touch to business and\nmoves into its fourth century\nstronger than ever.\nThe 'Piper Alpha' Loss\n'Piper Alpha' was owned by four companies: Occidental\nPetroleum (36.5%), Texaco (23.5%), International\nThomson (20%) and Union Texas Petroleum (20%).\nEstimation of the loss was hindered by each company\nhaving its own share separately insured at different total\nvaluations. 80% of the loss was insured in London.\nEstimated value of loss\n(US$ millions)\nPhysical damage 680\nCost of control 34\nSeepage and pol uti on4 Removal of wreck 85\nRedrilling expenses 187\nDamage to pipelines 26*\nBusiness interruption 275\nTOTAL 1291\nThe effect of 'Piper Alpha', the largest man-made loss ever\nto hit the insurance market, was to force cash flow\nproblems for the underwriters, 50-100% increase in\npremiums and a radical reassessment of the safety of\nplatforms and operating procedures.\nPage 10 FELIX May 12 1989\n\n"

Ir\nopposition to the current opinion in IC, I strongly\nbelieve that a library or, indeed, a bookshop is\nmuch more of a service to students than, for\nexample, a pint of cheap beer and, therefore, that\nthe Bookshop should remain a good students'\nbookshop, not a successful stationery shop.\nMr Baker and his Council have sold many\nthings this year: they sold the ICU to NUS...the\nAnti-Loans Campaign to SWSS...and now, the\nICU Bookshop to toiletries' mer chapt s.I am glad\nto see them leaving.\nEmmanual Saradakis, Physics 1.\nFusion\nDear Bill,\nA generalised mathematics exists covering both\nthe 'cold fusion phenomenon' and Stepher\nHawking's 'time' (FELIX 834). Verification of this\nmathematics could be done by examining\ntheoretically suggested similar phenomena, tc\nthat of the 'cold fusion', at room temperature\nwith routine materials, as IC URO P projects\nHowever the implications of success in this\nendeavour are all important.\nIn particular, and computer simulation ver if iec this, this generalised theory leads to the possible\ncreation of a three dimensional energy force\nshield'through which 'solid objects' could no l pass. In addition it would make possible the\ngeneration of entirely new sets of unstoppable\nweapons placed in outer space and target ted on tc the earth.\nClearly the .implications of all new\ndevelopments need to be an aly sie d in depth and\nmilitary developments avoided...but how?\nYours sincerely,\nHarni Fairbrother.\nLSE\nDear Bill,\nThe recent events at the LSE must go down in\nhistory as testimony to the stupidity of the 320\npeople who, on Tuesday 2nd, voted against the\nmotion to repeal the decision to elect Winston\nSilcott as honorary union president.\nJames Nathan claims Silcott is a hero. Silcott's letter of 29th April to The Independent maintains\nthis illusion, that he is an innocent victim of\ninstitutional is ed racism. 'I was locked up for,\nthirty years....with no evidence that I had\ncommitted or been involved in any crime'. He describes himself as a scapegoat. 'This shame of\na case will always he a thorn in the side of the\nBritish judiciary.' One is moved to pity at his\npoignant tale of 'injustice and lies...a black man\nwho has been used.'\nThe name Tonv Smith probably means nothing\nto most of vo u. His father, George Smith, says\nabout Silcott, 'I saw the way this gangster\nlived...He controlled people by fear and terror... this man is a monster.' Twenty v ear old\nTonv was murdered b v Silcott in earl v1985. Despite strenuous police objections, Silcott was\ngranted bail. Soon afterwards the Broadwater\nFarm estate erupted in violence. Silcott helped\nto murder the unarmed PC Blakelock, who died\nwhilst tr ving to protect ambulance crews.\nThe O.E.D. says a hero is a 'man admired for\ngreat deeds'. 1 see nothing great, nothing heroic,\nin the senseless, violent murders of a vo ung boxer\nand a vo ung policeman. The real thorn in the side\nof the British judiciary is that Silcott was released\nfrom prison on bail, and allowed to murder again.\nYours sincerely,\nUltan McCarthy, Physics I. Converted\nfrom Socialism\nDear Bill,\nMay I start by saying 1 do exist; I am not a pseudonym. I did not use 'Christianity as a mere\nfacade' to promote my beliefs. My beliefs come\nfrom Christianity; I was converted from socialism\nb v US tele-evangelist Pat Robertsem.\nIt is clear that the letter by J Healer and co. was\nnot written by a Christian. True, the early Church\n'held everything in common' but the v chose to\ndo so and it was not enforced by government.\nFree will is a central part of Christianity and we\nshould choose to follow Christ.\nThe introduction of the Welfare State is not\nevidence that we cannot rely on charities. It was\nintroduced by a socialist government after the war\nwhen the economy and country was in ruins. We\nhave a very different situation today. The Welfare\nState causes people to feel the state looks after\nothers and that they need only look after\nthemselves. It is this, not Thatcherite wealth\ncreation, that has led to our self-centred society.\nAn indication of how generous a society is, is it's level of personal charity and this has risen under\nThatcher.\nI challenge any Christian Socialist to a debate\nin a DebSoc forum.\nYours in Christ,\nDylan lames.\nPS. I resent being associated with the Bishop\nof Durham. He is a lefty, a liberal, and is trying\nto destroy the Church.\nSaradakis II\nDear Mr Goodwin,\nI was shocked of the election of W. Silcott, a convicted murderer of a policeman, as the\nHonorary President of LSE's student union.\nAs a foreign observer, permit me to say that\na youth that elects a murderer to lead them, might\ncreate some more wealth for the stockbrokers of\ntheir country but will certainly not create a future\nfor the nation.\nThroughout history, wealth has been at most\na measure of living standards, but, whether a country was rich or not, whenever basic\ntraditional moral values such as respect of human\nlife in all its forms, respect for the Nation and its\nrepresentatives, respect to one's family and the\nelders, were not upheld, the country in question\nwas eclipsed from the face of history.\nWhen a country's future leaders (like the ones\nat LSE) elect a murderer to lead them, it's as if\nthe v spat on the face, not only of the dead\npoliceman but of all his family, of the other\nyouths who fight for life and against violence and\nof all the soldiers and policemen who die on the\nfield of honour.\nYours sincerely.\nEmmanuel Saradaki*. Physics 1.\nLoonie-left\nradical sheep\nDear Bill,\nWe were dismayed to read James Nathans letter\nin Felix 834. It was naive of us to believe that I.C. students were at a level above the general mass\nof loony-lefty, liberal minded, 'free Nelson\nMandela' radical sheep that is often associated\nwith other colleges.\nIt only proves what an idiot James Nathan\nreally is that he agrees with the LSE Students\nUnion in its decision to elect the police murderer,\nWinston Silcott, as Honorary President.\nRacism is probably the most misused word in\nthis country (and in most other western societies)\nto dav. As soon as a black man commits a crime\n(which statistically they seem to do more often)\nand gets put in jail for it; it's racial discrimination.\nIf anything, the police should be given more\npower\u2014and guns\u2014so that law and order can be\nproperly maintained. If PC Blakelock had been\narmed, he could have probably protected himself\nfrom these murderous Tottenham tribesmen and\nwould be alive today.\nThese views\" are not borne out of prejudice\nagainst- ethnic minorities, but have been\ndeveloped from a genuine respect for law and\norder, which should be applicable to everyone,\nand should not be waived with respect to colour!\nThe police and courts have seen their active\npowers eroded away, partly due to the trite,\nfashionable, left-wing views of James Nathan and\nfellows.\nIf anything hanging (and even boiling) should\nbe a statutory punishment for these sorts of\ncrimes, and the sooner we develop a stronger and\nless tolerant attitude towards these vis cio is enemies of society, the sooner we will have a safer place for everyone to live in.\nThe use of the words 'working class' in Mr. Nathan's letter is itself the height of hypo c racy and just shows what a naive and gullible person\nhe is, with no real mind of his own. He is exactly\nthe type of fodder an effectively run left-wing (or\nright- wing) organisation would love to have as\na \u2014pliable and mani pul able. James Nathan should grow up!\nYours,\nOle Lie and Bill Bailey MRE 4.\nPage 2 FELIX May 12 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nKoko\nAuthor of more than a dozen horror\nstories, including Ghost Story and\nThe Talisman (co-written with Stephen King), this marks Peter\nStraub's first venture into pure\nthriller territory.\nA group of Vietnam vets, casually\nfronted b v Michael Poole, reunite\nwith a new mission objective. In\nSouth East Asia a string of murders\nhas come to light, each victim\nmutilated and with a playing card\nstuffed in his mouth. The cards all\nhave the word Koko scrawled on\nthem.\nOther than the four platoon\nmembers in New York there are\nonly a couple of likely perpetrators,\nan author Tim Underbill thought to\nbe in Singapore and Victor Spitalny,\nmissing since during the war.\nThe murders duplicate incidents\nin a small Vietnam village, la Thuc,\ntwenty years ago, and it appears\nthat Underhill must be to blame. So\nthree of the comrades fly off, hoping\nto catch the recluse writer, gain the\nsyndicated mini-series rights and earn a packet, and the other stays\nin New York to get rid of his\ncockroaches, his restaurant open,\nand eventually killed.\nIn telling this tale, potentially a wild and race y chase across the\nworld, the author has relied on\nchanging location and dropping in\na new clue now and then to provide\nthe pace. This would be quite\neffective if only the need to supply\ncomprehensive detail had n't padded out the events so much.\nThe past is recalled here and there\na piece at a time, but the intricate\nnarrative again clouds the salient\nincidents, and having failed to put\nthe clues together I needed it\nspelling out in the end.\nThe culmination of the search is\nfairly exciting, well written and\ncleverly constructed, but it takes a little long getting there. Straub\ncertainly has a feel for his subject\nmatter, and provides a convincing\naccount of his locations, especially\nthe brothels and bars of Bangkok.\nYou may be surprised what can be\ndone with a cigarette or a couple of\nping-pong balls.\nKoko is well written, at times\nstylish, and although its length\nmakes it drag occasionally, it also\nmakes for a thick, chunky book\nthat's good to get your hands\naround. It will be out in paperback\nsoon.\nAndmv Clarke.\nMississippi\nBurning\nThe last of the great Oscar nominees\nis here. Alan Parker, director of\nAngel Heart and Midnight Express\npresents us with a movie revolving\naround the suppress ive bigotry of\n1964 America.\nMississippi has a cancer, the\ndanger of racial integration.\nSalvation for the rednecks comes in\nthe form of the White Knights of the\nKu Klux Klan, determined oppose\nthe infiltration of equality in their\nstolid an it communist Anglo-Saxon\nworld. Removing the threat involves\nremoving three young civil rights\nworkers\u2014two white, one black\u2014in\na brutal murder.\nWashington is suspicious of the\nSheriff's 'missing persons' report,\nand ] Edgar's finest are dispatched.'\nWhen the Feds come to town a solution doesn't accompany them,\nas tempers fray, tension soars and\nthe real cancer, equality's opponents, proves to be malignant.\nThe tur bu lance is reflected in the\nFBI also, as the uncooperative locals\npressure their sensibilities and compromise their work ethic. Agent\nWard (Willem Dafoe) is a straight,\nby-the-book lawman, in charge of\nthe operation, but not of events.\nAgent Anderson (Gene Hackman)\nis the natural snoop, digging deep\nand keeping wounds open with\nprovocative, unerring proficiency.\nTheir tardiness causes Ward to call\nin more men, time and again, only\nfueling the situation. He only knows\nthe rules, not the mentality. 'Where\ndoes it come from, all this hatred?'.\nBut Anderson is a Mississippian\nemigre, and he knows the people.\nUltimately it is down to his hard-nosed attitude and ball-squeezing\ntactics to sort the case out.\nMississippi Burning tries very hard\nnot to be bracket ted as a buddy\nmovie. The abrasive relationship of\nthe two leads, and their eventual\nunity infer the description\nthroughout though. Nor does the\nfilm tackle it subject matter of racial\nhatred and obstinate bigotry with\nany real conviction. The events are\nused quite well as a backdrop, and\noften scrape a raw nerve, but the\ncorruption and suffering are never\npushed solidly as the pivot of the\nfilm.\nThere is one resounding victory\nfor the movie however. The NorthSouth divide is expressed very well.\nThe good old boys from Dixie want\nto get on with drinking sour mash\nand making their own rules. They\ndo not need the District of Columbia\nmaking decrees absolute, and they\ndon't need the Hoover-boys.\nAt the bottom line though, this is\njust a cop story, albeit a tense,\natmospheric and poignant example\nof the genre. It should be said\nthough that it deserves its seven\nOscar nominations, but I'm not\nsurprised it was beaten to the post\nby Rainman and Dangerous Liaisons.\nAndreio Clarke.\nSTILL SHOWING\nThe Tall Guy\nSlammed by some, applauded by\nothers, this directorial debut from\nMel Smith is not the stuff of legend,\nbut it never pretends to be. It's just\na come dv, and a good one at that.\nAmerican actor Jeff Goldblum\nsuffers on-stage at the hands of\nRowan Atkinson, and off-stage\nthrough his' own fumbling incompetence. But it gets him the\ngirl, Emma Thompson, complete\nwith nurse's uniform and a good\nstock of wisecracks. His disarray\nalso lands him the lead in the RSC's musical version of The Elephant\nMan.\nThe script is so strong that when rubbery, and everyone concerned\nit flicks effortlessly to solemnity handles Richard Curtiss' s you're left em barras ed by a stifled (Blackadder, The Young Ones) script\nlaugh.

    "content": "Feature\nLloyd's: the risk business\nThe name Lloyd's of London is synonymous with the high tech building\nin the heart of the City which you either love or loathe. But just what\nexactly goes on inside the Richard Rogers contentious creation? Liz Warren\nwent to find out.\nLloyd's of London is not a company\nbut a society made up of\napproximately 32,000 members or\nnames, who undertake to insure\nanything from oil tankers to ballet\ndancers' toes. The members group\ntogether to form syndicates, of\nwhich there are currently about four\nhundred, ranging in size from a few\nnames to several thousand. Each\nsyndicate may accept part of a risk.\nIt will receive that percentage of the\npremium and have to pay that\npercentage of any claims made.\nUnderwriters and Brokers\nEach of the syndicates is represented in the Lloyd's building by\nan underwriter (who may have\nseveral assistants). It is the job of the\nunderwriter to decide on behalf of\nthe syndicate which risks he will\naccept and how much of them he\nwill take. The name underwriter\ncomes from the fact that he or she\nwill write their name under the first\nperson to accept part of the risk.\nThis person is called the leader and\nic is the leaders who decide on the\nsize of the premium for the risk.\nThe risks are presented to the\nunderwriters by brokers, who act as\nmiddlemen between the clients and\nthe underwriters, and who receive\na percentage of the premium as\ncommission. They collect the\npremiums from the clients to pay\nthe syndicates and, in the event of\na claim, arrange a settlement and\ncollect the money from the\nunderwriters. There are currently\n280 bro king firms who are\nauthorised to trade with Lloyd's underwriters.\nThe Room\nAll Lloyd's underwriters work in one place\u2014The Room. Originally\none room in the Royal Exchange on\nThreadneedle Street, the Room now\noccupies the ground floor and three\nof the galleries in the impressive\nglass covered atrium that forms the\ncentre piece of the new Lloyd's building.\nThe underwriters sit on 'boxes',\na group of desks for each syndicate,\nand it is a reflection of the origins\nof Lloyd's that the brokers still visit\nthe underwriters personally to\narrange their business.\nWhen the broker receives the\ndetails of a risk from a client he puts\nthem on a card, known as a slip, and\nvisits an underwriter who specialises in that risk, for example\noil tankers, wh sj m he hopes will\nlead the risk. After^questioning and\nhaggling, a premium will be agreed\nand the underwriter takes a line by\nwriting on the slip the share of the\nrisk he is prepared to accept for his\nsyndicate, together with the agreed\npremium. Once a leader is\nestablished, the broker can then\napproach other underwriters to take\na share of the risk and write their\nnames under that of the leader.\nThe History of Lloyd's Lloyd's is now an enormous\ninstitution, and the actual signing of\npolicies and transfer ral of money\nbetween brokers and underwriters\nis carried out centrally by the\nLloyd's Policy Signing Office. This\nis just one of the ways in which the\nCorporation of Lloyd's supports and\nservices its members, others being\nthe leasing and administration of the\nLlovd's building and the collation of\nnews\u2014both of shipping losses and\nimportant world events.\nBut where did this efficient and\nenormous marketplace emerge\nfrom? The origin of Llovd's was in\nMr Edward Lloyd's Coffee House in\nTower Street in the late seventeenth\ncent ur v. Merchants, shipowner s and captains would gather in the\nCoffee House to exchange news,\nand Llovd's coffee house gained a administration of Lloyd's which was\nchaired by Sir Henry Fisher, ex-chairman of Imperial College's Governing Body. This set up the\nCouncil of Lloyd's which today acts\nas both a managing group and a rule\nmaking and self regulatory body.\nThe Lloyd's Building\nLloyd's has had several homes\u2014Mr\nLloyd's Coffee House; the New Lloyd's Coffee House and the Royal\nExchange, followed by a move to a The old underwriting Room\nThe present Lloyd's building\nreputation for trustworthy shipping\ninformation \u2014 and also the recognised place for marine\ninsurance.\nWith time, this informal gathering\nof Lloyd's became more\nestablished\u2014although marine\ninsurance went along hand in hand\nwith other less respectable\n'insurance'\u2014bets on sick kings\ndying within a certain time, for\ninstance. In 1769, the more\nreputable of Lloyd's customers\nbroke away and formed ' New Lloyd's Coffee House' in nearby\nPope's Head Alley, devoted solely\nto marine insurance. In 1774 the\nbusiness moved into rooms in the\nRoyal Exchange on Threadneedle\nStreet and Cornhill and left its\nCoffee House associations behind\nforever.\nThe Society of Lloyd's was given\na formal legal basis by the Lloyd's Act of 1871 and five subsequent acts\nhave followed which have met the\nchanging needs of the society. The\nmost recent of these was in 1982 and\nwas the result of an enquiry into the\nnew building in Lime Street,\nopposite the present site, in 1958.\nEach of these moves was the result\nof the ever-increasing number of\nunderwriters as both the number of\nsyndicates and the amount of\nbusiness transacted increased.\nBy the time Lloyd's moved into its\ncurrent site, the Richard Rogers\nbuilding, in May 1986, the strain on\nthe Lime Street building was such\nthat two underwriting rooms were\nin use (contrary to the practise of\nhaving all the underwriting in one\nroom, which was considered to be\nLloyd's strength). The second of\nthese rooms had formerly been an\nunderground car park and, as it was\npainted yellow, was known by\nthose who worked in it as 'The\nYellow Submarine'.\nThe new building is constructed\naround a central atrium with a glass\nbarrel roof which contains the Room\nand all the offices and meeting\nrooms. One end is filled with glass\nwalled escalators that seem to crawl\nup and down like caterpillars and on\ncont. on next page\nMay 12 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

Everyone has\nthem but everyone gets over them.\nWeu ere possibly a bit foolish in that\nwe would eat anything an v where. ind Malcolm paid for it by catching\ngard i a. This made cycling slightly\nunpleasant, but nothing that a few\ndav s and lots of antibiotics couldn't euro.\nAt midday we got our first\nglimpse of the mountains rising\nabrupt lv from the plains. This sight\nfilled us with enthusiasm but the\nseven kilometres and fourteen\nhairpin bends, that it took to climb\nthe 400 metres to Nahan, soon\nknocked that out of us.\nWe pulled into adha ba that was\ncrowded with people listening to the\ncricket on a transistor radio.\nEngland were being soundly thrashed by India and there was a gleam of satisfaction on the faces of\nthe men when the v saw us. Indians\nseem to be very familiar with\nEnglish cricketers and we were\nsubjected to a continual stream of\njokes about the quality of English\nplay.\nThe d hab aw allah informed us\nthat there would be a festival to\ncelebrate the birthday of Guru\\ anak so we decided to spend the\nday here. The interesting thing\nabout the festival was a large female\nparticipation which we found rather\nstrange as we hadn't, up to this\npoint, seen any women taking part\nin any kind of activity.\nNext morning we set out for\nShimla. The road runs through deep\nforests and high passes. There is\nsome incredible scenery to be seen\non this road, especially on the\nstretch between Solan and Kasumpati. We booked into a HP TD C( Homadhal Pradesh Tourist\nDevelopment Corporation) lodge\n(but only after the usual hassles with\nthe local chow kidder). The lodge\nwas built over the edge of a ridge\nand our room had the finest view I had probably seen to date. It is at\ntimes like this that we started\nranting about the relative merits of\ntaking a year off rather than going\nstraight into employment. We both\nfelt that the experiences gained are\nworth a lot more than the advancement in a career.\nOn reaching Shimla by this route,\nthere is a fine view of the town; pink\nrooftops against the dark green of\nthe forest. The town is built on a very steep ridge between Jakko hill\nand Observatory hill. The first\nhouses being built by Livet Kennedy\nin 1823. By 1928 the town was\nestablished as the favourite summer\nresidence of the British. Indeed, the\nbuildings surrounding the Mall are\nreminiscent of India's colonial days.\nOn arriving in Shimla we were\nswamped by touts insisting that we\nstayed at their hotel. Once the hotel\nwas decided a crowd of coolies\nmoved in and insisted that it was\nnecessary that our baggage be\ncarried for us. A few harsh words\nand a dominating personality never\nseem to do the trick in situations like\nthis.\nEventually we got, what must\nhave been, the shabbiest room in all\nof Shimla (even though we were\nassured that it had all 'mod cons').\nThe highlight of our stay in Shimla was a trip up Jakko hill\n(2455m) from which there are views\nof Shimla and the snow capped\nmountains. There is a temple at the\ntop of the hill, dedicated to\nHanuman\u2014the monk ev god. It is\nfamous for the monkeys that haunt\nit and while here Malcolm was\nattacked by a monkey which stole ,\na bag of peanuts out of his hand.\nWhile this was happening an old\nlad v who was almost bent double\nwith a child on her back, was being\nh arras ed by a monkey pulling at her\nhandbag. She was screaming, what\nI assume were Hindi curses.\nFortunately someone saw fit to hurl\na stone at the monk ev which then\ndisappeared into the forest.\nIt was now late November and a man in adha ba informed us that\nKashmir would be covered in snow\nwithin the month, so we decided\nthere and then to get a bus to\nJammu.\nTen hours later we arrived in\nJammu, only it isn't Jammu. We had\nsomehow managed to arrive in Pabhenkot which is in the Punjab.\n(A bit ironic considering we've\nspent days trying to avoid the area.)\n1 am informed b v the bus conductor\nthat the bus was diverted from\nJammu because of riots that have\njust taken place there. We are now\nexpected to get a train to Jammu\nfrom here.\nGetting a train ticket in India is\ndifficult but slightly more so at four\no 'clock in the morning and getting\na ticket for a bike as well is virtually\nimpossible. I left Malcom with the\nbikes and picked mv way carefully\nthrough the sleeping bodies that\nlittered tie platform to the ticket\noffice. The technique to use in these\nsituations is; head down and barge\nyour way through.\nAfter a great struggle I manage to\nget two tickets to Jammu but the '\nticket vendor was convinced that\nbicycles were never allowed on\ntrains. We found the guard of the\ntrain and offered him a small bribe\nif he allowed us to put our bikes on\nbut we were shocked when he\nrefused the money.\nAs the train pulled out we decided\nto barge into the first class\ncompartment, bikes and all. All the\ncompartments were taken so we\nsettled down on the floor in the\ncorridor to sleep. At dawn we were\nawakened b v an extremely mean\nlooking army official wondering\nwh v we were there. We explained\nthe previous night's events to him\nwhile he tinkered with our bikes.\nThis seemed to satisfy him and he\ndisappeared back into his carriage\nfor another hours sleep.\nAt the station we were stopped b va guard who must have been given\ninformation on us from somewhere.\nWe realised that this guard was only\nout to extract a little money from us\nso we gave him fifty rupees and\nhurried on. Our next obstacle was\nto get past the ticket collector at the\ngate but this was nothing that 20\nrupees couldn't solve. Leaving the\nstation we were immediately\npounced on by a group of touts\ntrying to sell us bus tickets to\nSringagar. We chose the most\ntrustworthy looking tout and we\nwere soon on the bus on our way\nto Sringagar, the summer capital of\nthe state of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe bus ride from Jammu to\nSrinagar is without doubt the most\nspectacular journey I 've\nundertaken. Leaving Jammu to road\nbegins to rise and continues\nupwards for the next four hours.\nPassing round a high mountain\nridge at Pataitop the road starts to\ndescend and the brown roofed\nmountains, peaked with snow come\ninto view.\nArriving in Srinagar the house\nboat touts were out in force. Each\none trying to convince us that they\nhave exactly what we're looking for.\nThe houseboats come to be in Srinagar because in the days of the\nRaj the British were not allowed to\nown land in Kashmir and a houseboat seemed the best solution.\nThe boats are decorated in an\nEdwardian style and it is easy to\nspend days and days just lounging\non the houseboat and occasionally\ngoing for rides in almost decadent\nluxury in one of the local Shikaras\n(a water-taxi).\nEven in the middle of Dal lake it\nis impossible to get away from touts\ntrying to sell you something. Thev\npaddle up in their floating\nhypermarket s and offer all kinds of\nsouvenirs.\nPerhaps the summer, when th t tourist trade isn't so slack, one can\nget b v with a lot less h arras s ment.

    "content": "Reviews\nGhetto\nby Joshua Sobol\nGhetto tells the story of the Jewish\nghetto in the Lithuanian city of Vilna\nunder Nazi occupation, and of the\ndesperate struggle for sur vial of its\ninhabitants. Since Jews who had\nemployment survived, one of the\nschemes was the formulation of a threat re troupe, which, incredibly,\nplayed to packed houses\nthroughout its few years of\nexistence.\nThe play opens with the discovery\nby Kittel, the local SS commandant,\nof a Jewish singer in possession of\nsome stolen beans. He insists that\nshe repay the value of the beans in\nperformances of which he will be\nthe judge, since he is an art connoisseur, and it is true that the real\nKittel patrolled the ghetto with a machine gun in one hand and a saxophone in the other.\nGens, the chief of Jewish police,\nand later the leader of the Jewish\ncouncil that runs the ghetto\nsupports the formation of the\ntheatre group, as he does for\nanything which can save Jewish\nfamilies, despite the idealistic\nZionist, librarian Kur k who campaigns for ' No theatre in a graveyard!' Gens' stance was that\nof all the Jewish councils in general\u2014they went along with the\nwishes of the Germans, although as\nGens demonstrates, their main\npoint was to save Jewish lives, since\nas Gens points out, the Germans kill\nmore Jews if they resist. He is even\nwilling to let the despicable\nentrepreneur Weiskopf become a millionaire on the backs of others,\nby repairing German uniforms\nbecause it gives employment.\nThe play is full of music and jokes\nas the inhabitants of the ghetto try\nto live their lives, and to maintain\ntheir moral standards, but, in its\nevocation of the Yiddish theatre, the\naction is faithful in that the laughter\nis tinged with tears, and the tears\nwith laughter. All the time there is\nthe threat of Kittel, the artistic,\nsadistic Kraut with the habit of\npopping up everywhere. Kittel,\nplayed by Alex Jennings, shares a curiously knowing rapport with\nGens, a superbly gritty performance\nby John Woodvine, which makes it\nall the harder to accept the inevitable\nconclusion, which extinguishes the\nhope you share with the Jews.\nAH the songs\u2014some of which\nsurvive from Vilna itself\u2014are\npe formed very well and some make\npoignant set peice s, such as Hayyah\nsinging of her sorrow that her man\nhas been shot, whilst the Nazis\nenjoy an orgy with Jewish girls, a bribe to save families. The clever set\ngives a good impression of a cramped ghetto, and the\nperformances are good, notably that\nof Linda Kerr Scott, as a ventriloquist's dummy.\nThe play also has a strong\nmessage in it, in so much as the\nghetto is a microcosm of modern-day Israel. The Jews are in conflict\nover whether to fight out against the\nGermans, and strive for their Zionist\nbeliefs, or whether to follow Gens\npath of passive resistance. Gens\njustifies the existence of the theatre\nto Kruk by saying that only through\nthe pursuit of culture and moral\nbehaviour in the ghetto will the\nsouls of the Jews remain clean, not\n'riddled with their filthy disease'.\nThis ties in with the author's statement that, if the Jews in Israel\nhave taken on the beliefs of the\nNazis, they are spiritually dead, and\nIsrael is lost.\nGhetto perhaps introduces more\nthemes than it can reasonably cope\nwith in its three hours, but despite\nthis, it is the most moving play I have seen about the Holocaust and\nis highly recommended.\nGhetto, Olivier Theatre, National\nTheatre, opened 27th April '89.\nMichael Kirsch.\nFletoh Lives\nWith a four year break since his first\nadventure, investigative reporter\nI.M. Fletcher is back, determined to\nworm his way into some villainy\nand conspiratorial wrong doings\nwhether he likes it or not.\nNews from Louisiana informs\nFletch of an inheritance; his recently\nICSO\nFunk Master\nChopin\nFrederic Chopin was born. Years\nlater he died. In between these two\nmajor events in his life, he wrote a large am mount of music,\nparticularly for the pianoforte.\nAmong these pieces were his great\nworks, Piano Concerto No 1, Piano\nConcerto No 2 and a large number of\nsonatas, followed a year later by a large number of sonatas No2. Chopin was Polish, known in piano playing circles as Mr Sheen,\nthough today, there are only a few\nsurviving circles still able to play the\npiano. He did not ride a motorcycle\nnor did he play in goal for his native\nPoland at Wembley in1974 in the\nWorld Cup qualifying match against\nEngland. He did however, lose the\nmanuscript for his first piano\nconcerto whilst on a journey from\nWarsaw to Paris. It was later found,\nunfortunately he had already\npublished its sequel and called it\nPiano Concerto No1. Luckily the\ntwo stories were not intertwined\nand only a few of the same\ncharacters were involved.\nChopin, being dead, will be\nunable to attend tonight's performance of his second (or first\nchronologically speaking) piano\ndeceased aunt's eighty acre\nplantation called Belle Isle. Visions\nof a languid existence in the South\nattract him, and with typewriter and\nsuitcase-load of disguises, off he\ngoes.\nThe property is a tumble-down\nwreck, overgrown and worthless.\nOr so it seems, until a number of\nstrange characters impede upon the\ntranquility and proceed to hound\nFletch into a sale. With a murder\nspicing the intrigue, our hero has\nsomething new to investigate.\nRecreating his unpredictable,\neccentric lead is Chevy Chase,\nswan ning around the screen in numerous disguises worthy of Peter\nSellers, with his natural grin and\nbenign charm shining through.\nFletch Lives offers another ideal\nplatform for Chase's brand of\nharmless wit and facetiousness, so\ncharacteristic of previous outings,\nCaddi/shack, National Lampoon's Vacation and the like.\nDirector is once again Michael\nRitchie (The Golden Child) and his\nexperience through the original\nFletch should enable him to bring\nout the best in Chase.

    "content": "Felix\nChemistry\nImperial's Chemistry Department is one of the top five departments\nin the country. It has produced two Nobel prize winners and generates\nmore research income per academic than any of the other departments\nwithin the College.\nBut, if you walked around the older parts of Chemistry you could\nbe forgiven for thinking otherwise; the buildings are dank and\nmiserable; the lecture theatres have not been redecorated since they\nwere built in the 1900's; the labs suffer from leaking roofs; the\nbuildings are overheated in Summer and too cold in Winter.\nThe University Funding Council's decision to allocate \u00a33.6m for an\nextension to the Chemistry building should be welcome news. It\nshould be, but \u00a33.6 million is not enough to provide anything other\nthan the most basic facilities. There will be no room for lecture theatres\nand no room for a planned Interdisciplinary Research Centre to\nresearch into semiconductors. But what is more worrying is the fact\nthat the department will not be able to maintain its current safety\nstandards, because the money allocated by the UFC will not provide\nan adequate number of fume cupboards.\nPerhaps then, it is not surprising that the department has lost three\nsenior professors in the past two years. Nor is it surprising that the\nHead of the Department is worried that top students will not be\nattracted to chemistry at IC.\nTrading places\nIn an effort to promote 'understanding' between FELIX and the Union,\nUnion President Nigel Baker and I will be swapping jobs for a week\nfrom the 22nd of May. It should be an interesting experience.\nIn some ways Nigel has the better part of the deal. It is possible\nto achieve a great deal in a week as FELIX Editor, but very little in\na week as Union President. Nevertheless the swap will provide a unique opportunity to look into the way the Union Office operates\nand I will take the opportunity to produce an in-depth investigation\ninto the role of a student Union President.\nNigel and I have very different views on the way FELIX should be\nrun. Nigel would very much like it to be a public relations vehicle for\nthe Union Office, after all, he argues, FELIX is funded by the Union.\nI take the view that the Union is much more than the handful of\npeople who work in the Union Office; the Union is made up of the\n5000 students, most of whom do not even know where the Union\nbuilding is. It is those students who pay for FELIX, not the Union\nOffice, and that is why I have tried to produce a FELIX which ordinary\nstudents will find interesting and informative.\nNevertheless, I have given the Union Office a page every week to\nuse in whatever manner they wish. The fact that the Union President\nand the other sabbaticals have decided they cannot be bothered to\nmake use of this facility rather diminishes their argument that FELIX\ndoes not give the Union (ie 'Union Office') a sufficiently high profile.\nUM (?0U gT \u00a3\\?LN - JU OlE v X f^AV/A Cr ArJ' ZA...

They claim\nthat the extension will not be large\nenough for the department's requirements and are concerned\nthat safety standards will be\ncompromised because of shortage of\nfunds.\nThe building, which is due for\ncompletion by 1993 was given the go\nahead two weeks ago, 20 years after\nthe initial application to the\nUniveristy Grants Committee. As part of the deal, the 'volley ball'\nblock and parts of the Old Chemistry building will be\ndemolished.\nCollege officials are still\nnegotiating with the Science\nMuseum to retain possession of the\nlecture theatre block, as no provision for replacement theatres\nhas been made by the UFC. Head of the Chemistry Department, Professor Steve Ley\nhas complained that 'There are no\nlecture theatres and it will severely\ndamage our ability to recruit\nstudents.'\nHe went on to say that the\nbuilding would not allow the\ndepartment room for future\nexpansion and pointed out that the\nmoney allocated by the UFC would\nnot allow a sufficient number of\nfume cupboards to maintain current\nsafety standards.\nThe department had originally\napplied for a building of 5000 square\nmeters in1965 to re house laboratories and lecture theatres\nheld in the old chemistry block.\nBecause the UFC award will only\nallow for a building of 2000 square\nmeters the college will be unable to\nreplace the labs and lecture theatres\nin the old blocks and plans to site\nan Interdisciplinary Research Centre\nfor semi conductors in the new\nbuilding have been dropped.\nThis has ang red many academics\nMm, l:l lh!:!!! in|!|:' l mmm\nAn artist's impression of the controversial new\nChemistry building\nwho are cone r ned that the\ndelap i dated state of the lecture\ntheatres will discourage top students and academics from applying to Imperial.\n'We have lost three senior\nprofessors in two years' said\nProfessor Ley.\nThe College has not undertaken\nany repair work on the old Chemistry building since the\napplication for Chemistry II was\nmade 20 years ago in the belief that\nthe older buildings would be\nentirely replaced.\nThe nine storey extension will be\nconstructed in two stages, with\nwork on the foundations and an\nelectrical sub-station due to begin in\nApril.\nImperial's first application for a new Chemistry building was turned\ndown in 1965 after the UGC had readjusted their assessment criteria. A second application for a smaller\nbuilding was turned down in 1972\nbecause the UGC were already fully\ncommitted financially. The College\napplied for a building of 4000 square\nmetres of usable space in 1982\nfollowing recommendations by the\nPhysical Science Sub Committee\nwho were 'sympathetic with the\nconditions in the old buildings.'\nThis application was postponed\nuntil the College could produce an\nappraisal of the amount of free space\navailable elsewhere in the College\nand had determined valid reasons\nfor these being unsuitable for use by\nthe department.\nThe UGC accepted that the\ndepartment needed a building with\n3000 square metres of floor space but\nreduced this figure to 2000 square\nmetres when they applied assessment criteria more stringently.\nInitially the UGC required the old\nChemistry buildings to be\ndemolished.\nTt led us to the point where we\ncouldn't see how to run the\ndepartment with that amount of\nspace' said a spokesman from the\ndepartment.\nThe UGC relented in April,\nallowing the department to retain\nthe lecture theatre block, subject to\nagreement with the Science\nMuseum who own half of the land\noccupied by the building.\nThe department has tried,\nunsuccessfully to obtain extra\nfunding for the building from\nindustry.\n'Industry is willing to invest in research, but not in buildings' said\na spokesman.\nSenate\nLibrary\nto go\nSenate House library may be\nforced to throw away thousands of\nscience textbooks because London\nUniversity lacks the money to\nredistribute the books to its\nconstituent Colleges.\nThe library's17,000 textbooks\nwere due to be redistributed to\nImperial, Royal Holloway and Bedford, Kings, Queen Mary, and\nUniversity College, but neither the\nlibrary nor the colleges are likely to\nbe able to afford the costs of\nre cataloging and transporting the\nbooks.\nTt would be easier and cheaper for\nthe colleges to buy new rather than\nto pay for re cataloging new stock'\nsaid a spokesman from the Senate\nlibrary.\nDr Bernard lamb, a member of the\nlibrary's Science Working Party,\ntold FELIX that many of the books\nwould have to be 'recycled for waste\npaper' because of the costs\ninvolved.\nSenate house library is due to\nbecome an 'arts only' library in 1990\nfollowing the recommendations of\nthe Ryan report on the library's future.\nA working party is currently\nconsidering the future of the\nlibrary's medical collection which is\nalso due to be redistributed throughout the constituent colleges.\nThe University of London Union\n(ULU) headed a campaign last year\nto retain the science and medical\ncollections of the library and to\nprevent the library from becoming\nreference only. Although the plans\nfor a reference only library were\ndropped, UL U President, Ruth\nBenzimera told FELIX that there was\nnothing UL U could do to save the\nscience and medical collection.\nISSUE 835 12 MAY1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nIC-A Worse Class\nBy Sydney Harbour-Bridge\nI feel compelled to write a second article concerning the academic situation\nat IC. Over the past two weeks, following the last article, many people\nhave spoken to me. With the exception of one person, who said it was\ndepressing, everyone else liked it. Many have stated they are seriously\nconsidering leaving IC and a number had sent it home to their parents.\nAmong other comments I was told 'If** king agree with everything you\nwrote' and someone else said 'Why didn't you write it last year, I'd have\nleft if it wasn't my final year'. The biggest question people have asked\nis 'Is it all true?'. The answer is, of course, yes, but I have to admit picking\nthe two most obvious examples of those friends who entered with me but\ndid not graduate.\nConsidering the impact of that\narticle I feel it important to outline\nthe fate of the others who did not\ngraduate. The only people I know,\nother than Giles and Caroline, who\ndid not graduate from that year of\nentry in my department, were four\nmen and one woman. We will call\nthese people Simon, John, Robert,\nChris and Sarah. Simon finished his\nfirst year with a third and promptly\nleft to go to Reading, changing his\ncourse from Geology to Geophysics.\nWhen I spoke to Simon two months\nago he informed me that he had\ngraduated with a2:1 and, although\nhe said so himself, was unlucky not\nto get a first. He is presently earning\na considerable sum of money with\na geological firm in Africa. (Less\nthan five of the original IC set got\njobs in geology on graduation.)\nJohn also got a third and left to go\nto Durham, a university he had\nqualified for through UCC A but had\nrejected in preference to IC. Although I hear this by word of\nmouth alone, I believe John also\ngraduated with a2:1. Robert failed to complete his first\nyear due to glandular fever and quit\nhis res it year in March, becoming an\naccountant in the City, a job many\nof his fellows took up after\ngraduation.\nSarah was re sitting her first year\nas I entered and she eventually\nfailed completely at the end of the\nyear. Depressed and dejected she\nreturned home to Sweden to restart\nher degree there. I have not heard\nfrom Sarah since.\nIC really screws you up\nI have purposely left Chris until last\nas this is a rather different story.\nChris entered the department as an\nenthusiastic and socially active\ncharacter. He scored well throughout the first year, coming\ntop nearly every week in one\nparticular subject, despite being\ndissatisfied with the course and the\namount of work. By half-way\nthrough the year he had given up\nall sport, which he was very good,\nand, as exams approached, he\nbecame more depressed. He hardly\nattended more than an hour of any\nof his exams and continually\nsuffered from bad migraine\nheadaches.\nChris failed his first year exams,\nhe did not res it or re-enter education\nelsewhere. He became a waiter in a London hotel and, when I last\nheard, was a heroin addict and\nunemployed.\nIC rid Chris of all his faith in the\neducation system and though many\nof his College friends tried to help\nhim get off drugs he showed\nnothing but hostility towards them.\nWhat makes people leave?\nImperial College surveys all of its\nstu a ents six months after\ngraduation to ascertain their success\nin finding a job. Outside of asking\na student who is leaving why he is\ndoing so, they do not make any\nattempt to find out anything about\nthose who do not graduate. Surely\nthese people hold the key to how to\nimprove the standard of education\nhere.\nAll of the people who fail at IC\nhave passed the entry requirements\nand hence we can presume have\nachieved good enough ' A' level\ngrades to enter almost any university in Britain. At the same\ntime the vast majority of students\nentering IC enjoyed their work at\n' A' level and have obviously\ndeveloped a strong understanding\nof the subject. .\nThe academic staff of IC have\noften told me that ' A' level grades\nare not a good indicator of success\nat degree level. If this is so, why are\npeople chosen on the basis of these\ngrades? If you managed to get good\n' A' level grades and failed your\ndegree whilst someone with lower\ngrades passed with flying colours at\nanother university, there is\nobviously something wrong with\nthe system and not you.\nIn my mind the problem lie?in the\namount of work that this college\nexpects of its students. Compare\nyour situation to that of your friends\nat home. Consider what they\nthought to be hard work at school\nand think about what they are doing\nnow. In almost all cases you will\nfind they are doing considerably less\nwork\u2014staff-student contact hours\nand private study.\nCollege ignores the facts\nSo, is it just the author's opinion\nthat the amount of lectures and\nquantity of material covered at IC is\nstifling for an adventurous mind?\nEvery five years each undergraduate\ncourse is reviewed and 'external\nassessors' are invited to comment.\nAlmost every assessor suggested a dramatic cut in the lecture and other\ncontact time. This point is ignored\nby the College. The College\nUndergraduate Studies Committee\nand Board of Studies have\nrecommended a weekly contact time\nof twenty hours with a maximum of\n25 hours. Nearly every department\nbreaks this regulation; my department does so almost every\nweek.\nSo, do we really work too hard?\nI believe so, having spoken to\ngeologists from other universities.\nThe best example of how hard we\nwork was demonstrated in a convention to which IC invites\nteachers from schools to convince\nthem of IC's excellence During a discussion I was asked if IC was\nhard work. I said it was very hard\nand that it tended to squash one's enthusiasm for the subject. I qualified this by saying that this\nprepared students for the outside\nworld. Immediately three of the four\nteachers present said that I should\nwait to get into the 'outside world'\nand insisted I would find it even\nharder work. I retorted saying that\nI'd worked in industry twice for\nmore than a year and it was easy\nand enjoyable compared to life at IC.\nThey were obviously not convinced\nthen the fourth teacher spoke up. 'I was at IC( doing Maths, the course\nwith the lowest contact hours). 'You\nwork hard, you work bloody hard,\nyou worked so hard I left and went\nto Southampton where I had a good\ntime and got a good degree. I wouldn't recommend one of my\nstudents to come here unless they\n. were absolutely brilliant, would\nwalk through Oxbridge and didn't want a social life.' She hadn't even\nbothered reaching her exam term to\nleave IC. To her it just wasn't worth\nall that hassle.\nAll work and no play\nI believe that students at IC do want\nto work hard, they enjoy doing well\nand generally enter College filled\nwith enthusiasm for their course,\nbut the workload at IC rids them of\nthis.\nThe College will tell you that it is\nimpossible to cut the size of the\ncourse and contact hours. This is\nabsolute rubbish. The courses that\nhave to be approved by external\nbodies are described in one paragraph. The questions set in the\nexams rarely cover more than 15%\nof the course that is lectured, hence\nthe same exam and course\ndescription could be applied to a lecture course half as long.\nThe lecturers of this College do\nnot understand what they are doing\nto the social development of their\nstudents by making them work so\nhard. The year before I joined this\ncollege I played bridge every day\nand was involved in national\ncompetitions. I played hockey every\nday and badminton once a week. I still had the time to get four ' A' levels and gain entry to IC. Within\none term at IC I found I could only\nafford to play hockey once a week\nand I haven't picked up a badminton racket since.\nI was conned when I joined\nImperial College.\nMay 12 1989 FELIX Page 3\n\n"

And she did goeth on 'We will send\na force of ships to smite the\nArgentine'.\nAnd Parliam'ent did reply ' Oh absolutely, Oh divine leader, whose\nhandbag we are not fit to look\nupon.'\nAnd the great fleet did sail for\nforty days and forty nights. But the\ngeneral knew no law for he sent\nforth his finest boat, the General\nBelgrano. And the divine Margar'et\ndid look upon this boat, saying\nYonder boat may not enter the holy\nZone of Exclusion for if it does it will\nfeel my wrath'. And the Belgrano\ndid not enter the Zone of Exclusion\nbut she sank it anyway.\nIt came to pass that Margar'et did\nbeat the sh*t out of the Argentines\nand there was much rejoicing and\nall the people did celebrate the great\nvictory. But Tarn Dalyel rebuked\nMargar'et saying unto her 'thou\nhast cheated.'\nAnd the scribes of The Mail and\nthe Express did say 'Maggie, thou\nart Wonderful' and the people did\nagree.\n4\" A great photo-opportunity\"\nNow, the barbarians of the\nIR'A who knew eth no law and\nno honour did try eth to blow up the\ndivine Margar'et and lo, they did\nmake a cock-up for Margar'et\nsurvive th and there was a great\n'photo-opportunity'.\nAnd the Cabin'et was like a house\ndivided for Hesel'tine, lord of the\njungle, did fight with Britt'an the\nmaster of the trades over the great\nSt. Feliticus started life as a Tabloidian\nMonk and is perhaps best known for his\nvisions.

But they did miss the one\nknown as the Mad Dog and Rea'gan\nsaye th unto the World 'Thou ain't seen nothing yet'.\nAnd, yea, it was again time for\nanother election and the followers\nof Margar'et did fight the prophets\nof doom, who were now called as\nthe followers of the rose, and did\nfight the many headed people of the\ncentre. And Owen, the prophet of\nthe centre, did say unto the people\n'Vote for me for I have no policies'.\nAnd Margar'et did smite the\nfollowers of the rose and the people\nof the centre and did again ascend\nthe throne of Dow'ning Street. And, lo, the people of the centre did right\none another on the fields of the\nGuardian Letters Page and, yea,\nthe v were stricken never to rise\nagain.\n6\n' 'Let there be privatisation of gas,\nwater and electricity\"\nOn the other side of the Earth,\na man by the name of Wright did go\nout among the people and did say\nunto them 'the lord's of intelligence\nin Brit'ain have been very naughty'.\nAnd Margar'et did say unto the\nJudges 'He cannot say that'. And the Judges of Brit'ain did agree. But,\nlo, on the other side of the earth the\nJudges did say 'thou art wrong'.\nAnd Margar'et sent forth Lord\nArm'strong known as he who is\neconomical with the truth to argue\nwith the Judges but to no avail. And it came to pass that all the peoples\nof the World, save those of Brit'ain,\ndid read the book of Wright and\nthey found it to be of no worth.\nAnd on a Rock in the Sea in the\nMiddle of the Earth the barbarians\nof the IR'A did again plan a deed\nmost foul. Yet they had no bomb.\nBut this worried Margar'et not and\nthe barbarians were slain by the\ndivine warriors of the S A'S. And the warriors did say unto the people\n'We cannot tell thou what happened\nfor it is an Official Secret'.\nLo, Margar'et continued in power. And she did say let there be\nprivatisation of gas and water and\nelectr'icity, and lo, there was privatisation of gas water and the\nelect ri 'city and there were many\nwho made a killing on the stock\nmarket. And on the second day she\ndid introduce loans for the poor and\nfor the stud'ents. And the widow\nhad to give up her mite to the poll-tax. And Margar'et went on and on\nand on, but on the seventh day she\ni rested. May 12 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
