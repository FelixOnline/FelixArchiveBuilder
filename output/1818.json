Still, his more loyal fans had faith\nin his ability to deliver more profound art, with tracks\nlike\u2018Sisyphus\u2019fromhispreviousLPincorporatingsome\nhighly interesting sonics that teased towards a promising path forward. And they were right. I Didn\u2019t Mean\nTo Haunt You blew me away in just about every way\npossible.\nInthisconceptual,ethereal,emotionalthunderstorm\nof a record, Quadeca delivers an intensely personal\naccount of mental health and suicidal ideation \u2013\nsomething he has struggled with over the past years.\nIn his own words, Ben found himself finding great\ncomfort in this idea of complete nothingness and\n\u201cnot existing\u201d, to the point where the idea felt worth\nexploring creatively. Rather than giving us a direct\ndepiction of his mental state, Quadeca decides to\ncraft a character of a ghost who is left to ponder his\ndecision to commit suicide, inhabiting an eerie place\n\u201csomewhere inbetween closed eyes and a dream\u201d,\nbeautifully painted on the track \u2018don\u2019t mind me\u2019 \u2013 one\nof my personal highlights on the record. Nonetheless,\nas much as he does use this character as a window into\nhis own mind, the ghost simultaneously feels like a\ncreative exercise for its own sake, with Ben essentially\nattempting to imagine what the continuation of the\npsyche in the aftermath of his own death would feel\nlike. The instrumentals on the first leg of the record are\nincredibly pretty and layered, with glitchy synthesizers,\ngentle piano keys and anxiety-inducing, distorted\nsoundpalettesconstructingahauntinglydepressing,yet\nbeautiful and other-worldly atmosphere reminiscent of\na Microphones record. Quadeca displays an absolute\nmastery of assembling many of these seemingly\ndisjointed fragments into mind-bending beats and\nmelodies that, for the most part, work really well at\nbringing you into this compelling world of grief and\nisolation.\nThe first track, \u2018sorry4dying\u2019, deals with the very act\nof suicide and the \u201csecond birth\u201d of the character\u2019s\nself in ghost form, as Quadeca puts it. He returns to\nhis childhood home, which is the setting where most\nof the album takes place. The character proclaims that\nhe\u2019s \u201csorry for dying\u201d and yearns to \u201chold his loved\nones\u201d without \u201chaunting\u201d them and causing them pain.\nQuickly, he is struck with the realisation of how lonely\nthis inbetween space is (\u201cReach through the walls,\nI tried to scream, it won\u2019t come out\u201d), which sends\nhim on a maddening spiral of conflicting emotions\nas the record progresses. The character reflects on his\ndecision to take his life on the following track, \u2018tell me\na joke\u2019, from the angle of satirical happiness, with verses\nlike \u201cKnock knock who\u2019s there, tell me a joke \u2026 it\u2019s a\nsetup, the punchline was me\u201d communicating regret\nand suggesting that he considers being dead one big\njoke \u2013 a poor decision that brought him nothing in the\nend apart from trapping him in a horrible, quiet space\nwhere \u201call he can hear are crickets\u201d. The initial emotions\nof sadness and compassion for his heart-broken\nmother slowly morph into annoyance and irritation,\nwhich begin to leak through on \u2018tell me a joke\u2019, where\nhe laughs at the implication that it was all \u201ctoo soon\u201d\nand \u201cout of the blue\u201d, perhaps expressing frustration\nthat nobody noticed his mental deterioration. On the\nsong \u2018born yesterday\u2019, he becomes almost angry at his\nmum for pretending to be okay after his passing (\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t born yesterday, I think you\u2019re goddamn lying\u201d),\nstarting to show more bitter and self-centred emotions\nthat grow stronger as he spirals into excruciating\nloneliness. The instrumental, while\nretaining many of the pretty qualities\non previous tracks, becomes moodier\nand tense. The main sample loops over\nand over again, adding to the mounting\nfeeling of unbearable sadness, with\nthe song becoming more intense and\nhelping to kickstart the character\u2019s\ntormented downfall. The repeated\nwish for his mother to join him in the\nafterlife is a recurring theme initially expressed on\n\u2018picking up hands\u2019, where he craves to be with her and\nconsole her, reassuring her that he is much closer\nthan she thinks. Although not bad, this track is\none of the few instances on the album where I feel\nthe production layers do not really coalesce into\nsomething more powerful, with many elements\nredundant and distracting.\nThis wish to reunite with his loved ones grows\nmore selfish and violent as the record progresses,\nculminating during \u2018house settling\u2019 \u2013 a key moment\non the album narratively. The crippling inability to\ninteract with the world of the living sends the\ncharacter into a series of desperate attempts to\nbe noticed. The creaks that he generates through\nwalkingaroundhischildhoodhousearedismissed\nas \u201chouse settling\u201d \u2013 a way to \u201crationalise his\npresence away\u201d in the character\u2019s eyes. Finally,\nthe anguish completely paralyses his judgement,\nand he decides to leak carbon monoxide into the\nhouse, hoping to forcefully suck his family into\nthe afterlife. The craziest thing about the song is\nthat the murderous act is not simply narrated by\nthe character. Instead, we are blessed with a super\ntight guest verse from Danny Brown who raps\nfrom the perspective of carbon monoxide gas\nitself \u2013 a uniquely unhinged creative decision that\nreally should not work as well as it does. Danny\u2019s\nvocals are blood-boilingly aggressive and perfectly\nedited to sound harsh, terrifying and demonic,\nmaking for arguably the best feature I have heard\nallyear.Thefollow-uptrack,\u2018knots\u2019,whilebuilding\non the same intensity set up on \u2018house settling\u2019,\nis a complete sonic detour from the rest, with\nQuadeca once again letting his immense production\ntalent explore previously uncharted territories. The\nsong is noisy, dark, disorienting and immensely\nclaustrophobic, with many people drawing parallels to\nDeath Grips \u2013 a comparison that is normally used a bit\ntoo liberally, but nonetheless feels apt in this instance.\nI love everything about the track and, albeit it may be\nan unusual inclusion in the flow of the record, I\u2019m glad\nthat Quad is not shying away from using all the sonics\nin his arsenal to communicate how painfully lonely\nthis inbetween space is.\nThis is where the record enters a really strong finish,\nwith the tempo and aggression being turned down\nonce more in favour of some more nostalgic and\nsorrowful melodies. The sadness and pain exuded on\n\u2018fantasyworld\u2019 is unparalleled and has made me tear\nup on multiple occasions, which is not something I\nexperience often with music. At the core of the track\nis a rather simple piano melody that\nalmost feels composed by an amateur\nkid playing the instrument for the first\ntime. The production layers that slowly\nget introduced over Quad\u2019s despondent\nvocalsarecompletelyoverwhelmingand\nheart-wrenching, building towards a\ndistorted climax that manages to retain\nthe same level of immense hopelessness\nand sadness in spite of the added\nabrasiveness. \u2018fractions of infinity\u2019 is more straightforwardly pretty, with one of the sweetest melodies\non the album and a fantastic feature by the Sunday\nService Choir that bring an angelic, heavenly\nquality to the track. The closer, \u2018cassini\u2019s division\u2019,\nends the character\u2019s journey on a strong note,\nand is the only track on the album that induced\nreal feelings of fear inside me. The spoken word\npassages delivered through tears, laced with\nchilling, alien-sounding vocal samples\nand a relentlessly repeating melody\nthat functions almost like a timer for\nhis eventual entry into nothingness,\nmakethesongatrulydiscomforting\nexperience. Moreover, the track\nends in a featureless sea of static,\ncommunicating the character\u2019s\ndisappearance into the void in a\nreally creative manner.\nAll things considered, I\nDidn\u2019t Mean To Haunt You is\na stunningly beautiful, personal,\nheart-wrenching and painful\njourney I wish I could experience\nagain for the first time. I have very\nfew gripes with this record, with\nthe extent of my criticisms being\nthat Ben\u2019s grand ambitions will\nvery occasionally lead him into\nexperimentation that feels a\nbit too overwhelming and\nconfusing, to the point\nwhere I feel lost, and the\nemotion doesn\u2019t come\nthrough as effectively as I\u2019d like it to. Nonetheless,\na lot of moments that initially struck me in this way\n(like \u2018cassini\u2019s division\u2019) have grown on me big time,\nand there\u2019s honestly very little material on this record\nthat I\u2019m not utterly enamoured with. Ben has proven\nhimselfasanincrediblyskilledproducerandstoryteller,\nshowingusthatheismuchmorecapableandartistically\ngifted than your average YouTube rapper.

This is not an\nentirelytruestatement.Tosomeextent,\ngroups of young people have gathered\ntogether, and have demostrated\nsome resolve around issues that\nthey feel strongly about.\nOn the whole face of it\nall, it does seem that many\n\u201cordinary\u201d people are\nno longer engaged in the\nissues that affect society,\nand are content to simply\ngo about their daily\nlives without giving\nmuch thought\nto the broader\ni m p l i c a t i o n s\nof their actions.\nPerhaps this is not an\nentirely new trend - a previous\nEditor has already spoken about\nthis, and the Overton window.\nThe Overton window is described\nas the range of political policies that\nthe \u201cmainstream\u201d, or that \u201cordinary\u201d\npeople reasonably accept . Think\nof it like the boundary of satire\nbeing \u201ctoo real\u201d to be unbelievable.\nI don\u2019t think having three Prime\nMinisters a year is something that\nwouldhavebeenacceptableintheyears\nbefore the pandemic. However, I don\u2019t\nthink ordinary people can be blamed\nfor being able to accept ridiculous\nsituations as factually as we do now.\nOur current generation has lived\nthrough a few historical events. A\npandemic comes to mind, alongside a\nseries of continuous years of record-breaking temperatures. London has\nseen increased terror threats, and I\ndon\u2019t think we\u2019ve used humour to\npoke fun at potential \u201cWorld War III\u201d\nsituations as much as we do currently.\nOne possible explanation that has\nbeen given for this trend is the sheer\namountofinformationthatisavailable\nto us. Alongside this, we also have to\ndeal with a decrease in concentration\nspans. Social media has succeeded in\nacclimatising us to the 24-hour news\ncycle,somuchsothatacontinuationof\na previous news story just seems bland.\nWe end up scouring international\nmedia for new and different news.\nBeing informed is one thing, but\noverloading ourselves with more\ninformation than we can handle is\ndetrimental. It results\nin becoming more\ndesentised to what\nmatters, making us\ngreat at knowing the\nheadlines but terrible\nat allowing us to\nponder the deeper\nresults or outcomes\nof a situation.\nAnother factor that\ncontributes to apathy\namongst \u201cordinary\u201d people\nis the feeling of powerlessness.\nIt is infinitely easier to say that\nmaking a decision on where we stand\non a complex issue is too hard, and\nthat we should leave it to experts. As\nwe might have figured out, experts,\nthough having large amounts of data,\ncan only make educated predictions.\nDuring lockdown, we had to take a\nstepback,andweturnedtotheinternet\nto entertain us.

However, a turn of events resulted\nin a final score of 6 \u20132 to Imperial.\nThe match began with two singles\ngames. These were neck and neck until\nthe final points, with both Imperial players winning\ntheir first\nset by a few\npoints to 21.\nOur second\nsingles play-er, Gavin,\nthen pushed\nhardthrough\nhis second\ngame, winning 21 \u2013 9.\nMeanwhile,\nhowever, the game between our first\nsingles player, Chonghui, and Portsmouth\u2019s first seed was so close that it\nwent to a third set. During the intense\nmatch, Chonghui slipped just after\nlunging to the front of the court and\nthe sudden movement caused a painful\ncalf cramp which left him lying on the court. Thankfully,\na few stretches and good spray\nof deep freeze put him back\non his feet and he was able to\nfinish the third game. He recovered impressively and the\ngame came close yet again but\nthe win was eventually secured\nby Portsmouth.\nNext were the doubles\ngames.

By\ncommunicating\neffectively with\neach other, finding weaknesses\nand giving advice,\nthey made an impressive comeback, winning their second and third sets. It was a\ngreat game to watch, as in each set they\nperformed better than in the previous.\nUnfortunately for Portsmouth, the\nfinal two remaining doubles games were\nforfeited as one of their doubles players\ninjured themselves during the opening\npoints of the game. After going for a\njump-smash, the player had landed on\nthe outer edge of his foot, causing him\nto roll over the ankle and fall.

However, our team pulled together and worked as a cohesive unit to\novercome the adversity. We were able to\nadjust our strategy and make the most of\nthe situation.

This isn\u2019t a new watch for me, as I\u2019ve seen it\na couple times before, but I continue to be impressed\nat its accessibility. The film follows three firms Scion\nCapital, FrontPoint Partners (with Deutsche Bank),\nand Brownfield Capital, (based on Cornwall Capital),\nall of which had employees who played a part in shorting a load of subprime bonds that had been loaned by\nbanks over many years, putting in motion what would\nbecome the full-blown financial crisis. I\u2019ll leave it to\nthe movie itself to explain further, but it features another all-star cast, with Steve Carell, Christian Bale,\nRyan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Jeremy Strong leading\nthe pack. Margot Robbie, chef Anthony Bourdain,\nSelena Gomez, and economist Richard Thaler are\nbrought in as helpful extras to explain such financial\nterms as CDOs, bond shorting, and subprime loans.\nName-dropping aside, it\u2019s a really great reference for\nthe general events of the crisis and what it meant for\nthe people who were involved in exposing it, those who\nhad taken out the subprime loans and mortgages, and\nthelaid-offemployeesofbanksthatwentbankrupt.It\u2019s\nalso just an entertaining film in itself, to see the interactions between characters as they strategise their way\nthrough the situation.\nJoy\nIwouldreallyrecommendJoytoanyoneandeveryone;\nit\u2019s one of my favourite films ever, starring one of my\nfavourite actresses, and I\u2019ve seen it countless times. Jennifer Lawrence embodies the title role of Joy Mangano,\na down-on-her-luck airline reservations desk manager,\nmother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, ex-wife, and\nuntapped designer and inventor. Mangano, through\nsheer force of will, carved out a path for herself to the\nforefront of her industry (developing innovative products and selling them through telemarketing). If you\u2019re\nlooking for instant motivation to pursue your dreams,\nthis is the movie to watch. It brings a little magic to\neveryday life in the form of Joy\u2019s wit and spark and desire to create, even in the face of her parents\u2019 divorce\n(Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen), her half-sister\u2019senvy(ElisabethR\u00f6hm),andamyriadofotherfamily issues. Her eventual success comes on the shoulders\nof her grandmother (Diane Ladd), ex-husband (\u00c9dgar\nRamirez), best friend (Dascha Polanco), and benefactor Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper). Lawrence and\nCooper have a wonderful chemistry on screen, which\ncan also be seen in the films Silver Linings Playbook\nand American Hustle, and always serves to elevate the\nstory being told. The movie itself emphasises that every\nrelationship we have is complex; that it\u2019s vital to follow\nyour heart even when those close to you don\u2019t believe\nin it, but that the same people who sometimes weigh\nus down can be our supporters and protectors when\nthey\u2019re most needed to be. It\u2019s the perfect mixture of\nnostalgic, emotional, comedic, and uplifting to infuse\na lazy, rainy weekend afternoon with some joy.\nFELIX\nWANTS\nYOU\nFuture Makers of Film\nFilm Editor Mike Buzadji\nTakeaways from UWE student film screening\nFilm Event\nOn January 17th I got an opportunity to sneak\ninto a screening of 20 short documentary films\nby students of UWE Bristol. As part of their curric-ulum, groups presented what they had been working\non for a couple of months. Pitching the idea, getting\nequipment, even raising funds and requesting a variety of permissions - it was a long journey and an amazing experience of a complete filmmaking pipeline.\nIt was interesting to see how diverse all the documentaries were. Topics ranged from local infrastructure and community to economic and political issues\nin the world. Although some of the films presented\ncontroversial opinions/ideas, none of them were expressively forcing themselves onto viewers. All the\nstudents managed to promote healthy and reasonable positions in a variety of subjects. A few of my top\npicks were: \u201cForget me not\u201d - about dementia and the\nsociety built around it, \u201cArt of Protests\u201d - about the\nart involved in the making of protests, \u201cChildren of\nUkraine\u201d - about the war and how it affected families\nand their children and \u201c243 Nights\u201d - about local DJ\nDerek\u2019s death, and his closest friends and community.\nSeeing so many exceptional films raising such important awareness for our society was inspiring, regardless\nof technical or other flaws. I believe the future of the\nfilm industry is in great hands with the new upcoming\ngeneration. If any of these do get published, don\u2019t miss\nthe opportunity to enjoy them.\nFor more details contact film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Mark Zuckerberg has longed been\nribbed by internet trolls for his\nrobotic actions and dull pallor, but until recently one\nrelatively unchallenged aspect of his work was \u2013 well \u2013\nthat. His story is one we\u2019ve all heard at least once before\nby now: starting in a college dorm, the former Harvard\nstudent slowly built up a social media empire that still\ndominates the space today with headline platforms\nlike Instagram and Facebook. But now, Zuckerberg\nhas turned his attention to what he thinks is the next\nfrontier: the metaverse.\nBut before we progress: what is the metaverse? The\nword is so generalised that it\u2019s difficult to pin down.\nThat being said, it appears most metaverse products fit\ninto one of a few categories: first, physical virtual reality\nitems such as headsets like Meta\u2019s own Quest 2, which\nallow access to virtual 3D worlds by putting on a large\nmask with screens inside and integrated speakers.\nSecond, there is the virtual item category, broadly\nencompassing non-tangible products such as the\ninfamous plot of land in the metaverse, or fancy\nclothing for avatars. Products like this have existed in\ngames for years: in 2006 video game publisher Bethesda\ngained criticism for releasing a cosmetic pack of horse\narmour on Xbox, the start of in-game cosmetic sales\nand microtransactions. Some recent iterations of this\nidea are NFT-ised, promising purchasers\u2019 exclusive\nownership. Well-known brands such as Ralph Lauren\nand Nike have recently released products in this\ncategory, albeit primarily to boost engagement for\nyounger audiences.\nThe last main branch of the metaverse umbrella is\naugmented reality, a technology that overlays the real\nworld with displays, much like the smart glasses of\nMarvel superhero films.\nBack to Mark. The Facebook founder believes in\nthe concept of the metaverse so much that last year he\nrenamed his company after it, to Meta. It was a bold\nmove that signalled his intentions to further explore the\nfield, but since then it is one that has failed to capture\nthe imagination of investors. After $15bn spent on the\nrebranding(withanother$85bnonR&D)andlessthan\n200,000 users of Meta\u2019s flagship metaverse program\nHorizon Worlds, a shareholder who owns 0.1% of Meta\nstock penned an open letter to the company telling\nthem to drop investment in the area to $5bn. Instead,\nZuckerberg defiantly plans to increase metaverse-related capital expenditure next year, facilitated by the\nCEO\u2019s 54% control of the voting shares that make his\ndecisions all but impossible to challenge.\nIn no small part down to weak global economic\ngrowth and industry headwinds that have jeopardised\nthe consistently high growth of the technology sector,\nMeta\u2019s stock has fallen over 60% in 2022, wiping over\n$500bn off its market cap. Low advertising earnings\nexpectations due to inflationary pressures, Tiktok\u2019s\nmeteoric rise, and Apple reworking its advertising\nsystem have wreaked havoc in big tech, triggering a wave\nof job and cost cuts as bullish predictions coming out\nof the pandemic fade away. In this context, the heavy\nmetaverse spending, already seen as controversial, is\nconsidered a critical issue as investors worry that the\nstrategy focusses too much on the future, and not what\nwill pay the bills now. Part of the stock plunge was due\nto the company reporting a second successive drop in\nquarterly revenue, but more pertinently, forecasts that\nthese drops would continue.\nSo, it\u2019s a big gamble, but Zuckerberg has had\nhis doubters before. Some newspapers called the\ninternet a \u2018fad\u2019 at its conception, yet the present day is\nunimaginable without it. Social media has evolved from\nprimarily text-based platforms such as twitter, to image-based like Instagram, and now videos as with Tiktok.\nMeta argues \u2018immersive experiences\u2019 are the next leap.\nYet I remain unconvinced by the two more current\nmetaverse products: VR headsets and in-world items.\nWhy? Amongst a variety of factors, the paradigm shift\nrequired seems huge: it took a global pandemic for\ncompanies to consider remote working, and even now\nonly 30% of the UK workforce is still working remotely\nat least once a week. Headsets are pushed as the next\ndevices to replace phones or laptops, but revamping\nexisting IT infrastructure to accommodate them would\nbe new and therefore cumbersome and, outside of\nmeetings, currently has minimal use cases. Meanwhile,\nthe price for individuals to buy headsets remains large,\nappealing only to highly keen consumers. Meta says we\nare looking for increased immersion and the better the\ntech gets, the more people will become interested. But\nsmartphones have proliferated and yet are arguably less\nimmersive than a large PC. Games consoles like the\nPS5 are advanced and brilliant, but most people aren\u2019t\ninterested: global installation numbers sit flat around\n175m.\nThe key to the venture\u2019s success sits in convincing\neveryday people of the added value in an age where\neveryone already needs multiple devices just to work.\nMost potently, like social media, people will only use\nit if others are on there first, and like cryptocurrencies,\ndigital assets within these virtual worlds only have\nvalue if many people deem it so or they have a physical\ncounterpart. Headsets will get smaller, cheaper, and\nmore sophisticated in the years to come, what stands to\nbe seen is whether Zuckerberg can obtain this critical\nmass of users. He has done it before with nothing to\nlose, but this time his billion-dollar empire hangs in the\nbalance: if he fails, this year\u2019s 60% drop might just be\nthe beginning.\nBefore the internet became a necessity for individuals\naround the world, there were many skeptics of its\npotential, some even calling it a fad. Now, over 20\nyears later, we seem to be having the same debate over\nthe metaverse\u2019s many technologies, a debate in which\nthe world\u2019s largest social network has made clear their\nstance.\nAlexander Themistocleous\nInvestment Society Writer\nMeta and the Metaverse: Fad, or the Future?\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Harry Schlote\nInvestment\nic.investmentsociety ic.investmentsociety\nic\u2013investment\nADD OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR THE LATEST EVENTS, NEW & OPPORTUNITIES\nA true METAmorphosis\n\n"

    "content": "ClearlyFridaythe13thisknownasan\nunlucky day for good reasons. The\nfirst of 2023 saw the unveiling of a new\nsculpture in Boston, titled \u2018Embrace\u2019,\ncommemorating the relationship\nbetween Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n(MLK) and Coretta Scott King, ahead\nof MLK\u2019s birthday on January 15th.\nWhile MLK is one of the most\ncommon subjects of commemorative\nstatues in the USA, Coretta\u2019s depiction\nis more of a rarity. It is not the first statue\nof the two, as I have seen claimed in one\narticle; Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania is\nhome to a sculpture from 2011 showing\nthe husband and wife marching together\nin their struggle for civil rights. The\nLehighValleystatueismoremodest,both\ninsizeandquality,andtherecentBoston\ninstallation has the honour of inhabiting\nthecitywherethecoupleinquestionmet.\nHowever, the artist behind \u2018Embrace\u2019,\nHank Willis Thomas, decided to\ntake a more abstract approach to the\nsubject, and has received somewhat of\na backlash reminiscent in nature to the\njustified reactions we at Imperial had\nupon seeing for the first time Antony\nGormley\u2019s \u2018Alert\u2019 statue. I would like\nto add my voice to the criticisms.\nWith no context, \u2018Embrace\u2019 is an\nodd melding of two people\u2019s arms.\nTheir faces, bodies, and any identifying\nfeatures beyond their sleeves are\nmissing, and they are of gargantuan\nproportions, lending the piece the aura\nof a dreamlike fantasy creature. With\nthe benefit of context, \u2018Embrace\u2019 is a\nsad joke. A tribute to two icons with no\nobvious resemblance to its subjects, and\na jarring excess of material and resources\nwhen contrasted with their legacies.\nIt is inspired by a candid photo of the\npair embracing after MLK\u2019s Nobel Prize\nvictory, though the absence of bodies\nhas also rendered the hug itself absent.\nIt\u2019s said that a hug brings two people\u2019s\nbeating hearts into contact; how ironic\nthen for the sculptor to effectively excise\nthe hearts. This on top of the more\negregiouscrimeofleavingouttheirfaces,\nthus almost eliminating their identities.\nOr, more correctly, replacing their\nidentities. For \u2018Embrace\u2019 does clearly\nhave the imprint of a certain person:\nHank Willis Thomas. Some of his most\nmemorable sculptures focus heavily on\nhands(seehisexcellent\u2018AllThingsBeing\nEqual\u2026\u2019exhibit),andthatmotifisclearly\npresent in \u2018Embrace\u2019. Because of this I\nlevel the same criticism that I directed\ntowards Antony Gormley\u2019s Alan Turing\nstatue. Rather than \u2018Embrace\u2019 being a\npiece showing the Kings in an intimate\nmoment, it is an installation in the\nHank Willis Thomas line inspired by\nthe Kings. MLK and Coretta are not\nreally the subjects, Thomas is. I must\nspecify that in the context of a Thomas\nexhibit, this kind of piece does highlight\nthe Kings because Thomas becomes\nthe background subject and the Kings\nbecome the subject unique from the\nother sculptures. In a public park,\nhowever, such a striking installation is\ndefined first and foremost by Thomas\u2019\nstyle, and the Kings become a sort of\nsecondary identifier. How this does\nnot constitute a tremendous insult\nto MLK and Coretta to everyone\ninvolved in its commission, baffles me.\nIt should also not be assumed that an\neffort to produce a realistic likeness will\ndefinitely yield a better result. A large\nbust of MLK in Buffalo, New York, is\npatentlynotMLK,afactunconvincingly\nclaimed to be intentional as an abstract\nrepresentation of the general civil rights\nmovement. While I\u2019m sure sculptors\nproduced their fair share of duds in the\ngolden age of statues and those simply\nhaven\u2019t been preserved, it certainly\nfeels like the overall\nquality has lowered\nover the ages. It is odd\nthat art is one of the\nfields that is allowed\nby the market to not\nclearly have improved\nin skill in6 a linear\nmanner. Cars nowadays\nare expected to be\nand succeed in being\nfaster, safer, and more\ncomfortable than cars 50 years ago.\nWhy then do we foment the existence\nof statues less evocative of real people\nthan those produced 500 years ago?\nAbstract art has its place, but it\u2019s\ntime we isolate the field of objective\nrepresentation artwork and consult the\ntradespeople of that field whenever we\nneed to install something in honour of\nreal people for the general public. Most\nof us are far more inspired by bodies\nwith faces than amorphous geometry\nand weird limbs, and we certainly have\nsurpluses of objectively good statues\nfor all the conventional white figures\nof history. A pity the enfranchisement\nof everyone else appears to be\ncoinciding with the dominance\nof alienating abstract sculpture.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n6 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWhen will art move on?\nNicolas Geiseler-Toran\nSelf Proclaimed Statue Critic\nComment\nMLK AND CORETTA\nARE NOT REALLY\nTHE SUBJECTS,\nTHOMAS IS\n\u201c A heart?!

Real life aside,\nKing Richard follows Richard Williams as he coaches his two tennis-loving daughters towards greatness.\nWill Smith plays the character with intensity, allowing\nus to feel his frustration at the societal barriers he en-counters, as well as his pride at watching them flourish in competition. We are also taken back to the 90\u2019s,\nwhen Venus (Saniyya Sidney) began to play professional tennis, with the help of free additional coaching\nfrom Rick Macci (Jon Bernthal), assertively acquired\nby her father. Serena made her debut soon after Venus did, and the film shines a light on just how much\nof her success comes from her own passion and drive\nto participate in competitions. It is also evident that\nwhile Macci\u2019s training rounded the sisters out, it was\ntheir parents\u2019 continual guidance and sisters\u2019 support\nthat carried them through to greatness. Tennis being\na largely middle to upper class sport \u2013 due to the need\nfor rackets, balls, courts, and often an expensive coach,\nit is hard to believe that the Williams sisters didn\u2019t\ncome from privilege, and incredible to witness the way\nRichard Williams carved out their new life and strove\nto provide them with every opportunity he possibly\ncould.\nFighting with my Family\nThe theme of sports seems to be a popular choice for\nbiographical films.

There is no\nbetter manifestation of these elements than in Fighting with my Family, the story of professional wrestler\nSaraya Jade Bevis, or \u2018Paige\u2019 (Florence Pugh). Paige\ncomes from a family of wrestlers who perform together\nto make a living, but faced a challenge when she was\ndrafted into the WWE competition and her brother\nZak \u2018Zodiac\u2019 (Jack Lowden) wasn\u2019t.

Among these were a few biographical films,\nwhich dramatise the extraordinary lives of real people,\nand are some of the most amazing cinematic works out\nthere. The seven films I\u2019ll discuss shed light on occasions when societal adversity was overcome to make\nway for radical change and a new normal. Perseverance, in its many forms, runs through all these tales,\nwhich have each succeeded on the silver screen due to\ntheir capacity to inspire us.\nLion\nI had been meaning to watch Lion for years, ever since\nit was nominated for an Oscar in 2017. The movie tells\nthe story of Saroo Brierley (played by Dev Patel), separated from his family at a young age and adopted by\na couple from Tasmania. Detailing Saroo\u2019s trying experience of searching for his hometown, and his eventual\nreunification with his birth family, Lion is a beautiful\nfilm, with superb casting. Watching it without knowledge of the underlying story, you would be forgiven for\nthinking it was fiction. It\u2019s incredible to imagine the\nresolve the young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) must have had\nto survive alone on the streets of Calcutta (now named\nKolkata). Of course, there is a certain dramatic flair\nadded to make it \u2018marketable\u2019, such as in adult Saroo\u2019s\nvisions of his older brother, but the tale is rich in emotion and intrigue, even without these effects. It is also\ntouching to see the relationships and support system\nthat Saroo has built around him; his adoptive family\n(Nicole Kidman, David Wenham, Divian Ladwa), and\ngirlfriend from university (Rooney Mara). The all-star\ncast is the heart of the film \u2013 Pawar and Patel in particular bring gentle, adventurous life to the character\nof Saroo (Patel was nominated for Best Supporting Actor). It is an impressive film, with shocking and lovely\ncinematography, and I highly recommend it!\nMoneyball\nBrad Pitt stars as former baseball player Billy Beane\nin this drama about the Oakland Athletics baseball\nteam\u2019s reshuffle, using an algorithm to find the cheapest underrated players on the market. What struck me\nthe most about Moneyball was how it showed the humanity behind a seemingly disconnected technique of\nchoosing and training players for a sports team. Despite the initial difficulties of scraping together a ragtag\nteam of players, Beane and his team ultimately managed support the Athletics (A\u2019s) through rising up from\nthe bottom of the league to winning 20 games straight\nin 2002. Beane\u2019s relationship with his daughter, who\nlives with her mother, makes the film extra special, as it\npresents her as a source of support and encouragement\nfor him, even while he is not always physically with her.\nShowing a mix of real and curated footage, it is interesting to see the connections between the players on\nthe field and what happens behind the scenes.\nThe Swimmers\nRefugee migration is a \u2018difficult\u2019 topic for most people to discuss, due to misinformation, emotions, personal experiences or trauma, and countless other fac-tors. But the story of Syrian sisters Sarah and Yusra\nMardini (Manal and Nathalie Issa) is portrayed plainly\nand poignantly in Sally El Hosaini\u2019s film The Swimmers. Yusra Mardini formed part of the first Refugee\nOlympic Team as \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a freestyle and\nbutterfly swimmer, competing in the Rio 2016 Olympics.

This is something NegaFelix cannot\nyet agree to.\nThe final straw was when a satirical piece in August on how the then-new\nHealth Secretary could possibly do a\nworse job than their predecessor was outdone by the News section.

The path to\nthe role for her was unexpected \u2013 in her\nfirst year at Imperial, Kia was unaware of\nthe organization, but by her second year,\nshewasalreadyaVicePresident.Shehad\nhoped to have a more passive role this\nyear, holding the role of CGCU Bolt\nBearer. All this would change, however,\nafter the resignation of Barry Jiang,\nelected as President of the CGCU in\nMarch 2022. He resigned from the role\nafter a Vote of No Confidence motion\nwas brought against him (see Felix\n1811). His resignation triggered a by-electiontoelectanewCGCUPresident.\n\u201cA lot of the CGCU committee\nmembers were quite like, \u2018Well, you\nknow, we\u2019d rather have you\u2019\u201d, Kia tells\nme when I ask why she ran, \u201c\u2018as someone\nwho we know, someone who we\u2019ve\nworked with for this length of time\u2019\u201d\nAnd yet, despite this, it wasn\u2019t easy: five\ncandidates ran, and by Kia\u2019s own words\nall of them had the credentials to do the\njob. The result was an intense campaign\n\u2013 multiple candidates, including Kia,\ntooktoInstagramtoshareendorsements\nfrom fellow CGCU members on official\ncampaign accounts. Kia\u2019s dog Cookie\nmade a return to the campaign trail,\nendorsing \u2013 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2013\nKia. Cookie has previously endorsed\na candidate in the 2022 Leadership\nElections for \u2018providing treats\u2019. \u201cI hope\nno one\u2019s voting for me based on my dog\u201d,\nKia joked.\nNow, a common complaint by busy\nImperial students is finding time to\nrelax. So, how does Kia relax after a long\nweek managing multiple roles? Having\nthe aforementioned dog for one helps\n\u2013 going on walks with it every day is\nher main method of destressing. She\nalso emphasises that she finds her role\nenjoyable and doesn\u2019t consider it added\nstress.\nAs for making sure that her\ncommittee gets a break, she explains\nthat it\u2019s quite easy to ensure people\naren\u2019t working during exam periods due\nto their varied schedules. She tells me\nthat their internal training pages state\nthat members\u2019 degrees come first. Kia\nalso raises the importance of cross-team\ncommunication: \u201cPeople are very open\nabout, \u2018Okay, I won\u2019t be able to do any\nwork now, but I can do the work at this\ntime. This is when I\u2019m free. What can I\ndo then?\u2019\u201d\nFor committee communications ,\nshe admits their current use of many\nWhatsApp groups and Teams chats\nwas \u201cpossibly not the most amazing\nway of organizing\u201d. One specialised\ntool: Nuclino. This is used as a checklist\nfor repeated events and organisation\nactivities, such as the Welcome Dinner.\nOn the topic of such events, Kia tells\nme that the CGCU alumni has a lot of\nyounger experienced members who she\ncanaskforhelp\u2013\u201cIwasactuallyworking\nwith someone who was a previous\nCGCU president over summer\u201d she\ninforms me. Furthermore, Kia was able\nto draw on the experiences of Hayley\nWong [former CGCU President,\nnow Union President] and Allan Lee\n[CGCU Treasurer, 2020-2022], who\nadvised her when she helped organise\nthis year\u2019s Welcome Dinner.\nNow, what of Kia\u2019s manifesto\ncommitments?\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to spoil too much\u201d\nshe responds when asked about her\npromise of more events. Nevertheless,\nI still managed to get some teasers\n\u2013 namely an event like last year\u2019s TriUnion extravaganza is in the works,\nwith hints the medics could be involved\nas well. Previously this involved taking\nstudents from the City and Guilds,\nRoyal Science and Royal School of\nMines Student Union to Cirque Le Soir,\na circus themed nightclub in London\n\u2013 it remains to be seen what this year\u2019s\nmight involve. There is also the return of\nevents the CGCU used to hold before\nCOVID\u2013shehas \u201cbeenincontactwith\nsome alumni who were involved in their\ntime [at Imperial]\u201d, perhaps bringing\nback the week of activities known as\n\u201cCity and Guilds Week\u201d. Such events\nrequire funding via sponsorships \u2013 Kia\nexplained this could prove difficult, as\ncompanies are finding it harder to justify\nsponsorship in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis and general price squeeze.\nKia also talked about helping\nsocieties grow their alumni relations\nin her manifesto, and this is already\nsomething she has made strides in.\nDoCSoc recently launched a new\nalumni mentoring programme to allow\nstudents to meet computing alumni\nfromdifferentfields.Kiainformsmethis\n\u201cwas actually something that myself and\nthe [DoCSoc] president set up\u201d with\nthe help of the City and Guilds College\nAssociation (CGCA), essentially the\nalumni group for the CGCU:\n\u201cWe got in touch with people via the\nCGCA [\u2026]\u201d Kia explains, \u201cmade them\npass the message around, so I think if we\ncould kind of establish something like\n[DoCSoc mentoring] in a wider range\nof departments, we do really want to\npush for that.\u201d\nKia also promised in her manifesto to\n\u201cEstablishsponsorshipfortheCGCUto\nincrease funding\u201d. Asked about this she\nexplains they were working on \u201cgetting\na sponsor proposal ready\u201d to send out,\nwith a few different possible approaches\nbeing taken.\nAs we reach the end of the interview,\nI ask if she has any advice for anyone\nlooking to get involved with the\nCGCU: \u201cThe office door is always open.\nSo CAGB350, if someone is in there\nthey\u2019ll definitely let you in and have\na conversation with you about their\nexperience.\u201d As for whether the CGCU\nhadanyplanstostealtheRCSU\u2019sMascot\n\u201cTheta\u201d \u2013 Kia mentions that the CGCU\nhad already made off with it at the start\nof the Autumn term.

    "content": "Brockhampton was a staple of my teenage years;\nlike Kevin Abstract, I also consider it to be the\n\u2018best boy band since One Direction\u2019 (1:01, \u2018BOOGIE\u2019 of SATURATION III). The Brockhampton that\nwe all know today came into fruition in 2010, when\n14-year-old Kevin Abstract made a post on the KanyeToThe forum titled \u2018Anyone wanna make a band?\u2019. Arguably, they did not come into the public eye until the\nrelease of their first studio album SATURATION in\n2017 and rose in prominence through the progression\nof the SATURATION series.\nPersonally, my favorite album is GINGER, with \u2018ST.\nPERCY\u2019 and \u2018BOY BYE\u2019 dominating my 2019 Spotify\nWrapped. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is\nthat makes their music so magnetic. Maybe it comes\nfrom the dramatically melancholic memories 17-year-old me associated Brockhampton with, or maybe it\u2019s\ntheir entirely unique sound being a concoction of each\nmember\u2019s idiosyncratic taste. United by the members\u2019\nlove of early 2000s hiphop, they venture together into\ngenres like alt rock, R&B, soul, and the occasional\nballad (think Lupe Fiasco\u2019s \u2018Kick, Push\u2019 or Jay-Z\u2019s\n\u20184:44\u2019). It became increasingly difficult to define the\ngenre of their music because each track sounds like\nit\u2019s independently produced by another artist, but you\njust can\u2019t quite pinpoint who. That\u2019s what makes them\nso special. Of course, each member is in a league of\ntheir own in terms of production and vocal; but when\nthey come together, the product of their collective is\nmuch greater than the sum of its parts and unrivaled\nby many.\nThe band announced an indefinite hiatus at the\nbeginning of 2022 and delivered the bad news with\na treat to help ease the pain. Their final studio album\nThe Family was meant as a parting gift for the fans, but\nthey announced the release of TM, an extra studio\nalbum, on the same day. I consider The Family as their\ntrue final album, but not as an attempt to undermine\nTM. It\u2019s laced with the producer Matt Champion\u2019s\nsignaturenonchalance;it\u2019seasytolistento.TheFamily,\non the other hand, feels like Kevin Abstract welded a\nblade out of his emotions and stabbed you in the thigh\nwith it. The man really poured his entire soul and\nbody into the album. He reflects on his relationships\nwith his mother, his friends, the band members, and\nthe band as a collective. The final track, appropriately\ntitled \u2018Brockhampton\u2019, fires one hard-hitting confession\nafter the other, \u201cMe and Jabari had a fight that changed\nour relationship / When you yelling at your brothers,\nit gets dangerous / I don\u2019t think our love\u2019s ever been\nthe same since,\u201d and \u201cHonestly there were issues before\nROADRUNNER / iridescence I wasn\u2019t really there\nfor my brothers / Barely present, more focused on bad\nrelationships\u201d. Backed by a slow-temple strings, it is a\nreal tearjerker.\nFollowingthereleaseofthealbum,Abstractreleased\nthis statement, \u201cAs most of us did, I shut down once I\nhit middle school, I was afraid to be vulnerable with\nmy mom. I remember not feeling good enough for\nmy dad. I remember pretending to be somebody new\ndepending on who I was around. I used to wanna be\nan actor, my 14-year-old self was in pain. I was lost.\nTrapped. And so I dreamt. For reasons similar, but\nunique, everyone in this group dreamt too.\u201d He called\nback to that original post on the Kanye forum as an\nolive branch, an attempt to pull himself up from the\ngutters of his teenage years. When the band has been\nthe mental rock for the better part of one\u2019s life, it is\ndifficult to let go. But the members seem to have made\npeace with the disbandment, one cheeky tweet at a\ntime. I, however, have not, so I will be sulking for some\ntime.\n20 Music.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Joe Riordan\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nMusic\nDon\u2019t Miss the Gig\nRCSU LiveMusicShowcase@\nMETRIC,9th February\nFor only \u00a33, come see what Imperial\u2019s\nhottest new bands have on offer.

Please text FROZENTEETZ to\nnumber above!\nLast weekend, ICHack organisers conducted a pre-hack hack to pre-empt\npotential problems at the actual ICHack in February. They were left holding the bag when they realised that - contrary to popular Computing belief,\nthe matra \u201cproduction is the test\u201d does not work well in real life.\nAdditionally, \u201cblame it on the legacy code\u201d also did not work, as the code\nin question was written by the lead programmer last week. \u201cI wrote that at\n3am after a week of not sleeping! You cannot hold me accountable for this\u201d,\nclaimed said ICHack Web Magician, Tim \u201cMan with the hands\u201d Java (@\nTopsyTurvy on GitHub, FAANG, hit me up!).\nNegaFelix received a tip-off that some ICHack groups are about to create\nweb applications with \u201creal use in real time\u201d, a rumour that ICHack whis-tleblower KS denies strongly. \u201cLook, we get students and sponsors in the\nsame room over the weekend, give everyone coffee and sugar, and we really don\u2019t expect anything functioning. The code is never going to look great,\nand it\u2019s not like groups haven\u2019t used Figma to trick the judges\u201d.\nIC Hack attendees are also going to be facing a harder time than usual in\nthis year\u2019s iteration - \u201cIt worked on my computer last night\u201d will no longer\nbe accepted as a valid excuse, alongside other claims like \u201coh maybe you\ndon\u2019t have the right dependencies\u201d, and \u201cWe would like to thank ChatGPT\nfor being a valuable programmer\u201d. That last statement will be grounds for\nautomatic discalculation.\nIC Pre-Hack organisers also seemed to be unaware of reality, saying:\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just rewind the tapes and get ICTV to do some video editing\u201d. NegaFelix felt obliged to inform them that:\n1. ICTV is now a defunct society, and\n2. IC Pre-Hack was not recorded.\n\n"
