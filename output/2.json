    "content": "* & m ED^rO RIAL We were extremely gratified by the reception given to our\nfirst issue; it was, it seems, a success.600 copies were printed and all were sold \"before 10 a.m., and it was reported that some\nsportsmen were offering their copies to the latecomers a t4d, and\nfinding plenty of takers. The cure for any black market is to increase the supply, and so 1000 copies of this issue will be\nprinted, and we hope that. this will meet the demand. However, first affairs are.' axiomatically never entirely successful In the light of further \u2022 experience, and we hope steadily to improve, the quality of FELIX with each succeeding i.s aue. Any suggestions. and- criticisms are very welcome, and if you cannot be bothered to put' a note to the Editor in the I.G. Union rack, you probably.know some members\nof the Board, at least by sight, and can mention your suggestions when next you meet.\nIn this Issue we are starting two feature series which we\nhope to continue in each issue. The first is a\" Profile\", a feature copied unblushing ly from a leading Sunday newspaper. In it we shall, present personalities of whom we think you would wish to know\nmore; students past or present, staff, and institutions. We wish to avoid, making this a mere catalogue of Professors and Union\nofficials, and shall strive to give as much variety as possible. For this reason we are starting the series with\" a Profile on the\nUnion bar, for few would deny that this excellent \u2022 institution has\ngreat personality, and few know it in all its varying moods.\nThe second new feature is \"The Drinking Man's Guide to London\"\nThose who do not know London are often beset with the problem of\nwhere to go when they want a drink, for, of the thousands of pubs\nin London, so few are really pleasant. In this series, then, we\nshall introduce you to some of the better hostelries in town, and\ntry to indicate the features of each, the type of person who\nfrequents them, whether they be quiet or convivial, the kind of\nbeer, closing time and so on. We trust that the starting of this series in' the same issue as a\" Profile\" on the bar will nut be\nheld to give it too much of a beer y bias, but the latter is a non-recurring factor and so the bias will be temporary.\nIn our next issue we intend to start an Agony Column in which\nwe shall print any small advertisements you may wish to insert. No\ncharge will be made for this, but the available space will be limited and so we cannot guarantee to print every 'advertisement which may\nbe submitted. To save space, advertisements will be numbered, and\nreplies should be addressed to\" Advertiser No ' Felix\" and\nplaced In. the Union rack. Advertisers must note the number of their advertisement and collect the replies themselves, but they must\nsubmit their names and Colleges to the Editor with their advertisement.\nFor the benefit of those who cannot be sure of buying their FELIX on Friday mornings, we are prepared to reserve a number of\ncopies which may be collected from the bar. Those who wish to have\ntheir copies reserved should give their names to the Editor. Contributions must be in by the Monday preceding the date of\nthe next issue, but it will be appreciated If they are submitted sooner. They should be addressed to The Editor, Felix, I.C. Union.\nContributors must supply their names and colleges with their contribution, though they may write under sio ms de plume if they wish.\n\n"

    "content": "8\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR.\nThe Editor of Felix. Sir,I would like, as Chairman of the I.C. Union Entertainments Committee, to reply to the letter from \" Wallflower\" printed in the last issue of Felix. We agree entirely with the sentiments expressed and while we view with some satisfaction the increase in popularity of the Saturday night \"hops\", we do nevertheless wish to overcome\nas much as possible the overcrowded conditions.1 would assure\nWallflower that much time has been spent recently, both toy my\nCommittee and by the I.C. Union Council, in trying to find a solution. As a result, a different arrangement Is to be tried this term so that the Upper Dining Hall can be available as well as the Gym. during the whole of the evening. At this point, I wish, to make an appeal. The arrangements\nwill not operate satisfactorily unless we have some cooperation from the people attending the \"hops\" . My Committee consists of\nsix people only and with all of them on duty every Saturday night, we have only' just enough people to keep things running. We have no spare persons to station at each door of the Union\nchecking membership cards. Nor have we surplus energy with which to evict uninvited guests either with or without loss of apparel. If Wallflower\", or anyone else, can. find sufficient people willing to stand by all. the doors during the whole of\nevery Saturday evening, then maybe we can carry out the\nsuggestions. I hope we shall find conditions somewhat better with the new arrangements. It's up to the people who attend to help to make them work. If they don't well the next step will have\nto be admission by ticket only with a limited number of tickets and I for one don't want to see that state of affairs brought\nabout. 1\n, /'\nYours etc., R. GILL \u2022\n\u2022\nMy dear Felix, I'm very glad to meet you! As your Editor went to some chivalrous pains to make\nclear I am serenely incapable of having kittens( except perhaps,\nbetween ourselves, around, the time of my flaming publication) so \"no one kai n'tp in nuth in' on me\". Thus, my pleasure on your birthday was strictly avuncular, yetI hope to stand you a pot\n- of milk Felix on your future anniversaries, and many of 'em.\nBelieve me, you're very welcome to t'.P\\ old Man. So welcome\nindeed that I have thought it prudent to arrange with your Editor to get hold of you through, him if your public again mono polis es you completely. It rust to see you wax old and wise, grow into a strong and\nvirtuous but with a l,a. merry Cat . Being yet young you may have\nsome trouble with bits of Dog Latin, but your Editor will translate for yon \" Nili lli gitim us carbo run dum\" Felix! Bless your fur and whiskers. Yours, \"PHOENIX\"\nP.S. You might mention to your Editor that mine is fond of beer. "

    "content": "After each team had scored two goals, and divers descents\nhad been made to retrieve lost balls from the- surrounding canals, we returned to ballot for the order of washing under one cold tap. Eventually arriving at the Societe it in Amsterdam, Taffy Williams settled himself between two of our three teetotallers( shame 1) to\nensure himself of a fair supply of anything that was going. Such\nlow cunning'. Needless to say, this had the desired effect, and\nsoon we were to see Taffy and Don. Bow tell trying to decide who\nscored our other two goals, having baffled completely our opponents\nby repeatedly assuring them that we had won 4-11 Taff' s constitution later stood a heavy meal, but Don. was content to slumber in the\nBilliard' Roam, though later he was resurrected and frequently had\nto be dissuaded from putting his head in the fire. Other members\nof the party toured the nightlife of Amsterdam and returned with enough material to write a Kinsey report I Next morning we travelled to Delft, where again a match was\nto be played the same afternoon. This took place on an excellent ground in the suburbs of The Hague, which was reached by means of\na car evidently constructed before the Industrial Revolution. Of\nthe original18 cylinders only two were said to be in operation, one of these failing fast. This carried9 inside, with seating accommodation for two more on the rear bumper, whilst kit for both teams was carried on the numerous projections outside. Seated in this and driving en the right( but wrong) side of the road, was a somewhat harrowing experience. This game we lost90, to the\nstrongest team put out against us - the 12th man being sent off some minutes after the start'. At least one referee of our party would prefer to forget incidents of this game. The evening was a complete hon kers session(5 p.m.5 a.m.), the highlights being a beer race in m rh ich John Houghton surprised us all with his lightning despatch of half of Pilsen er, and Derek Hand's knowledgeable exposition of the pro's and con's of the married state. As a result, on Friday morning we were all split up because of staggered hours\nof rising, though it is known that some took the opportunity of\nseeing Delft unfortunately Buckroyd was unable to get into motion in any sense of the word, probably due to a surfeit of\nfried eggs. However, the last match was to be at 2.00 and between\n1.45 and 2.15 most of the party gathered on the Delft mudflats for this last encounter. By this time everyone was far from fit for football, and all credit is due to those who played here, some for the third time in4 days. The match was eventually drawn 1-1,\nthough it is said that had Taffy Williams used the right pair of\nhands and caught the right ball when he was suddenly confronted with( he says) 18 multi coloured spheres flashing goal wards, the\ngame might have been saved'. Later to the accompaniment of \"Come on\nthe 10 men and the Captain.\" a very tired Pete. Vessey was spurred to intercept a pigeon moving fast down the left wing. Needless to say he did not catch it1 The evening's entertainment commenced in a local \"pub.\",\ncomplete with dinner and speeches, after which, the Delft version cf the \"Yard\" was introduced. This comprised a glass boot ( s tie f el) of capacity about 5 pints. For emptying this at any stage of its journey round the table, the poor unfortunate preceding the winner\nhad. the doubtful pleasure of paying for are fill. After a token sip by the Dutch President, who started the s tie f el on its journey, Spud Hayter did likewise, thinking it very safe so to do with all but 5 pints still remaining, whereupon a Dutch student seized the\narticle and drained it! This was the hard luck story of the t,; ur.\nThis evening finished comparatively early, at about 4 a.m. Previously arranged, almost all met next morning to visit The Hague for shopping, where Immense quantities of all kinds of\ns ust inen ce, both liquid and solid, were purchased. Due back at\nDelft later in the afternoon, we duly arrived and were taken by\nthe Dutch boys to Rotterdam, where we ended up in a Chinese\nRestaurant for a farewell dinner, which all ate but Arthur Briscoe, who had good reasons of his own for not partaking. From here we\njourneyed back to Rotterdam station, where many disposed of\n\n"

However, by much patience, perseverance and long service, the tale of The Bar, of the Union built around it and the History connected with it have enabled this writer to say: \" I have met\npeople who remember when \"\nQueenie's father, Jim Peacock, was the first barman, standing in as tall outside the present Union building with grass and no\nbuildings in front of him - selling sandwiches, rolls and bottled beer. This was the first College Bar in the Country, and in a few\nyears its place in history was assured by the formation of 4 o lub s closely connected with it and by its firm installation next the\nlavatory. The 21, 22, Chaos & Links Clubs made the Bar a congenial-meeting place, a good talking shop, a place for warriors to return to tell the tale and lick the odd wound (from rag or honest game),\nand of course a place in which to liberate great exuberance - for such is the joyous outcome of bi bulat ion. Such it was made, and such it remains. Ted Smith, joining Jim Peacock in1927( just after I was born), soon became steeped in the great traditions of the place. He tells with obvious joy of\nthe days when women were not allowed in the Union precincts except\nfor the Upoer Entrance Hall any infringements being firmly dealt with by the President of the Union. In 1930 Ted served Lawrence of\nArabia with a mild and bitter, with as little fuss as when he gave\nGeneral Smuts a large whiskey when that Worthy was invested with two\nchains of office in one day (the other at the Guildhall). The Bar is ever changing in character; in half an hour it can change from a quiet place to have s chat, to he most hilariously ear shattering concentration of humanity this side of Wapping. Long\nmay its rafters ring in rousing tuneful song. ' '\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL CLUB.

Following ham and eggs for breakfast at the Hook, where\nsome embarrassment was caused upon encountering a female slot machine to gain entry to the \"Heeren\", we betook ourselves to Amsterdam, and after lunch, to our first encounter with the hutch students. An interesting innovation here was \"he use of canals for touch lines, and. Arthur Briscoe was the agreed representative of\nI.C. for testing the depth of same- he found them knee-deep. The\ngame opened in fine style, at least all but the photograph of the\nkickoff which never materialise d, and after two passes Spud Hayter promptly decided that he had had enough football(22.25 sees.) and\nwas removed to the \" pavilion\", where he slept for the rest of the\ngame, nursing a watered knee.

Much Ado\nAs the curtain fell for the last time, a feeling of great relief filled the cast and lusty voices sang in joyous unison the\n\" Song hit\" of the Play. Make-up was pulled, rubbed and squeezed\noff; crumpled costumes and tin wear were flung aside, and .stage-hands proceeded with gay abandon to clear their hitherto valuable.. sets, aside. In a short time the Society, in mixed but not un respectable attire, was attacking the masses of food; speeches were made, of\nexquisite shortness( Roland Cox said goodbye yet again!) then the\ncast, quaffing good ale, bellowed lustily to the piano playing of\nOld Leonato ( David Greenfield), while the stage hands prepared their one-act farce. By this time almost anything was funny, and\nthis proved to be almost anything. The farce over, individual turns revealed much hidden talent; Bob Gigg sang a fine Cowboy\nsong, despite the fact that he knew few of the words; Spike Briscoe compensated for lack of words by rendering at great speed Gilbert ian words to something resembling Sullivan' s music, and a fine Irish sketch.

The weather\nwas not kind to those optimistic members who had carried ice axes\nall the way from London much to the displeasure of employees of\npublic transport. I trained continuously on all but one of the nine days of the meet.\nThe weather however did not damp the spirits of members who\nset out regularly to climb a particular crag; the weather often thwarted their intentions and they returned wet, hungry but forever cheerful to the hut to start thinking of preparations for supper.\nThe food can be considered as one of the successes of the meet,\nfor members excelled themselves in the gentle art of cooking, no\ndoubt learnt in the college laboratories.

    "content": "MUCH ADO ABOUT; NOTHING.\nMuch Ado from the Dramatic Society. Reviewing the I.C. Dramatic Society' s last effort, \"Much Ado\nabout Nothing\", performed on Friday December 9 th,' the outstanding success was Mr. John Prig more. Of course he was helped by an\nappreciative audience but perhaps Shakespeare might even have smiled at the sight of a stooping bearded Gentleman shuffling forward to.. the accompaniment of'\" chu ffc huff, chu ffc huff\". This chorus from\nthe audience undoubtedly signified Mr . Pri'g more1 s \u2022 interest in railways, British or otherwise. The choice of Shakespeare for a Comedy led the audience \u2022 to make its own laughs, and this they did until temporarily checked\nby the arrival of the Rector at the end of the second act. Regarding other distinguished performances: Joan Spencer's Beatrice v/ as very fine; Briscoe' s Don Pedro excellent( especially in the use of his hands); Derek Howe's Bene dick was very competent,\nas was Chris. McKoen's Dogberry. Now for the brickbats'. I hope\nthese remarks won'tru in the careers( dramatic or otherwise) of the players concerned. It was unfortunate that some of the supporting cast were\nnot up to standard; Hero in particular was a mistake in casting, and\nthe Messenger might have been better employed in scene shifting. It was felt that only the breeding in the more expensive seats, and the Rector's presence amongst the\" shillings\" prevented violence from\nactually breaking out on two occasions. At times this performance was not up to the usual Dramatic\nSociety standard. One remark heard from the cheaper seats as the audience dispersed,\" If I had known the play was by Shakespeare I wouldn't have come\", shows what a wonderful job is done, by our\nschools. Much Ado from the Mines. If Shakespeare's bones remained inert the night the Mines\nattended the Dramatic Society' s production of \"Much Ado about\nNothing\" then there is no force within them, and the resurrection of\nthe body is not for William. Sixteenth century audiences were reputedly hard oh the players, but these miners would have been outstanding in a meeting of .Communists being addressed by Churchill on ' Private Enterprise for the Masses'. Lest that create an unfair impression it should be added that the bar racking was witty, seldom vicious and borne\nmost manfully by the actors. Penetrating questions were asked of Don John's villi any, Balthasar' s manhood and Antonio's 'make-up, and\nthe speeches on Hero's chastity were subjected to a most rigorous examination.\\ Bene dick received great acclamation for twice answering\nqueries from the mob with complete nonchalance, and further distinguished himself, whilst looking in the arbour, by quaffing two\npints of beer handed out from backstage by an anonymous stage-hand\ncaught up in the n pir it of the occasion. And Balthasar' s rendering of \"Hey Nonny No\" so fired the audience that they could not be\nrestrained from joining in. the chorus; the fact that the result sounded more like \"Old McDonald had a farm\" could doubtless be,a11r i but ed to ov e rex uber a nee. Those who accuse miners of being hard bitten materialists, immune to the finer feelings of man, would have been agreeably surprised at the point when Beatrice finally submitted to Bene dick's embrace and love was triumphant. The audience was so overwhelmed\nthat it insisted on an encore and the whole Theatre shook with emotion, bosoms.were filled to overflowing with goodwill and\ntenderness; the open-hearted ness of that moment was recorded for all time by a great generous cry from the back of \"Nov/ let Pr iggy have\na got\n\n"

Peels t.isa turning to the left half way\nup Church Street, and may he reached from College either by 52 bus\nor via the Goat and the Prince of Wales.\nThe Windsor is a quiet pub; soft lighting, dark oak panelling, polished copper cans and excellent scenery. There is always a cheerful fire in winter, and being one of the best Kensington pubs\nis frequented mainly by the Right sort of people - ici on par le anglais. In the summer, drinks are served in the walled garden\nbehind the Sherry bar, and this makes it the most popular rendezvous\nin London at lunchtime on a fine Sunday, and the groundwork may be\nlaid there for many an. excellent Sunday afternoon. A word of\nwarning here one needs to be there by 12 o' clock to be sure of a seat in the garden, and It is almost useless to expect lunch before2 o' clock.\" \u2022 i Other essential data: Charring ton's beer, very well kept, the IPA being l/8d and the bitter and mild l/4da pint. Closing times are 3 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., and on Sundays the usual2 p.m. and 10 p.m. No barmaids, but the head barman's name is Maurices mall, dark and slightly deaf. No meals are served, but one can\nusually get a roll of one kind or another. Full marks for this excellent hostelry. HEARD IN COURT.\nIt was a tiny court room.,used only when the main one was full. The magistrate, prosecutor and defence, accused and witnesses, two\nreporters and one spectator filled it to capacity. Mr. Guest, the\nmagistrate, wore a black look.\" Call D. C.H.,\" said the Beak,'- and the case was on. This miscreant had tried to interfere with the apprehension of a colleague. \"He took the law into his own hands. Twenty Shillings fine and twenty shillings costs\"., said the Beak. Things looked bad.\nThe fate of the next culprit was much the same. \"You have\nbeen very silly and this is a most unfortunate affair\", was the\ncomment. There appeared to be no case against Clegg and he was\nasked to leave, taking all his money with him. George was not so\nfortunate; Mr. Guest just didn't believe him and fined him \u00a31 with similar costs. Carder was accused of striking an officer. He insisted despite counsel, that it' had probably been intentional and he had\nbeen \"under the influence\" at the time. This pleased the Beak who\nsaid, \"But for the honest way In which you gave your evidence, I should undoubtedly have sent you to prison. Is hall therefore fine you \u00a31 for obstruction and \u00a31 for assault with \u00a31 cost s\".I.C. sighed with relief. Thus with the other fines the Law was \u00a311\nricher. The magistrate refused to say he thought the matter was\nnot too serious, saying\" I will have no further hand in this affair\". We all left. Guilds Boanerges devotees suffered considerable shock this term\non discovering that the 4 th yr. Miners had a rival of unquestionably greater antiquity. This is on view outside- the Union - the proud\nowners biggest problem is how to get it away again with minimum\nloss of dignity or life. Suggestions to Mess rs. Hill, Norris, Hayward and Barnes. "

Hilarity continued until5 or so ( I think) when ham and coffee settled pleasantly on violently ill treated stomachs.I gather Reg Gill played some records from 4 o' clock thanks Reg! Thanks also to all who helped in the masses of work -a lot of you. were Miners & R.C.S,* to Mr. Seers for the inspired piano playing and thanks to the Carnival Sub-Committee which\nSpent v so many enjoyable evenings in my room.\nFootnote: Who pinched my pot? \" D.C. HOWE.\n\n"
