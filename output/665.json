    "content": "Weights Room\nThe new free-weights room in Southside is now\noperational and provides a welcome extension\nto the multi-gym.\nThe type and quantity of weights available\nhas necessitated certain restrictions, but it's is open to all. Please contact Ian Bull in the\nUnion Office at lunch time for further details.\nFootbal\nIC4ths 4-1 SSEES/SOAS\nOH'ici an a dos of the sports page may have\nnoticed a distinct lack of fourth team reports\nwhich has been due to a distinct lack of\nvictories. This was remedied on Saturday by\nthe annihilation of SSEES by four goals to\none.\nThe first half was uneventful, notable only\nfor the opening of the scoring by SSEES. The\nsecond half though, saw a transformed IC.\nThe equalise r was soon scored by Nick\nLouton who capitalised on fine work by Paul\nDent on the right wing. It was Paul Dent,\nagain, who put us in front after out pacing the\ndefence and dribbling around the goalkeeper.\nThe game was put out of the reach of SSEES\nby two further goals by Nick Louton, which\nwere two of the best goals scored all season.\nThe victory was due in the main, to a fine\nall team work from IC. In the absence of a team list special mention must be given to the\ncentral defence partnership of Dave 'Barnsley\nBomber' Bradley and Tom Dale, the calming\ninfluence of Matt Johnson and the pace and\nfinishing of the forwards Paul Dent and Nick\nLouton.\n\u2022 \u2022\nKJ 'fife >\nBasketball\n.-.v.:.:. vi.!.:-ICBB v Guys Hospital 86-30\nYet another easy match for the team despite\nsome sloppy play induced by lack of interest.\nWe suffered once again from the absence of\nour regular coach to organise an offense so\nPanes stepped in.\nFortunately we rarely had to set up our\noffense with tough defense from Ken Tee\nMan' Janet giving many opportunities for\nfast break point.\nWhen the ball was brought up slowly it\nfound its way most of the time to Miguel Diaz\non the baseline who played a superb game to\nnet 27 points as top scorer.\nThe second half was slightly more leisurely\nwith the opposition beaten and knowing it.\nAlex 'Super Hog' Mackenzie sunk 23 point\nthough he fumbled his first potential game\ndunk much to the amusement of Ken who\ndespite his dissatisfaction with his lay up\naccuracy still managed to score 20 points.\nBy the time you are reading this (if\nanybody's got this far!) we will have played\nthe first of our four really tough matches\nwhich must be won to take the league title.\nSo wish us bon chance for yesterday\u2014\nresults next week!\nSport Last Sunday the Orienteering Club travelled\nto Wimbledon for its second event of 1984.\nThe event, more local and a little less exciting\nin terms of terrain than most, provided an\nopportunity to sharpen up navigational\nskills, running technique and aggression for\nthe 'Biggy' this Sunday.\nFor 'tis then we take on those giants of\norienteering, Cambridge University, in an\nunusual head-to-head match at a high class\nevent. For this we'll be pulling out all the\nstops, and pulling in the reserves. So, if this\narticle brings back memories of happy\nM15/W15 days, or all of this is gibberish to\nyou but you think you can run at high speed\nacross complex terrain, come and see us in the\nSCR, 12:30-l:00 pm, Fridays.\nPunchdrunk\nOver the first weekend of this term, the\nSailing Club hosted their first internat in al competition, having invited three Dutch\nteams and two additional English teams to\nparticipate in a small American-style to urna ment. Unfortunately the combination of very\ngusty, strong winds and the British Firefly\nproved too much for most of the teams and\nnearly everyone managed at least one early\nbath in the icy waters of the Welsh Harp. The\nmost dramatic capsize was performed by\nHowarth and McClean who had to abandon\ntheir vessel when it decided to imitate the\nAmerican space shuttle (nose pointing to the\nskies, transom sunk in cooling water). The\nsailing was later abandoned and replaced by\ntable tennis and darts, where the Dutch team\n'Histos' proved their supremacy.\nLast weekend Imperial travelled to\nFarmour to take on Oxford and Reading.\nOxford's Laser lis were a new experience for\nmany of the team and we were unlucky to lose\n1-2 to Oxford. Reading initially appeared to\nbe an easier fish but sloppy sailing by\nImperial gave the opposition the first race.\nJones and Bevan saved the match in the\nsecond race by scraping home with a narrow\nwinning margin. In the final race all seemed\nlost at the start of the final leg but Reading\nthrew a convincing lead away and Imperial\nPing Pong\nAll teams played this week (last week). Team\n1 lost, despite Daryl Griffith wining all his,\nwhere were the rest?\nTeam 3 won at Rejects III 5-4, only due to\nWladeh Forysiak winning all three whilst the\nrest of the team slept or swore. Then the team\nwent down the Pu- and got\norange juice (double). (Censored.)\nTeam 4 showed continual signs of revival\nby actually gaining a point against Crown\nand Manor. That should have been the\nheadline to the report, well done lads!\nTeam 5 v anguished Mak's Mob90. Erica\nParkes is now not so depressed, except about\nthe mis-print last week, she didn't know\nabout her sex change.\nAs a footnote I had a complaint from the\nSailing Club that I haven't mentioned them in\nmy reports since the first few. In fact one of\nthem said they would run home crying to\nmummy if I didn't mention them this week.\nwere incredibly lucky to take this race and the\nmatch.\nMany thanks to Oxford SC for hosting a very enjoyable (though rather cold) sailing in\ntheir centenary year.\nIC vs Surrey won 3-1\nImperial College Sailing Club continued their\nhighly successful season last Saturday when\nthey beat Surrey University 3-1 at Frensham\nPond.\nLed by their ever-enthusiastic captain,\nJones, the team were in a commanding\nposition at the end of the first leg of the first\nrace. Places did not change in the rest of the\nrace and Imperial cruised home with a' convincing 2, 3, 4.\nThe following three races followed much\nthe same pattern, with Surrey trailing the\nsuperior team. In the race Imperial lost, the\nteam had decided to give the opposition a chance by interchanging helms and crews; if\nthe race had been sailed by the rule book,\nImperial would have won with the fewest\npenalty points.\nThe only other events worthy of mention\nwere a near-capsize by Jones when investigating just how far he could roll a Lark when\ntacking and a commendable performance by\nnewcomer Cart, who was frequently rescued\nfrom the back of the fleet.\nFELIX] \\Friday, February 3, 1984 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Letters to the Editor are always welcome on any\nsubject at all. They should be submitted to the\nFELIX Office before Monday 1:00pm for inclusion\nin Friday's FELIX.\nTits!\nDear Pallab\nSo Michael Newman has led\nhis crusade through the pearly\ngates of Beit into the intellectual\nmuch read, well balanced Daily\nExpress. As I flick through the\npages every day in checking my\nMillionaire's Club number. I cannot help judging the\npolitical bias of the Express.\nTherefore I'm sure the Express\nwould like to know what else\nSaint Michael gets up to at\nCollege. I'm sure they'd be\nreally sympathetic to his C ND views for a start!\nIf Saturday's parable was\nbased on facts given to the\nExpress, then FELIX's ability\nto distort facts pales into\ninsignificance alongside the\nExpress. Can a national\njournalist give the impression\nthat these 'sexy sessions'\nhappen fe que ntl y. or did our\nknight in shining armour\nsimply forget to tell them it was\nan annual occasion and not a twice weekly gang bang?\nThe Express might like to\nknow the range of activist\ngroups funded by UGC grants\nthrough student unions.\nPerhaps Monseigner Newman\ncould continue his series next\nweek. At least no student union\nmoney funded Hon Porn's Night.\nI can now hear howls of\nprotest from groups all over\nCollege.' Freedom of expression!\" and so on is their\nwar cry. This has been ICU's viewpoint too. The Newman\nblock vote has been defeated\nseveral times by a majority of\nstudents using their (let's fact it)\ndemocratic right to preserve\nfreedom of expression.\nI have not attended Hon\nPorn's Night, as is my right, and\nhave no intention of ever going.\nIt is not my right to force my\nopinion on others who have\nobviously made a democratic\ndecision to allow the freedom to\norganise such an event.\nThe periodic whining s from\nMr Newman and his cronies\nhave led to open debate on his\n'moral' issues in FELIX and in\ndebates. ICU and students in\nLondon will have little chance\nto refute his allegations in the\nnational media. Thanks again\nMr Newman. The student\nimage needs your actions like a hole in the head. \u2022\nJim Boucher\nMillionaires Club \\o:9657411903 Postgraduate\nCovenants\nDear Pallab\nI would like to bring to the\nattention of your postgraduate\nreaders a^ in t which Peter\nBurt O'. r'ooked in his\nother wis i excellent feature\n'Stretching Your Student\nGrant' ( FELIX663). In the SERC studentships\nhandbook sections 15.24 and\n15.25 detail the position with\nrespect to covenants. In brief,\nthese state that no deduction\nwill be made from the award to\ntake account of the first \u00a3375pa of income from any source and\nthat no deductions at all are\nmade in relation to gifts\n(including money received from\nparents) unless made under\ncovenant. Thus covenants\nwhich would yield in excess of\n\u00a3375pa merely serve to transfer\nsome of the financial burden of\nyour grant from the SERC back\nonto your parents.\nYours sincerely\nHugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nMoonyholism\nDear Sir\n1 am writing to express my\nconcern about my brother.\nHaving left IC 12 years ago, he\nstill uses the refectories as a life\nmember and is a self-confessed\nMooneyholic, unable I believe\nto kick the habit.\nFurthermore, I having left IC\n2 years ago also continue to use\nthe refectories and am worried\nabout also have an add ic it on. Please a div se me if there is\nany known cure.\nYours fretting ly Elie Dangoor\nUGM\nYawn!\nDear Pallab\nGosh, yes IC Union does it\nagain; organising aUG M to\nwhich only 180 people turned\nup. So the meeting was\nin quo rate wasting, time,\nmoney, paper etc.\nThere can only be two\nreasons for this: either the\nmeeting was improperly publicised or the content bored\npeople stupid.\nCan I suggest a remedy.\nEither have 25 semi-naked\nnubile Philipino dancing girls\nfree fall onto Queens Lawn to\npublicise UG Ms; or drop\nmotions which bear no\nrelevance to the affairs of IC\n\u2022like those on Grenada, and S Africa, etc, and only call such\nmeetings when more pertinent\nmotions arise.\nJohn Heseltine\nMining\nMean\nOld\nMooncy\nDear Mr Ghosh\nAs the Hon Sec of the Selkirk\nHall disco appreciation society.\nI should like to express our\nannoyance to the fact that Mr 'Cheapskate' Mooney has\nstopped the weekly Stan's disco. It would seem that the B \u2014\nhas spent all the annual budget\non very slightly improving the\nquality of the baked beans,\nwhich less people consume than\nattend the disco. We should\nattend the disco.\nYours sincerely\nSelkirk Hall Residents\nBums!\nDear Pallab\nMichael Newman really\ndeserves criticism for contacting all the national\nnewspapers. Even people, like\nme, who support Mr Newman's campaign must realise that he\nhas demolished one of his most\neffective arguments.\nIt has been argued that by\nbanning Hon Porn Night, IC's sexist image would be reduced.\nThis would hopefully increase\nthe number of women at\nCollege. Now what ever the\nUnion does, in the eyes of Daily\nExpress IC students will always\nbe connected with porno-graph y. If this prevents one\nwoman coming to College,\nMichael Newman will be\nresponsible for increasing the\nmain origin of sexism at\nCollege, the sex ratio.\nThe only argument advanced\nby Mr Newman to support his\ncause is that students should be\nproud of their Union. This may\nbe true but Mr Newman has at\nthe same time demolished his\ncause.\nIn my opinion there is little\nMr Newman can do to rescue his\ncause. However perhaps ne\nmight like to apologise to\nGaynor Lewis who was\npestered by journalists all\nFriday. *\nMr Newman has also shown\nan alarming lack of respect for\nthe processes of Union democracy. All students have\nthe right, which Mr Newman\nhas often exercised, to present\nmotions to aUG M. However\nwhen they are not passed one\nmust accept that as democracy.\nIt is extremely childish to act as\nMr Newman has. He has started\nusing undemocratic methods\nbecause democratic methods\nhave failed.\nYours sincerely\nHugh Southey\nLetters\nBlarney\nDear Pallab\nI'm told you're short of\nletters. May I suggest the\nEnglish alphabet which contains quite a few. If this is\nnot enough perhaps you may\ncare to investigate a39 letter\nalphabet pioneered by my\nfellow country man George\nBernard Shaw.\nYours\nPeter Rodgers\nPage 2 Friday, February 3, 1984\\ FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Music Here, there and Everywhere: England,\nScotland, Belfast and\nBarki- FELIX goes\nin Search of\nTHE NEXT BIG THING In December 82 Bono Vox of U2 made\nthe prediction that in 1983 'fashion\nwould be out of fashion' and predicted\nan end to 'wallpaper' music and the\nreturn of the guitar. How wrong he was!\n1983's two brightest stars were the\nwonderful image-laden sounds of the\nEurythmics and Culture Club. A year\nlater however the prophecy seems\ncloser to realisation with the newest\nwave of acts returning to basics.\nUnfortunately bright new talent still\nseems as rare a commodity as ever, with\nrecord companies frantically courting\nthe new acts to persuade them to ink that\nmagic contract.\nThe inevitable reams of promotion,\nhype and general media overexposure\nsurrounding these deals only serves to\nheighten expectations and puts the\nbands in the unenviable position of\nhaving to live up to generally inflated\nreputations.\nDon't Sing by Prefab Sprout (CBS) is\nthe case in point. Starting on Newcastle\nindependent Kitchenware their first\nsingles (now being re-released by CBS) were acclaimed by the few who heard\nthem and subsequently led to an eight\nalbum deal with CBS. Sadly the single\ndoesn't live up to expectations\u2014it mixes\nWhoish vocals over an early Spandau riff\nin a song which never quite takes off.\nComplete disregard for conventional\nsong structures doesn't make for comfortable listening although it still shows\nsigns of promise. The talented Scritti\nPollttl found themselves in a similar\nposition eighteen months ago following\nthe release of their album but what's happened to them now?\nThe Smiths showed abundant promise\nin 83 recording the magnificent Charming Man and crowned the year with a triumphant performance in Camden's Electric Ballroom. Their new single What\nDifference Does It Make (Rough Trade)\nis a slight change of direction, replacing\nthe buoyant guitar melodies of its\npredecessor with a relentless riff which\ndominates the song. The effect is\nrivetting and the rhythm stays with you\nfor days at a time. Previously the Smiths\nwere dogged by sordid aura which led to\nsensational is ed stories in the gutter\npress but the prudish can relax (sic) with\nthis as it seems harmless. With an album\ndue in February and a major tour taking\nin the Lyceum (Feb 12) it's hard to\nbelieve that only last May the Smiths\nwere third on the bill at UL U. The Bankrobbers are a similar if less\ntalented example of the return to simple\nrock'n 'roll practised by bands like the\nSmiths. Their new single is a fine blend\nof unrestrained vocals, staccato horns\n(from the Uniqhorns) and a thumping\ndrum beat about a girl called Jenny\n(EMI). It's only fault is the totally\nunnecessary inclusion of five seconds of\nguitar histrionics halfway through the\nsong which totally throws the rhythm\nand momentum. However their main\nworry at the minute would seem to be the\nBank of England who are currently\nconsidering legal action against the\nband for printing their own \u00a350 notes to\npromote the single (see photo).\nEcho and the Bunnymen singles never\nfail to please and The Killing Moon\n(Korova) is no exception. Gently\nstrummed guitars against the usual\ngamut of Bunnymen production tricks\nheralds in Mac's most lucid delivery to\ndate. The lyrics mark a return to the more\npersonal pastures of Rescue in line with\nthe refinement of the orchestral sensibilities of Never Stop. Amazingly this\nnew mellowed sound remains awesomely powerful, notably on the nine-minute version on the 12-inch. The Bside is a live recording (made at the\nAlbert Hall) of Do It Clean during which\nthey free associate into All You Need Is\nLove, Sex Machine and more besides. At\naround \u00a32 for over twenty minutes the\n12-inch is bargain of the year, if not\nrecord of the year.\nThe customary end of the year lists in\nthe music press always throw up\nsomething interesting which deserved to\nreach a wider audience first time round.\nThis year it was Song to Siren (4AD) by\nThis Mortal Coil. This is a haunting song\nbeautifully song by Cocteau Twin\nElizabeth Frazer in (what I'm told is) the\nrecitative style of Italian opera. It was the most original vocal of 1983 and a welcome reaction to all the twee sounds\nof Weekend/Marine Girls which was so\npopular a few years ago.\nAnother revelation in late 83 was one\nman and his guitar, Billy Bragg. His Life's Riot with Spy vs Spy (Go) was a hybrid in\nmore ways than one. 12-inch, 45rpm,7 songs totalling 23 minutes and featuring\nnothing but Bragg's ragged electric\nguitar and just about average singing. At\nhis best (I don't want to change the\nworld, I'm not dreaming of a new\nEngland, I'm just dreaming of another\ngirl-A New England) and most of the\nalbum is terrific and only very occasionally (just because you're going\nforwards doesn't mean I'm going back-To Have and to Have Not) slightly\nembarrassing.\nEND PIECE\nThese reviews have been slightly delayed (and in the case of Bragg and\nMortal Coil are very late) but in a perfect\nworld where everything was equal,\nthey'd all make number one and I'd be\nworking on the sequel.\nPeter Rodgers\nGood Rocking Tonight Due to circumstances beyond their\ncontrol Ents are running very few gigs on\nFriday nights this term but there is a band playing in the Lounge Lizards Club\nevery Saturday night instead. However\ntonight RED LORRY YELLOW LORRY\nare playing the Lounge. Described as a cross between early Television and Velvet\nUnderground, they have had several\nsingles released and seem set for the big\ntime after serving their time supporting\nseveral large name acts.\nPage 6 j The Bankrobbers\n\u2022 H Friday.

    "content": "Jean Seberg at the Olivier,\nNational Theatre.\nPoor Jean Seberg. At 17, she\nis plucked from obscurity by\nOtto Preminger to star in his 'St\nJoan', but her performance is\ncritically shredded. Later she\nenjoys a slight success in French\nNew Wave films. Then she\nbecomes involved with the Black\nPower movement, is the victim of\na FBI smear campaign, causing\nher mental collapse and final\nignominious suicide.\nPoor Jean Seberg. Soon\nforgotten, she is plucked from\nobscurity by Marvin Hamlisch as\nthe centre for his new musical. It\nis much vaunted as the National\nTheatre's first premiere musical,\nbut the critics give it lukewarm\nreviews, and instead of the\nhoped-from Broadway transfer;\nthe show finishes next April.\nThe fact is that Jean Seberg\nwas not a martyr like Joan of Arc\nbut merely a pathetic lightweight.\nThis musical attempts to parallel\ntheir two lives, but only highlights\nher insufficiency as an actress\nand as a saint. Her 'commitment'\nto Black Power was not much\nmore than a superficial flirtation.\nUndoubtably, the attempts of the\nFBI to slur her character by\nhinting that her pregnancy was\nthat of a black panther (and not\nher husband) were disgusting.\nBut, if Jean Seberg was so\ncommitted to racial equality,\nshould she then have paraded\nthe corpse of her child, in an\nopen coffin, to prove its\nwhiteness?\nHowever, if one ignores the\nfrail it y of the Jean Seberg/Joan\nof Arc comparison, Jean Seberg\nprovides an acceptable evening\nout. Elizabeth Hunter, as the\nolder Jean has a good grainy\nvoice, her mature world-weariness contrasting well with\nthe fragile idealism of Kelly\nHunter's Young Jean. Paul\nImbusch is J Edgar Hoover\u2014the\nmost unpopular man in America;\nsoft-stepping into everyone's affairs.\nMarvin Hamlisch's songs are\nbland and forgettable, with the\nexception of the hilarious 'My\nLips are Sealed'. This exposes\nthe insincerity of two hard-nailed\ngossip columnists, their faces\nmasks of wide-eyed in nonce n ce, as one extrudes secrets from the\nother.\n\u2022 Being heavily financed by the\nNational Theatre, the sets,\ncostumes and support cast are,\nof course, of a high standard.\nBut perhaps all it can say about\nthe life of Jean Seberg is how\nquickly it was forgotten. She only\ndied four years ago, but who\nremembered her, before she was\nreincarnated in this musical?\nFELIX JIH MBH n Ml The music format has its origins in the vaudeville\nentertain mf. it of the 19th century. This was a series of short\nmusical sketches, sometimes accompanied with dancing,\nwhich were per ir. med in music halls. With the advent of films,\nmany of the music halls were converted into cinemas and thus\nvaudeville gradually died out. Strangely it was to resurface in\nthe cell u lo'i form with the talkies (for example, 'The Jazz\nSinger' in the 1930s) later evolving into our modern day\nmusical. This encouraged the growth of stage musicals, until\nnow there is a constant, and healthy, interaction, between\nstage and film.\nMusicals are especially popular in the West End at present:\nfourteen currently showing. They range from the blatantly\ncommer ical revival, or film adaptation, such as 'Singin' in the\nRain'; to those with a serious undertone such as 'Poppy' (see\nrei ve w). The cause of the boom may be that people are more\nprepared to spare money for the glossy sets and lavish costumes\nof a musical, than for the less spectacular production of a play.\nHowever, ticket prices are still reasonably good for students,\nwith student-standby tickets being an average of \u00a35.\nAndrew Lloyd-Webber is still doing well, with three shows\n'Cats', 'Evita' and 'Song and Dance' now running concurrently.\nIn late March, his latest offering 'Starlight Express' about a steam train, opens at the Apollo Victoria. No doubt, bringing him\neven greater success.\nLloyd-Webber's former collaborator Tim Rice, has lately\nwritten 'Blondel'\u2014the story of a ballad-singing wandering\nminstrel, in the days of Richard Lionheart. it opened last\nautumn at the revamped Old Vic, but has now transferred to\nthe Aldwych.\nAnother transfer, this time from the fringe, is Vivian Ellis'\n1920's musical comedy 'Mr Cinders'\u2014a pastiche on the\nCinderella story. A popular show, it has just won star Denis\nLawson, an award for the best actor in a West End musical.\nFor Rocky Horror fans 'Little Shop of Horrors' should\nprovide some similarly macabre entertainment, based on a1960's B movie about a man-eating plant. Whilst for the more\nsentimentally-minded person, there is 'Snoopy'\u2014yet another\nmoney-spinner for that canine pal.,Even that schmaltzy pop pet musical 'Bugsy Malone' has been staged, based on Alan\nParker's original film. It's advertising states that it'll kill\nya'\u2014reports indicate this may well be true.\nFinally, there is the cabaret-style entertainment offered by\n'Y' at the Piccadilly Theatre, and 'Late and Live' at the Donmar\nWarehouse. Not strictly musicals, there are best enjoyed with\nan accompanying dinner.\nClaire Moss\nH Friday, February 3, 1984 n mW k^ kW km W mW kW kW\\ Reviews\nPoppy by Peter Nichols and\nMonty Norman, at the\nAdelphi Theatre.\nA curious amalgam of musical,\npantomime and moral tale,\nPoppy is an unusual West End\nshow. It deals with a distinctly\ndisreputable affair in our not-so-glorious Imperial past\u2014the 19th century opium wars. Some\nhistory: to ensure the servitude\nof the Chinese people, the British\nendeavour ed to addict them to\nopium, they revolted, result\u2014the\nopium wars.\nThe originality of Poppy lies in\nthe use of pantomime, an\nessentially comic medium, to\ninterpret this serious theme.\nWhether this succeeds is open to\ndoubt, but there are some good\nsharp points made. Thus Lord\nPalmerston (Mike White) is\ndepicted as a ventriloquist's dummy, mouthing the words\nsupplied by Obadiah Upward\n(Alfred Marks) who represents\nthe East India Company. Queen\nVictoria is played by Nichola\nMcAnliffe as a flirt y, shrill-voiced\nEmpress, later appearing in the\nguise of a horsey-tooth Bible\nmissionary; reminding us that\nreligion was another import\nfoisted on the Chinese. And of\ncourse there is a Dame\u2014the\nsimpering Lady Dodo of\nGeoffrey Hutchings.\nThis production of Poppy is\nstrong on gloss and raz ma tazz, thoroughly enjoyable for its own\nsake, but softening the bite that\nmight otherwise have been\nmade. Perhaps a tawdry, third\nrate style production would\nreally expose the shabby\nVictorian ideals used to exploit\nthe Chinese. As it is, it is best to\njust sit back and wallow in the\nstunning sets, elaborate costumes\nand witty songs Poppy has to\nif fer. But beware if you don't like\npantomime, as much of the\nhumour is of this type, relying on\naudience participation and\nappreciation.\nPages\n\n"

    "content": "News\\ Jolly Good\nFellows\nThe names of the new Fellows\nand Associates of the College\nwere recently announced. The\nbest known name among them is\nSir Clive Sinclair, famous for his\nZX81 and Spectrum computers,\nwho is elected to Fellowship.\nAlso made a Fellow is Professor Sir Richard Southwood,\nknighted in the New Year\nhonours list, a former director of\nthe College's Silwood Park field\nstation. Other Fellows are\nSumantrao Moolgaokar, chairman of the Tata Engineering\nCompany of Bombay, Emeritus\nProfessor AW Skempton of the\nCivil Engineering department,\nand Dr Heinrich Ursprung, President of the Swiss Federal\nInstitute bf Technology in\nZurich.\nThe single Associate elected\nthis year is Geoffrey Cunningham\na former departmental superintendent in Aeronautics.\nThose elected will be inaugurated\nat the Commemoration Day\nceremony in October.\nI Careers Pick-up\nThe job prospects for students\ngraduating from IC arc improv-ing, according to College Careers\nAdvisor Dr Neil Hams. Onl\\\n6.49r of last year's graduates w ere\nstill unemployed at the end of\nDecember and Dr Harris expects\nthis year's figure to be lower still.\nIt seems IC students have a head\nstart when it comes to getting\njobs since the unemployment\nfigure for graduates nationally is\ntwice that for IC.\nThe pick-up in recruitment is\nmost noticeable in the electronics\nand computing industries, with\nbanking, accountancy and retailing also showing improvements.\nIn electronics there are generally\nmore jobs available than there\nare suitable applicants, the first\ntime such a situation has existed\nin any industry for several years.\nRetailing companies such as\nDixons, the consumer electronics\nchain, and MacDonalds hamburgers are now starting to\nrecruit graduates where they\npreviously took A Level qu ali fi cations.\nMost engineering industries\nhave still to show signs of real\nNeil Harris\nimprovement but the decline has\nlargely stopped. With little recruitment for the past few years\ncompanies are now finding it\nnecessary to recruit to avoid their\nstaff age distribution becoming\ntoo top heavy. The oil industry is\nstill depressed along with chemical and mechanical industries,\nbut IC graduates have always\ndone well in comparison to other\nuniversity graduates in these\nindustries. The message from the\nCareers Office is that for nearly\nall IC graduates there will be a job this year, but that you must\nbe prepared to be flexible in your\nchoice of career.\nInvasion of\nToast Racks\nNew bicycle racks have appeared\naround College in an effort to\nreduce the problems caused by\nlack of facilities for cyclists.\nThere will be 32 racks in total\nwhen they all arrive, each holding\nup to six bikes.\nThe new racks were designed\nby the London Cycling Campaign, who offered last year\nto give two racks to College as a result of a donation by Martin S Taylor, last year's FELIX Editor\nand trick cyclist extra ordinaire. Subsequently College Domestic\nManager Mr Iuan Thomas\nordered 30 more of the racks at a cost of about \u00a3100 each.\nInitially there has been some\nreluctance on the part of IC's cyclists to use the racks. This is\nwidely believed to be because few\npeople realised what they were\nmeant to be. However, gradually\nmore and more people have been\nusing the racks. Mr Thomas is\nanxious to point out that the\nracks can be moved around and\nhe would welcome suggestions\nfrom cyclists for suitable sites.\n\u2022After a hard day's work sweeping out his rat infested dungeon College Secretary John Smith likes to relax by playing FELIX\nBingo. This is because he knows that it has to be the biggest\nbingo bonanza ever!\n\u2022Mr Smith is as keen as anyone to win the weekend in |\nAmsterdam.\n\u2022Whether this is because he wants to see Rembrandt's night watch in the Ryksmuseum or discover more about Gouda\ncheese or just spend a pleasant weekend admiring the\nattractive scenery (nudge nudge).\n\u2022What is certain though is that Mr Smithwillhave a good time if| he goes to the Hotel Cok.\n\u2022Beat him to the prize by checking off the numbers each week I on your ULU card.\n\u2022When you have a full house come to the FELIX Office and I claim your prize.\n{Friday, February 3, 19841\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSP 1 OF I ERIAL COLLEGE U NOW UC THEM. NOW YOU DONT!\nImperial College was raided by a mascot ry team from University College\nyesterday morning. The group of about 20 students disrupted a lecture in\nthe Chemical Engineering department and stole 22 honours shields from\noutside the City and Guilds Union Office. The group consisted mainly of\nstudents from UCL' s Chemical Engineering department. Their first\ntarget was a lecture theatre in Chemical Engineering building where they\nshowered Chem Eng 2 with flour, eggs and stink bombs for about half a minute.\nThe remainder of the UCL students .left the Chemical\nEngineering building and rushed\nalong the walkway to Mechanical\nEngineering. Here they pulled 22\nshields from the wall. These\nshields, each valued at \u00a3200, have\nthe names of Guilds Union\nOfficers on them. Professor\nHusband, head of Mech Eng,\ndescribed the incident as 'quasi-criminal'. One of the raiding\nparty was captured by IC\nstudents and was later subjected\nto a rag 'torture' in the Beit Quad.\nThe student captured, UCL physicist Adrian Head, was taken\nto*> Geoffrey Reeves, College\nSecurity Officer. Although Mr Reeves wanted to call in the\npolice the heads of the\ndepartments involved, Professors\nSargeant and Husband treated\nthe matter as a mascot ry raid and\ndecided not to press charges. Mr Reeves decided to give Adrian\nHead to the RCS mascot ry team\nto deal with as they saw fit. They\nraised money for Rag by having\nhim covered in motor oil, wood\nchips and a Mooney lasagne.\nUCL Union denied knowledge\nof the event saying that it was.\norganised by the Engineering\nSociety. ' Mike Stuart, Guilds'\nPresident, contacted them and\ndemanded the return of the\nshields since they are not violate\nmascots. Their response was to\nset a ransom of \u00a38 per shield, but\nMr Stuart refused to consider\npaying any ransom and threatened to inform the police if they\nwere not returned by 5.30pm yesterday. This deadline was\nlater extended to 2.00pm today,\nand at the time of going to press\nthe shields had not been ret-ur ned. The culprit, Adrian Head,\ngetting his just desserts.\nLeon socks it to 'em!\nIn his speech Mr Bnttan\ndiscussed the causes of increased\ncrime, pointing out that these\nwere of such a deep-rooted\nnature that only long term\nmeasures have any effect. As\nHome Secretary, his more immediate task was to reduce and\nmitigate crime by in cres ing the\neffectiveness of the police force\nand the judicial and prison\nsystems. SDecifically, he highlighted the importance of the\nrelationship between the police\nand the community. In discussing\npolice powers, and the necessity\nfor protecting the public against\nthe abuse of them, Mr Brittan\nren r red to the Police and\nCriminal Evidence Bill, currently\nbeing passed through parliament.\nHere, he said, the powers of the\npolice and the rights of the\nindividual had been very clearly\ndefined. The Bill also sets out a system for dealing with complaints against police, including\nthe provision of an independant\nPolice Complaints Authority to\nNo 665 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Home Secretary, Mr Leon Brittan, attracted a large\naudience when he spoke on 'Winning the Fight against\nCrime' in College on Tuesday at a meeting organised by\nthe Conservative Society.\nThe Home Secretary, the Right Hon Leon Brittan,\naddressing a large audience in Mech Eng 220 on Tuesday.\nsupervise investigations of com-plaints.\nI During the subsequent ques-tion in g,Mr Brittan was asked to\n! expand upon the causes of\nj increased crime. In response, he\nstressed that the critical factors\nwere social ones, such as the\ndecline of the family unit, and\nthat he did not believe there was a direct correlation between high\nunemployment and a high crime\nrate.\nWhen questioned about the\npassing of excessively lenient\nsentences in some recent rape\ncases, he said that it would in\nfuture be possible to refer such\ncases to a court of appeal, which\ncould indicate what a more\nappropriate sentence would have\nbeen.\nTo nobody's surprise, the\nquestion of hard-core pornography films was twice raised. Mr Brittan spoke initially of the\n'more horrific material* which it\nis i lie gal to sell, and then\ndiscussed the argument as to\nwhether certain types of film,\nnormally shown only in private\nclubs, should also be available in\nvideo shops.

It provides lots of fun and\nexcitement and raises money for charity.\nWhat we witnessed yesterday could only be described as\ninstitutional is ed vandalism. The University College thugs made no\nattempt to find the Guilds mascot Spanner and Bolt but merely\nwreaked havoc all over campus and stole 22 of the Guilds Union shields. These shields are not mascots, they are priceless to Guilds\nand irreplaceable. If I were Mike Stuart I'd certainly press charges\nagainst those involved if the shields aren't brought back pronto.\nThefts\nIt seems that a group of people are entering Southside rooms which\nhave been left unlocked and stealing resident's cash, cheque books\nand other small valuables. As a Hall resident myself I know what a pain it is to lock your door every time you pop out of your room for a couple of minutes. However unless you do you are asking for trouble.\nThere are no descriptions as yet of these walk-in thieves so if you see\nanyone acting suspiciously in Southside inform security at once.\nFridges\nThe Southside Wardens are faced with a real problem as to what to do\nabout the landing fridges. The GLC regulations are in a way a blessing in disguise since they will force College to convert some of\nthe Southside rooms in to snared kitchenettes, something that has\nbeen long over due. The problem is what to do in the short term since\nno work on re conversion can be started until the summer break. The\noptions open to the Wardens are to either put the fridges in the\ncleaning cupboards (something that won't be popular with the\ncleaners) or to have the fridges in a resident's room or, perhaps most\nrealistically, put all the fridges in a communal area on Gallery level.\nPrint Unit\nThe Union Print unit coexists with the FELIX Office and is there to\nprint Union societies' posters, booklets and other publicity.

When Ben says 'I knew you wouldn't,' it\nshows that there are at least two diamonds (call one\nthe nine) and that for each diamond there is another\ncard of the same face value, but a different suit (so\nthe nine of spades will be there). When Bill says that\nhe knows its colour, it shows that there must be a spade which doesn't have any other suit of the same\nvalue, eg the eight. When Ben says that he knows\nwhat the card is, it shows that the ten must be the\nonly card to appear in both red suits, since no\ndeduction could otherwise be made. So at least\nthree tens, two 'nines' and an 'eight' are there,\nthough the nines and eights are purely arb it ary. So\nthe selection here is 10D,9 D,10H,10S,9 S,8 S. Therefore, there is a minimum of six cards, of which\none is a heart.\nOnly six correct solutions, and the randomly\nselected winner is Philip Milne of Physics 2, who can\ncollect his cheque from FELIX Office after 1:30pm on Monday.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit,~Prince ConsortRd, SW7\nTel 01-589 5111 ext n1048 or internal 2881.

The\nother alternative he has suggested\nis that each resident should be\nsupplied with a fridge.

    "content": "Special Feature Underwater photography requires specialised\nphotographic equipment, new photographic\ntechniques and diving skill. Each of these can be\ntaken to different levels according to commitment,\ntime and money available.\nDiving to around ten feet or so is possible with a mask, fins, healthy lungs and a snorkel. If you want\nto do anything more, you must take lessons and\ngain certificates. Never, ever dive alone\u2014no matter\nwhat your standard. Even the slightest mistake in\nthe sea can be fatal.\nNow with that warning over, let's look at equip-ment. If you have no camera and know nothing\nabout photography, you might think about buying\nthe Minolta Weathermatic or a similar camera for\naround \u00a340. This camera can be used on land or\nunderwater down to about ten feet. It is also useful\nin sandy conditions, as it is completely sealed. Its\nmain disadvantage, is that it takes 110 film, which is\na small negative size unsuitable for large prints. If\nyou already have an SLR, you can waterproof it\nfor around the same amount of money by buying a specially made 'plastic bag' combined with a glove\nwhich allows operation of the main controls.\nFor around \u00a3250, you can buy a Nikonos, a35 mm camera with capability for interchangeable\nlenses, which is completely waterproof. If however\nyou have spent a lot of money on one particular\nsystem you can get a custom-made housing for\nyour 35mm camera if it is a popular make, such as\nNikon, Canon, Pentax or Olympus.\nFlashguns and exposure meters can be housed\nor bought in waterproof versions. Underwater\nflashguns are usually rechargeable, so that they\nstay factory-sealed.\nCaring for underwater equipment\nThe waterproofing of any equipment depends on\nsoft 0-ring seals. These will be damaged by sand and\ngrit and ruined if salt crystals form on them. Also,\nsalt water is highly corrosive and generally ruins\nany type of machinery or electronics. When you\ncome out of the sea, first of all get all of the salt\nwater out of your hair and clothing. Rinse equipment in warm, fresh water, for half an hour. Once o rings have been opened, smear them with special o ring grease.\nIf your camera or housing springs a leak, speed is\nessential. Rinse quickly with fresh water, and then\ntake a screwdriver and dismantle your equipment\nas far as possible (forgetting what it says in the\nmanual!). Rinse thoroughly in fresh water and then\nin pure alcohol to remove the water. Finally, cry,\nphone your insurance company and drink the rest\nof the alcohol. Deliver the remains to your camera\nrepairman (who will become very understanding if\nyou make a habit of it!). These desperate measures\nwill never be required if you keep up maintenance\nof your camera and housing.\nOur knowledge of the undersea world has been greatly increased\nby pioneering underwater photographers such as Jaques Cousteau.\nRecently, however, the emphasis has switched from making documentaries to more creative aspects, using the ocean itself as a photographic studio. As a preliminary to the underwater film show and\ntalk being held in the Great Hall to mmo row this special feature\ninvestigates the ex hill a rating world of underwater photography.\n' \u2022 j it Now, some of the basic rules of underwater\nphotography\nLenses for surface use are designed to have air,\nrefractive index 1, in contact with their front ele-ment. If instead there is water, refractive index 1.3,\nyour lens will behave differently. Objects will\nappear to be one third larger and one quarter\nnearer than they are. Also, the angle of view will be\nreduced by one quarter, so, for instance a35 mm focal length moderate wide angle lens will lose its\nwide-angle properties and behave like a standard\nlens.\nPic: Mike Valentine\nNikonos lenses are either fully or partly corrected for underwater use (partial correction allows\nuse in air). For normal lenses in a housing, the\ndesign of the port is vital. A flat port will cause many\noptical aberrations. A dome shape effectively forms,\na negative lens of water on top of the lens, and this\ncan be designed to counter most aberrations. For\ninstance, the angle of view and apparent size are\nrestored, but the apparent distance is even closer.\nAlso, a positive close-up lens must be added to\nallow reasonable focusing action.\nShorter apparent distance. Refraction Apparent increase in size. Underwater,\nhas the effect of making objects objects also appear to be larger than they\nunderwater appear to be one quarter really are, by one third. The reason for\ncloser than they actually are. this is quite simply that they appear.\ncloser.\nLight underwater is another problem. As you\ndive deeper, the colours present in natural sunlight\nare filtered out. Red is completely absent 20ft down,\norange goes at 35ft and so on until all the light has\ngone at 90ft down. Reasonable colour photography\nat any depth over 10ft or so requires flash. Also,\nflash exposures need to be found by experiment\nand automatic systems will not work because the\noptics of a flashgun's automatic 'eye' change under-water.\nScattering of light by particles and motion in the\nwater reduces visibility considerably. This can lead\n.to loss of colour. Reflection from particles is reduced at large angles of incidence, so for instance,\nflash held out at arm's length will work better than if\nmounted on the camera.\nOne last problem is your eyes' housing\u2014you will f be wearing a mask and it will be difficult to get your\nface close to the viewfinder. The use of a focusing\nframe is a good idea, especially for close-up photography (eg pretty fish or corals). You can make a frame out of a coat hanger. Bend it into a rectangle\nthe size of your field of view and position it in the\nplane of focus, via a bracket. Then whatever is in\nthe wire frame will be on the film and in focus.\nAll underwater photographic techniques can be\nmastered safe t ly in a swimming pool. You can\ncalibrate your flashgun, work out exposures and fit,\na focusing frame before you go into the sea, and\nthen you will be able to give top priority to your\nsafety, and that of your companions and second to\nthe photography!\nPage 9| I FELIX, February 3, 19841\nThe first time I heard about underwater photography\nwas when a friend of mine asked me if I would like to\ngo to the Red Sea for five weeks as an expedition\nphotographer. Until that moment I had done for under\nwater photography what Donald Duck had done for\ns peach lessons. However I Decided to lie through my\nteeth and I persuaded my friend that I knew everything there was to know about underwater photo-graph y. Luckily everything went well and the Red Sea\nwas a fantastic introduction to underwater photo-graph y. What I'm trying to do now is to try and bring the\nunderwater world to a wider audience. The show that I am putting on on February 4 will bring to the attention\nof the public the way that the underwater world can\npresent such fantastic images, be such a fantastic place\nto tell a story and to show how one can be totally\ncreative underwater and use it as a photographic studio\nas opposed to merely a documentary background.\nThe show consists of four films and five audio visuals.\nThe films will be on first and will be in four sections. The\nfirst one will be an introduction to diving, its from the\npoint of view of someone with no diving experience\nbeing taught to dive. The second film is called 'Hunt for\nthe X5' which is about one of the mini subs that went out\nto blow up a German battleship in WW2. The third film\nis a collage of undersea life synchronise d to electronic\nmusic. The fourth film will be the premier of the film I 've\njust made and is about diving in the Red Sea.\nAfter the break there are four audio visual shows.\nThe audio visual shows, or A VS, consist of stereo-sound synchronise d to a series of slides. The pictures\nof course are out of this world and the sound quality will\nbe of a very high standard since there will be six\nkilowatts of stereo pa going through 12 loudspeakers.\nThe show will not only be of interest to photographers and divers but also to the complete novice,\nwho I hope will see one of the most exciting spectacles\nhe has ever seen.\nMike Valentine\nSchedule\n7:30 Films\n9:00-9:30 Intermission\n9:30 Audiovisuals\nSat Feb 4 Great Hall\n1.

Stretching your grant even further.\nMost students can obtain free\nprescriptions and are entitled to\nrefunds on dental treatment and\nglasses, provided the work is done\nunder the NHS. To be eligible for\nthese benefits you must have a sufficiently low income. Claimants on supplementary\nbenefit have an 'automatic right'\nto this kind of free treatment, and\nthe DHSS usually considers the\nstudent grant as roughly the\nequivalent of supplementary\nbenefit when assessing the right\nto help with medical costs.\nHowever, if you receive a scholarship or other forms of\nextra income, you may not be\neligible for free treatment except\nduring the vacation\nPrescriptions\nYou will require an exemption\ncertificate, granted to those with\na low income, if you wish to\nobtain free prescriptions.' Apply\nfor an exemption certificate now\nand don't wait until you need a prescription.\nExemption certificates are well\nworth having as they also give\nyou an 'automatic right' to the\nother types of free medical\ntreatment described. This means\nthat you don't have to wait for\nreimbursement of charges\nalready paid, but can literally\nwalk out without paying for\ntreatment!\nExemption certificates or reimbursement of prescription\ncharges for those who have\nalready paid can be obtained by\ncompleting and returning form\nP ll to the DHSS.\nDentists/Opticians\nUnless you have an exemption\ncert if cate, you will usually have\nto pay for your treatment at the\ntime and then reclaim the charge.\nTo do this, ask your dentist/optician for a receipt and\nthe rel event forms (which s/ he\nmay need to stamp), and send\nthem off to the DHSS.\nReimbursement for glasses is\nlimited to the cheapest type of\nNHS frames and glasses, so if you\nwant to look suave and\nsophisticated expect to pay the\nextra.\nMany extra entitlements are\navailable to students supporting\nfamilies, such as free milk and\nvitamins for young children. You\nshould check that you are\nreceiving your full quota.\nFor more information, see\nleaflets P ll( prescriptions and\nexemption certificates), Dll( dental treatment), Gil( glasses)\nand MV11 (milk and vitamins),\nwhich are available from Student\nFELIX \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I This week Peter Burt examines the health and\ndental benefits students are eligible for. This article\nalso explains how people who receive no grant\nwhatsoever can obtain financial as s it ance. Services, DHSS offices, and large\npost offices. It is important to\nremember that you can only\nreceive free treatment if it is done\nunder the NHS, and you should\nalways check beforehand that\nintended work can be covered by\nthe NHS.\nMost students manage to earn\nmoney by working at some stage\nduring their course. Vacation\nwork, especially if course-related,\nwill also provide you with useful\ntraining. Income over the\nvacation is not taxable below\n\u00a3 1,785 and will not affect the level\nof your grant. However, earnings\nduring term time are supposed to\nbe declared to your LEA, and\nincome above \u00a3375 per year is\ndeducted pound-for-pound from\nyour grant.\nObviously 'proper' holiday\njobs are becoming scarcer, and\nunless you find a course-related\njob through your department or\nsponsor, or know of someone of\ninfluence, you will probably have\nto look hard for one. Favourite\nholiday jobs, such as Christmas\nwork for the Post Office, are\ngenerally less available than in\npast years, as employers tend to\nrecruit from those who have\nspent a long time on the dole\nrather than by choosing students.\nPersistent hunting, though, will\nprobably find manual work such\nas fruit-picking or building work\nin the summer, if you don't mind\nsuch employment.\nTerm time jobs usually exploit\nthe market for bar staff, shop\nassistants, or baby sitters etc.\nThis area is quite fortunate in\nhaving some fairly large\nemployers for such work.\nFavourites among postgraduates\ninclude demonstrating or\ntutoring. If you have any special\nskills you should try using them\nto earn money, eg by busking,\ndrawing.\nNo Grant?\nThere are 350,000 students on\nfurther education courses in this\ncountry who get no grant\nwhatsoever. Most students on\nfirst degree courses do receive a mandatory award, but there are a few unfortunate individuals who\nare ineligible, frequently by\nvirtue of their attendance on a previous course.\nRegrettably, the outlook for\nsuch people is very poor. The first\nbody to turn to for financial help\nis your LEA, who may consider\nyou for a discretionary award.\nEven at the best of times\ndiscretionary awards were few\nand far between, but you may be\nlucky and it is worth contacting\nyour LEA, especially if they are\n'big spenders'.\nOtherwise you may possibly be\nable to apply for Unemployment\nor Supplementary Benefit. To be\neligible for these benefits you\nmust be available for work,\nwhich is why full time students\ncannot claim them during term\ntime. If, however, your department is prepared to state to\nthe relevant benefit office that\nyou are in part time attendance at\ncollege (usually less than about\n21 hours per week), you may be\nentitled to receive such benefits.\nIt is well worth contacting your\ndepartment if you face such\nhardship, as it is just conceivable\nthat they may have 'something up\ntheir sleeve' to help you in other\nways.\nIf a claim for Unemployment\nor Supplementary Benefit is\nsuccessful (which will depend on\na number of factors, ot least of\nwhich is what kind of mood your\nbenefit officer is in!) you must\nremember that, in the unlikely\nevent of a suitable job becoming\navailable, you will be expected to\ngive up your course to enter\nemployment.\nFinally, it may pay to\napproach an educational charity\nfor assistance. The 'Grants\nRegister 1983-5' (next edition is\npublished Autumn 1984) by\nCraig Alan Lerner & Roland\nTurner (Macmillan Publishers\nLtd; available in most good\nlibraries under Dewey classification 378.3GRA) lists organisations providing as s it ance/ scholarships/ research and\nequipment grants etc. The book\nis international in flavour and is\nwritten for graduates and above.\nYou should also consult the\n'Directory of Grant Making\nTrusts', published by the\nCharities Aid Foundation and\nthe 'Charities Digest' published\nby the Family Welfare Association. Alternatively you\ncould try competing for a scholarship. Details of many\nsuch schemes are to be found in\nteh booklet 'Sponsorship and\nSupplementary Awards' available from the careers and\noccupational information centre,\nMoorfoot, Sheffield SI 4PQ. The Education Grants Advisory Service (EGAS7 can\nalso put further and higher\neducation students in touch with\nsources of financial aid from\ntrusts and other bodies when\ndifficulties have arisen. They can\nbe contacted by writing to The\nStudent Adviser, Educational\nGrants Advisory Service, The\nFamily Welfare Association,\n501-505 Kingsland Road, Dalston, London E8 4 AU. Phone\n01-254 6251.\nIn general, such charities\nusually give preference to those ,\nwho have encountered un for seen difficulties rather than those who\nhave knowingly commenced a course without financial support.\nThey usually provide only\nsupplementary assistance, which\ndoes not take the place of a full\ngrant, and tend to give priority to\nthose from disadvantaged\ngroups. Trusts are very unlikely\nto help postgraduates or those\nlooking for second degrees or\nadditional qualifications.\nIn general, most of the benefits\nand schemes I have described\napply only to Home students.\nThey are yours by right, and if\nyou don't claim them you must\nhave more money than sense! By\nnow you should already have\nlok oed into the possibilities of\ndrawing up a\" covenant and\napplied for a rent rebate and\nprescription and exemption\ncertificate. Remember that there\nis usually a long wait before you\nreceive most benefits, which can\nseldom be backdated, so the\nsooner you apply the better.\nAs far as I know all the details\nabove are correct, and I have\nmade every effort to ensure that\nthey are accurate. They are only a guide, however, and if you want\nmore help, please go and consult\nStudent Services (I must thank\nKaren for her help in writing\nthis). Student Services know\nmore about these things than\nmost people, and should be able\nto fill in any outstanding details.\nPeter Burt\nEAO\n{Friday, February 3, 1984 I VPage 7\n\n"
