    "content": "I RECKON THAT WAS BETTER THAN SEX\nOverheard: \"I reckon that was better than\nsex.\" The quote refers of course to the\nincredible cup tie between Imperial College 2\nand University College 2/1 (standard UC tactics when faced with superior opposition).\nThe game evoked all facets of human\nemotion; from the height of euphoria to the\nabyss of despair. The inclement overcast sky;\na slight drizzle which left a fast grassy\nsurface, augured a hard game with the\npromise of goals.\nNervous tension sparkled in the changing\nroom before the game. Giles (Glow Balls)\nBrereton had zest added to his game by the\nliberal application of Ralgex spray to an\nerogenous zone. The tension carried to the\nfield, the quick aggressive UC midfield not\nallowing Imperial to settle. Slow thinking at a UC free kick allowed the UC centre forward\nample time to lob Al Betts: one, nil. The hard-running of the Imperial front three; James\nRowley, Dave Dean and Quentin Merritt\nreaped its first reward when Imperial were\nawarded a penalty, the goalkeeper having\nbeen given no option but to bring down Dave\nDean. The penalty was torpedoed by Phil\nNiccolls at the goalkeeper's head, who by this\ntime had dived to one side: one all. Imperial\nnow pressured the UC defence to resorted to\nbreaking up Imperial attacks by crude\ntackling which was to set the foundation for\nfuture events. At half-time the score was still\none all.\nThe second half saw Dave Dean running\nonto a UC own goal in time to notch his first of\na hat trick. Two one up Imperial tended to\nrelax; the culmination of shoddy play was a well taken UC goal. The 'Lorimer' style shot\neluding Al Betts. Soon after UC went three\ntwo up the headed goal from a free kick.\nImperials defence of Dek McG uck in, Giles\nBrereton, C Beer and Jim Beer sponged the\nheavy pressure of the UC attack, Kev\nBuckley, Brian Scannell and Phil Niccolls\nhelping the defence. Brian Scannel and\nJames Rowley thrusting on the left provided\nsome semblance of an Imperial attack.\nImperial fought their way back into the tie and\nit was as the tide was turning that UC began to\nresort to their earlier vindictive attacks. It was\nafter an exceptionally late and vicious 'tackle'\non Quentin Merritt'as he threatened the UC goal that the UC centre half was sent off.\nImperial pressed forward to capitalize on\ntheir opponents depletion in numbers,\nhowever UC defended resolutely. Quentin,\nJames and Dave probed the UC defence but\nchances were few. The equalizer came as a UC defender was harassed into a bad\nclearance, the ball riding to Dave Dean whose\nrasping left foot shot reached the UC net from\nan oblique angle. Tired limbs and spasms of\ncramp suggested a ragged finale with the\nprospect of yet another replay. But with two\nminutes remaining a speculative forty yard\nshot from Dave Dean looked destined for the\nUC goalkeeper's arms. However the greasy\nball escaped firm control and after spiralling\nabove the prostrate goalkeeper agonizingly\ncrept into the goal. Surely, Imperial could\nhold on. With thirty seconds remaining UC were awarded a controversial penalty.\nSpeechless, the Imperial team watch the UC player place the ball on the spot, sinews\nflexed, tension electrified the air. The UC player strode deliberately toward the ball. His\nfirmly driven shot looked destined for the\nlower right hand corner of the goal. But Al( the Kitten) Betts had summoned his\nincredible powers of anticipation and leapt\nmajestically in the path of the ball. The\nrebound was safely gathered in his arms. His\nkick heralded the final whistle Jubilation was\nrife and the post match celebration continued into the early hours.\nNo apology for the above verbal diarrhoea.\nTeam: Betts, McGuckin, Brereton, C Beer,\nJ Beer, Buckley, Niccols, Scannell, Rowley,\nDean and Merritt.\nTHE RALGEX APPLICATOR\nLSE IV vs IC VI\nUnlucky 13\nToday saw the continuing comeback of IC\nVI from relative ob sur it y to the forefront of\nuniversity soccer. In a highly competitive\ngame IC made an excellent start but found\nthemselves 2-0 down before Dave Tinkler\nrealized he was marking the referee, an\nunder stan able mistake as the ref acted as an\nLSE twelfth man. Continuing pressure\nunfortunately proved fruitless and IC were\nunlucky to find themselves 7-0 down at half-time. It was at this point that the referee began\nto show concern for his players in view of the\nkeen IC tackling. However, IC did have a period of complete control from the end of\nthe first half to the beginning of the second\nduring which they successfully managed to\neat their oranges.\nIn the second half, due to reorganization of\nthe defence and some inspired attacking\nfootball, IC managed to keep the final score\ndown to an unlucky 13-0. This sound\nperformance should keep IC VI in good stead\nfor the return match in a week's time.\nTeam: Rynbeek, Hobson, Audin, Brisnull, J. Baldwin, Tinkler, Wolfson, Slater, Davies,\nAdach and Coyle.\nIC 1ST XV vs CHESHONT: 4-22\nThis match was played at Harlington, in\nconditions that were not conducive to good,\nfree running rugby.\nIC started the match very shake ly and apart\nfrom a few patches when we showed our true\nform, we were unable to shake off this 'nervy'\nm odd. The match was spent containing the\nCheshont pack, and especially the back row,\nwho created a lot of problems for us.\nThe bright spot of the match was a well\nworked and well deserved try scored by Phil\nRatcliff, playing on the wing. IC, playing\nsome of our brightest rugby, managed to get\nwithin ten yards of the Cheshont line before\nwe were awarded a penalty for a scrum aging in f ring ment. A forwards move was called by\nSteve Townsend, making a welcome return to\nthe back row. After Richard 'Horror' Smart\nhad taken the ball to within two yards of the\ntry line, the IC pack set up good ball for Steve\nDobney (Happy Birthday, Steve) to put Phil\nover, in the corner.\nThe match finished with Cheshont running\nin four tries and IC put ing in a less than usual\nperformance.\n'One to learn from lads.'\nEGB\nLADY'S HOCKEY\nRoyal Vetinary College vs Imperial College:\n1-1\nHaving eventually found the Vets ground,\nIC ladies played a hard fought mae ch against\nthe Royal Vets.\nThroughout the first half Imperial had most\nof the play, but were unable to score from any\nof their frequent attacking moves. Shortly\nafter the turn around IC went ahead with a goal from Hilary Carter. However Vets\nequalized almost immediately. The IC\ndefence did well to withstand the intense\npressure from the Vets attack and in the end a draw was a fair result.\nThanks to Pat Dunleavy for driving us out\nthere, pity he wasn't as loud while cheering\nfor us on the pitch, as he was in the bar later\non.\nTeam; Julia Towns (Capt), Fay Hood,\nAveril Horton, Alex Burnip, Catherine\nCrosley, Shirley Course, Dana Clark, Debra\nMendes, Caroline Godin, Hilary \" \u2022\nCarole Thomas.\nBarts vs IC: 2-4\nOn Saturday after n non IC ladies travelled\nto Sidcup to play Barts in a league match.\nOwing to pressures of work and weekend\noutings by various members of team, IC were\nstruggling to field a full side, and it was with\nsome trepidation that we took to the pitch\nagainst a Barts team which included some\nrecognised UL U plays.\nHowever, the opposition failed to make full\nuse of their better players and IC were able to\ntake advantage of a rather weak Bart's defence. IC were 3-0 up at half time than dk s to a superb goal from Alison Oversby and one\neach from Mary Harrington and Fay Hood.\nBarts came back to 3-2 and Alex Burnip\nwas particularly effective in our defence\nfoiling many attempts from Bart's forwards to\nequalize. Mary Harrington put a seal on the\nmatch with a late goal to earn two league\npoints for IC. Jan Clarke played well in her\ndebut match.\nTeam: Julia Towns (Capt), Alison Oversby,\nJan Clarke, Fay Hood, Mary Harrington,\nKathy, Dana Clark, Ruth, Catherine Crosley,\nAlex Burnip and Averil Horton.\nHay Food\nI thought I was an alcoholic\nuntil I discovered Pub Board.\nAre you interested in the\nmedia? If so, then you are the\nideal person for Ordinary\nMember of ICU Publications\nBoard. Papers for this post go\nup in the Union Lower Lounge\non Tuesday and the election is\nat the Pub Board meeting on\nDecember 4th. Why not have a go - you\ncould get more than you\nbargained for!\n23\n\n"

It is obviously difficult for me to make\ncomparisons as my perspective is very much\ndifferent this year. But I would like to present\none or two slightly contentious observations.\nMaybe I was spoiled by a good first year last\nyear, maybe my C CU spex saw things\ndifferently or maybe this year's fresher s aren't so prepared to get involved or are more\nworried about failing in a climate of\ndecreasing opportunites.\nThis might explain the reluctance of an\nRCS UGM to convict its President in a trial\n(unheard of), it might explain the way many\nBernard Sunley House residents haven't even\nput their names on their doors, it might\nexplain the poor numbers of people prepared\nto help ENTS and the fact that ICU still needs\na publicity officer (desperate plug).\nPlease don't take it personally and don't consider this to be in any way re cri minatory, or if you are one of the people who has thrown\nyourself Into the fray don't give up. But do\nplease review your own involvement in what\ncan loosely be described as 'college life'.\nUGM BLUES\nI was very disappointed to see the quorum\nchallenged by such a narrow margin at the\nend of Tuesday's UGM. The fact that there\nwere only six people short ofthe required 300\nand that people left immediately before and\nduring the count leads me to believe that the\nmeeting had been quo rate during most of the\nbulk of the discussion.\nIt was also unfortunate that the motion\nconcerning the Education Cuts and ICU's involvement in yesterday's Day of Action was\nnot discussed, but I hope that something can\nbe salva lge d at the next meeting.\nI was, however, pleased that the John\nShuttleworth claim to the FELIX throne has\nfinally been buried. I will close that issue by\nsaying I resent the time I have spent on it that\ncould have been better used.\nSo....\n1. Keep moving so there's less chance of the\nmuck sticking.\n2. Become a Publicity Officer.\n3.

The Union Disciplinary Committee\nhas the power to make people pay for damage\ncaused, and impose an additional fine, and\nsuspend them from use of all Union facilities\nincluding clubs and societies) for an\nlite length of time, and to refer cases to\nCollege Disciplinary Committee. I do a lot of\nwork keeping the Union running, and I take a strong personal dislike to the moronic\nwan kers who smash things to bits; so much\nso that I desire a certain sadistic delight in\nImposing maximum disciplinary measures\nagainst miscreants who get caught.\nAnd as for whoever I catch writing on the\nwalls, they will be presented with a bucket\nand wash leather and an ENTIRE Union\nbuilding to clean.\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\nTHEFT\nSome money was stolen from clothes left in\nthe gym changing rooms on Monday evening\nbetween 6:15 and 7:15. Anyone who saw\nanyone going into the gym during this period\nshould contact me as soon as possible.\nAnd if I catch the person responsible, I don't think I 'll bother w j th the disciplinary\nprocedure; it's easier for me just to mention a name and department to those members of\nRugby Club whose money was taken.\nBARS\nDespite a recent price increase from the\nbrewers, bar prices are being kept down for a while at least. The only way we can maintain\nthese prices is if the bars are well patronised,\nand our expenses are kept down.

    "content": "LETTERS\n\\\nwe** of ^ . \" ^\nNAT WEST BANK\nDear Colin\nI read with great interest Mr\nWhite house's letter\" to you drawing attention to the long\nwaiting periods that he\nexperiences from time to time in\nour branch in the College. As he\nquite rightly says, at certain times\nour premises are very crowded\nindeed and it is a source of\nconcern to us that we are not able\nto provide the speed of service\nwhich we would like.\nAs Mr Whitehous mentions, we\nhave introduced a Quick Service\nTill and Mail Box, which I appreciate has not solved the\nproblem but I do believe they have\nmade some contribution. As far as\nthe Mail Box is concerned, it is\nnow the case that some customers who otherwise would\nhave waited can deal with their\nbusiness immediately.\nThere are obviously major\nproblems involved in any extension of the bank's premises\neven if the space were available,\nbut we do believe that we are\ntaking a real step forward with our\npresent plans to provide a Servicetill adjacent to the main\nli ft s on Level Two as soon as the\nPost Office can provide a line and\nthe necessary preparations have\nbeen made. This will be available\nto our customers to provide cash\n' and accept instructions for\ncheque books and statements on\na twenty-four hour basis. This has\nnot previously been publicised as\nit is unlikely that the work involved\ncan be completed until well into\n1980.\nIn the meantime perhaps I could\ndraw attention to the Cash\nDispenser which is situated by the\ncorridor parallel to that which\nleads to the bank premises from\nLevel One and from which\namounts of ten pounds can be\ndrawn.\nYours sincerely\nBD Hunt JP. Manager\nMORE RAG MAG\nDear Sir\nHas correspondence on one of\nIC's more notorious publications\n(no, not the Blue Book. That's a notorious Oxford publication. Or\nUSAF) been closed, or can I be stunningly original and fly off\nat at an get from previous\ncorrespondence?\nConsider the Rag Mag - here we\nhave a situation where the Union\ncould find itself liable in court for\nthe actions of an individual (if\nMary Whitehouse were to\nprosecute), despite having strongly opposed those actions.\nSorry, but the Union would find it\nhard to disown the Rag Mag.\nNow, before Ruth (this is your\nmention), Rae, Tansy and other\nin tell e gent young things leap to\nmy feet, objecting that in future\nthe Rag Mag Editor will be\nanswerable - sorry girls, but the\nRag Mag is just one example of\nICU's continued policy of\nmuddling through on the assumption that it will all come\nclean in the wash, rather than an\nisolated abbe ration. The changes\nin Rag Committee structure are\njust another example of ICU\nbolting the horses after the door -oh well, you know what I mean;\nspecific solutions to specific\nproblems, usually too late. Come on ICU - general is e; after all, the\nconstitutions remain as full\nof loopholes as a sieve (if mixed\nmetaphors are good enough for\nBill Shakespear(e), who am I to\nargue?).\nNow, this year ICU is privileged\nto have a strong P WP who have\npledged themselves to great\nthings, not to mention leaping tall\nbuildings, so how about it, Mxs\nBerry, Hepton et al? Why not have\na go at making IC's numerous\nconstitutions as foolproof as a duck's eyelid? If you do not see\nthe need for such action, I am sure\nthat John Tidy will be pleased to\nexplain in greater depth. After all\nhe knows your addresses.\nYours f ably KJ Fenning\nSomewhere-Outside-Devizes\nPS - As I recall last year's UK\nconcert, the 'Walkout' was caused\nby an ugly rumour that Brendon\nhad called last orders, rather than\nthe group's musical abilities.\nFELIX PROBLEMS\nDear Sir\nWe agree that FELIX has had\nmore than its fair share of\nproblems this year. This doubtless explains why an article\non Jezebel handed into the FELIX\nOffice before the copy deadline of the Freshers' FELIX has still not\nbeen printed.\nWithout the above article\nhaving been seen, we are grateful\nfor any further publicity which can\nbe given to the rebuild of Jezebel's engine.\nWe therefore had mixed feelings regarding a certain\nphotograph on page nine of\nFELIX no. 532. Its only saving\ngrace was the caption 'Jez on the\nroad?'.\nForthose interested, the answer\nis NO! This is a picture of a1914 machine which is owned by\nDennis Brothers of Guildford.\nYours faithfully\nThe R CSU Motor Club\nPS - Why no credit for the photo\non the back pa qe? REACTION TO THE ZIMBABWE ARTICLE\nDear Sir\nAlthough I am not at your\ncollege, I had the misfortune to\nread a copy of your students i paper entitled FELIX through a friend of mine at Imperial. The\npaper itself was of admirable\nquality, when I came across an\narticle which struck near to my\nheart. I refer to the article by a certain Jan Cz ern usk a on\nRhodesia-Zimbabwe. The article\nwas written with such gross and\nunbelievable errors, that one can\nonly suppose it was written from\neither sheer ignorance or a wicked deceiver.\nIam a third generation Rhodesian, and as such as much a Rhodesian as any other man born\nin our country. I would like to\npoint out a few fact a as a reply to\nthis gentleman's fabrications or\ntrash (is there any other way to\ndescribe the article?).\n1. The torture and suffering\nbrought to the people is to the\nmost extent caused by callous\nand blood thirsty butchers, who\nwithout conscience slaughter\nhundreds of innocent men,\nwomen and children of any\ncolour, creed or religion, to satisfy\ntheir desires. As in the cases of the\nfamily of twenty-three burned to\ndeath while locked in their home,\nor of the crashed civilian plane of\nwhich ten of the eighteen\nsurvivors were fired upon. Ages?\nTwo girls aged four and eleven,\nseven women and one man. After\nwhich not content to admit it as an\naccident their gallen t leader went\non TV to laugh and snigger at this\nbloody affair suffering!\n2. Of course over 95% of our\ncountry is under martial law. Most\nare when under Seiger from\nneighboring countries. We get\nwild claims of 'democracy' and\n-'justice' from these states, where\nthey claim their peoples live in\npeace and harmony. In\nMozambique there hasn't been an\nelection since colonial days and\nwhen there will be, only one party\nwill be able to stand! In Zambia,\nthe bastion of demo c race y in the\narea, Dr Kaunda eliminates his\nopponents by changing constitution to allow no one to stand\nagainst him.\nOf course the country is not\nperfect, very few are, but if the\npeoples inside were allowed to\nlook after ourselves we'd have one\nof the most prosperous and\npeaceful states in Africa. Before\npeople said we were Britains\nresponsibility, now its accepted,\nyour judged as biased, where are\nall these double standards coming from? From people and\ncountries who can least afford to\nbe examined themselves.\nYours since rly Karl Anderson\nPS - Let people speak from\nknowledge, not ignorance.\n2\n\n"

This slightly overshadowed the four\ngoals by Dick Veenam, who had been first to\ncomplete his hat trick. Ian Stevenson was the\nother goalscorer in this impressive\nperformance.\nMartin Curran was especially good in\ndefence and the running of Graham Rickard\nup front was a distraction Goldsmiths\ncouldn't handle.

Having been\ngiven a gift penalty, which 'Slinky' Rickard\nconverted. They fell behind and trailed 3-1 at\nhalf time.\nIC equalized early in the second half, with\ntwo more goals from Rickard, leading to a tense and keenly contested last half hour.\nRickard pushed our noses in front once\nagain. But QMC hit back immediately. It was\nlooking like a draw until Phil Brindle rose\nabove the QMC defence to score cleanly with\nhis head in the last minute and dramatically\nwin the match.\nTeam: Veats, Hendy, Reeve, Kenrick,.\nCaffyn, Clarke, Haralampoos, Donaldson,\nRickard, Brindle and Kearny.\nFOOTBALL IC 1st XI (5) vs QM C1st XI (4)\nDue to field trips, a2nd team cup replay and\nplayers disappearing to varius parts of the\ncountry, the 1st XI had a new look from the\nprevious match, but still achieved their fourth\nconsecutive lea que win. This was despite the\nefforts of Steve 'I do Catch the Ball\nSometimes' Veats being in goal. The first half\nwas forgettable except for a badly taken\nRickard penalty ( he allowed the keeper time\nRickard penalty (he allowed the keeper time\nto flinch before the ball hit the net!) and three\ncharitable (to QMC) cock-ups by Veats.\nAt half time the score was Veats 3, IC 1.

It was touch and go, whether we\nwould catch the coach from UC Union, and\nthings looked de spa rate, when Steve Kirk\nwas caught short at Euston, but fortunately\nfor you reading this, we made it!\nThe race got off almost on time, and\nStraight away the IC 'fab four' of Evan,\nCameron, la-Morton, Steve Kirk and Mark\nPickard, were well up to the front of the field.\nNobody really knew where the course went,\nso a good sense of direction was needed to\nget around. Not surprisingly Morton was\nsoon in trouble, being led astray by an LSE\nrunner (?!), and ending up round some\nchicken shacks. The race went on, and was\neasily won by Evan (now available in Airfix),\nfollowed by Steve in third, Mark in fourth and\nIan, well down in eighth. The team result was\nthat we beat UC.\nThe following Saturday, a team ran in the\nPriory Relays at Reigate. The appearance of\nSteve Ovett in the programme had a few\ntongues wagging, but could the presence of\nan IC team of no-hopes pose a threat to the\nchances of the mighty southern clubs who\nwere competing in the relay. Well, for all you\navid readers of the Beano, the Hornet etc., I'm sorry to say the answer was NO!\nPosing for the camera, Gary Longhurst,\nshot off like a whippet at the start of the first\nleg, and disappeared over the hill, well up in\nthe first ten. However, on his return, it was a pitiful sight, as the poor lad, eyes blood-shot,\nstaggered into the finish, to collapse in a heap\nin 30th position. Mark Thwaites on the\nsecond leg had the run of his life to pull back\nfour places. Pete Holdsworth, Nick\nWatmough, and Dave Barrett, all had\nencouraging runs, whilst Ian Morton pulled\nback a few places on the last leg to finish the\nteam in 28th position.\nHOCKEY\n2nd and 3rd Xl's Hockey Trip to Cambridge\nIC 2nd vs St Johns 2nd:04 IC 3rd vs St Johns 3rd:33 As dawn broke over London the team\nmembers were trudging towards the union\nlower lounge. By midday someone said\neveryone was ready and we piled into the\ncoach. Having visited an off licence en route\nwe arrived on time (just in time for some\npeople), despite Phil's best efforts to misdirect us.\nAd can be seen from the score the 2nds didn't have a good game. The St Johns\nplayers were better organized, played well as\na team and dominated all aspects of the\ngame. At half time the score was 3-0, two\nshort corners and a penalty flick, that had\ncost them about \u00a315 in the form of a broken\nKarachi King Super.\nThe 3rds braved the field with only ten men,\nbut then the opposition only had ten, so that's no reason for the miserable draw. IC were in\nthe lead after two minutes with a superb break\naway goal from yours truly. St Johns\nequalized with a goal that should have been\ndisallowed, as it glanced off the keepers chest\nfrom a short corner, Tim Mitchel put IC back\nin the lead again with a great goal from the left\nwing. St Johns equalized with another\nscrappy goal half way through the second\nhalf, which was followed by some excellent\nteam work resulting in yours truly scoring\nagain. St Johns equalizing as the whistle\nwent.\nAfter a disappointing tea, which vanished\nbefore half of us looked round, we were\nsouthward bound with an occasional stop\nand an attempt at a singsong, a lack of words\nrendering of 'One Day at a Time, Sweet Jesus'\nsoon ended that. A good time was had by all\ndespite the disappointing results.\nD Cornwall\n21\n\n"

Details\nof these and others from Welfare\nCentre.\nJeremy Nunns\nThe masochistic roving reporter\nLondon was quite congested, but there was\nat least one traffic policeman at every set of\ntraffic lights and the veteran cars were just\nwaved through, rn uch to the annoyance of\nmotorists in side roads. Despite the weather\nthere were thousands of people lining the\nroute.with hardly a stretch of pavement\nlonger than ten yards without a group of\nspectators on it until Coulsdon (about 15\nmiles from Hyde Park).\nSouth of Coulsdon there were less people\nand a little less traffic,although the road was\nstill full of sightseeing cars and coaches,also\n'Tow Cars' (support cars) for the vintage\nvehicles. I made one unsuccessful attempt to\nphone back to I.C. Radio shortly after Bo had\nstopped in Streatham due to a knocking noise\nfrom the engine; a faulty inlet valve was\nsuspected but it turned out to be merely the\nbonnet bouncing up and down. A few miles\nfurther on, in Purley, Bo made a brief stop to\nsort out a problem with the transmission\nbrake. I got through to Harvey Nadin's breakfast programme just after that (some of\nyou may have heard me at 9.35), but as it took\nme several minutes I was quite a bit behind Bo at that time.\nWhen I arrived at Redhill (which has got a very steep hill in the middle of it) I got quite\nsevere cramp in my legs, but I persevered\nbecause I found out that I was only a couple\nof minutes behind Bo. A little later I took a short cut past Crawley (where the A23 does a sweep to the west) and rejoined the main road\nabout ten miles further on. I asked some\nspectators if they had seen 'A red car with\npeople in top hats in it', they replied in the\nnegative, by which I ascertained that I was\nahead.\nCycling on to the edge of the town district\nof Brighton I ensured that I arrived in the town\nfirst. Shortly afterward Bo passed ; after\ntaking some photographs I followed and\narrived at the finish about two minutes after\nthe Guilds veteran mascot, tired but\ntriumphant.\nPhoto by Jeremy Nunns\nBOOKS, RECORDS AND TAPES FOR LOAN!

This\nwas in response to British Steel Corporation's proposed cutbacks in Corby, Northants.\nGANGSTER KILLED IN POLICE AMBUSH\nJaques Mesrine, for ten years the most\nwanted criminal in France, met his death\nwhen he drove into a police ambush. He was\nhit 18 times and his girlfriend, sitting beside\nhim, was severely wounded.\nZIMBABWE-RHODESIA\nBritain's plan for Zimbabwe/Rhodesia was\npublished by Lord Carrington and left little\nroom for manoeuvre by the Patriotic Front. In\na substantially non-negotiable document, the\nplan called for a British Governor to control\nthe election period using British political,\nmilitary and legal advisers to run the territory\nusing existing civil service and se curt iy forces.\nSATURDAY 3\nMOUNTBATTEN SUSPECT HELD IN US\nAn IRA man, suspected of being connected\nwith Earl Mountbatten's death, is being held\nin USA. The suspect was identified as\nMichael O 'Rourk, and faces deportation\nproceedings. O 'Rourke, who was living under\nthe name of Patrick Mannion in the US, was\nthe name of Patrick Mannion in the US, was\nidentified by photographs and fingerprints\nsent by the Irish police.\nBLISTERING ATTACK ON 'ARROGANT\nBRITAIN\nThe Mozambique government accused\nBritain of arrogance and blackmail in its\ntreatment of the Patriotic Front. This attack,\nwhich is bound to cause further tension at\nLancaster House, has come at a key moment\nas PF is still demanding huge changes in\nBritain's plans.\nMONDAY 5\nBRITISH EMBASSY OCCUPIED\nIslamic students and revolutionary guards\noccupied the British Embassy in Teheran for\nsix hours today. The occupation which ended\npeacefully at midnight was strongly\ncondemned by the same Iranian authorities\nwho had supported the occupation of the US\nEmbassy.\nMOUNTBATTEN'S MURDER CASE\nTwo men appeared in Dublin's Special\nCriminal Court today charged with the\nmurder of Earl Mountbatten on 27 August.\nThe Irish police, having found traces of\ngelignite, paint and sand, can show that the\nmen had been on the boat before it set off on\nits ill-fated fishing expedition.\nFAMINE THREAT TO ZAMBIA\nThe Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government are\nto impose sanctions against Zambia and half\nall supplies of maize. Zimbabwe-Rhodesia\ncontrols the only route from the maize\nsupplying south into Zambia. The reasons for\nthe sanctions are because President Kaunda\nof Zambia has failed to stop the infiltration of\nguerillas from his country. This will cause a critical situation in Zambiz as it had a very\npoor harvest.\nTUESDAY 6\nCHILDREN'S APPEAL\nA BBC TV appeal through the Blue Peter\nprogrammed for starving people in\nCambodia has raised \u00a3100,000 in two days.\nThe response exceeded expectations as\nparents of young viewers sent in cheques for\n\u00a35, \u00a315 and more. The money will be used to\nbuy an 18 ton lorry, seeds, rice, agricultural\nimplements and fishing net.\nWEDNESDAY 31\nCALLAGHAN WINS INQUIRY VOTE\nModerate Labour MPs rallied round Mr\nCallaghan and his shadow cabinet colleagues and voted in favour of the\nproposal that the National Executive should\nreconsider the composition of the special\ninquiry into the Labour party and give strong\nrepresentation to the Parliamentary Labour\nParty. Though the NEC would consider this\nproposal, left wingers asserted that the\ncomposition of the commission will not be\naltered.\nMOVE TO CUT EEC BILL\nFollowing talks with Chancellor Schmidt in\nBonn, Mrs Thatcher said that efforts would be\nmade during next month's meeting in Dublin\nto get the contribution made by Britain to the\nEEC cut. Chancellor Schmidt said that\nBritain's demand for changes in rules\ngoverning contributions was justified.\nNeither of the two leaders was prepared to\nguess as to how much from the\n\u00a31,000million paid now would be saved if the\ndemand was successful.\nDC10 CRASH\nFifty-six people were killed in a crash when\na DC10 crashed into a building soon after\ntouchdown. The accident took place at\nMexico City which was covered with thick\nfog. Mexico City has ne of the highest airports\nin the world at 7,300 feet, and is ringed with\nmountains and frequently has poor vis ability but is also one of the busiest Latin-American\nairports.\nTHURSDAY 1\nSPENDING CUTS\nA reduction of \u00a33,500 million in the public\nexpenditure for 1980-81 planned by the\nLabour party is announced in a white paper.\nEducation cuts represent \u00a3412 million of this\nreduction and a cut-back in housing, \u00a3302\nmillion. Also affected are transport and roads,\nnationalised industries and the NHS. The\ndefence, law and order and social security\nbudgets have been raised.\nINCREASE IN POSTAL CHARGES\nThe Post Office announced their intention\nto raise the charge of both first and second\nclass letters by 2p. It hopes to make the\nincrease in February, a month after the\nintroduction of an increase in the charge for\ntelephone calls. The Post Office blames the\nincrease in postman's pay and other costs\nand explains that without the increases the\npostal side would lose \u00a335 million by March.\nFRIDAY 2\nUNION PLANS ACTION TO 'CRIPPLE\nSTEEL INDUSTRY'\nLeaders of the 10,000 strong Iron and Steel\nTrades Confederation have drawn up a plan\ninvolving an overtime ban, a24 hour national\nSUNDAY 4\nSTUDENTS STORM US EMBASSY\nFour hundred students stormed the US\nEmbassy in Teheran and seized one hundred\nhostages who include women, US marines,\nand embassy staff.

'Forthe\nShah'.\nNUCLEAR PACT OFFER\nNato allies propose to launch an arms\nlimitation initiative soon.

    "content": "MUST FELIX BE TURNED INTO A LITERARY\nBATTLEGROUND TO REVIVE OLD GROUSES\nDear Colin\nIt is tempting to over-react to\nShlomo Godsi's letter. It is\nperhaps more tempting not to\nwrite at all - must FELIX be turned\ninto a literary battleground to\nrevive old grouses? The sad\nfashion in Imperial College Union\nthis term appears to be for many\nof its most able and dedicated\nmem be is to dissipate their\nenergies fighting each other - to\nthe ultimate detriment of the\nwhole. Things are rapidly\nreaching the stage where a portion of any muck slung at one\nsticks, unless one screams one's innocence as loudly as possible.\nInstead, I will apologise. No\nmember of IC Union who has\nmade the effort to attend a UGM\nshould EVER feel that the\nChairman had deprived him or her\nof a fair hearing or misjudged the\nmood of i he meeting. Inapropriate though I consider this\nmedium for discussion of such\ntechnicalities, I would bring\nto everyone's attention the\nexistence of Procedural Motion 20\n(xiii) - 'a challenge to the\nChairman's Ruling'. I never heard\none on Tuesday 16 October - it is\nto be hoped that the majority of\nthose attending the UGM on that\nday felt that I was correct in my\ntreatment of the procedural\nmotions I accepted and the one I rejected. After' all, the act of\nacceptance by the Chairman\nmerely gives the meeting a chance to decide for itself\n(definitions of 'democracy'\nbecome twisted when one feels\nthose attending the meeting to be\nacting 'un democratically'). Clause nine of the Standing\nOrders for ICUGMs states that a motion, after being proposed,\n\"shall be open to discussion\nsubject ot Standing Orders.\"\nProcedural Motion No. 20 (i) is:\nthat the question now be put'.\nPresumably this concludes\n'discussion' and that was my\ninterpretation (as was my right,\nand in fact my duty, under\nStanding Order 28, even though it\nnow appears this was at variance\nwith an addendum to Clause 20 on\nProcedural Motions). I quote\nClause 10: \"At the termination of\nsuch discussion, the proposer of\nthe motion or amendment ie Chris\nFox, has the right of reply,\nIMMEDIATELY after which the\nquestion shall be put. \" Anyway,\nas I hope everyone now knows, if\nyou feel you can help me chair the meeting. more fairly, the mechanisms exist - be they via\npoints of order, or information of,\nor a challenge to, the Chair.\nAgain, I apologize for the\ntechnical content of this letter,\nand I think it will be appreciated\nthat, in the midst of this intricate\nweb of detail, the last thing the\nChairman has time to consider is\nhis own personal viewpoint.\nThis brings me to the treatment\nof this meeting in FELIX no. 530.\nSuch sarcastic comments as\n\"many Miners' bread and butter\"\n(Apartheid), \"off they rushed to\noccupy the Senior Dining Room!\"\nand \"magnanimous as ever\" (of a speaker) are hardly consistent\nwith the aims of factual and\naccurate reporting. One expects\nto find such personal views in\n' opinion' articles( with the author's name attached) or in\neditorials (sadly missing from\nthat, and previous editions), but\nthis appeared under' U GM Report'!\nCome on ICU! Why waste\nenergy on internal bickering at a time when Britannia must\nconsider how best to tighten her\ngirdle (sorry Merche) - after all,\nissues now face the Union which\nmake personal vendettas look\npretty trivial. If a Union of nearly\n5,000 members cannot produce\nthe machinery for reaching\nmajority decisions (which are\ninfinitely more important than the\nindividual opinions of Messrs\nBrain, Fox, Godsi or Berry), then\nwho could blame an onlooker who pronounced that\" serious consideration should be given to\nits abolition\"?\nI remain, Sir, defiantly impartial\nMick Berry\nChairman ICU General Meetings\n1979-80\nMATURITY\nFRANK JAMES\nWE LOVE YOU\nDear Colin\nYes the controversy continues! I do not accept that CCUs are\neither tribal' or 'anti-intellectual'\nand suggest that one reason why\nno one has bothered to answer\nthese allegations is because they\nare totally irrelevant.\nCCUs are groups of supposedly\nintelligent students and if there is\nanything wrong with the CCUs,\nthen the fault is inherent in the\nstudents and nothing will be\nachieved by abolishing CCUs.\nI believe that there are two\ncontributing factors:\n1. IC being entirely science based\n(in the broadest sense of the\nword) lacks the enrichment of\nideas from students studying\nmore human matters.\n2. Due to the fairly high standard\nof entry to IC it is probable that\nmany students will be accepted as\na result of having spent large\namounts of time studying at\nschool and who will thus have\ndeveloped very narrow minds.\nI suggest that it is a result of\nthese influences that CCUs have\ndeveloped as they are, almost as\nan escape from reality.\nIf I may be excused the use of a most distasteful expression I'd like to say that the letter from\nSteve Hutchings got right up my\nnose. OK I don't know the facts,\nbut it seems to me that from the\ntone of his letter he appears to be\na power mad prat. Surely a simple\nand absolutely trivial matter like\nthat can be solved without\nthreats? If not, what hope for the\nworld?\nI'd like to claim the prize for\nspotting the deliberate mistake on\npage four of last week's FELIX:\nMONDAY 04 NOVEMBER for the\ncopy deadline!\nIncidentally, how about a hitchhike competition to see who\ncan get the furthest in one day,\nanyone interested?\nI have the pleasure to be\nlan Hodgson\nElec Eng\nDear Sir\nThe subject of my letter is\n'maturity'. Maturity is a wonderful\nthing, it should progress at its own\nspeed, not too fast and not too\nslow. There is nothing in this\nworld as boring as someone who\nhas 'matured' faster than those\naround him, someone who is out\nof place, who has matured too\nearly in life, i am twenty-three\nyears old, older than the average\nundergraduate and I like to think I am not too mature to have a few\ndrinks and enjoy myself in a lively\nand exuberant manner after the\nDear Colin\nIn reply to Frank James' reply to\nmy letter about his first one (this is\ngetting interesting). He stated that\nwe were shouting past each other,\nbut he is the worst offender. I did\nnot answer his criticisms because\nI substantially agreed with them; it\nwas his conclusions that I thought\nwere wrong. Certainly, there are\nmany faults in the CC Us; but he\nappears to be confusing non-intellectual with anti-intellectual.\nMy comment was that the 'non-intellectual' activities of the CC Us actually help students to\nconcentrate better on their\n'intellectual' activities (such as\ndrinking orange juice?), by\nproviding a release from the\nstress built up in an average hard\nworking week.\nMr James, however, has in my\nopinion lost touch with the\naverage student. He is too old and\nboring to take seriously, why does\nhe not realize how mundane his\npatronizing attacks on institutions, which keep the rest of us\nsane, are, in situ t ions he is too\nestranged to understand. I hope\nto be as 'mature' as Mr James\nwhen I am sixty, perhaps.\nYours\nP Dunleavy\npressures of work. None of the\nC CU activities are compulsory, so\nif an individual feels that they do\nnot wish to take part in one, or\neven any, events then that is their\nown personal decision.\nFew, if any, of the CC Us' faults\nwould be corrected by amalgamating them into a single central\norganisation (ie by abolishing\nthem); further problems would be\ncreated and many of their good\nqualities would be lost.\nSincerely\nJeremy Nunns\nPS Frank James clearly misunderstood me last time -1 do\ndrink beer, but only because I can't afford anything better.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK Imperial College Union is proud to\nannounce its Environmental Week. This will\nbegin on Thursday 29 November. At 1pm the\nwill will be opened by Mike Burke from\nFriends of the Earth. At 4:30 the Rector, Lord\nFlowers, will give a talk on energy and the\nenvironment. Later the same day, at 7pm there will be a debate on the motion 'Nuclear\nPower, the major energy source of the future'.\nSpeaking for the motion are Mr LG Brookes\n(Atomic Energy Authority) and Dr Goddard\n(Imperial College). Speaking against are Prof\nJeffery (Birkbeck College) and Prof Scorer\n(Imperial College).\nAs a prelude to the week various articles on\nenvironmental issues will be published in\nFELIX. This week a piece from 'Who Needs\nNuclear Energy?' (published by Students\nAgainst Nuclear Power) is printed as well as a news story from the Evening News on bottle\nbanks.\nGOVERNMENT FORECASTS( OVER CAPACITY)\nThe main argument which the nuclear\nindustry are using is that \"without a major\ncommitment to nuclear power we shall all\nfreeze in the dark\". And further - \"there is no\nviable alternative\". The next section shows\nthat this is ridiculous and extremely\nmisleading.\nThe energy planners at the Central\nElectrictiy Generating Board ( CE GB) have\nmade a big mistake. There is now 40% more\ngenerating capacity in England and Wales\nthan required to meet peak demand on the\ncoldest day of the year. In Scotland the figure\nis an unbelievable 70%. (Both these figures\nallowing for planning margins in case of\nbreakdown.)\nThe CE GB had expected demand to\ncontinue rising exponentially. Sir Arthur\nHawkins, the chairman at the time described\nthe results: \"Our sales of electricity fell away\nso sharply that many power stations had no\nneed to operate even during the peak winter\nmonths....OUR RELUCTANT CONCLUSION IS THAT WE CAN FIND NO CASE ON THE GROUNDS OF ELECTRICITY DEMAND FOR PLACING ANY ORDERS FOR NEW POWER STATIONS OF ANY TYPE FOR ATLEAST SEVERAL YEARS.\"(1976) Apparently his predictions didn't suit the\npowerful interests within the nuclear lobby\nfor he didn't remain in the job much longer.\nConsequently, the means of justifying new\norders have become more ridiculous. Firstly\nthey have closed down a number of small\npower stations, (which could have been used\nfor combined heat and power development).\nSecondly they (CEGB) are raising the\nplanning margins from 28% to 35%. (In USA the planning margins are 15%). Lastly they\nare proposing ridiculous levels of growth in\nenergy demand. The Southern Scottish\nElectricity Board (SSEB) justify the proposed\nTorness nuclear reactor using predictions of\n6% compound growth in energy demand per\nannum (based upon 1974 figures). The total\ngrowth in demand since these predictions\nwere made has turned out to be less than 1 %.\nThe current over capacity in the S SEB area is\nin excess of 7 0 % - what will it be after Torness\nis built? Every region in Britain has a chronic\nover capacity of electricity generating plant.\nThe construction of more power stations to\nfill the famous non-existent energy gap is\ntotally unnecessary at the moment.\n(Students against Nuclear Energy will be one\nof the groups at the Environmental Fair on\nWednesday 5 December, along with CE GB, NC B, FOE, etc, etc. And on the next day the\nRector, David Owen, Sir Derek Ezra, Nigel\nForman, Lord Tanpaw and Mike Robson will\ndiscuss the topic 'An Energy Future for\nBritain'.)\nBANKING UP YOUR BOTTLES\nA bank with a difference opened in London\ntoday. It's a bottle bank aimed at recycling\nglass.\nEventually London boroughs could earn\n\u00a32 1/2 million a year through the scheme.\nBrent Council has launched the scheme by\ninviting housewives to pop their glass\nempties, from pickle jars to whiskey bottles,\ninto bottle bank skips positioned throughout\nthe borough.\nTwo other London boroughs, Barnet, and\nGreenwich will soon be announcing similar\nschemes.\nA spokesman for the Glass Manufactureres\nFederation said: \"There are\u00a32 1/2 million\nworth of glass bottles and jars dumped in the\ncapital's dustbins every year.\nToday's launch in Brent is a major step\nforward in the federation's plans to extend the\nscheme to 200 cities and towns throughout\nBritain over the next two years.\"\nFederation director Oliver Ormandale said\nthe glass recycling potential for London was\nenormous. He estimated that more than 610\nmillion jars and bottles were available for\nrecycling in the GLC area every year.\nThis he said, would earn London boroughs\n\u00a32.45million a year in sales of waste glass to\nmanufacturer es and save Britain the\nequivalent of 5.2million gallons of oil each\nyear in glass manufacture.\nThe Brent bottle banks have different\ncontainers for white and coloured glass. Any\nbottle is welcome, except milk bottles or\nthose on which a deposit has been paid.\n(As part of the week we are collecting waste\npackaging for Friends of the Earth to present\nto the Chairman of the Packaging Council.\nFOE are demanding more effective controls\non packaging, calling for specific codes of\npractice on specific packages.)\nCAVING CLUB\nThe day of parting arrived (last Friday) and,\nwith heavy hearts half of the Fellowship of the\nRung (yes, we had ladders, too!) set off from\nthe Eye-Sea for the caves and tortures ofthe\nKingdom of Wales.\nThe journey was terrible and arduous (and\nboring) but the sturdy vessel Dialavan\nremained fast and firm throughout. On and\non she sped towards (and then past) our\ndestination. With haste (and a map) our\ncourse was corrected and we reached\nCrickhowall, to be met by a band of our\nfellows who had set off not long after us.\nThe night was spent on a dark forbidding\nhillside, surrounded by many weird animals\nknown as she'bogo to the natives. Dawn\nbroke (along with our shelter) and the now\nrested party set off for our goal, the caves of\nFfynnon-Ddu. We were four parties, entering\nby two entrances, with only a guide-book to\ntell us what we might expect.\nDespite the early return of one unworthy\ncave r/ but fair helmsman, and his guide, the\npar lies enjoyed considerable success, going\ndeep into Og of Ffynnon Ddu I and Cwmdwr.\nNo one encountered any Oras, dwarves or\nBalrogs and all returned from their journey\nhungry but happy with the memory of the\nsplendour of the caves. (Unfortunately the\nhoped-for treasure hoard was not discovered\neither.)\nThe night was spent in a well-defined stony\nkeep and the following day, while some of the\nfellowship went yet further and deeper into\nOF D( their party lead by Rangers of the\nmountains), the others explored old mines\n(perhaps from pre-man times) some miles\nfurther into the mountains.\nMyself and a stalwart comrade were\nlookouts while the parties were abroad, and,\nwhen all were again united, many tankards of\ngood ale were emptied (not least by the first\nparty, having met impassable white water\nperils deep into Ffynnon Ddu) and finally\npreparation was made to return home.\nProvisions were taken on board and, guided\nby good sense and a full, bright moon, we\ncame at last to the Eye Sea. Here many tearful\nsundering s occured (until the next time) yet\nall were glad to be home.\nThe Helmsman (guess who?)\n20\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nI feel sufficiently moved by\nMerche Clark's innuendo in the\nlast letters' column of FELIX to\nwrite concerning the vote on the\n'taking of the banner' at the last\nICU Council.\nThe reason I moved that the\nbanner should not be taken on the\nTUC march is that ICU's abortion\npolicy is a total farce. It consists of\nthe entirety of Merche's own\nmotion at last year's AGM and part\nof Barry Austin's amendment, the\ntwo being in absolute contradiction of each other. Hence, ICU Abortion policy states, on the one\nhand, that we should \"instruct the\nNHS to treat medical problems of\npregnancy positively and always\nact with the intention of saving\nboth mother and child\" and on the\nother hand, \"we believe that\nabortion should be available free\non demand up until the date when\nthe foetus would be able to survive\nindependently of the mother.\"\nIt does not take much imagination to see that these two\nitems of policy are mutually\nexclusive, leaving aside any\ndoubts as to when exactly a foetus/baby would be able to\nsurvive independently of the\nmother.\nIn short, I feel there is an\ninsufficient basis here to decide\nwhether we are for or against the\nCorrie bill and hence ICU should\nICU BANNER\nFELIX BIAS ?\nnot be represented on a march\nlike the TUC' s until such time as\nthe policy is clearer.\nI have been badly misquoted by\nMerche and in fact said no such\nthing as \"Abortion is a moral\nissue\" at the Council meeting. (I did, however, say this two days'\nlater to a certain Ms Atten borough\n- could there be some connection?)\nFor Ms Clark's instruction, here\nis the full text of my speech\nagainst her motion to take the\nbanner:\n7 feel that it would be a misrepresentation if the ICU\nbanner were to be taken on this\nmarch. The Corrie Bill is not antiabortion in that abortion under\ntwenty weeks is still not an\noffence. I therefore feel that it\nwould be best to discuss the\nmatter at a UGM in order to\ndetermine clearly whether we are\nfor or against the Corrie Bill.'\nThere is no doubt that Coupcil\ndid make its decision 'without due\nconsideration'; there should have\nbeen much more discussion, but I feel that Merche would have done\nbetter to move one of the many\nprocedural motions available to\nher at the time rather than directly\ndisobey the ruling of Council and\n'swipe' the banner from the Union\nOffice.\nRichard Earl\nPhysics PG Dear Colin\nReading Philip Cole's attack on\n\"FELIX bias\", I was astonished to\nrind that this included the cartoon\non the front page of FELIX, 26\nOctober, \"obviously directed\nagainst those opposing the cuts.\"\nAs the original author of said\ncartoon, I feel obliged now to\nexplain it to Mr Cole. I suppose I should apologise for its lacking\nclarity. It does in fact support\naction against the cuts (I even\ndrew it whilst in occupation of\nSCR). The symbolism of course\nbeing that unless enough is done\nwe will all eventually get to feel\ndrastic effects.\nInvisible a xe:non public proceedings, changes in Tory\nmanifesto policy, etc, etc. Of\ncourse it is taken to an extreme\ncase - the whole idea is to shock\npeople into considering the long\nterm effects.\nI would also like to point out that\nthe original was donated anonymously to FELIX (I'm not\ninto ego-tripping myself) and that\nI'm not about to start wandering\ninto any S Hutchings type\nhysterical law cases versus Pau'\nWilliams (who madea better job oi\nthe drawing anyway, Tal).\nMy main point of course, is that\nMr Cole might be better listened\nto, if he resisted the temptation to\nspend four paragraphs slang ing FELIX.\nYours sincerely\nJulia Musgrove\nChe mEng3 "

This album promises\nmuch but pre-judging from the tracks given\nradio-play ('Playground Twist' and 'Icons')\nwould be a mistake. It's not that good.\nRanging from the gentle melodic, music-box\nbacked 'Mother* to the violent rage of 'The\nLord's Prayer' there is something for every\nBanshees fan, but It's spread thinly.\nWhereas their debut LP, 'The Scream', was\nconsidered over their first year as a band,\n'Join Hands' suffers from being made to order\nand does not sound as polished and refined.\nThere are echoes of the first work but nothing\nhere to match it.\nGood points include the Siouxsie vocals\nand John McKay (who, I'm sure you've heard\nby now if you're interested, together with\ndrummer Kenny Morris, has done a bunk\nsince these recordings were made)'s raunchy\nguitar work. These together with 'Playground\nTwist', an excellent single, although the\nmajority of the record-buying public\nobviously doesn't agree with me, 'Icons' and\n'Mother' make the album worth a listen. But\nthat fourteen minute 'Lord's Prayer' comes\nback to haunt you. I mean Zzzz boring!\nIt's all stylized, gothic, original, extreme,\ninteresting, flawed, dance able( after a fashion) and I like most of it. But I wouldn't buy it.\nJON FIRTH\nBLUE BABY BLUE\nby\nGAY WILD\n(RCA)\nGay was eleven when I first had\nthe pleasure of seeing her. Even\nthen she had big ambitions. Her\ndebut single, 'Blue baby blue' may\nbe an abysmal flop but never mind ...\nshe looks good. It is rare for FELIX\nreviewers to say, \"I'm not reviewing\nthat load of but say it they did.\nHowever, they did not spend\nenough time looking at Gay's publicity photo. Had they realised\nthe energies that fire Gay's wild\nexistence; then the piece of plastic\nspinning on their turntable would\nGil THE\nGOVERNMENT\nINSPECTOR\nOLD VIC\n\"In 'The Government Inspector' I decided\nto gather into one heap everything rotten in\nRussia as I then saw it. all the injustices which\nare perpetrated in those places and\ncircumstances where justice is most required\nof a man; I decided to hold up everything to\nridicule at once.\"\nNickolay Gogol's play 'The Government\nInspector' was supposed to be about official\ncorruption but in the process he reinforces\nthe age old principle of authority being in the\neye of the beholder.\nSmall town fiddling is nothing new these\ndays but the comic premise of authority, or\nlack of it, continues to be appealing in this\nthoroughly enjoyable production.\nWhen the officials of a small country town\nhear that a government inspector from St\nPetersburg is to make an incognito\nappearance amongst them, they panic as\nthey realise what he will find. The hospital is\nsqualid, the Judge1\nhas \"been on the bench\nfifteen years and never yet seen a document\nhe's understood\", the school is staffed by\nidiots and everyone from the Mayor down is\ntaking bribes.\nThe worries increase when a young well-dressed man staying at the local inn starts\nordering everyone about. The Mayor and\nofficials automatically assume this to be the\nInspector and are anxious to appease him.\nFortunately for the young man, in reality\nmerely a clerk with delusions of grandeur, he\ncatches on to the true situation before\nanyone else and in a series of marvellous\nscenes sets about impressing the awed\nonlookers. Boasts of knowing various poets\nrapidly escalate to visits to the palace and\nvery soon he is accepting financial 'loans'\nfrom the grovelling town council.\nhave seemed irrelevant. Gay Wild\ncannot be captured on a mere\nsingle. Wait until RCA release an\nalbum. The cover pic will be enough\n.... forget what's inside.\nTHE STUD\nRecord reviewers\nare urgently\nrequired to review\nawful records\nNever does the performance by Jon Richardson of this snobbish, audacious,\npreposterous pseudo-Inspector become\nunbelievable and Hugh Sullivan as the\ngreasy, sycophantic Mayor (with Yorkshire\naccent, incident ly very Russian!) was also\nvery fine.\nThe beginning of the play must be\nmentioned; a stage on wheels rolled out\ntowards the audience with the leading\nplayers aboard - a novel idea from this\nconstantly innovative Old Vic company. And throughout the play at intervals a spotlighted\nsymbolic coach, suspended above the stage\nand behind the back cloth, brings the real\nInspector towards the town. The production\nof Toby Robertson is witty, pac y and stylish.\nThe whole thing fairly rattles along and surely\ngains from this.\n'The Government Inspector' is at the Old\nVic on November 1, 2,3,16,17 and December\n5, 6, 17 and 18. I recommend it!\nJON FIRTH\n15\n\n"

    "content": "REACTION TO THE ZIMBABWE ARTICLE HAM SOC Dear Jan Czernuska\nI felt I had to correct a few\ninaccuracies in your article\nentitled 'Zimbabwe'. I presume\nyou in fact mean ZimbabweRhodesia, but this is a minor\nmistake, as is calling Bishop\nMuzorewa's party the VANC,\nwhen it is the UANC and has been\nfor several years. Perhaps a misprint in- the marxist\npublications you so obviously get\nyour information from.\nMass murder by Muzorewa and\nhis minions? When and where?\nThe only murderers are Nkomo\nand Mugabes' bandits, who kill\nany innocent African unfortunate\nto be in their way as they rape and\nrob across the country.\nFloods of refugees into\nMocambique? Your sense of\ndirection has gone. If you were on\nthat border you would see groups\nof Africans risk death in the\nminefields to escape starvation\nand 're-education centres' in\nMocambique. And if those were\nrefugee camps we attacked in the\nfront line states, why were those\nrefugees armed and dressed in\ncamouflage?\nMuzorewa was elected by 60%\nof the votes cast (in a large\npercentage poll) and will be the\nvictor in any democratic election\nas the last one was. He will win\nbecause African politics is tribal\nand the Bishop's tribe is by far the\nlargest. Of course the Patriotic\nFront want 50% control of the\ntransitional committee, by the\ntime elections come about only\none of them would be left to\ncontest it, the one who had been\nfastest in removing the opposition\nand his partner. Rather an\nunbiased British Governor and\nBritish peace-keeping force than\na UN force which is not known for\nits neutrality.\n\"Apartheid has not ceased\"!\nWords fail me, does Jan\nCzernuska seriously believe racial\ndiscrimination exists in a country\nwhere the President, the Prime\nMinister, most members of\nParliament and 80% of the\nse curt iy forces are black?

Who\nknows, you might even learn the\ntruth?\nI am a Zimbabwe-Rhodesian.\nLionel Batty\nChem Eng 1\nWHY ONLY POLITICS?\nDear Sir\nI feel I must lend my support to\nMr Pearson's letter in last week's FELIX. ICU seems to have the\npolicy that IC's reputation for\nacademic excellence will attract\nstudents no matter how bad other\nmatters become, hence ICU's bigwigs can get on with what they\nenjoy: messing around with\npolitics. This seems to be rather\nfar distant from the basic aims of a students' union, which are surely\nto represent the interests of its\nmembers. If external politics are\nonly of minority interest, they\nshould be given only minor\nattention.\nHow about ICU tackling the\nfood problem? I paid \u00a35.50 to go\nto a fresher s' dinner, but I'm sure I could have cooked better myself.\nHow about accommodation?\nHaving attempted to sleep on\nconcrete outside the Sherfield\nBuilding while queueing for\nLexham Gardens this year, I am\nnot convinced that anybody really\nwants us to have anywhere to live.\nAs for Frank James: perhaps he\nshould do something useful,\nrather than writing smart letters\n'ILL INFORMED' CAMBODIA MOTION\nDear Sir\nI am writing to correct the ill-informed motion, pre posed by\nJohn Whitehouse on Cambodia,\npublished in the last Exec News.\nThe view that the Cambodia\ndisaster has been caused by the\nappalling Pol Pot government is\nextremely shortsighted. Like any\nother disaster of this nature it has\nbeen caused by prolonged war,\ninstability and violence perpetrated most recently by the\nnazi-style expansionist aims of\nSoviet backed Vietnam. The only\nsolution for Cambodia is peace,\nand this will only come when the\nVietnamese invaders are driven\nback to where they belong. There\nis every probability that the\npresent puppet regime of Heng\nSam Rin in Phnom Phen is just as\nbad as that of Pol Pot, its blatant\ndisregard for human life being\ndemonstrated by its deliberate\nexpulsion of ethnic Chinese as a result of which half a million have\ndrowned at sea.\nBy recognizing the present\nregime we would be falling\nstraight into the hands of\nVietnamese propaganda. The\nrecognition issue is totally\nirrelevant to that of aid, this being\nconclusively by the statement\nfrom Phnom Penh that aid would\nnow be accepted without strings.\nFurthermore recognizing Heng\nSan Rin would further encourage\nthe Vietnamese to invade\nThailand, which they already\nseem to be considering and thus\nspread famine, tragedy and\ndomination to yet another proud\nnation.\nWhile realizing the urgent need\nto send aid to Cambodia, we must\nattack the Vietnamese aggressors\nwith every weapon we have, for\ntheir actions, encouraged by the\nSoviet Union, are no better than\nthose of the Nazis. Thus the\ngovernment must be encouraged,\nnot only to send food to\nCambodia and the refugee camps\nin Thailand, but also to militarily\nstrengthen Thailand against\ninvasion and to support Cambodian freedom fighters, so\nthat a great nation may rise up and\nthrow off the conqueror and live\nonce again.\nWilliam Cortazzi\nChem Eng 1\nand promoting the Temperance\nSeven. I shall spare you my\ntreatise on 'Is sex Anti intellectual?', quite apart from 'Is\nICU Tribal?'.\nYours faithfully\nKen Strachan\nMech Eng 2\nDO WE WANT EDUCATION?\nDear Colin\nAs one of the few surviving\nmembers of the Union's Working\nParty which looked into the\nsubject of 'Higher Education in\nthe 1990s' and as a direct result of\nthe recent discussions on\neducation cuts, I believe that a few\nrelevant facts need to be stated.\nThe Union's response to the\ngovernment discussion document basically reaffirmed two\nideas:\n1. That everyone with the ability to\nprogress to Higher Education\nshould have the opportunity to.\n2. That the HE sector should\nexpand to accommodate the\nbulge in university students\npredicted to arrive in the late\n1980s.3. The expansion in the HE sector\nand subsequent expansion of\nfacilities should be used after the\nbulge has passed on for perhaps\nthe establishment of more four\nyear university courses.\nAt present large members of the\npublic do not fully appreciate the\neffect the present education cuts\nwill have on the HE sector at a time\nwhen it should be expanding!\nWe must ask ourselves, and the\nrest of the general public, do we\nwant education or do we want\nincrease pay packets as a result of\ndecrease taxation ?\nYours\nBernard Smith\nPhysics 3\nDear Colin\nPerhaps you think I should be\ngrateful to you for finally printing\nsomething from Hamsoc, but\nconsidering the tooth-grinding\ncock-up you put in the last FELIX,\nI would have been happier if you\nhad let it drift into the same limbo\nthat our fresher s article slipped\ninto. For the scores of students\nwondering what I'm going on\nabout, I 'll explain.\nSome weeks ago, I wrote an\nAmateur Radio Society article\nexplaining what we're getting up\nto this term, and inviting people to\ncome up and see us. Nothing\nunusual, or too obscene, just a normal sort of 'Societies' article,\nin fact. This was given in before\nthe Monday deadline (in cide n tally, is it true that the FELIX editor\nturns back into a pumpkin after\n5:30pm Monday?), yet when, on\nthe following Friday, I scanned my\nFELIX in the hope of a narcissist\nthrill at seeing my article in print, I was disappointed. It seems that\narms were twisted and knuckles\nrapped so that the issue was\nmainly concerned with the union\noccupation. I can only echo PE Mills' sentiments on that score\nand add that I too was fobbed off\nwith \"It'll be in next week.\"\nNext week arrived, with its\ndouble dose of 'Societies' articles.\nAnd just look what you'd done. In\nthe bottom of the final column you\ntacked in an unfinished fragment\nof the intended Hamsoc article,\nand not the important timetable,\neither, just the introduction. What\nthe hell were you playing at? Had\nyou lost most of the article? If you\nhad, surely it must have been\nblatantly obvious that the sheet of\npaper you had was not the whole\nthing, or perhaps the editorial eye\nwas tired and bleary from\nplanning these 'foreign assign-ment s' that we've been hearing\nabout.\nMaybe you decided to edit it,\nsince you were running short of\nspace. If this was so, wouldn't one\nof Steve Marshall's excellent\ncartoons have been infinitely\nbetter than the clumsy hatchet job\npublished?\nAt any rate, thank you for not\nattaching my name to it, but for\nthe several people who knew who\nhad written the Hamsoc piece,\nplease publish this incoherent\ntirade, so they can stop thinking,\nMy God, isn't that Savage\ncharacter ag it!' or at least go on\nthinking so for other reasons than\nStrange Behaviour on Elec Eng\nRoof.

At this stage the NUS Exec were\nplaying ultra callous by ordering Union banners\nnot to be raised. Yet earlier they had amongst,\nalmost chaos, sanctioned a march along the\npavements from Malet Street without full police\napproval. Thus, as the 400 strong demo passed\nthe DES there were no placards and no banners,\na feature of any successful demo.\nTo applause and clapping the coffin was\nbrought out from Waterloo tube entrance direct\nfrom IC and across the road. It was held high and\nbecame the central focus of the march. That,\nhowever, was as far as it went as the contingent\nnow crossed the Thames, in groups of ten to\nlobby members of Parliament.\nHaving left the coffin in safe keeping (ie in the\nopposite Harlequin record shop) Philip Cole, Ian\nGreenwood and Roger Stotesbury then went on\nto join the lobby queue. At 6 pm, Peter Brooke,\nthe MP for this area, emerged from the chamber\nand discussed for 25 minutes the proposed\neducation cuts.\nBRIGHTON 79\na driver's view\nAn opportunity to drive in the London to\nBrighton Veteran Car Run is a unique\nexperience, and I feel privileged to have been\ngiven the opportunity to drive Boanerges in\nthis annual event.

Waking up at 6am to a cold and\nwet day did nothing to subdue my spirits so I dressed in what I thought would be necessary\nto keep out the cold, and then doubled it.\nAfter a final check at the garage, we loaded up\nthe car and set off for Hyde Park, along with\nSir Hugh Ford, the Guilds Motor Club\nPresident, and Jo Armitage, the Guilds Union\nPresident, were Peter Moody and Victoria\nWestgarth who were to share the co-driving.\nThe enormous crowd in Hyde Park\nincluded a brave band of py jama clad Guilds\nsupporters who sent us off with a hearty\nBoomalaka.

    "content": "IC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER CLUB\nSome of this year's fresher s, fighting the waters of\nthe Thames on Wednesday and Saturday\nafternoons preparing for racing this session.\nAnyone still interested should turn upon these days at 2:00 for some of the best tuition and some fun. All\nraw recruits of both sexes welcome as we have a very strong womens section as well. All welcome\ndown at Putney Embankment.\nIC A Team were supposed to play Guys B at\nhome, but ended up playing QMC, who were\nsupposed to play another team - how about\nthat for organisation. IC won 5-0. Geoff\n'Cuddly' Keymer played first and after keying\nhimself up, latched himself on to a comfortable victory. Second on, was Chris\nTripp, our new star of IC, who averages a50 break, once a week and won easily. Dave\n'Man at C&A' Grassland only s tur gg led a win\non the bal ck because \"I was bored, my heart\nwan't in it\". So much for the opposition. The\nlast two, Teelock and Proudiove, akin to other\nfamous double acts like Aboot and Costellor\nor Laurel and Hardy, both won , but how long\ncan it last.\nA Team: Keymer (Capt), Tripp, Crossland,\nProudland, Teelock.\nThe 3 Team were supposed to play Guys A away, but when the opposition saw 'Bilbo'\nLedezio doing 100mph rec less ly through\nLondon, they must have left the country\nbecause they were no where to be found and\nthe B team played a composite team from\nGuys. The claimed It 5-0, but only won 4-1 in\nTIT-BITS FROM THE WELFARE CENTRE\nRENT ALLOWANCE\nRent allowances are a form of housing sub is dy paid\nby local authorities to impoverished tenants in their\nboroughs. They are based on the fair rent for the\naccommodation exclusive of rates and the rental\nvalue of the furniture (this means that if your rent is\n\u00a318 per week only, say \u00a310 of this will be taken into\naccount. Also, if you are getting a grant they knock\n\u00a38.25 off the rent on the grounds that you can't receive support from two public funds for the same\nexpenditure). After making all these deductions\nthey give you a percentage of what is left.\nThis is not very lucrative in term time but if you are\npaying during the vacation and can't claim\nsupplementary benefit because you don't want to\nhave to sign on in London every week, it can be very\nworthwhile because your income is then greatly\nreduced and so the \u00a38.25 deduction should not\napply. Someone who claimed last year got rent\nallowances totalling over \u00a3100 on a rent of \u00a315 per\nweek.\nIf you would like to claim, contact the housing\ndepartment at the town hall nearest to your\naccommodation and they will let you have the\nappropriate forms to fill in. You can claim a rate\nrebate at the same time as this adds a few pounds to\nyour claim - even though you probably don't pay\nrates separately, you can claim because they are\nincluded in the rent.\nIf you want to know more about the ins and outs of\nhow rent allowances-are calculated, you can find\nout from the Welfare Centre.\nLONDON PROPERTY SERVICES TENANTS\nA large number of people who enjoyed the\nhospitality of LPS last year, found that they had\nsubstantial deductions from their deposits when\nthey came to leave. Something of a misunderstanding seems to have arisen between\nLPS and their ten an at s, stemming from the fact that\na rather inadequate inventory was given to the\ntenants at the beginning of their stay while a very\ndetailed search for tears, scratches and, would you\nbelieve, finger marks, was conducted at the end of\nthe year.\nA possible solution to this problem is to make sure\nthat all marks etc are notified to LPS at the\nbeginning of the year, and if they won't accept it,\nthen a list of these defects should be deposited with\nsay, a bank, so that there is some answer to any\nallegations that might be brought at the end of this\nyear.\nIf you are a LPS tenant and would like to discuss the\nbest way of safeguarding your deposit, you can\nalways come and see me in the Welfare Centre.\n\u2022 MICHAEL ARTHUR\nactual fact. Ledezio played first and with\nexquisite, normal, temper control, won by\nmiles. Tomsk 'four-eyes' Mclelland played\nlike a meagre specimen of excrement and just\nwon by managing to hid a foul .from the\nf referee. The honourable Steve Jeans (from\nWales - so he must be good) won quite easily.\nChris Calvert suffering from snooker it is useless it is played like a won ky television set\nand just won because his opponent was\nwon ki er. Last on, was Dave 'all aboard the\nskylark' Nuttall, who for some stupid reason\nwent in off the bal ck to lose and deserved a good spanking but would have enjoyed it too\nmuch.

An organisation called\n'Save the Marshes Campaign' is fighting the\nplan and would like the marsh declared an\narea of great natural interest, preserving its\nstatus as common land. This being the last\ngenuine marshland along the River Lea, and\nthe only remaining countryside area in the\ndesert of East London.\nWaltham Forest Borough Council, in\nwhose do mian the marsh lies, and Hackney\nBorough Council, whose residents are the\nmain users of the area, have both voted to\noppose the plans. The area around the marsh\nis thickly populated, with few gardens,\nmaking the marsh a valuable public open\nspace. In addition the plans would involve 75-150 heavy lorries per day visiting the site.\nThe marsh area is drained, but probably\nfloods most years. The wildlife content is\nexceptionally valuable. The vegetation, most\nof which is under three foot high, apart fro\u2122\nassorted willows at eh north end and contains\nover 300 recorded species of plants,\nincluding a150 year old reed bed. It supports\nseventeen species of butterfly and a variety of\nbreeding birds including a rookery and a her onry on an island in one of the reservoirs.\nRCS Nat Hist Soc will be visiting the 6 0 ac-e site to assess its value ecologically, and\ngenerally view the site. Any specialist would\nbe especially welcome and we will be leaving\nthe Beit Arch on Saturday 10 November at\n9am and taking luc h in a nearby pub.

The\nJ CR was packed and great fun was had by all.\nThe final fresher s' dinner was held on\nThursday and continued well into Friday\nwhich was spent recovering. Saturday was\nthe day that Guilds went out to measure\nOxford Street, we collected \u00a3250 and after\nmuch deliberation decided how long the road\nwas: 750 Spanners, 800 Mikes, 4.0 x lO Mega\nJos. Only about twenty people came to the\noffice, so they did rather well although w \u00ab\nwant more people to come with us when we\nnext go out: Saturday 17 November on the\nRag Procession.\nBo went to Brighton on Sunday and was\nwelcomed by a storming Boomalaka on the\nsea front but there is an article abut the day\nelsewhere in FELIX, so I won't repeat what\nhas been said.\nEvents coming up:\nSaturday 10, the Lord Mayors/Guilds show,\nyou can go along and cheer us along as the\nLord Mayor follows us through London.\nWe will be having a Union Meeting on\nTuesday 13 at 12:45 in ME542 where there\nwill be a Morphy Day briefing and the trials of\nvarious Exec members for slight misdemeanors during the first part of term.\nWe would also like to see some topics for\ndiscussion or motions given to us before the\nmeeting.\nWednesday is Morphy day, where we go\nout to Putney and throw shit all over RCS and\nMines, won't that be fun.\nSee you at these events and also turn up on\nThursday lunchtime for a monster inter C CU boat race. I'm happy to say that 'The Enid' have finally\nbeen persuaded to headline Guilds carnival,\nso don't bother going to the Rainbow to see\nthem around 23 November. That's the big day\nand when I say big I mean BIG. Supporting\nthe Enid will be two bands 'Wildlife' and\n'Urchin', both of whom play different brands\nof rock music. Trad Jazz band will be opening\ndownstairs and for the first time ever the\nCarnival atmosphere will be completed by a steel band. That's five bands, in total. After all\nthese bands and eating and drinking how\nabout watching a film or two. Well, that'sk the way our minds think anyway, so we have'The\nChoirboys' and 'The Chelsea Girls' for your\nenjoyment.

    "content": "FILM REVIEW\nMONTY PYTHONS\n'LIFE OF BRIAN'\nBy now you will no doubt realise that this is\nthe title of the long awaited biblical romp from\nthe Monty Python team, released yesterday\nfor an exclusive period at the Plaza, Piccadilly\nCircus. Set in Judea at around the same time\nas the life of Christ, it tells the strange and\npreviously totally forgotten tale of Brian\nCohen, a Jewish lad living in a Roman\noccupied land.\nBrian turns out to be the illegitimate son of\na legionnaire (Naughtius Maximus) who at\nbirth was mistaken for the infant Christ by\nthree (supposedly) wise men. Well, I suppose\nit's an easy mistake to make seeing as Brian\njust happened to be born on or around 25\nDecember in a stable, coincidentally situated\nin Bethlehem.\nTt n main saga begins with the adult Brian\nand his domineering mother Mandy witnessing the sermon on the mount.\nUnfortunately Mandy would rather go to a stoning but before they leave Brian spies\nJudith, a beautiful revolutionary and member\nof the People's Front of Judea (an\norganisation dedicated to the overthrow of\nthe Roman Empire within five months). Upon\ndiscovering his parenthood he joins the PF J( not, of course, to be confused with the\nJudean People's Front) and meets their\nleader, Reg. In some hilarious scenes set in a Roman amphitheatre, Stan (a confused\nrevolutionary) discusses with Reg his desire\nto become a woman and have babies; \"But\nStan, you haven't got a womb!\" exclaims Reg\n\"where's the foetus gonna gestate then? Are\nyou gonna put it in a box?\" In the mouth of\nJohn Cleese this is some of the finest Python\never written.\nThe PF J( not, of course, to be confused\nwith the Campaign for Free Galilee either)\naccept Brian after daubs the slogan, \"Romani\nite Do mum\" all over Pontius Pilate's palace.\nThe Romans are not amused and during\nBrian's attempts to escape punishment, he\nhas several adventures culminating in him\nbeing mistaken once again for the Messiah.\nBrian, howe\"er, wants none of it. He really\nwants Judith and trys to convince the\nmultitude which follows him that they don't^> oNT\nVfflo/v V.' really need to be told what to do; \"You're all\nindividuals!\" he cries. \"Yes, we're all\nindividuals!\" two thousand voices echo in\nunison.\nFor those who haven't heard yet the film\nhas had an amazing reaction in the dear old\nUSA. Several religious groups have objected\nviolently to its release and have even formed a 'Citizens Against Brian' group. Personally, I didn't consider it remotely blasphemous. It is\nmade very clear that Christ and Brian are two\nvery different people. Any comparisons made\ncan only be personal. However, if you hold\nvery strong religious convictions you may\nfind the treatment of such things as\ncr uci fiction offensive, so be warned. Remember you do have the choice of whether\nto see it or not. Otherwise I would strongly\nrecommend this as the funniest film in years.\nIt's Python at their glorious best - something\nwhich most of you will not want to miss.\nMark Smith\nWE HAVE Mf\\ DE PROGRESS\\ MOW AUL HE DOES6 SiT ON) THEIR CHESTS\n15 NOV Carrie\n24 NOV Canterbury Tales\n6 DEC Adventures of Barrle McKenzie\n13 DEC Soldier Blue\n10 JAN Convoy\n17 JAN Jabberwocky\n24 JAN The Song Remains the Same\n31 JAN Midnight Express\n7 FEB Catch 22\n14 FEB The Eiger Sanction\n21 FEB If\n28 FEB American Graffitti\n6 MAR 39 Steps\n13 MAR Holocaust 2000\n20 MAR Young Frankenstein\n24 APR 9 Lives of Fritz the Cat\n1 MAY The Strange Affair\n8 MAY Pink Panther\n15 MAY Laserblast\n22 MAY Confessions of a Driving Instructor\nAll films in Mech Eng 220 at 6:30 EXCEPT\nAmerican Graffitti which is In Maths 213.\nENTS\nFILMS\n79 - 80\n8\n\n"
