    "content": "Feature Felix 932 1 May 1992\nWritten, formal examinations\nhave a hallowed place in academic\nlife, and while, from time to time,\neducation a lists have espoused\nalternative methods, they are widely\naccepted as the fairest and most\nefficient means of assessing\nstudents' knowledge and\nunderstanding.\nThe written examination is not\nhowever by any means a precise\ninstrument. It is certainly possible,\nfor example, on individual papers,\nPlaying the examination game\nExaminations are to some extent an\nabstraction from reality, an artificial\nconstruct. They are a sort of game\nin which the participants are invited\nto demonstrate what they know, in\nwriting, on a blank piece of paper,\nin a set time. An important\ncomponent of the game is that the\nexaminer is forbidden to give credit\non any other evidence than that\npresented in the script. It is an\nastonishing fact that despite this\nSome basic and well recognised\ncomponents of a good examination\ntechnique are as follows.\n1. Read the question paper\ncarefully, preferably twice. Errors\nof perception are highly correlated\nwith heightened anxiety.\n2. Select the questions you are\ngoing to answer, put them in order\nExamination Stress\nDon Adlington, Student Counsellor.\nto come up with a 'fluke' result, that\nis a result markedly better than the\nstudent's actual ability would have\nled one to expect. It is also\nunquestionably possible to come up\nwith results that are worse than\neither the student or his teachers\nanticipated, and which do not fairly\nreflect the student's abilities.\nThe risk of systematically\nunder performing in a set of\nexaminations is linked to two\nseparate, but closely related,\nfactors:\na) an inadequate technique for\nplaying the examination game, and\nb) an inadequate recognition that\na formal examination, like any other\ntesting situation, can generate levels\nof anxiety which in themselves may\nhave an adverse effect on\nintellectual functioning.\nelementary point, some students\ninsist on abandoning commonsense\nto the extent, apparently, of playing\nanother game altogether. A common manifestation of this is the\nstudent who spends an hour and\nthree quarters (out of three hours)\nwriting, re-writing, polishing and\nperfecting one answer out of four\nor five required.\nAnother common departure from\nthe rules consists in writing out the\nanswers without properly reading\nthe questions. There are two,\nequally devastating variants to this:\na) not selecting the questions\nwhich opt i mise the candidate's chances of scoring high over-all,\nand\nb) misreading individual\nquestions and subsequently writing\nan answer to a question which, in\neffect, is not there.\nand write out a simple time-table,\nallowing the same time to all\nquestions (assuming the same\nmaximum marks for each). Allow\nabout fifteen minutes for the\nplanning and five minutes at the end\nfor finishing off and checking for\nsimple errors. Some people find\nthat it helps to make quick notes on\neach question at this stage.\n3. Be disciplined in adhering to the\ntime-table. Recognise that the first\nfew marks accruing to a question\ncan be obtained far more easily than\nthe last few\u2014and it is the total mark\nwhich counts. If you get stuck in the\nmiddle of a question leave it and\ndeal with the next one. You can\nalways return to the unfinished\nanswer later, and indeed the very\nact of disengaging from the\ndifficulty may allow a resolution to\n, surface when your mind is actually\nfocused on something else.\n4. Answer the easiest question first,\nso that you can proceed to the others\non a psychological 'high.'\n5. Don't be afraid to make rough\nnotes in your answer book. When\nyou are answering one question,\nideas relating to other questions you\nare going to answer may come into\nyour head\u2014jot them down.\nSimilarly on entering the\nexamination room, and possibly\nbefore reading the paper at all, you\nmay wish to write down very\nquickly salient points which you\nhave memorised in your final\npreparation.\nIt is, of course, essential to rule\nout rough work very clearly, so that\nthe examiner knows that it does not\nform part of your answer.\n6. If you run out of time, tell the\nexaminer so, and say which points\nyou would have gone on to discuss\nif you had more time.\nDealing with anxiety\nA degree of anxiety, accompanied\nby recognised physiological\nsymptoms, is a normal reaction to\ntesting and stressful situations.\nEveryone is affected to some extent\nand should be aware of it. You tell\nyourself that you are anxious, that\nit is natural, and that you can handle\nit. In doing that, you minimise the\nrisk that the anxiety may escalate to\na point where it become disabling.\nAgain there seem to me to be some\ncommonsense ways of handling this\nproblem.\nArrive early\u2014far better be biting\nyour nails outside the examination\nroom, than sitting in a traffic jam\nat Earl's Court. Once you are in the\nexamination room, sit down and\nrelax for a minute or two before\ndoing anything.\nTo a certain extent anxiety is\ncont a geo us. If you feel that this is\na hazard for you, then 'keep\nyourself to yourself before\nadmission to the examination room.\nIt may also be worthwhile resisting\nthe impulse to compare notes with\nall your friends immediately after\nan exam.\nIt is also a good idea in the\nexamination itself, not to let\nyourself be thrown if your\nneighbours appear to be writing\nwith more facility than you are. they\nmay, for all you know, be writing\nrubbish, and in any case,\ninordinately long answers do not\nnecessarily bring the best results.\nThe most common symptom of\nanxiety getting out of hand, is an\noverwhelming sense of panic, a temporary breakdown of our\nrational and ordered response to a demanding situation. In an\nexamination this may, for example,\ntake the form of 'blanking-out'\u2014\ncompletely forgetting everything.\nThe remedy for this is to switch-off,\nclose your eyes, and do nothing for\na while.\nThis is far better than yielding too\neasily to the powerful impulse to\nresolve the tension by giving up\naltogether. When you feel that the\nanxiety attack has abated, try\ngetting your mind working again by\nusing a 'scribble technique'. Just\nwrite down words\u2014any words\u2014\nwhich lead to other words, until you\nfeel that your faculty of recall is\navailable to your again.\nA final point, if you have a history of becoming particularly\nanxious at exam times, or if for\ncontingent reasons you think that\nyou may do so this time, it would\nbe sensible to talk to someone about\nit well beforehand. Tell your\npersonal tutor or your senior tutor,\ntalk to a doctor or nurse and the\nHealth Centre, or come to see me.\nJust a small amount of practical help\nmay make a substantial difference\nin the event. My office is at 15\nPrince's Gardens, and my phone\nnumber is 3041.\n\u2014 10\u2014\n\n"

That last year the Third World\ntransferred $51 billion more to the\nWest in debt payments than it\nreceived in new loans and aid\ncombined.\nICU Further Notes\n1. That the British banks have\nplayed a major role in the debt\ncrisis. In the 1980s they received an\naverage of over \u00a32 billion in interest\npayments a year.\n2. That British banks have also\nreceived considerable tax relief for\ntheir provisions made for non-repayment of the debt, but have not\nactually cancelled any debt. It is\nestimated that the banks have now\nreceived over \u00a3 3 billion in tax\npayer's money.\nICU Believes:\n1. That, without substantial relief,\ndevelopment in the Third World is\nimpossible.\n2. That the debts of the poorest\ncountries should be completely\ncancelled.\n3. That the debts of the other major\ndebtors should be cut by at least one\nhalf.\n4.

In addition, their\npromotional material should not be\npublished in any Union media\nsubject to the same caveat.\nMotion (3) asks that the 'big four'\nnot be allowed to attend ICU\nFresher's Fair and motion (4) asks\nthe same for ICU Career's Fair\nuntil the bank's Third World Debt\nis cancelled.

    "content": "Feature Felix 932 1 May 1992\nFrom the\nNovember 1932\nissue of\n'Phoenix'\nThis element called woman is a member of the human family and\nit has been assigned the chemical\nsymbol WO. The accepted atomic\nweight is 120, although a number\nof isotopes have been identified\nhaving weights ranging from 95 to\n400.\nOccurrence: It is abundant in\nnature; found both free and\ncombined, usually associated with\nman. That found in the UK is\npreferred.\nPhysical properties: A number of\nall o tropic forms have been\nobserved. Their density,\ntransparency, hardness, colour,\nboiling, and melting points vary\nwithin wide limits. The colour\nexhibited by many specimens is a surface phenomenon and is usually\ndue to a more or less closely-adhering powder. It has been found\nthat an unpolished specimen tends\nto turn green in the presence of a highly polished one. The boiling\npoint for some varieties is quite\nlow, while others are likely to\nfreeze at any moment. All varieties\nmelt under proper treatment. The\ntaste varies from sweet to very\nbitter, depending upon the\nenvironment and treatment.\nChemical Properties: Absorbs,\nwithout dissolving, in a number of\nliquids, the activity being greatly\nincreased with alcohol. Absorbs\nseemingly unlimited amounts of\nexpensive foods. Some varieties\ncatalyze the food into fat according\nto the formula PV = NRT. Many\nnaturally occurring varieties of WO\nare highly magnetic: in general, the\nmagnetism varies inversely with the\nChemical Nature of Women\ndensity and size, directly with the\nsquare of the valence, and inversely\nwith the cube of the age. Some\nvarieties tend to form Anne-ions;\nothers cat-ions. Their ionic\nmigrations vary widely. All varieties exhibit great affinity for\nAg, Au and Pt, and for precious\nstones in both chain and ring\nstructures. The valence toward\nthese substances is high and its\nstudy is complicated by the fact that\nthe residual valence is never\nsatisfied. Many stable and unstable\nunions have been described\u2014the\nlatter in the daily press. Some\nvarieties, being highly explosive,\nare exceedingly dangerous in\ninexperienced hands. In general,\nthey tend to explode spontaneously\nwhen left alone temporarily by\nman. The application of pressure to\ndifferent specimen ts of WO produces such a variety of results\nas to defy the principle of Le\nChatelier.\nUse: Highly ornamental.

It is hardly to be\nexpected that her impressions will\nbe unbiased by personal\nobservations; in short the ideas\nexpressed are essentially those of\nthe individual, and must not be\naccepted as the considered opinion\neither of women in general or\ncollege women in particular. Few,\nif any, of you fully realise the\nobstacles we have to overcome. For\nmany reasons the women's colleges\nsuch as Bedford, Girton or\nNewnham have many advantages\nsocially, but after all, most of us\nhave to face the future seriously,\nand the necessity for choosing a career has been forced upon us\nowing to the present economic\nconditions. Women (for the most\npart) are essentially 'synthetic'\nscientists.\nThe frigid and austere\natmosphere during the first few\nweeks in the college strikes one\nforcibly, especially since most of us\nhave come from girls schools where\nwe have been treated as individuals\ninstead of in the 'mass' action way\nof a university. The real difficulty\nis of course the smallness of\nnumbers, which makes any form of\nsocial life and activities an\nun surmountable obstacle. Perhaps\nit would have been better had it\nremained an entirely masculine\ncollege. From the point of view of\nwork it offers many advantages to\nthe student, but there is a wide field\nand a possibility of vast\nimprovements. We may be to\nblame, since for the most part we\nseek seclusion rather than publicity.\nOccasionally we try to serve some\nuseful purpose; we are willing to\nhelp, but it is for you to ask! The\ncollege and its traditions are ours as\nwell as yours, but lack of\nenthusiasm seems to typify the spirit\nof today.\nPerhaps the effect of working\ntogether under similar conditions\nresults in a general apathy towards\ncollege women, and you seek\nchange and new society after\ncollege hours. Sometimes you\ndiscuss and invite criticisms, but for\nthe most part we are relegated to the\nbackground. One wonders\nsometimes whether the college\nwomen are particularly peculiar or\nunusual. It is a debatable point and\nit may be that on first consideration\nthey are, and that, for the majority,\nis the only consideration.\nEven if we are scientists, yet we\nstill remain human. Though\nvictorian isms and chivalry lie\nburied in the past, sometimes we\nmay sigh for those far off days, for\nour ideals are hidden beneath the\nbold front and cynical outlook of\ntwentieth century equality.\nIMPERIAL WELFARE QQLLE\u00a3E ADVISORY SERVICE do you need advice on any of the\nfollowing?\nStudent Loans NHS Charm's Poll Tax Insurance\nHousing Rights Consumer Rights\nLegal Matters Immigration\nHousing Benefit Income Ta\\ Debt Childcarc\nConfidential, impartial advice is offered hv\nStefano Ruis the ICU Welfare Adviser.\nPLUS: a wide range of welfare related leaflets ami\nclaim forms arc available\nCull in BOH lit the\nICI He/fare Office in licit (Iliad\nor phone\n07I SS9 fill est JSII7\n- 1 8 \u2014\n\n"

He\ndeveloped what is possibly the\nworld's simplest climate model. In\nthe Lorenz model the entire\natmosphere is represented by just\nthree numbers and three equations.\nThese equations contain analogues\nto many the large scale effects in the\natmosphere and the model's behaviour, like that of the real\natmosphere, is largely\nunpredictable.\nI say largely. Although the values\nof each of the numbers do not seem\nto follow any simple pattern, their\naverages (the climate for the Lorenz\nmodel) stay remarkably constant. It\nis just that, the numbers never seem\nto reach their average values\nsimultaneously. This has been\ncompared to the atmosphere\n'orbiting' its mean value.\nIt is probably appropriate to end\nthis section by saying that there is\na lot about the present climate that\nwe can 'predict' with current\nnumerical models and, possibly,\nThe great 'Oh\nGod, we're all\ngoing to DIE'\nschool of\njournalism\nmany features of future and past\nclimates too. As the models and\nparameter is at ions are refined, these\npredictions should improve but it\nwill be a long, slow and convoluted\nprocess. Herein lies the problem.\nWe do not yet know what, if\nanything, will happen, but there are\nsome quite frightening possibilities.\nIt is these frightening possibilities\nthat people get to hear about.\nTHE POLITICS OF CLIMATE\nA certain politician was once\ndescribed as having an athletic\nability to jump on to any passing\nbandwagon. This was unfair, not\nbecause the comment was\nundeserved (it wasn't) but because\nit blamed one man for doing what\ncomes naturally to his whole\nprofession. Bandwagon jumping is\nan essential skill for any politician.\nIt was probably inevitable that the\ntheory of global warming would\neventually find its way out of the\nscientific press and into the tabloids,\nand equally inevitable that, when it\ndid, the great and the good would\njump.\nThe first reports of possible\nglobal warming were in the great\ntraditions of the 'Oh God, we're all\ngoing to DIE' school of journalism.\nThese first stories were a gift to the,\nthen politically, obscure Green\nmovement who exploited the\nworries for all they were worth. It\nwould be a bad pun but no\nexaggeration to say that the Green\nParty's amazing performance in the\nlast round of European elections\nwas a 'greenhouse-effect' effect.\nIt was only after the first burst of\npanic that the other, less worrying,\nand possibly more accurate,\nversions of the theory began to\nappear. There has been the\ninevitable backlash.\nThe first counter blast in this\ncountry came from Channel Four's science series 'Equinox' in a programme called the 'The\nGreenhouse Conspiracy'. It was\nlargely based on the views of\nProfessor Richard Lindzen of the\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, a long time opponent\nof the enhanced greenhouse effect\ntheory. Hilary Lawson, the\npresenter, argued that, even if there\nwas no conspiracy to promote the\ntheory, there was 'a coalition of\ninterests... scientists have needed\nfunds, the media a story, and\ngovernments a worthy cause.'\nThe anti-greenhouse campaign\nhas, if not exactly taken off, found\nitself some influential supporters.\nRecently, a Conservative MP, Teresa Gorman, was given a fifteen\nminute slot on BBC Radio to say\nthat the whole global warming\ndebate was a ploy by 'eco-terrorists'\nto keep her away from her car. It\nwas the sort of well reasoned\nargument that should set the\nenvironmental groups off on a desperate search for Ms Gorman's missing marbles.\nThere is a possibility that the UK,\nlike the US, will start to listen to the\nvested interests: the motor and\nmanufacturing industries who do\nnot want the expense of reducing\ntheir C02 emissions. The US\ngovernment has always refused to\ntalk about 'global warming',\npreferring the neutral term 'climate\nchange'.\nThe US anti-greenhouse lobby\nhas some influential friends. The\nThe debate was\na ploy by 'eco-terrorists' to\nkeep Teresa\nGorman from\nher car\nformer White House chief of staff\nJohn Sununu, recently sacked by\nGeorge Bush, was well known for\nhis opposition to environmentalists\nand their calls for reduced\nemissions. It is said that he had a program on his own personal\ncomputer which he thought was\nbetter than any of the large scale\nglobal models.\nIn the UK, the vested interests are\nquieter and more discrete. They are\nnot any less influential.\nThe problem with politics is that\npoliticians need definite proof\nbefore making any sort of decision,\nand this proof is simply not\navailable. With vested interests\nshouting from all sides, the\nargument that 'we should do\nnothing because we do not know\nwhat will happen' becomes very\nattractive. No politician, worth his\nor her job, will accept that it is\nprecisely because we do not know\nwhat will happen that we should do\nsomething.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThanks to Dr Keith Shine for\nreading though this article and for\nhis much needed hatchet job on the\nfirst draft.\nThey thought Christine was dead,\nThey thought the nightmare was over.\n\u00a3 They thought wrong.\n4 4 The best of the ge we, since' Bill and Ted' s Bogus Maintenance Contract and' Blame it on Fuse rUn it'95 Photocopier'9244 Atl S'pence for a coloured A4 and pence for A3 its a must for all dedicated gc reproduce rs?V Bri Babble Random44 Its quicksilver change from colour to black anc white \u2022 at5 pence loran A4 and10 pence' or A3 \u2022 is truly astonishing to see99 \u2022\nTarquin Pretentious From the director that brought\nTOW FUCKUP\nand\nstarring KEVIN COSTLESS KEANU REAMS TONAH BOTTLE ODOR O 'ZONE directed GRATUITOUS BLOTCH\nproduced PHINEAS IRREGULAR music 'BEEP' STOCKHAUSEN photography COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT\ncostume SVENGALI McMAGNOLIA screenplay PROBABLY ILLEGAL flow of consciousness SIGMUND FREUD\ndistribution THE SILKY TASSLES OF SPRING ZEPHYRS\nIMMEDIATE RELEASE AT A FELIX OFFICE NEAR YOU \u2014 1 6 \u2014\n\n"

Sources from St Thomas' Hospital\nand the Charing Cross Hospital\nhave reacted angrily to newspaper\nreports this week that they are to\nclose. The prospect of these\nteaching hospitals being axed was\nraised by the left wing pressure\ngroup, 'London Health\nEmergency.' In their report,\n'Countdown to Crisis', they say the\nconsequences could be the closure\nof 2,000 beds, 100,000 fewer\nLondon operations, and the loss of\n10,000 NHS jobs.\nThe report alleged that a secret\ninquiry, headed by Sir Bernard\nTomlinson, is drawing up a hit list\nof proposed hospital closures. 'We\nare sounding the alarm now, to alert\nthe public to the danger before the\nchanges are announced,' said John\nLister, Information Director of\nLondon Health Emergency.\nThe publication of the report has\nbeen greeted with scorn and\nderision. A spokesman for St\nThomas' Hospital said that London\nHealth Emergency were to health\nwhat the Socialist Workers were to\npolitics. 'London Health\nEmergency never check their facts.\nTheir reports are badly researched\nand generally erroneous. They are\na constant irritation. They are\nprovocative and childish. Their\nreport i is completely without\nfoundation.'\nA spokesman for Charing Cross\nHospital said that the story had\ncaused a lot of worry, but that as\nthe rumour had been going round\nfor over a year, it was about time\nthat Charing Cross was mentioned.\nThe rumour is being fed by the\nuncertainty caused by the\nTomlinson inquiry. Sir Bernard\nTomlinson has been appointed by\nthe Department of Health to look\ninto the provision of health care in\nLondon. The inquiry is not due to\nreport until after the summer, but\nit has been widely rumoured that the\ninquiry is to recommend closure of\ntwo hospitals. London Health\nEmergency has seized on this to\nclaim the existence of a 'secret\nagenda'. This the Department of\nHealth denies. Hospitals minister,\nDr Brian Mawhinney, said 'it is\nnonsense to suggest their is a hidden\nagenda.

Ruban\nRamachandran, the 4th team\ncaptain, should be commended in\nthe way he has conducted himself,\nand his team, this year. Not only\nhas he worked hard to ensure the\nsuccess of his own team, he also\nproduced some thoroughbred 3rd team players and never hesitated in\noffering them to higher teams\nwithin the club.

Both sides\nstruggled in tough divisions, this\nyear, and just when they looked like\ns tabi lising themselves, out of\nrelegation danger, they lost key\nplayers to the 3rd and 4th teams.\nUnder these difficult circumstances\nthey played some good football and\nthe team spirit remained high to the\nend, a further credit to the\nprofessionalism of Andy and Nigel.\nMartin Atherton captained the\n3rd team this year, and compared\nto the 4th,5 th and 6th team, has had\na relatively quiet year, though still\nwith an outside chance of gaining\npromotion. Martin has done well in\nbuilding his side almost from\nscratch, never afraid to experiment\nwith new players.

Italian based 2nd team captain Rakesh Muthoo, put\ninto practise his belief that the short\npassing game is the way to bring\nfootballing success, prompting very\nfavourable comments from referees\non the flair and style of the 2nds game. An intriguing idea of playing\nmidfielders as defenders produced\nboth results for the 2nds and the\nbalance between success for the\n2nds and integration of his side\nwithin the club resulting in some top\nquality diplomacy.

It is significant as the time\nwhen hellenic culture and Science\nmoved eastwards, influencing all\nthe known World.\nThe other famous Greek who\ncame from Macedonia in these\ntimes, was Aristotle, the great\nphilosopher, naturalist and\nphysicist, who was also the\nacademic tutor of Alexander.\nAfter the fall of the Empire of\nAlexander the Great, which\nMacedonia: the facts\n'This article is\nan attempt at\nsetting the\nrecord\nstraight...\nand at\ndenouncing the\ntapestry of\n1ies... The 'Macedonia Question' has\nbeen poisoning the relations\nbetween Balkan nations even before\nthe fall of the Ottoman Empire. Its\nknowledge is one of the major keys\nto understanding the restlessness\nand ethnic rivalry which is the\ntrademark of 20th century Balkan\nand European History.\nThe interests of the Great\nEuropean Powers (with the\nexception of the UK which has\ntaken a fairly uninvolved stance)\nand of the lesser regional powers,\nhaving shifted often during the 19th and 20th centuries, all these nations\nhave played around with the ancient\nHistory, linguistics, geography and\nrecent History of Macedonia, in\norder to support their diverse and\nrival claims on this area.\nThis article is an attempt at setting\nthe record straight, using neutral,\nscholarly sources, and at\ndenouncing the tapestry of lies,\npatiently woven by each country to\nfavour its own interests!\nThe situation today\nBefore getting to the historical\narguments, it is good to know the\npolitical situation nowadays:\nMacedonia is a region of Northern\nGreece: one of the largest regions,\nwith 2,200,000 inhabitants, the\ncapital of which is Salonica\n(Thessaloniki), the second Greek\ncity in size and importance after\nAthens.\nFrom 1944, when Tito, the\ncommunist absolute ruler of\nYugoslavia, re-organised the\ncountry, until last year, there was\na second 'Macedonia', one of the\nconstituent Republics of the\nYugoslav Federation, with 2 million\ninhabitants. Before 1944, this\nregion was known as South Serbia\nor 'Administration of Vukovar'.\nAlthough it is universally\nrecognised that this former\nconstituent Republic is one of the\nless homogenous regions\u2014\nethnically and culturally\u2014of the\nworld; its government now seeks its\ntransform tion into a sovereign state.\nFor this to be achieved, a systematic\nstifling of all political di side n ce, cultural differences and ethnic\nidentities within it. is attempted.\nAncient history of Macedonia\nAccording to the famous ancient\nGreek historian Herodotus, whose\ntexts are the closest to the\nconsidered period reference, the\nMacedonians were these Doric\ntribes which, instead of moving\nsouthwards towards southern\nGreece and its isles, stayed close to\nthe river Haliakmon, at the North\nof the Greek Peninsula. According\nto the Encyclopaedia Britainnica,\nsince the Macedonians were not\nseafarers and had not therefore\ntakers advantage of their coastal\nareas, these were colonised by one\nof the most dynamic Greek cities of\nthe time (750-650 BC), Chalis, on\nthe Greek island of Euboia, a few\nmiles from Athens. The ethnic\ncomposition of Macedonia became\nthence exactly identical to that of the\nrest of Greece. Today, still, the\nmain coastal area of Macedonia, in\nGreece is called Chalkidike.\nThe name Macedonia was first\nconferred to this area by its King\nAmyntas III (reigned 393-370 BC),\nthe grandfather of King Alexander\nthe Great. At that time, Greece was\ncomposed of independent sovereign\ncities (like Athens and Sparta) and\ntheir dependent areas. It had ethnic,\nlinguistic and cultural unity, but no\npolit cal one.\nAlexander the Great gave Greece\nits political unity, through war as\nwell as intricate diplomacy. He can\ntherefore be considered as the first\nKing of Greece.\nHe went further, driving the\nunited Greek army to the East: Iran\n(Persia), Iraq (Mesoptamia),\nAfghanistan, Syria, Egypt and\nIndia. This time (ca. 330-280 BC)\nwas named the 'Hellenistic Period',\nafter the Greek name for 'Greece',\nsurvived him a few decades,\nMacedonia\u2014together with the rest\nof Greece\u2014falls in the hands of the\nRomans (168 BC), then becomes\none of the key regions of the\nByzantine Empire, and falls again,\ntogether with Constantinople,\nAthens and Sparta, to Turkish rule\n(15th century AD).\nModern history of Macedonia\nMacedonia became, as a1 May 1992 Felix 932 Opinion\ngeographical concept, a part of the\nOttoman Empire. In 1828, part of\nGreece gained its independence,\nfollowed by Bulgaria (helped by the\nGreeks) in 1878. In 1912,\nBulgarians, Serbs and Greeks\ntogether liberated the soil of\nMacedonia from the Turks (Modern\nHistory Review). In 1913, the, by\nfar, greatest part of Macedonia\njoined the Kingdom of Greece, this\npart was populated by Greeks,\nexcept for a10,000 strong minority\nof Pomaks (i.e. Bulgarian speaking\nMuslims). Another, much smaller\npart of Macedonia, containing 25\ndifferent ethnic groups, joined\nSerbia. (N.B. All population data\nare meant after the completion of\npopulation exchanges provided for\nby the treaties).\nDuring the First World War,\nBulgaria, siding with the Germans,\nattempted to snatch the Serbian part\nof Macedonia, but it was conferred\nto Serbia again, at the end of the\nwar.\nYugoslavia, the new country to\ninclude Serbia, Croatia and\nSlovenia, was founded in 1929,\nand, at the end of the Second World\nWar, Marshal Tito (a Croat)\nreorganised it into a federation,\ncutting off pieces of Serbia, which\nwas too large compared with the\nother constituents of Yugoslavia.\nOne of these parts Tito cut off and\nnamed 'Macedonia'. It contained of\ncourse, the small part of the\nhistorical region of Macedonia,\nwhich had been conferred to Serbia\nin 1913, but this accounted only for\n30% of the new so-called\n'Macedonia'. The other 70% was\nSerbia pure and simple.\nSerbia had to accept this situation\nuntil Slovenia's and Croatia's succession is t moves in 1990, which\nled to Serbia claiming back its\nformer territory, which she had had\nto surrender under the Communist\nrule, for the sake of the Yugoslav\nFederation which no longer exists.\nThe linguistic question\nThe notion of 'Macedonia\nlanguage' is one of the most\ncommonly twisted and used\narguments, by anyone who wants to\nmake a claim on the area. Here are\nthe facts, according to the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica: when\nlinguistics talk about Macedonian\nlanguage, they refer to an extinct\nancient language, a direct\ndescendent of the com on IndoEuropean, and precursor of Greek.\nMacedonian developed into Greek\nby the 2nd mille nary BC and was\nnever heard again.\nWhat then is the modern Slavic\nlanguage which the Government of\nthe would-be pseudo-' Macedonian\nindependent state' (the former\nSouth Serbia) promotes as\n'Macedonian'?\nThis language does not exist (I have already mentioned the cultural\ndisparity of the region) except as an\nartificial formalism. In fact the\nformer South Serbia speaks dialects\nin the North which are very 'similar\nto the Serbian ones', in the East\nsomething which is 'shading into\nBulgarian', in the West dialects\nwhich sound very much like\nBulgarian, but which change from\ncity to city; 'The central dialects of\nthe cities of Prilep and Vales were\nelevated to the status of language\nduring the Second World War'\n(1940, and were then official is ed by\nTito and formalised by his team of\npseudo-linguists as 'Macedonian'.\nTheir use was then imposed to all\nthe other parts of the new\nConstituent Republic.\nPopulation Statistics\nIn the Greek region of Macedonia,\nthere is. as we said before, a ten\nthousand strong minority of Pomaks\n(Bulgarian-speaking Muslims). The\ntotal pop ul tion of the region being\n2.2 million, the minority represents\nca. 0.4%.\nThe Yugoslavian ex-'Constituent\nRepublic of Macedonia' (i.e. South\nSerbia) has a200,000 strong Greek\nminority (i.e.10% of the total\npopulation). Another 23% are\nethnic Albanians, Bulgarians,\nTurks, Pomaks and Serbs,\nrecognised as ethnic minorities.\nThe remaining 67% are Serbs\nwhich were known as South Serbs\nuntil 1940, as well as a few\nAlbanians and Bulgarians. These\nhave been named by Tito, in 1944.\n'Macedonians': some are proud of\ntheir newly-invented 'identity'.\nOthers strongly refuse this imposed\ntrademark.\nConclusions\nThis ends the presentation of the\nmost relevant facts. Each one can\ndraw from them their own\nconclusions. However, I will,\nreferring in turn to all the previous\nsections, attempt myself to answer\nthe question behind all this: 'What\nshould happen to the former\n'Constituent Republic of\nMacedonia', i.e. South Serbia, now\nthat the Yugoslav Federation is\nfalling apart?'\nTaking historical arguments\nalone, it is clear that the part of the\nregion which corresponds to ancient\nMacedonia (and which still has\n200,000 Greeks in it) should join\nGreece, the rest (the greatest part)\nbeing returned to Serbia.\nAdding to these the linguistic and\ndemographic arguments, we may\nconclude that part of the Serbian\npiece should hold a referendum for\njoining Bulgaria. Indeed, the\nseparation of this territory in three\nparts (Greek. Serbian and\nBulgarian) would be the best\nsolution, not only according to\nInternational Right, but also for the\nfreedom and well-being of its\ninhabitants.\nA small independent state,\nbearing the enmity of all its\nneighbours, would be reduced to\nstarvation and isolationism,\ntherefore totalitarianism. It would\nalso have to oppress all the\nrecognised minorities within it\n(which constitute, as we saw, 33%\nof the total population), for the sake\nof preserving an artificial stat is t unity.\nIs this what Western Europe, and\nthis country in particular, mean\nwhen they talk about post-Communist freedom and well-being\nfor Eastern European peoples? Is\nthis what they mean by respect for\nthe minorities? Is this their version\nof the Truth?\n\u201413\u2014\nW, DON'T LET THE\nSUN\nGO DOWN\nBook now to secure the flight you want at the price you want.

One result of this\nis that, every year, air is trapped\nunder the newly formed layers and\nsimply by taking a cross-section\nthrough the ice it is possible to\nobtain estimated concentrations\ngoing back millennia.\nSee Figure 2: C02\nConcentrations.\nAs you can see from the graph\naccompanying this article, adding\nthis data to the directly obtained\nresults shows that the steady\nincrease in C02 is very much a recent phenomena. Indeed, the\nincrease over the last thirty odd\nyears is almost equal to that over the\nprevious two hundred.\nJust for once, we have a clear,\nunequivocal result.\nIt is the rarity of results like this\nthat makes them so valuable. Most\nobservational evidence could best\nBefore 1853\nthere was no\nstandard method\nfor measuring\nsea temperature\nbe described as 'not inconsistent'\nwith an enhanced greenhouse\neffect. This is why, in order to\nunderstand the climate, we have to\nresort to other means: in particular\nto computer modelling.\nTHE MODELS Naively, it might be thought that\nthe only real way of measuring the\nrelative importance of all the\npossible processes which occur in\nthe atmosphere and oceans is to put\nall of them together into one huge\ncomputer model. This is\nimpossible, not just because we do\nnot know what all these processes\nare, or because such a model would\nbe just too big for any computer,\nbut because it would tell us\nabsolutely nothing.\nClimate research like any science\nworks by simplifying the problem.\nModels have been developed which\nsimulate the growth of a single\nthunder-cloud, or which can\ncalculate the absorption of all\nfrequencies of radiation in a column\nof air. On the largest scale, there\nare models designed to calculate the\nflow of air around the whole surface\nof the planet.\nOn their own, each of these\nmodels can tell us what matters in\none part, in some cases a very small\npart of the atmosphere and in order\nto do so they must all contain cheap,\ncheerful, and not necessarily\naccurate, representations of the\nprocesses they are not explicitly\nmodelling. This is known as\n'parameter is ation.' As an example, you could think\nof the representation of small\nconvective clouds in large scale\nclimate models. A convective cloud\nforms in air in which, although it\ncontains a large amount of water\nvapour, none has yet condensed\nout. If the ground below such a mass of air becomes unusually\nwarm, such as over the concrete of\na city on a sunny day, this can force\nthe air upwards. As it rises, the air\ncools and the water vapour\ncondenses out.\nTypically, one of these clouds\nwill be about a kilometre across.\nCompare this with a large scale\nclimate model which can resolve\nnothing smaller that five-hundred\nkilometres wide.\nWithin this 500km wide box the\nmodel must be able to represent the\neffects of hundreds of these clouds:\nthe incoming sunlight they reflect\nand the rain that falls from them.\nWhat is more, it must get through\nall the calculations as quickly as\npossible.\nThere are schemes available to do\nexactly this. They are not designed\nto be exact physical analogues but\nare based quite deliberately on gross\noversimplifications. Rainfall in a real convective cloud involves\nindividual raindrops forming in the\nbody of the cloud, being carried up\nand down on with the wind,\npartially evaporating and then\ngrowing and so on and so on. In a model, all this complexity can be\nreduced to a statement like 'if there\nis more than a certain amount of\nwater in a given mass of air, the\nexcess all rains out'.\nThese schemes are designed to be\n'tweaked'. A few parameters are\nadjusted to give a result as close as\npossible to that which is observed.\nThere is no guarantee that the\ntweaking, which works for\n9\n> 0.2\nFigure I: Temperature Change; Global Average 1856-1990.\nEarth today, would still be\napplicable if the amount of C02\nwas doubled.\nNearly all the predictions, of the\nconsequences of global warming,\nare based on models like this. It is\nnot a great surprise that they do not\nalways precisely agree. But neither\ndo they totally disagree.\nParameterisation is the mode ller s hot topic. It has been argued that we\nare reaching a point where the best\nway to model the climate may not\nbe to produce models with finer and\nfiner resolution but to work towards\nmuch better estimates of the\nunresolved processes.\nAs I said right at the very start of\nthis article, the climate is, quite\npossibly, chaotic. Even with the\nbest parameter is ation, we will not\nsee a weather forecast for the 14th of March 2050 until possibly the 1 st\nof March 2050. Weather\nforecasting computer mode ller s will\nnot place any faith in their results\nbeyond about two weeks ahead.\nThis does not mean that, as some\npeople have argued, the whole idea\nof using a computer model to\npredict the climate half a century on\nis ridiculous, the results from\nrunning a working weather\nforecasting model for that long\ncould quite rightly be dismissed. A climate model is different.\nIn a weather forecasting model\nthe computer starts with the\nobserved current state of the\natmosphere. It then uses what is\nknown, about the physics of the\natmosphere, to extrapolate forward\nfor a few days to give a prediction\nof, say, rainfall at a particular spot.\nMost climate models are not\ndesigned to do this. The idea of\nsuch a model is for it to run long\nenough to produce an average of the\nweather over a period of time. The\nweather at any particular hour on\n\n"

Jason\nLander\ncontinues his\nlook into Global\nWarming in his\nlast article, on\nthe evidence for\nit\nThanks are due to Dr CF England of the Space and\nAtmospheric Physics group for\nthe photographs.\nPeople have been studying the\nweather for millennia, and deduced\nlittle more than that a red sky at\nnight can cheer up a shepherd.\nScientifically usable measurements\ndate only from the middle of the\nnineteenth century, and even these\nmeasurements bring with them a whole raft of problems.\nThe readings are far from evenly\nspread but instead concentrated in\nwhat would have regarded itself as\nthe 'civilised world' (mostly\nwestern Europe) and, for very good\nreasons, almost entirely over land.\nThere are sea based measurements,\nbut these are prone to their own\npeculiar errors and, concentrated,\nagain for obvious reasons, on the\nmajor trade routes.\nThat is not to say that researchers\nhave not tried to deduce something\nfrom this data. Teams of\nresearchers from the University of\nEast Anglia (UEA), and from the\nMeteorological Office, have\nproduced estimates of global yearly\naverage temperatures going back\nwell over a century. Writing in the\nAugust 1990 edition of 'Scientific\nAmerican', two of the UEA team,\nPhillip Jones and Tom Wigley,\ndescribed a technique that is as\nmuch an art as a science.\nTo produce an accurate record of\ntemperature from the available data,\nthe researchers had to take into\naccount more than just the accuracy\nof the individual readings.\nTemperature can vary over\nhorizontal distances of just a few\nmetres: the atmosphere cools\nrapidly with height. Weather\nstations do not necessarily stay in\none place, and simply moving a site\nslightly down a hill would lead to\na completely spurious warming.\nEven sites which stay put can be\naffected by changes in their\nsurroundings. Those which, though\nthey were once mostly surrounded\nby fields, were engulfed as the\npopulation and the cities expanded\nare prone to what is known as the\nheat island effect.\nHeat is more readily absorbed\nand re-radiated by bricks and\nmortar, than by soil, and large\nurban areas are invariably local\n'hot-spots': another source of\nspurious warming.\nThe measurements of\ntemperature over the sea are sparse\nand bring with them their own\nunique errors. Before 1853, there\nwas no, internationally agreed,\nstandard method for measuring sea\nsurface temperature. Sailors, who\nhad better things to do, used the\nrough and ready technique of\nlowering a bucket into the sea,\npulling it up and putting a thermometer into the water. It was\nthe buckets that gave the\nresearchers their problems.\nA simple canvas bucket is quite\na good conductor of heat compared\nwith, say, a wooden bucket and any\nwater in the canvas bucket will\nwarm or cool comparatively rapidly\nin the open air. In the middle of the\nnineteenth century, scientists began\nto realise the importance of\nstandard ising the readings.\nFor this reason that it was decided\nthat, as part of an agreement to\nshare meteorological measurements\nsigned (where else) in Brussels in\n1853, all ships were forthwith to use\nwooden buckets. The decision was,\nby and large, completely ignored.\nMost ships continued to use 'non-standard' buckets until the 1940s and it was only after the second\nworld war and the invention of the\nplastic bucket that usable data\nbecame available. Jones and Wigley\nsay that the bucket-induced\nc lima to logical error could be as\nhigh as 0.7 of a degree.\nSee Figure 1: the evidence for\nGlobal Warming.\nAfter years of work, the research\nteams believe that they have a series\nof global and hemispheric mean\nland and sea temperatures with all\nthe noise, from expanding suburbs\nand the cooling buckets, taken out.\nThey estimate that their data, taken\nfrom the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury onwards and averaged over\nten years, is accurate to within 0.1\ndegrees Celsius. It quite clearly\nshows a warming of around 0.4\nWe will not see\na forecast for\nthe 14th March\n2050 until 1st March 2050\ndegrees Celsius over the last\ncentury.\nIt can be difficult to see what\ndifference a change this small could\npossibly make: 0.4 degrees is a fraction of the variation in\ntemperature normally found on any\none day.\nThe UEA researchers, with the\nbacking of computer model results,\nbelieve that global warming will not\nbe slow and constant, but will start\noff small and then accelerate. They *\nargue that the 0.4 degrees is not\nworrying for what it is, but for what\nit could become.\nSome researchers believe that it\ncould become a change of up to 5\ndegrees by the year 2050. It is a measure of the uncertainty in the\nsubject that others estimate the\nchange to be less than 2 degrees.\nThe uncertainty over the\ntemperature change, the alleged\nresult of the enhanced greenhouse\neffect, contrasts with the confidence\nwith which we can estimate changes\nin the concentration of the principle\ncause, C02.\nDirect measurements of the\nconcentration of the gas are\navailable for only the last quarter of\na century or so and these show a roughly steady increase.

Eight teams\nhad reached the second phase of the\ntournament, who were all hoping to\nbe the champions and collect the\nfirst prize of a grand shield, \u00a375 as\nwell as mini ture trophies for each\nmember of the team.\nThe qualifying teams were ICFC\n2 (1). Chemical Engineers (2),\nCypriots (3). Snooker 1 (4),\nLebanese 1 (5), ICFC 1 (6), Sikh\n2 (7) and Islamic 1 (8). Each of\nEng (the free-kick experts) played\nICFC 1 (the tournament favourites).\nThis turned out to be a heated affair,\nwith both teams struggling to\nproduces their best form. However,\nChem Eng managed to pull out all\nthe stops and go 3-0 ahead. After\na half time pep talk by captain Marv\nAbdo. ICFC 1 managed to crawl\nback into the game with 3 second\nhalf goals. Full time was creeping\never nearer, with the possibility of\nthe first extra time of the\ntournament being played, when\nICFC 1 scored in the dying minutes\nto win 4-3.\nSo the final was the ultimate in\nGROUP1 TEAM P WDL FA Pts\nChe mEng330033109 Italian 3 2 0 1 1 6 11 6\nPakistan120028210 Computing20020150 GROUP 2\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nI CFC2330046129 Malaysian13201252566 Snooker2310222283 Bridge Club30 o317450 Indoor Soccer Tournament\nthese teams had battled through a three week long gruelling fight in\ntheir respective groups to qualify.\nThe final group placings are shown\nalongside this text.\nEach of the qualifying teams were\nseeded according to their\nperformance in the first phase of the\ntournament (shown in brackets\nabove).

The results\nof the quart-finals are shown below.\nThe first semi-final was contested\nby ICFC 2 (strong on the passing\ngame) and Snooker 1 (the team with\nthe most skilful player in the\ntournament).

I wish\nto make it clear that I am not\narguing that Jonty should have been\ndisqualified\u2014I wish him every luck\nin the future.

The sound\nincreased until amid more smoke\nand dust a tunnelling machine broke\nthrough the floor.

For him, it is a marriage\nof convenience to pass the time\nbefore his next posting. For the\nyoung innocent, it is her life. It is\nthe tragedy of the blind faith of one\nof Japan's most glorious assets, its\nwomen, against the western casual\nlover. Her dogged belief in her\nhusband' is all the more pitiful as\nhe returns with his American wife\nto adopt Butterfly's son Sorrow.\nWith her one last reason to exist\ngone, she ends her desolation by her\nfather's sword.\nThis is not a depressing piece.\nButterfly's eternal enthusiasm\nbeams through her companion's realism. Susan Bullock as Butterfly\ncould never be taken for a15 year\nold Geisha, but then suspension of\nreality is at the heart of such a rending performance. Her vocal\nemotion and dexterity did not fail\nDigging\nfor Fire\nand\nWhite\nWoman\nStreet\nDigging for fire is unfortunately\nno longer showing at The Bush, or\nindeed anywhere. I am mentioning\nit here to bring these points to your\nattention. The play was probably\nthe best I have ever seen, for the\nfollowing reasons. The venue was\nvery good, the company of actors\nwas excellent, and the playwright\na genius in his analysis of human\nnature.\nI therefore ask of you to\nremember the following and look\nout lor them in the future. The Bush\nStar\nWars\nto entwine their audience into her\nexploited world in 19th Century\nJapan.\nDavid Rendall. as Pinkerton,\ngave an equally stoical portrayal,\nevery mannerism and tone\nexpressing his temporary affection,\ndisregarding Butterfly's dedication,\nas she abandons family and religion\nto honour him alone.\nThe set is stark but striking.\nStrident images grasp at the flimsy\nJapanese screens. Pinkerton leaves.\nTheatre, the Rough Magic theatre\ncompany and the playwright Declan\nHughes. Rough Magic will be\nperforming another Declan Hughes\nplay. Love under Bottles, at the\nTricycle Theatre (071-328-1000)\nfrom the first of June. A review will\nbe forthcoming at about that time.\nNow to a play that you can still\nsee. White Woman Street was a small trading town near Ohio. In the\nlate 1800's. it was so named\nbecause of its brothel, which was\nsaid to contain the only white\nwoman for 500 miles. In the\n1890's. a woman was said to have\nbeen brutally murdered there. The\nmurderer was never' brought to\njustice.\nTwenty years later, five outlaws\nare heading toward the town. They\nfollow a man known only a 'Trooper', due to his having fought\nin the indian wars. The play opens\nwith a long monologue from\nTrooper, and as the play continues,\neach character vocalise s his\nthoughts, as well as talking to the\nother.-characters.\nAll but Trooper talk of the gold\ntrain they are to rob there. James\nMiranda imagines himself a 'proper\ngentleman', with enough money\nthat his colour will no longer\nmatter.\nand the abandoned garden returns\nto grey mud. Now it is Butterfly's colour that cheers the drab and\nd is repaired house.\nThis is a glorious and emotive\nproduction - everyone should\nexperience Butterfly.\nThe Dissident\n\u2022 Madam Butterfly runs at the\nLondon Colosseum to June 18th. Tickets \u00a34.50 ( on the night ) to\n\u00a342. All operas are performed in\nEnglish.\nTrooper thinks only of 'a ghost (he) must bury' in the town.\nWhat this means is held a mystery\nuntil the end. Trooper is such a gentle man, yet he feels such guilt.\nWe can only guess why.\nAlthough this mystery lies at the\nheart of the play, White Woman\nStreet is far from a mystery. The\ncore is human nature, how we judge\nourselves, and torture ourselves for\nthe past. In this field, the play is\nhugely successful. Its failing lies in\nanother area.\nTo enjoy a play, film or book to\nthe full, you must be able to suspend\nyour disbelief, immerse yourself\ninto the production, so that you are\nliving it. and become part of it\nrather than just 'watching a play'.\nThe scenery is elaborate at best but\nwatching five men ride across the\nAmerican landscape without horses,\ncan stretch your sense of\nperspective quite severely. Either\nyou can take it, or you can't. If you\ncan then the play is good. If not...\nWhite Woman Street will be\nshowing until the 16th May with a performance for deaf people on the\n7th. The Bush Theatre can be\nreached on 081 743 3388, and can\nbe found on Shepherd's Bush\nGreen.\nStef.\nYes, they're back in the first book\nof the new Star Wars trilogy,\npicking up where the movie trilogy\nleft off. Five years after the\ndestruction of the Death Star and the\ndefeat of the Emperor, Darth Vader\nand the Empire, the rebel alliance\nis in the process of setting up the\nNew Republic. Our old friends\nfrom the films are all busy of\ncourse. Han Solo is now chasing\naround in the Millenium Falcon\nwith the Wookiee. Chewbacca,\ntrying to enlist smugglers to the\ncause. Princess Leia Organa Solo\n(you remember that Han and her\nfinally got it together at the end of\nReturn of the Jedi) is now a diplomat and trainee Jedi and Luke\nSkywalker is still a wish y was hy dreamer even if he is a Jedi now.\nAnyway, while the heroes are all\npottering around in their new\nRepublic, things are stirring in the\nEmpire's little corner of the galaxy.\nThings like a Grand Admiral with\namazing tactical prowess. Things\nlike a clone of one of the old dark\nJedis. Things like a massive store\nof Empire technology and long lost\nmilitary secrets. Things like little\nfurry snakes which can cell out all\naffects of the Force ('May the force\nnot be with you' I suppose!).\nBefore we get very far the\nEmpire is making its comeback.\nOut come the Star Destroyers and\nTIE fighters, X Wings and Star\nCruisers and the battles begin again\nin the same old War. To make\nthings even more interesting, a little\nbit of unrest in the New Republic's council is thrown in for good\nmeasure and we find out that Leia\nis carrying two Jedi twins which the\nempire is out to kidnap.\nThis is an exciting read, full of\nall the sort of action we've come to\nexpect from the films. It certainly\nkept me enthralled with plenty of\nthrowbacks to the original trilogy\nand an excellent sense of continuity.\nI recommend this book to all Star\nWars fans and sane people alike. As\nfar as more possibilities go, it's been nearly fifteen years since the\nfirst Star Wars movie and I do\nwonder if we will see Mark Hamil,\nHarrison Ford and Alec Guinness\nagain in a new set of films. Well\nthey did it for Star Trek.\nFoB.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
