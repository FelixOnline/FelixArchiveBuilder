I don\u2019t have the deep\nintrospective banter that Matt usually\nfills his column with and you\u2019re in the\nwrong section if you\u2019re looking for answers to those puzzling questions that\nhave been plaguing your mind recently\nlike, \u2018what is the meaning of life?\u2019 (Al-though I suggest you try Az\u2019s fantabu-lous games section for that one. I\u2019m\npretty sure there are pages and pages of\nit and I hear it\u2019s really good) or, \u2018would\nthe US economy be brought to a standstill if reporters were no longer allowed\nto print news about Britney Spears?\u2019\n(I vote yes). I do, however, have some\ngood old music reviews and news for\nyou to sink your Nescafe-stained teeth\ninto. Enjoy. And remember, it\u2019s music,\nbitches!\nIn music news, Jacko is having a\ndouble whammy this year. Not only is\nhe approaching the big 5-0 (although\nyou probably couldn\u2019t tell by looking\nat him) but his classic best-selling al-bum, Thriller, is turning twenty-five.\nMichael therefore has two aims this\nyear 1) To show us it is possible to be\nsexy, happy, relevant free-spirited at 50\nand 2) To remind us why he is hailed as\nthe King of Pop.\nTo cash-in celebrate, Thriller is being recycled re-released with 7 bonus\ntracks and artists set to feature include Kanye West, Akon, Fergie and\nwill.i.am. You should be shot if you\ndon\u2019t already own a copy of Thriller\nso it just remains to be seen if the new\ntracks justify buying the album. Keep\nchecking Felix music for a review once\nthe album drops in February.\nIn more Jackson news, Janet is preparing to make her umpteenth come-back. She is set to release her 10th\nstudio album, titled Discipline, next\nmonth and has already shot a video\nfor lead single Feedback (See opposite\nfor a review). The music video is awe-some, in case you were wondering, so\nYouTube it now. Peace.\nJemil Salami\nMusic Guru\nB\nefore achieving mainstream success with the\nNe-Yo-penned Let Me Love\nYou, Mario was annoying.\nI mean it was obvious he\ncould sing his ass off but he could never\nseem to get his hands on the right ma-terial. This is probably why his debut\nalbum, despite being marketed to teen-Do you like my style? A fan-made replica of Feedback\u2019s cover art\nI\nt\u2019s been quite a while since Janet\nhas had a hit album. Her previous two efforts, Damita Jo and\n20 Y.O. both underperformed\ncommercially. It would be very\neasy to put her lacklustre sales down to\npatriotic Americans still being mad at\nher after the Super Bowl stunt, and to\nbe fair, MTV and TRL refusing to play\nher videos would undeniably have had\nan effect on her record sales, but the\nbottom line is that both fell short in\ncontent. That\u2019s the only way to explain\nwhy they also bombed in the European\nmusic markets and why the \u2018wardrobe\nmalfunction\u2019 hasn\u2019t slowed Justin\u2019s attempt at world domination. You\u2019ve got\nAlbum Review: Mario\u2019s 3rd studio LP is finally released. Check it out\nage girls (and we all know they\u2019ll buy\nanything if it has a half-decent looking\nguy on the cover), sold so poorly.\nIt looked like Mario would disappear into the abyss that swallowed the\nlikes of Mario Winans (still have night-mares) and Eamon (remember him?\nMan did he suck). But fortunately, not\njust for Mario but for us too, he had\nwhat is in all honesty an urban classic\ndropped on his doorstep, and the rest\nis history.\nThere was always going to be pressure on his next release. It would give\npeople a chance to see if he\u2019s an artist\nworth watching or just another flash in\nthe one-hit-wonder pan. It was pretty\nobvious that there were only two ways\nthis could go: 1) He\u2019d recruit Ne-Yo\nagain to make an album of rehashes of\nLet Me Love Yous or 2) He\u2019d be so eager\nto stray away from the image that he\u2019d\nend up doing something wildly differ-ent. Fans were dying to know which\ndirection he\u2019d pick and then the release\ndate finally arrived. But there was no\nalbum.\nGo! is finally going to be released\nan entire year after it was initially\nsupposed to drop and you can\u2019t help\nbut wonder why it was shelved for so\nlong. With Ne-Yo\u2019s name not appearing once in the credits, it became clear\nthat Mario has traded his clean-cut Let\nMe Love You image for a more grownup and overtly-sexual persona and nowhere is this more evident than on the\nhyperactive Neptunes-produced title\ntrack Go! on which he uses enough\nexpletives to make Lil\u2019 Kim blush. It\u2019s\nvery different, works surprisingly well\nand doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome.\nThe rest of Go! (the album) is more\nlaid back and consists of well-crafted\nballads like Why, a worthy cover of\nKeith Sweat\u2019s Right and a Wrong Way\nand of course the single Crying Out\nFor Me all of which showcase his vocal\nability brilliantly. He even manages to\nshine on the Stargate-produced How\nDo I Breathe despite it sounding uncomfortably similar to some of the production team\u2019s other recent projects\n(Rihanna\u2019s Hate That I Love You and\nBeyonce\u2019s Irreplaceable).\nOther notable tracks include Kryptonite, which features a rap from the\nup-and-coming Rich Boy and sees\nMario comparing his weakness for other girls to Superman\u2019s weakness to the\ngreen stuff, and the Akon-produced\nDo Right \u2013 a song about his mother\u2019s\ndrug addiction. Go! is easily his best album to date and is a must-have for lovers of contemporary R&B who find the\nlikes of Beyonce a little too pop-ish to\nhandle. A new video for Do Right can\nnow be viewed online.\nJemil Salami\nSingle Review: Feedback\nMario in the studio\nJanet Jackson\nFeedback\n(Mercury)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nto admire her though. She\u2019s right back\nup on that horse and is set to release\nstudio album number ten, titled Discipline, in February.\nFeedback, the first single taken from\nthe album, doesn\u2019t quite come close in\nbrilliancetoherhitsinglesofyesteryear\nlike \u2018Got \u2018Til It\u2019s Gone\u2019 or even \u2018Someone to Call My Lover\u2019 but it\u2019s definitely\nher best work in quite a while. Coproduced by Rodney Jerkins (Brandy\u2019s\nWhat About Us?, Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Lose\nMy Breath), it has a futuristic giddiness\nto it and coupled with the super-catchy\nhook it is the perfect track to embarrass yourself on the dance floor to.\nThe most exciting thing about this\ntrack, though, is the video. It\u2019s artistic and quite slow for the first half but\nonce Janet lands in the milky stuff and\nbegins her choreography, she kills it.\nIt\u2019s so good that MTV has been forced\nto scratch her name from the blacklist\nand jump right back on the we-love-you-Ms-Jackson bandwagon.\nHistory tells us that this by no means\nindicates a good album but things do\nseem to be looking up for Janet and she\nseems to know what she has got to do\nthis time around so don\u2019t rule her out\njust yet. Janet is set to perform Feedback at the Grammys next month.\nJemil Salami\nJackson Cover Art: MJ\u2019s Thriller 25 (top) and Janet\u2019s Discipline\nMario\nGo!\n(J Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank must deal with an economy in free fall as well as political infighting\nCan we see peace on the horizon?\nC\nonflict in Israel, or Palestine if you prefer, was one\nof the defining features of\nthe 20th century, and its\ncontinuation in the 21st\ncentury stands as a regretful monument to humankind. I will not label\nthe Palestinians as terrorists; nor will\nI condemn the actions of the Israeli\nstate; those wishing to reinforce their\nprejudices should read elsewhere. Is\nthere a realistic route for peace in the\nfuture? I believe that there is, but it\ndoes not lie in a two-state solution.\nIn a rather tedious way I must reiterate the basis of peace in the Holy\nLand, as has been iterated countless\ntime by various world leaders; an end\nto violence is paramount. The situation as is it now makes this goal substantially more complicated than it\nwas a mere 10 years ago. While in the\npast U.S. leaders have put a lot of effort\ninto ending violence in the Holy Land,\nfor example under Bill Clinton, the\ncurrent administration has neglected\nthis conflict and thus lost credibility\nas a peacemaker. Also, there are now\ntwo separate groups who have a hand\nin deciding the fate of the Palestinian\npeople; the Islamist Hamas that has\ncontrol in Gaza and the secular Fatah,\nwhich has control in the West Bank.\nThis makes the problem of ending\nviolence more difficult. Firstly, because gaining a meaningful ceasefire\nagreement is much easier when you\nonly have to deal with one group, but\nrealistically this alone does not turn\na molehill into a mountain. Secondly,\nand more importantly, for violence to\nend Hamas must stomach its aversion\nto dealing with Israel while Israel and\nthe U.S. must stomach their aversion\nto dealing with Hamas. However we\nshould not exaggerate this issue and\ndeceive ourselves that this is impossi-ble. Hamas and Israel have previously\nheld a ceasefire and in fact currently\nHamas is seeking a ceasefire with Israel.\nInfrastructure minister Binyamin BenEliezer and transport minister Shaul\nMofaz have both said that Israel should\nbe receptive to a ceasefire with Hamas.\n\u201cIf Hamas comes to us with a serious\nproposal for a long-term truce, in my\nopinion Israel should not reject it,\u201d Mr.\nBen-Eliezer told Israeli public radio.\nDespite my optimism, I concede that at\npresent neither side has shown the political guts to work seriously for peace.\nIsraeli PM Ehud Olmert has ruled out\na ceasefire with Palestinian Islamist\nmovement Hamas unless it recognizes\nIsrael and renounces violence. \u201cThis\nwar will continue,\u201d Mr Olmert told his\nministers. a Hamas spokesman also\ndenied it was considering a truce. \u201cIt is\nup to [Israel] because when they stop\nall their aggressions we will then discuss the issue.\u201d\nThe Israeli government argues that\nallowing refugees to return to their\noriginal homes (many of which are\nin what is now Israel) would create a\nPalestinian majority and undermine\nIsrael\u2019s status as a Jewish state. Critics\nof the right to return state that Palestinians were made homeless because of\nthe Arab-initiated 1948 war. However,\nseveral UN resolutions call for refugees to be permitted to return to their\nhomes \u201cat the earliest practicable date\u201d.\nLittle progress has been made on what\nis perhaps the most difficult issue.\nRegardless of the differences on both\nsides, progress is steadily being made\non the issue, and despite suspicion\nfrom some quarters, both sides generally agree that a peaceful solution\nis mutually more beneficial than constant conflict.\nTension between Iran and the U.S.A\nhas, in some ways, made the peace\nprocess more difficult. The U.S. and\nIsrael are distracted from the goal\nof peace and instead feel their national security is threatened. Hamas\nis regarded as a proxy fighter for Iran\nrather than a representative of the Palestinian people and so this conflict is\ninterpreted as a proxy war against Iran\nrather than a tragedy that requires a\nrapid peace. Iran does not act in the\ninterests of the Palestinian people. It\nperpetuates the violence by supplying\nweapons and funds to militants. The\nuse of this conflict by both sides as a\nproxy war is highly damaging to the\npeace process and obviously the lives\nof Israeli and Palestinian people. There\nis an unexpected benefit however of\nWith a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Kadhim Shubber investigates a possible route for peace\nFrom top: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin\nand Ismail Haniya\nWith over 1,000 active members in its military wing Hamas\nis the largest and most influential\nPalestinian militant movement.\n2 years ago this month Hamas\nwon the Palestinian Authority\u2019s\n(PA) general legislative elections.\nThey defeated Fatah, the party\nof Mahmoud Abbas, the PA\u2019s\npresident. Hamas grew out of\nthe Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political organization\nfounded in Egypt in the 1960s,\nHamas\u2019 founder and spiritual\nleader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,\nstarted Hamas as the Muslim\nBrotherhood\u2019s local political arm\nin December 1987, following the\neruption of the first intifada.\nHamas combines Islamic Fundamentalism with Palestinian\nNationalism. Its founding charter\ncommits the group to the destruction of Israel, the founding\nof an Islamic state in Palestine.\nHamas devotes much of its estimated $70-million annual budget\nto an extensive social services\nnetwork. \u201cApproximately 90 percent of its work is in social, wel-fare, cultural, and educational activities,\u201d writes the Israeli scholar\nReuven Paz.\nHamas is believed to have killed\nmore than five hundred people\nin more than 350 separate terrorist attacks since 1993. The group\nuses mortars, short-range rock-ets, and small arms fire as well\nas suicide attacks.\nHistory and facts on Hamas\nthe tension surrounding Iran. Other\nArab states, seeking to counter-act the\nrising power of Iran have been more\nwilling to co-operate with Israel. This\nwas seen at the Annapolis conference\nin December. Israel often feels threatened by its Arab neighbours and this\nhinders peace, therefore by bringing\nthe Arab states closer to their Jewish\nneighbour, Israel will gain the confidence to pursue peace with the Palestinians. It remains to be seen whether\nrenewed co-operation with Arab states\nwill re-assure Israel as much as tension\nwith Iran concerns it.\nPrevious ceasefires and peace agreements have come to nothing. Despite\nthe many summits and opportunities in\nthe past that seemed to point towards\npeace, we still find ourselves no closer\nto the light at the end of tunnel. The\nOslo Peace Accords are the most public example in our lifetime of high-level\nmeetings resulting in little progress on\nthe ground, due to in part the actions\nof Hamas. What will make a peace\nagreement work? Instead of agreeing\non terms through which the Palestinians and Israelis will be divided, the\nexact opposite should be done.\nIn comparison to the economic\ncondition of the UK, the Palestinian\nterritories\u2019 situation is appalling. The\nunemployment rate is approximately\n35 percent in Gaza but slightly lower\nin the West Bank. Import and export is\nessentially a non-entity with the Gaza\nStrip\u2019s only import being humanitarian aid. I do not wish to trivialise the\nissue, but the cause of this miserable economic situation is rather easily summed up. It is the isolation of the\nPalestinian Territories due to ongoing\nviolence and the restriction on travel\nand trade imposed by Israel. Israel\nhas destroyed Gaza\u2019s airport and harbour while keeping its people behind a\nRecently, Israel has tightened\nit\u2019s grip on the Gaza Strip. Restrictions have been placed\non fuel imports resulting in\nGaza\u2019s only power plant going offline. U.S. Secretary of\nState Condoleezza Rice urged\nIsrael to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza; she joined a\nlarge number of nations condemning Israel\u2019s actions. She\ndid add that, ultimately, Hamas\nwas to blame for the situation.\nHumanitarian\nCrisis\nHamas militants armed to the teeth\n\n"

There are also\ntwo positions available on the recently\nformed Trustee Board and eight NUS\nAnnual Conference delegate positions\nup for grabs.\nAny Imperial student can stand in the\nelections. All they need to do is log on\nto the Union\u2019s website at www.imperi-alcollegeunion.org/vote and put themselves forward. Nominees then require\n20 \u201cseconders\u201d, in other words, 20 other\nImperial students or friends who must\nlog on to the website and recommend\nyou as a worthy candidate.\nThe nominations period lasts for two\nweeks so students have plenty of time\nto decide whether they want to stand\nor not. In next week\u2019s issue, Felix will\nbe interviewing and grilling the current Sabbatical Officers about their\nexperiences so far, hopefully to give\nthe rest of the student body an idea of\nwhat it is like to be in such a position of\nresponsibility.\nStudents who successfully manage to\ncajole 20 people into seconding them\nwill subsequently embark on a month-long election campaign. Nominees\nwill have to come up with an election\nmanifesto by Friday 15th February,\nwhich will be published on the Union\u2019s\nwebsite, in Felix and on Live! (live.cgcu.\nnet).\nDuring February there will also be\ntwo Hustings, where nominees will\nhave to give short speeches about what\nchanges (if any) they intend to bring to\nthe Union and justify why they are up\nto the task of taking over their respective mantles. The second half of each\nHustings involves questions from the\nfloor.\nEventually voting opens on Friday\n22nd February and lasts until Tuesday 26th February. During this time,\nnominees will be out and about around\ncampus canvassing students for their\nvotes.\nNominees should pencil in the Tuesday 27th February as the Final Candidates meeting where the results will be\nannounced. However, judging by previous Sabbatical elections which have\nspiralled into theatrical farce due to\ncomplaints of foul play between com-petitors, this date is liable to shift into\nMarch.\nIf you want to stand, put yourself\nup for nomination by visiting\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nvote from Monday onwards.\nGood luck to all participants\nLast year\u2019s winners and this year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers\nElection results at last\nResults were finally announced for\nthe Presidential election on Thursday lunchtime, completing an election period that has been characterised by Felix\u2019s favourite five letter\nword: farce.\nThe next Union President will be\nthe well-known anti-NUS figurehead at IC and Felix Comment\nEditor, Stephen Brown, who beat\nthe current Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), Jon Matthews, to take the position.

Mr Brown and\nMr Matthews both received several hundred more votes\nthan the \u2018outsider\u2019\ncandidates; Diogo\nGeraldes (he who\nheld a sign up over\nMr Matthews head\nat hustings reading\n\u201cWTF?\u201d) lead the loser\u2019s field, picking up 179\nvotes, presumably from people\nwith a sense of humour.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 25 January 2008 felix\nPolitics\nMore\nimmigrants\nplease!\nThe country\u2019s full! We\u2019re storing up\nproblems for the future! Immigrants\nare blood-sucking, benefit-stealing,\nlazy terrorists! Any idea what these\nstatements have in common? Let me\nadd another to help you: \u201clike the Roman, I seem to see \u2018the River Tiber\nfoaming with much blood\u2019\u201d. That is a\nquote from Enoch Powell\u2019s \u2018Rivers of\nBlood\u2019 speech and the thing that they\nall have in common is that they are all\nbullshit.\nThose of you who have a copy of the\nDaily Mail in your bag will be aghast at\nmy statement; luckily, due to the mul-ti-cultural and well-educated nature of\nImperial students, you are a minority.\nImmigrants are economically benefi-cial; you are free to dispute this, though\nyou run the risk of embarrassing your-self. The Economist recently reported\n\u201cWithout migrants, the greying and\nincreasingly choosy populations in\nmuch of the rich world would already\nbe on the decline today.\u201d One estimate\nin 2004 of the impact of letting an extra 16m migrants into the OECD club\nof rich economies suggested that the\ngain to the global economy would be in\nthe order of $156 billion. There may be\nstrains on local public services - at least\nuntil bureaucrats catch up and allocate\nresources according to the larger local\npopulations. Problems with the prison\nsystem, NHS and crime in Britain today are just those; and to label immigration as the cause simply distracts us\nfrom the true roots of the problem.\nThe thought that we can just build\na fence and watch NHS waiting lists\ndisappear is very comforting. It is\nhowever, equally delusional when you\nconsider the strain smoking, drinking\nand over-eating put on public services.\nWe are all scientists, and as scientists\nwe must look at the facts. Opposition\nto immigration is simply ignoring the\nfacts.\nUnfortunately, the facts of immigration don\u2019t actually make a difference\nto politicians devising immigration\nlaw. More important to rational government decisions, it would seem, are\nthe nonsensical ranting of the tabloid\npress. The horrifying story of an illegal immigrant who wasn\u2019t deported is\nmore important in the public mindset than the tangible economic gains\nof international migration. Everybody\nat Imperial will have experienced the\nbenefits of migration either directly,\nthrough friendship and their own experience as migrants, or indirectly\nthrough a high standard of living (a\nquick scroll through your contact list\nwill remind you that your life would\nbe worse if not for immigration).\nCertainly there are immigrants who\ndo not integrate or learn English, but\nthese are not symptoms of a system\nheaded for disaster; rather they remind\nus that - like the readers of the Daily\nMail - close-minded idiots come in all\ncolours, creeds and religions.\n40km long barbed wire fence. It is not\nfor nothing that Gazans regard themselves as prisoners in the world\u2019s largest\nopen-air prison. For Israel too, there is\na harsh economic cost of the current\nstatus quo. While the uninformed often disregard the effect of the conflict\non Israelis, the impact of the Second\nIntifada in 2000 was dramatic, including a cessation of economic growth\nan increase in the extent and depth of\npoverty. Israel suffers from the conflict\nand from financing its involvement in\nthe conflict.\nIs there anything to be gained from\nthese statistics? Both Israel and the\nPalestinian people suffer economically\nfrom the conflict. Please no applause,\nI beg you. What is important is that\neconomics provides both an incentive\nfor peace and also the glue that will\nhold peace together. Once begun, it\nbecomes self-sustaining. If the Palestinian territories are able to produce\nand export goods then links are established with the wider world, wealth is\nproduced and greater prospects are\nopened to the Palestinian people. With\na stable economy, a stable job market\nand stable future then militant groups\n\u2013 those who wish to destabilize the\nregion through violence \u2013 will lose\nsupport.\nThe economic angle has another important part to play. Isolation between\ncommunities is one of the biggest per-petuators of conflict in this region. Israelis and Palestinians develop prejudices against each other based on the\nworst atrocities of the conflict. These\nprejudices are not easily destroyed.\nThe West Bank Barrier physically separates Israelis and Palestinians, for ex-ample, but there are also no trade links\nor other connections between these\ntwo peoples. By encouraging and initiating trade and commerce between the\nPalestinian Territories and Israel then\nthese links will begin to exist. Palestinians and Israelis will interact daily with\neach other through business, initially,\nbut as this regular contact has an effect also in friendship. Today the Palestinians and Israelis lose tremendous\namounts from conflict but fear and\nprejudice allow them to justify these\nlosses. Their leaders have been unable\nto make peace but it is not at high-level\ntalks that this conflict will end. It will\nend as these communities come closer\ntogether on a long-term basis through\ntrade. Instead of justifying their losses,\nan opportunity should be presented\nfor them to justify moving past this tit-tat conflict with long-term economic\nbenefits.\nOff the coast of Gaza lie at least $2\nbillion in undeveloped gas reserves.\nThis provides the basis for the future\nof economic development in Palestine\nAs stated earlier, the division be-This will probably be the first\ntime you have heard about\ngas reserves off the coast\nof Gaza. BG Group Plc was\nmeant to drill for natural gas\n36 kilometers off of the Gaza\ncoast, in an area that was designated as PA territory following the Oslo Accords. The gas\nwas meant to then flow four\nkm underwater in a pipeline\n850 meters below the surface\nto an Ashkelon refinery. The\nfield, which BG purchased in\n2000 and to which Hamas now\nclaims rightful ownership,\ncontains 1 trillion cubic feet of\nnatural gas worth an estimated $4 billion. If Israel were to\nbe the main purchaser of Palestinian gas exports it would\nrepresent a win-win situation.\nThe Palestinians would have a\nguaranteed purchaser for their\ngas, one that would generate\n\u00a350 million a year for 15 years\nin tax revenues, and provide\nthe foundation for sustainable\neconomic growth. And the\nIsraelis would have a secure\nsource of affordable gas to\nunderwrite their economy\u2019s\ngrowth. However the deal\nwas scuppered due to Israeli\nfears that revenues from the\ngas development could fall\ninto the hands of its enemies\nsuch as the various militant\ngroups that operate in Palestine specifically Hamas.\nIs there really gas off Gaza?\ntween Fatah and Hamas complicates\nthe matter. In the West Bank, Fatah\nhas made leaps and bounds in terms\nof good governance. The Palestinian Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, has\nwon Western plaudits through his efforts to put Palestinian finances on a\nnew footing - and root out corruption.\nHe has announced plans for a sewage\ntreatment plant in Gaza and a number\nof projects in the West Bank, including an industrial park in Jericho and an\nindustrial zone in Hebron. However\nwhile in the West Bank Mr. Fayyad,\nan internationally respected moder-ate, is in charge, in the impoverished\nand overcrowded Gaza Strip, the other Palestinian Prime Minister, Ismail\nHaniya leads an organization regarded\nas terrorist by the EU and U.S.A. Since\nHamas took over Gaza, leading President Abbas to choose another Prime\nMinister, Salam Fayyad, Israel and the\nU.S. as well as international donors\nhave tried to undermine, bring down\nand skirt around the authority of Hamas. This action has been taken under\nthe assumption that Hamas will not\nmake peace readily and instead must\nbe forced economically and militarily.\nDefinitely Hamas has proved itself as\na force against peace, it showed an effective veto over the peace process\nlaunched by the Oslo Peace Accords\nby launching suicide attacks. However\nthe isolation of the people of Gaza does\nnot persuade anyone to come to the\nnegotiating table, instead it reinforces\nthe mentality of conflict and gives justification to those who label Israelis as\nthe enemy. The economic stranglehold\non Gaza is simply driving people to\njoin Hamas, if only because it is one of\nthe few employers left. After decades\nof conflict the defiant streak of the\nPalestinians still exists, coercion simply hardens attitudes and reinforces\nprejudices. Hamas can be dealt with in\na peace process; currently they act as\nthe defender of the Palestinian people.\nRemove the impetus to fight through a\nceasefire and they will be forced to act\nas the provider of the Palestinian peo-ple. The reason why they were elected\nwas not because Palestinians were affirming their support for terrorism;\nit was because Hamas were seen as\nhonest and capable of providing basic\nservices. Instead of forcing them into\nconflict, we must force them into good\ngovernance.\nThe most important tool of peacemaking is the unshakeable will to\nreach an agreement. There are many\nsigns that neither the Israeli nor the\nPalestinian government possesses this\nwill. Israel\u2019s role in preventing the exploitation of Gaza\u2019s offshore resources\nleads one to the conclusion that Israel\ndoes not want the Palestinians to stand\non their feet economically while Hamas and other groups seem more than\nready to allow their people to wallow in\npoverty than build a sustainable future.\nThe most important thing, more important than a ceasefire or economic\nco-operation, is that these two peoples\nhave representatives that share their\ndesire for peace.\nIsolation is the fuel that drives this\nconflict. Israel isolates the Palestinian\nterritories due to security concerns,\nand by isolate I mean denies freedom\nof movement to Palestinians and prevents the Palestinian economy from\nfunctioning. This isolation leads to\ndesperation and desperation can end\nnowhere except in violence. First these\nsecurity concerns must be addressed.\nHowever the mistakes of the past must\nnot be repeated, we cannot wait for\npeace before peace talks. Israel must be\nprepared to negotiate with its enemies\nand appeal to the Palestinian people\nthrough economic assistance. A two\nstate solution is a misnomer. There\ncan be no solution as long as the Palestinians and Israelis are kept separate.\nThe Israeli state will remain suspicious\nof its neighbour and continue to have\ntotal control over it while the Palestinian people will continue to rue what\nthey see as the greatest injustice in\nmankind\u2019s history. There is no inherent animosity between the Jewish and\nMuslim faith, only that which exists\ntoday because of association with the\nPalestine-Israel conflict. The future of\nsustainable peace is one state for both\nPalestinians and Jewish people. A state\nfor the Jewish or Palestinian people\ncarries an inherent discrimination that\ncould only lead to conflict, conversely\nan inclusive state will lead to peace, understanding and an end to this chapter\nof human history that reveals the worst\nwithin us all.\nJerusalem is a barrier to the two state solution, with both sides claiming it as their natural capital. For both Jerusalem is a sacred city.\nSamuel Black\nPolitical Know-it-all\n\n"

There\u2019s\na snuff container made of an entire\nram\u2019s head from nineteenth-century\nScotland. Near it is a box containing\na selection of glass eyes. I also find a\ngall bladder (possibly Chinese, the\nlabel says) and a fragment of Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s skin. Not to mention an entire mummified male body from medieval Peru, curled up in the corner.\nThere are items that really make you\nwonder how they got there. Like the\ndeath mask of Benjamin Disraeli. Er...\nmight he want that back? And then\nthere\u2019s Napoleon\u2019s toothbrush. There\u2019s\nalso a whole glass case of sex. Such\nitems probably belong down a side\nstreet in Paris. \u201cStatue of a copulating couple\u201d, \u201cfigurine depicting sexual\nforeplay\u201d, \u201cstill life with concealed erotic scenes\u201d, \u201cJapanese sex aids\u201d... Henry\nWellcome was clearly a very dirty old\nman. The phallic amulets are unmissable \u2013 ornaments of penises with legs\nand wings, hailing from Roman times.\nMedical history wouldn\u2019t be medi-Left: the Medicine Man gallery filled with dead bodies and penis amulets. Right: yes, it\u2019s a penis. With legs and hooves. This is what old Henry Wellcome was into, it would seem\ncal history without a healthy helping\nof blood and guts. Medicine Man does\nnot disappoint. There\u2019s a top notch\npainting of a Victorian woman midway through popping out a baby. Plus\nif you\u2019re squeamish, you won\u2019t like\nthe nearby case of metal instruments.\nKnives, saws and a staggering array of\nbirthing forceps. Nice. This case almost puts \u201ctorture chair\u201d to shame.\nNow, I could rant and rave about the\nunequalled brilliance of the Wellcome\nLibrary, but I\u2019ll try to keep it to a mini-mum. If you\u2019re studying medicine, biology or any kind of history of science,\nI guarantee you\u2019ll find all the books\nyou\u2019ll ever need here. For everyone\nelse, this is a blissfully quiet and comfortable place to work, complete with\ncomputers and Internet access. Never\nagain will you have to beat people off\nwith a stick to get a library desk around\nexam time. You can turn up at any time\nand register for free. They\u2019ll even take\nan unflattering photo of you and print\nit on a handy swipecard.\nThe Wellcome Collection is like the\nScience Museum, but mixed with a\nsplattering of art. It has the advantage\nof being more compact \u2013 you can easily work your way round all the galleries in a few hours. Something I very\nmuch appreciate is the relative absence\nof small children running about under\nyour feet, even at weekends. A trip to\nthe Wellcome Collection would make\na sophisticated, intellectual but fun\n(and free!) day out for any future doctor or scientist.\nThe Science of sleep and dreams\nThe Wellcome Collection\u2019s current exhibition explains why sleeping through your lectures might one day\nearn you a Nobel Prize. Emily Wilson stumbles about in the dark to find out. Zzzzzzzz...\nW\nhy do we sleep?\nWhat purpose does\ndreaming serve?\nThese are some\nof the questions\nwhich the current Wellcome Collection exhibition, Sleeping and Dreaming, seeks to answer. To answer these\nquestions, simply enter the imposing\nglass door to the left of the information desk as you walk into the building.\nYou will feel a blast of cold air as you\nwalk in \u2013 the exhibition space is noticeably cold. You\u2019re also plunged into\nnear-darkness, which isn\u2019t too helpful\nwhen you\u2019re a journalist trying to take\nnotes. But, on the bright side, there to\ngreet you are some giant sleeping faces\nprojected on to the walls.\nSo what\u2019s in Sleeping and Dreaming?\nMuch like the rest of the Wellcome\nCollection, it\u2019s a trendy fusion of science and art. There are paintings and\nsculptures of people sleeping, images\nof dreams, but also medical instruments and footage from experiments.\nSome of the artwork is deeply sinister.\nA painting about narcosis by Richard\nTennant-Cooper from 1912 is fuck-off\nscary in fact, showing little green men\ntorturing a naked, sleeping man. Apparently it portrays the fears aroused\nby temporary loss of consciousness.\nWell Richard, until now I had no such\nfears. \u201cDie nacht/der traum\u201d by Battista\nDossi (1544) is more amusing. A sleeping woman is surrounded by an owl, a\nrooster, a lobster waving a flag and a\nbearded bloke about to whack her over\nthe head with a stick. Also good is \u201cA\ndandy fainting\u201d, a cartoon by Robert\nCruikshank from 1835. The caption\nseen it before (it\u2019s become somewhat\nof a clich\u00e9 recently, I think) and I don\u2019t\nwant to revisit the scene with the eye.\n*Shudder*. However I love \u201cDream\nPaintings\u201d by Jane Gifford (2004) \u2013 144\ndifferent miniature paintings of her\nvarious dreams.\nMy personal favourite is number\nfourteen, described as: \u201cI saw Gordon Brown carrying a mug of \u2018Covent Garden\u2019 carrot and coriander soup\nacross the courtyard\u201d. Other exhibits I\nappreciated were the display cases of\nSleeping and Dreaming: it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s dark, it asks too many questions, but you might just learn something\nreads \u201cthis caricature pokes fun at the\neffeminate behaviour of English dandies who wore their clothes too tight\nand swooned upon hearing a castrato\nsinging\u201d. As you do, really.\nBut the science is just as interesting.\nThere is an interesting section about\nthe development of electroencepha-lography (EEG), which allowed brain\nactivity to be recorded for the first\ntime in the 1920s. It apparently revolutionised sleep research and medicine.\nThe information is accompanied by\nfootage from a sleep laboratory. I was\nhoping somebody to start sleepwalking\nor sleep-killing-spree-ing, but it\u2019s just\npeople snoring in bed. Shame.\nI also found it fascinating how many\nscientific discoveries have been made\nthrough the dreams of their creators.\nAugust Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz attributed his discovery of the ring-shaped\nstructure of the benzene molecule to a\ndream he had in 1861 or 1862, which\nfeatured a snake twisting and turn-ing. On 17th February 1869, Dmitri\nMendeleev dozed off and in his dream\nhe saw a table in which all the known\nchemical elements fell into place. Two\nweeks later he published the Periodic Table. And in 1920, Otto Loewi\ndreamed the design for an experiment\non the transmission of nerve impulses.\nHe discovered neurotransmitters and\nwon the 1936 Nobel Prize for Medicine. Such evidence showing the importance of sleep to science, is surely\na perfect defence for anybody caught\nsnoozing through lectures.\nCarrying on the dream theme,\nthere\u2019s a looped showing of the Salvador Dal\u00ed film \u201cUn Chien Andalou\u201d. I\u2019ve\nmodern sedatives (Nytol, Sleepeaze),\ndevices to prevent snoring (SnorBan,\nAntiSnor \u2013 so originally named) and\nstimulant drinks and tablets (Red Bull,\nRelentless, several mysterious Japanese\nproducts). However, the \u201cHeadthinker\u201d sculptures by Laura Ford (2003),\nsleeping children with donkeys\u2019 heads,\nare ghastly and their role in the exhibition seems to be little more than filling\nempty space.\nOverall Sleeping and Dreaming is\ngood, but not very good. It is of a very\nhigh standard considering it\u2019s free to\nview, but I much preferred their previous exhibit, The Heart, which filled the\navailable space impressively and had a\nbit more substance to it. This exhibition just keeps on asking questions.\nWhat happens when we are asleep?\nIs life without sleep possible?... But I\ndidn\u2019t come away from the exhibition\nfeeling any of them had been answered.\nPerhaps Wellcome need to spend less\ntime making us think and more time\nteaching us something.\n\n"

The aim of\nthe night was to meet up with friends,\neat well, enjoy comedy and raise money\nfor the Edhi Foundation.\nSHAAM 07 was very well attended\nby both students and families, and the\norganisation was excellent.

As\nMasters students, there is some debate as to whether we are allowed to\nbuy and eat food in the SCR. However,\nthis \u2018gentleman\u2019 (he declined to give his\nname) obviously thought otherwise,\nand told us to leave. After we politely\nasked if we could at least finish our\nlunch first, he proceeded to man-han-dle us out of our seats whilst subjecting\nLetter to the Editor\nMan-handled\nand kicked out\nof the Senior\nCommon Room\nS\ntudent journalism is A Good\nThing. Let\u2019s put that onto\nthe table right there, before\nwe get too far into this one-sided conversation between\nyou and my fine self. Student Journalism is A Good Thing, and when I envisage the world collapsing under the\nstrain of nuclear war with only the core\ntenets of human society remaining\nintact, I like to think that dry-roasted\npeanuts will still be the snack of choice\nfor the discerning gentleman, and that\nstudents who can string seven words\ntogether will still continue to write entertainingly for their fellow slackers.\nHowever, I think it\u2019s fair to say that\nReal Journalism is not the same as Student Journalism. Here are some ways in\nwhich Felix, for instance, differs from a\nreal publication \u2013 first of all, Felix isn\u2019t\nhugely reliant on anyone. It has adver-tisers, sure, but they\u2019re largely unrelated to anything they write about and the\nincome isn\u2019t the only thing that keeps\nit going. Felix also is running in a one-horse race. If you want to read something written by students, for free, in\npaper format, then you\u2019re picking up\nFelix. No competition. No stress. And\nmost importantly, no other outlets for\nbudding student journalists.\nNow I\u2019m not one to tootle my own\ncor anglais, but I\u2019ve been lucky enough\nto experience both of these worlds. By\nday, I\u2019m a mild-mannered freelance\njournalist, and by night I don black\nleather and a gimp mask and write\nsomething like this for something like\nFelix.\nIf the self-appointed title of \u2018freelance\njournalist\u2019 makes you think of me as an\narrogant retard then you\u2019d pretty much\nbe right on the money, but nevertheless it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m\npaid, on regular intervals, to produce\namounts of words for others to read.\nIt\u2019s a completely different experience\nfor writing aimless rants in a student\npaper, and it\u2019s possibly why I found last\nweek\u2019s article in Felix Games a little bit\nwide of the mark.\nFor those of you too cosmopolitan to\nbe caught reading the Games section\nof Felix, even though you secretly really\nwant to, last week it covered the scandalous \u2013 if slightly old \u2013 story of a one\nus to verbal abuse.\nThere are two points I wish to make\nconcerning this incident. Firstly, to address the behaviour of the individual\nconcerned, I was somewhat shocked\nby the arrogant and patronising behaviour coming from a member of Imperial College staff. Obviously he had\nnothing better to do during his lunch-break than talk down to people like an\nirate headmaster.\nMoving on from discussing superiority complexes, I come to my second\npoint. Is it really necessary to segregate\ntaught Masters students from the rest\nof the postgraduates? I would like to\nknow the reasoning behind this. As a\nthirty-two year old with a PhD (from\nImperial), MSc, six years industry experience and studying for a second\nMSc, I consider myself mature enough\nto sit and eat lunch for thirty minutes\nwithout making a scene. I am also paying (some might say pay-rolling members of College staff?) a substantial\namount of my own money to be at Imperial, so I rather resent being treated\nlike a school child when I want to eat\nmy lunch.\nThe SCR and Junior Common Room\nare both busy at lunch time. Allowing\ntaught Masters students into the SCR\nis not likely to cause the whole system\nto collapse though (I should also imagine that the caterers would be quite\nkeen to have the extra customers).\nOne-year taught Masters students are\npostgraduates just as PhD students\nare. I understand that Imperial runs\nmany four-year undergraduate Masters courses, but these are still undergraduate courses so I do not include\nthem here. It\u2019s an issue of attitude. To\nhave segregation between postgraduates seems to me to be divisive and just\nplain daft. Where is the forum for intellectual development and exchange\nof ideas within the postgraduate and\nacademic community at Imperial? The\nCollege should be encouraging such\ninteractions, not making us feel like\nchildren.\nDr David Stacey MSc DIC\nMr. Jeff Gerstmann, a games journalist\nwho was last year dismissed from the\nhigh-profile website GameSpot. The\nstory goes that Gerstmann reviewed\nblockbuster title Kane and Lynch\nand gave it such a low score despite\nthe game garnering huge advertising\nrevenue that the website sacked him.\nGameSpot denied that this was the\ncause, but then they would, wouldn\u2019t\nthey because they\u2019re the evil corporation and that\u2019s exactly what they want\nyou to think.\nAt this point I\u2019d like to make sure noone\u2019s getting turned off by the mention of \u2018games\u2019 and so we\u2019re going to\nabstract away the product and pretend\nthat we\u2019re talking about the \u2018Object\u2019\nindustry, where journalists review and\nwrite about \u2018Objects\u2019 so that you, the\npublic, might decide to pay money in\nsome way to read their words about\nthe \u2018Objects\u2019.\nFuck it, I\u2019m calling them games, you\ncan abstract it yourself.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that people\u2019s reaction\nto Gerstmanngate has been less than\nrational. The media, or rather \u2018the bits\nof the media who give a toss\u2019, covered it\nwith usual aplomb and overuse of inflammatory headlines, and most blogs\ntook the opportunity to wax lyrical\non the ethics of journalism and, of all\nthings, the integrity of the games in-dustry. Which I assumed was a sarcastic joke until I began reading past the\nopening paragraphs.\nHere are some things that no-one\never mentions when they attack large\nmedia outlets \u2013 and I\u2019d like to point out\nthat this goes for film, music, theatre,\ntelevision, food; whatever kind of reviewing you like, my personal experience being the first in that list.\nFirst of all, Gerstmann wasn\u2019t a boat-rocker all of his life. In case I didn\u2019t\nmake it clear, the implication people\nmade after his being fired was that\nmost reviewers will tack on an above-average score to please publishing\nhouses even if it means lying to the\nreader, and that Gerstmann was some\nkind of loose cannon who chose to\ndefy convention. Well, he wasn\u2019t. Gerstmann was the kind of guy who gave\nsuper-generic button-masher Tekken\n5 a score of 92%. He was the sort of\njournalist that thought lazily designed,\nlowest-common-denominator stuff\nlike Unreal Championship 2 was worth\n9 points out of 10. Gerstmann was like\nevery other games journalist, he just\nguessed wrong when it came to Kane\nand Lynch.\nSecond of all, although you see Gerstmann\u2019s review as critical and uncen-sored, this was only because there was\nno-one directly above him editing his\nwork, because he was the editorial di-rector. The kind of high-level censorship that was seen after his dismissal\n\u2013 his review was edited by GameSpot\u2019s\nhigher-ups \u2013 is endemic among lower-level journalists. If you review a game\nand your editor thinks you made the\nwrong call, your opinion is going to get\nchanged. Sure, they\u2019re not going to add\n40% onto a score. But they can easily\nturn a few negative-sounding phrases\ninto a positive one and add an extra\nmark out of ten on. The only difference\nis that no-one notices and even fewer\npeople would care.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, is\nthat people are suddenly complaining\nthat media monoliths such as GameSpot have too much power. Internet\nswinging dick CNET took control of\nGameSpot over seven years ago, the\nowners didn\u2019t wake up one winter\u2019s\nmorning last November with a dark\nsuit on and a white cat in their arms.\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to do most of\nmy writing for media groups with\nless complicated chains of command.\nCNET is a group so large and so hungry for advertising revenue, that anyone visiting them in serious search of\njournalistic integrity is like an Aztec\nvisiting a Medics\u2019 Bar Night looking\nfor a virgin sacrifice.\nWhat puzzles me most, however, is\nthat this isn\u2019t a monopoly, like Felix, and\nit\u2019s not a place where advertising isn\u2019t a\nbig deal. It\u2019s on a high-profile website\nthat\u2019s slap bang in the middle of the\ninternet. The Internet slings opinion\nand up-to-the-minute news at you like\na monkey at the zoo and even though,\nas with the monkey, most of what\u2019s flying at you is shit, it\u2019s not that hard to\nfind alternative sources of opinion or\ncomment. GameSpot aren\u2019t \u2018signal[ling\nthat] this type of thing is acceptable\u2019.\nThey just made a PR cock-up at executive level. I can understand people\nwanting to make the gaming world\nmore exciting than it really is, but even\ngeeks should have their limits.\nEditor-in-Chief Tom Roberts\nresponds:\nThank you for writing in Dr Stacey. I\nhope you\u2019re not too badly bruised! Your\nletter came as a surprise to me for two\nreasons: firstly because of the appalling\nbehaviour of the staff member you described and secondly because I had assumed that MSc students were allowed\nin the Senior Common Room anyway.\nI have always thought of the SCR as a\nplace for postgraduate students and as\nyou say it seems incredibly daft to segregate them from each other.\nOne possible explanation the Felix office came up with is that MSc students\nare forbidden from the hallowed SCR\nbecause lecturers don\u2019t want to be hassled by them whilst they\u2019re eating their\nlunch. It seems like a pretty feeble explanation though and I\u2019m interested to\nfind out what the real reason is.\nWhat do you think, dear readers?\nShould MSc students be allowed in the\nSCR or left to mix with the undergraduate paupers in the JCR?\nGames Editor, Azfarul Islam\ncomments:\nFelix being a rather independent body is\nwhat encourages us to speak our minds,\nengender constructive debate and bring\nforth what we feel is necessary. It\u2019s\ndefinitely a place where opinions from\nacross the spectrum are appreciated.\nConstructive opinions, in particular.\nAnd to be fair, the discussions were\nfrom three different perspectives. I\u2019m\ntalking about the actual status quo of\nthe commercial bodies that govern this\nmedium, Sebb speaks of the reviewing\nconundrums and Samir waxes lyrical\nabout consumerism in this niche.\nWe\u2019re not complaining about media\nmonoliths possessing much power, we\nknow they do.\nAnd, oh, sure. Hurray for the bigwigs.\nLet\u2019s all rally up and give \u2018em a big\nThumbs Up\u2122 so that Small-\u2018n\u2019-Squishy\ncan keep charging snide amounts for\nits Bazaar and Sunny can make overpriced products all under the guise of\nmedia convergence. Huzzah.\nAh, sorry.\nJust had to.\nGames Editor Sebastian Nordgren\ncomments:\nThe gaming public isn't martyring Jeff\nGerstmann \u2013 he's not the saviour of\ngaming reviews. Nor are we surprised\nor outraged that review scores have and\nwill always be fudged a bit by upper\nmanagement (though I do question how\nCNET knows that Kane & Lynch was\nbetter than Gerstmann claimed it was,\nhaving presumably never played it). No,\nthe issue at hand is one of escalation.\nYes, advertising dollars have always\nplayed their part in review scores, but\nnever before have they got anyone fired.\nIt's a worrying trend by any standards,\nespecially if corporate swinging dicks\neverywhere gain momentum from it.\nThe idiot is whinier than the sword\nLisa\n\u201c\nIt was\ncovered by the\nmedia with the\nusual aplomb\nand overinflam-matory headlines\n\u201d\nShould MSc students be allowed\nto use the SCR?\n\n"

    "content": "Hidden depths: down the rat hole\nJarvist Frost provides us with the riveting report of a Caving Club expedition underground\nW\ne stagger our\nway up the path\nweighed down with\nbags of rope and\nmetalwork, passing\nthe toddlers being carried to see Father\nChristmas at the Ingleborough Cave,\nour comedy yellow PVC suits cracking\nin the sub-zero temperature. The sky is\na perfect blue from horizon to horizon,\nthe bog frozen beneath our feet.\nIt was the first caving day of our\nWinter Tour and this was our plan: To\nsplit into two groups and rig separate\nways down into the enormous Gaping\nGill cave system, meeting in the main\nchamber and swapping routes - going\nout on each other\u2019s ropes. The others\nset out across the moor on a compass\nbearing, while we hop over a fence to\nprotect the unwary from the stunning\n110m waterfall.\nA last recheck of our gear, a few nervous grins, and we dive in. We start by\ncrawling down an old dry entrance, a\ndistant roar becoming a thud pounding\nthrough the limestone as we approach\nthe underground stream. We regroup\nperched in the middle of this torrent\nand I attach our bags with 150m of\nrope between them to my harness.\nA few short pieces and soon we approach the monster. Swinging from\nceiling bolt to ceiling bolt, judging\nlengths and tying rope as I go. Finally\nout above the main drop, below is an\nutter maelstrom. The river pours over\na jagged lip and unravels into disordered streams, ricocheting off the\nwalls as it plunges down. To go straight\ndown would be suicide - the hurtling\nwater would first batter and freeze and\nthen drown you. Through the spray is\na view of pure blackness - the ninety-odd metre drop to the floor.\nAnd so our way is to traverse, ab-seiling down a little, carefully holding\nsteady and then throwing ourselves\nacross the shaft towards where we\nhope the next bolt will be, bouncing\noff the walls and scrambling along with\nwhatever holds can be grabbed. With\nthe rope safely tied off, I kneel against\nthe wall and contemplate the next obstacle - a traverse between two overhanging walls a little over two metres\napart, with tiny footholds, to gain the\nnext bolt and place of safety. There is\na crack of a ledge on one side, and a\nfew graspable bumps on the other. The\nclimbing wall does not prepare you for\nmoments like this.\nI pull the necessary slack through\nmy descender - no chance of being\nable to self-belay as I climb, and set\noff - bridged across from one wall on\ntip-toes standing in the crack on one\nside whilst pushing with my fingertips on the other. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat moves I used to get across, or\nhow I stepped from one side to the\nother when the ledges ran out. My only\nmemory is being in the middle and\nlooking down, feeling the strain in my\ntendons, watching the drips plunge to\nthe floor.\nOn and drifting down on a 9mm\nspindle of rope, lassoing the walls to\nswing in to the bolts finally landing on\n\u2018The Amphitheater\u2019, a scallop shaped\nledge with the waterfall-powered\nwinds whistling past. One hundred\nmetres of rope used so far. The view\nfrom here is amazing - looking down\ninto the enormous main chamber.\nDowning my light, I can just make out\nthe daylight filtering down from above,\nso dim and speckled from bouncing\noff the rocks that it could as well have\nbeen the Northern lights.\nI set off again, knots tied to bolts,\nkarabiners clicking in to hold the soft\nrope away from the jagged rock. The\nwalls blossom out and I am left in free\nspace, dangling between two water-falls. The weave of the rope sets me\ngently spinning as I drop to the floor,\nmy descender purring to itself as my\nheight is turned into puffs of steam\nfreed from the wet rope.\nDown on the cobbled floor, I dodge\nthe other seven waterfalls as I stumble\nacross a chamber big enough to happily host the Albert Hall, blowing my\nwhistle till I am out of breath to signal the others. Eventually (after a lot\nof blowing!) they get the message and\na pinprick of light appears a long way\nup above and starts to drift down as\nslowly as a feather.\nWith perfect timing, the other party\narrives. We share a wee dram and a sip\nof hot chocolate, and make our separate ways out. Passages and chambers\nand climbs and rope: finally we were\nback on the surface, nearly eight hours\nunderground.\nStarlight glinted from the crystal\nclear sky, lighting the white beards of\nfrost on the heather. To think a day ago\nI had been walking home under the\norange glow of South Kensington! We\nwalked the long path back to the mini-bus, the ropes dangling from our belts\nstiffening into rods as they froze solid.\nDon\u2019t you wish you were there?\nI think I can see the light at the end of the tunnel... if it\u2019s not someone\u2019s flash\nIn the name of the Father, the Son and into the Hole he goes\n34 felix Friday 25 January 2008\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nHow should universities be funded?\nIn light of the Union\u2019s survey released today, Comment returns to the Higher Education funding debate\nSteve Brown\nUnion President\nTake a step back from it all\nA\nt times it can be difficult\nto engage one of the least\npoliticised student bodies in the country but it\nis all part and parcel of\nStudents\u2019 Union Presidency. Whilst\nthe majority of Union activity centres\naround clubs and society activity and\nsocial events, the real reason the Union was established way back when\nwas to provide a representative voice\nfor the students of Imperial College.\nIn the future the Union is looking to\nmake greater use of electronic means\nof gathering student opinion which is\nwhy we are giving this electronic survey on the topic of how our Universities should be funded a go. The student body of Imperial has the power to\nmandate elected officers like myself to\ntake a certain position on issues such\nas this so in order to help this process\nalong I urge you to take the few minutes it will take to complete our short\nsurvey. Whilst I am happy to share my\nopinion at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter what I think \u2013 the view\nthat matters is the one taken by the\nlargest number of students.\nMy successor (who you are about to\nelect) will also be looking to collate and\nvoice your views in the run up to the\ngovernment\u2019s Higher Education funding review which is currently scheduled for 2009. In respect of the current\n\u00a33000 cap on the contribution made by\nUK and EU students you will hear a variety of calls from student leaders, University Vice-Chancellors (most places\ndon\u2019t have a Rector) and politicians to\nkeep it, raise it or perhaps even remove\nit altogether. I will use the rest of this\narticle to pose some questions to you\nFirst of all, what are your opinions\nof the current system? I have made\nmy own views clear on this matter in\nprevious issues but do you think that\nthe introduction of top up fees has\nchanged our universities for the better or for the worse? Are the enhanced\nbursary packages students in financial need now have access to whilst at\nuniversity worth the debt? Getting in\nto debt on a buy now, pay later basis\ncan be quite daunting but it can be\nconsidered to be quite attractive to\nthe alternative of increasing the rate\nof income tax. One day we all will pay\noff our student debts whilst any additional tax burden on graduates could\nmake our education even more costly\nthan it currently is. One of the benefits\nof the current system is that what you\npay back every month is determined\nby how much you earn and if your\nearnings never increase pass a certain\nlevel then you don\u2019t have to pay back\na penny. Could it be that the endless\nscaremongering that has emanated\nfrom Students\u2019 Unions on the issue of\nstudent debt put some people off applying to university?\nSecondly, looking to the future you\nmight want to consider what mechanisms should be in place to direct\nfunding? With finite resources available how should they be distributed and\nwhat criteria should be taken in to ac-count?Weareconstantlyhearingabout\nshortages of suitably qualified and willing students wanting to study science\nand some have argued that resources\nin this area should be increased. With\nregards to the more popular subjects\nwhere there is already a glut of graduates to what extent should learning for\nlearning\u2019s sake be funded?\nThese are some pertinent and controversial questions that we would like\nyour views on. If you think my opinions are awful then our survey is a\nquick and easy opportunity to steer me\nback on to the right path and to better inform the Union\u2019s policy making\nprocess. Visit www.imperialcollegeun-ion.org/hesurvey to take the survey.\nMatty Hoban\nFree education leads to a free society\nI\nn the run up to the 1997 general election, Tony Blair promised that the new Labour/New\nLabour government would be\nabout three things; the now fa-mous, \u201cEducation, education, education!\u201d We now know with the benefit\nof hindsight that he was really promoting arbitrary targets alongside part\nprivatisation of schools. The same sort\nof hatchet job has been applied to university and higher education funding\nwhere rarely the student or institution\nis satisfied. With the Union asking for\nstudent consultation with regards to\ntheir future policy on higher educa-Let us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\nW\nith the suspension of the Union\u2019s\npolicy on Higher\nEducation funding\nlast term, the Council said they wanted to gauge student\nopinion on the matter. You might ask\nwhy the President wanted to conduct\na survey instead of having a referen-dum. After having a look at a draft of\nthe survey last term, I can guess at the\nreason why \u2013 it asks vague questions\nabout things such as who should be applying to university rather than asking\ndefinite questions on how university\neducation should be funded, which\nshould leave the few people pushing\nfor new policy enough room to interpret the results however they wish.\nThroughout this whole process certain people on Council have stressed\nthe importance of having a debate on\nthis issue, while at the same time doing everything possible to inhibit the\ndebate. At a meeting of the Representation and Welfare Board where\nthe questions in the draft survey were\nsupposed to be debated, the discussion was halted after several minutes\nand people were asked to voice their\nopinions by email rather than being\nable to discuss them with everyone\nelse present.\nSo what are the main points in this\ndebate? Firstly, our Union should fight\nfor free education because any other\npolicy would only weaken our position as a Student\u2019s Union. If we fight\nfor a cap on top up fees, how do we\ndecide what \u201ccap\u201d is suitable? In this\nsituation, the Rector\u2019s position in favour of unlimited top up fees would\nbecome harder to fight against. If we\nfought for the cap to remain at \u00a33,000\nthinking that it\u2019s the best we\u2019re going to\nget, then we are accepting that the free\nmarket should dictate Higher Education.Furthermore, if entrance to universities is dominated by the free mar-ket, then Universities will continually\ncompete to increase fees, and it will\nbecome harder and harder for people\nto afford to go to University.\nSecondly, the main duty of a Student\u2019s Union is to take a principled\nstand on issues that affect students.\nFighting for free education is not because people \u201cprefer something free\nover something you have to now pay\nfor\u201d as the President previously said; it\nis because people who can\u2019t afford to\npay the top up fees are being excluded\nfrom going to University out of fear of\nthe resulting debt.\nThe previous Union policy stated\nthat \u201cTop-up fees have created a market in Higher Education which hinders\nthe involvement of those students who\ncome from backgrounds with historically low participation rates.\u201d They also\nsaid that the Union believed that \u201cany\n\u2018review\u2019 by the Government is likely\nto be a sham, designed to smooth the\npassage of unrestricted top-up fees.\u201d\nAs I have noted before, I believe that\nthis comment should be applied to the\nreview of this policy by the Council;\nit has been a sham, aimed at pushing\nthrough opinions which aren\u2019t representative of the student population at\nImperial.\nSo I urge you to reflect the arguments\nmade in this article in your responses\nto the Union\u2019s survey.\nFight for free education\ntion funding (through the online sur-vey), big questions and easy solutions\nare thrown about. I am personally for\nfree education, and luckily due to my\nbackground I enjoy not having to pay\ntuition fees. However, I have witnessed\nfirst hand people struggling to pay tuition fees and the financial uncertainties it brings.\nAside from my ideological viewpoint that education should be free\nand readily available to all, I see the\nsystem as inherently hypocritical. New\nLabour set the now infamous target of\nfifty percent of school leavers to attend\nuniversity. Through this they immediately aligned themselves with university admissions and ideas of wider\navailability. However, at the same time\nthey present a cheque as a solution to\nthe funding implications. The main\ndifficulty I have is the fact that those\nwho suffer most from the tuition fees\nare the lower middle classes whose income lies just above the fees threshold.\nNew Labour was about wooing Middle England and to do the above just\nmakes no political sense, these are also\nthe people I have seen suffer the most.\nYou are lumbered with debts, which\nis a problem that you will personally\nhave to solve. If anything, this destroys\nthe nature of social mobility, or at\nleast makes it about as easy as walking\nthrough a pool of treacle.\nWhether a Students\u2019 Union should\nnaturally be in favour of free education\nwill hopefully come to light from this\nsurvey; the Union is there to represent your interests. Just remember that\neducation is the most liberating of human endeavours; could placing a price\ntag on it only undermine this liberty?\nWhether you believe this or are a self-proclaimed \u201cpragmatist\u201d, one thing is\nfor sure, someone will be burdened by\nthe cost. However, you can choose who\nwill be better at dealing with it.\nCaroline Clark\n\n"

Viewing these sites is no trouble thanks to the 800x352 pixel screen,\nshowing me the full width of the web-page. Email is also a painless experience - where a normal phone would\nshow an inbox for texts, I also get a list\nof emails to peruse at my leisure.\nHowever, despite this being a business device, Nokia have thoughtfully\nincluded a wide range of multimedia\nfeatures more akin to what one would\nfind on their N-series devices. I\u2019ve got\nmy music player (with 2.5mm headphone jack) for MP3\u2019s, AAC\u2019s, WMA\u2019s\nand most other compression acronyms\nyou care to mention. I can also play the\npodcasts I found whilst browsing the\nweb, or an audio book detailing the ins\nandoutsofspeed-datingfordummies...\nor whatever takes your fancy. There\u2019s\na 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera\nfor those spur-of-the-moment snaps,\nwhich can incidentally also take \u2018DVD\nquality\u2019 (read TV resolution) videos, so\nyou can make your own home movie\n- perhaps after a successful speed dating session... and finally, there is what\nhas to be one of my favorite uses for\nthis device - a video player. Whether\nby chance or on purpose, Nokia have\ncreated a screen the exact shape of\nmost Hollywood blockbusters. In other words, this beast will play videos at\na higher resolution than your TV and\nwith a pixel density greater than any\nHDTV, movies will look and playback\nflawlessly thanks to the inbuilt video\ncard. I defy you to find a media player\non the market to outperform it.\nThe thing is, I\u2019m still stuck with an\nenormous phone and a laptop too\nsmall to type on with any more than\ntwo fingers per hand. Nokia have made\nappalling use of the space on the outside of the phone and the shortcuts on\nthe inner keyboard are obscure to say\nthe least. There is also no denying that\nthis is a fat, heavy, metal-cased brick...\nbut then on the off chance that I get\nkidnapped walking home from college,\ni can knock my assailant out with it and\nin true Imperial fashion find the optimum route home with the built-in GPS\nand mapping software; and you know,\ndespite the drawbacks, should I choose\nto I can leave my laptop at home, take\nthis massive phone into lectures, open\nit up and make my mate\u2019s tiny EEEPC\nlook, well...rather large.\nSo how do you pick which phone to\nbuy, not just from the tiny handful here\nbut from the whole phone market?\nWell the best way seems to be to figure\nwhat kind of contract you want. For ex-ample, how much do you want to pay\na month and what volume of calls and\ntexts do you want. Once you\u2019ve got all\nthat together, decide what features you\nwant from the phone, none of them\nhave everything, and see which of the\nmodels available on your contract best\nsuits your needs.\nT\nhe Tablet PC brought us\na step closer to that futuristic world we see on\nStar-Trek. With the ability\nto use your PC as a sheet\nof paper a whole wealth of options are\nsuddenly opened up. Midnight deadlines on mathematics can be handed\nin, hand-written, hours after the submissions office has closed without having to contemplate who designed Microsoft Equation Editor and work out\nwhat their grudge against the scientific\ncommunity was.\nI\u2019ve got a fairly old model of Tablet\nPC; none the less, it still comes with\nall the features needed from a PC. A\n1.7Ghz Pentium Mobile, 512MB of\nRAM (upgraded to 1GB for Vista) and,\nfor the time-generous, a 60GB hard-drive with a 14.1\u201d screen. Day to day\nit\u2019s your standard laptop with keyboard\nand annoying trackpad, but obviously\nit all changes in Tablet PC mode.\nWith a special pen that comes with\nthe PC, the monitor can detect where\nyou are pointing on the screen, so you\ncan use it instead of that trackpad. My\nlaptop came pre-loaded with XP Tablet\nPC Edition with built-in handwriting\nrecognition, as do all flavours of Vista,\nand this can be used to input text into\nany area. Simply waggle the pen above\nthe screen and you\u2019ll activate the input-panel. Anything you write in this will\nbe translated into standard text with\nimpressive accuracy. Windows takes\nthe shape drawn and the path taken\nto draw it to guess the word you\u2019re\nwriting. It will then compare this to\nthe sentence that you\u2019ve written and\nIs it supposed to do that?\nAndrew Slater explains why some people\u2019s laptops bend the wrong way\nchoose the most probable word that\u2019s\ngrammatically correct. By combining\nthese with ongoing learning from daily\nuse it quickly becomes smooth enough\nto use for fast-response areas such as\nonline messaging.\nThere\u2019s also a variety of tools available for Tablet PC users. Office comes\nwith the ability to annotate documents\nwith ink, Windows provides Journal as\na basic (paper-style) notepad and there\nare many downloadable applications\nsuch as PDF Annotator which allows\nyou to scribble on your lecturer\u2019s notes\nin PDF form, so you can always make\ncorrections later. There are also arty\ntools available which can take into account the pressure that you press onto\nthe screen for smudge effects and such.\nI now find that I don\u2019t carry around\npaper or a pen, if I need to scribble I\nflip it into Tablet mode. Drawing diagrams and embedding them into work\nwithout a scanner, the ability to correct\nthings drawn in pen or even copy-paste\na long equation to the next line are all\nthings I\u2019ve come to use often.\nSo why don\u2019t we all have Tablet PCs?\nMost Tablets are at least \u00a3100 more\nthan their normal brothers, if not up\nto \u00a3200 more for functionality that\nmany just won\u2019t use. Then there\u2019s the\nscreen itself, with some nifty engineering to get the screen to pivot and\ncollapse back onto its own keyboard,\nhowever this can be a weak point and\nmay be prone to break with prolonged\nuse. Lastly, there\u2019s the size. Everyone\nwith this tech in Sci-Fi is using super-thin screens which weigh nothing and\nhave huge functionality. Unfortunately\nthat\u2019s not the case today, however the\nsituation is improving, with smaller\nand lighter tablets that you would\nhappily rest on your arm whilst writing on them, just like a notebook or\nclipboard. A MacBook Air style Tablet\nwould be perfect, wireless functionality and extremely portable, let\u2019s hope\nthe rumours of a Mac Tablet are true!\nAnd who knows, we get lucky and not\nhave a Mac pricetag to weigh the thing\ndown.\nOn a side-note, tablets are increasingly being used as a tool in the creative media. Greater software support\nis being produced allowing you to\nemulate pencil sketcing and oil painting with surprising realism. Graphic\ndesigners also depend upon this little\ntools to make their jobs possible.\nTo those that frequently have to scan\nnotes into a document, include hand-drawn diagrams or even help a mate\nwith maths work over MSN, a Tablet\nPC is perfect providing quick and easy\naccess to scribble on your PC. There\nare even some gimmicky but fun games\nthat have been developed for tablets.\nIf you think these features would be\nkinda cool, but ultimately would never\nuse them, then stick with a standard\nlaptop and save yourself a few hundred\npounds. Or maybe just blow it all on\nsomething else.\nHonestly, it\u2019s meant to look like someone broke it\nLG Viewty - Similiar to the iPhone but with a sensible price Nokia e90 - Just look at it. It\u2019s huge. At least no one will steal it\n\n"

If you enjoy\nwriting short stories, poetry, drawing and any other forms of art that you can think of, come, get acquainted\nWay back in 1887, H.G. Wells \u2013 an Imperial student at the time \u2013 founded the\nliterary publication Science Schools\nJournal, which would later become\nthe Arts magazine of Imperial College,\nPhoenix, in 1904.\nPhoenix started life covering news\nand events around college, but as time\npassed the magazine evolved into a\nmore artistic publication. With the creation of Felix (which is in fact a spin-off\nfrom Phoenix) on 9th December 1949,\nPhoenix lost its role as a news source\nfor students and consequently its focus\nshifted onto creative writing.\nSince then Phoenix has been through\nmany changes and different versions over the years. Technology has\nchanged dramatically during its life-time. Phoenix has gone from typewriters and sketches to glossy paper and\nfull CMYK glory, most recently with\nits most latest publication in 2005.\n2005. That\u2019s quite a gap since the last\nissue was published, but over the last\ncentury a space of three years in between publications is relatively short. It\nseems that whoever came up with the\nmonicker \u201cPhoenix\u201d had some spook-ily accurate foresight.\nRather inevitably considering the\nnature of this article, you won\u2019t be\nsurprised to hear that Phoenix will be\nrising again later this term and subsequently during the summer term.\nWe need contributors. Felix Arts\neditor David Paw will be at the helm\nof the operation with yours truly assisting him all the way. If the brief history lesson above has whet your appetite enough, then you can email David\nstraight-away on arts.felix@imperial.\nac.uk. If, however, you\u2019re still feeling\nundernourished, let me continue...\nThis term\u2019s issue of Phoenix will be\nbased on the same specifications as\nI,Science; a full technicolour A4 maga-Tom Roberts\nzine. Sections are yet to be finalised,\nbut we would love to receive your short\nstories, poems, sonnets, haikus, draw-ings, comic strips, theatre and culture\nreviews, photography, screenplays and\nanything else you can think of! If you\ncan come up with any bright ideas of\nyour own that haven\u2019t been mentioned\nabove, fire your mind bullets in David\u2019s\ndirection and he\u2019ll consider them.\nIf you look around the page in front\nof you, hopefully you\u2019ll be able to get a\nfeel for what the essence of Phoenix is.\nIt\u2019s about as far removed from Felix as\npossible. Issues in the past have been\nmade wholly from seemingly random\narticles; snippets from warped minds\nthat have been and gone through Imperial College.\nPhoenix is free from the newspaper\nAbove: Just a small sample of Phoenix front covers from over the years. Below: A selection of poems from the archives\nconventions that restrict Felix. Whatever your brain can conjure up, Phoenix can consider it to be published.\nBeware though, we will be drawing the\nline at fascist dictator love-ins though.\nPhoenix got stung by that one when\none of its old editors, namely David Irving, used the magazine as a platform\nto spout his pro-Hitler views.\nBut... don\u2019t let that put you off! Ahem.\nAs students studying science, creative\nopportunities like this aren\u2019t as readily\navailable in comparison with other in-stitutions, so put your literary cap on\n(the one with the flower and the rib-bon) and get in touch!\nContact David Paw by dropping\nhim an email on arts.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.

    "content": "5\nFriday 25 January 2008 felix\nWhat alternative funding methods are there?\nWell, some people believe taxpayers should have to pay for Higher Education once again\nmaking it free to everyone. However, this would be a major step backwards for the\ngovernment.\nOne alternative model to both top-up fees and funding from taxpayers is a Graduate\nTax. Students would contribute nothing towards their degree whilst they are studying;\nthere would be no tuition fees. Once a student graduates his/her earnings would have\nan additional tax on them for a fixed period of time, say 25 years. The tax rate would be\nfixed for all graduates, meaning that higher earners would pay more than those on lower\nsalaries.\nAnother suggestion is to revise the distribution of funding depending on the subjects a\nuniversity teaches. So, for example, universities teaching science based subjects would\nget more money than those teaching arts subjects because test tubes and lasers cost\nmore than books and paints.\nWhat does the future hold then?\n2009 is an important year for students; the government is scheduled to conduct a\nreview of variable top-up fee rates. The cap on top-up fees could be lifted meaning\nthat universities are free to charge students whatever they like. If it\u2019s not lifted\ncompletely, it may be raised above \u00a33,000 per year instead. Or... it could just stay\nthe same.\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the government is going to have a sea-change and\nrevert back to free education if previous policies are anything to go by. These\nreports do not (as can be seen from the Dearing Report) directly dictate policy\nto the Government. If the role of City Academies (schools funded partially by\nindependent bodies, such as banks and partially by the Government) in secondary\neducation is an indicator, the Government may see the benefits of privatising off\nboth student loans and sectors of the higher education. Imperial College as an\nelite university may benefit from this whilst others might struggle to compete.\nHead to:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/hesurvey\nYou\u2019ll be asked to give your opinions on\nthe purpose of Higher Education, where\nfunding should come from and also\nbursaries.\nOnce you\u2019ve taken the survey you will\nbe invited to leave your email address to\nbe entered into a free prize draw.\nThe main prize will be two return\ntickets to Paris on the Eurostar. More\nprizes will be added as the number of\nresponses increases so watch out for\nmore additional prizes over the coming\nweeks and get all your friends to fill in\nthe survey.\nWhat\u2019s going to\nhappen with the data?\nAfter the survey the Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare) and the Representation\nand Welfare Board will draft a new policy to\nbe voted on at Union Council.\nWhile this piece of paper will not make\nvery much difference on its own it will\ndictate how all 10 NUS delegates will\nvote at the NUS Conference in April. It\nwill also give the President and DPEW\na mandate to follow when presenting\nImperial College Students\u2019 opinions\nand finally it will provide a powerful\nand substantial argument for the Great\nHigher Education Funding Debate\nwhich is taking place in March.\nThis will be an opportunity for Student\nUnions, academics and politicians\nto talk about the future of Higher\nEducation Funding ahead of the review\nin 2009 and will take place over a whole day at\nCentral Hall in Westminster.\nSo, how do I take this survey?\nThe survey is online now:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/hesurvey\n2009: The year of the top-up fees review and\npossibly the next General Election. Coincidence?\nShould universities be given more funding\ndepending on which subjects they teach?\nWritten by Tom Roberts, Kirsty Patterson and Matty Hoban\n\n"

Better yet, it\nwas terrifying. While System Shock 1\nhad been a success, it was System Shock\n2 that really put Looking Glass Studios\non the map. The game can be seen\nas the main source of inspiration for\nDeus Ex and, more recently, BioShock\n\u2013 forming a trio of games that appear\non almost everyone\u2019s \u201cBest.Games.\nEvar!\u201d lists.\nWhile System Shock\u2019s gameplay was\ngood, it was its writing that set it apart\nfrom the rest of the pack, most significantly Half-Life (with which it was in\ndirect competition at the time of its\nrelease). Where System Shock opted\nfor expositions by long-dead crew\nmembers through audio logs scattered\nacross the game world (sound famil-iar?), most other FPS games opted for\nhaving non-player characters reveal\nmost of the storyline. In many ways,\nit was the complete absence of other\n(sane) characters on-board the Rickenbacker and Von Braun that made\nthe game feel so eerie. Every creak of\na door hinge, every footstep, every\nagonized groan was hostile \u2013 and with\nrapidly degrading weapons and scarce\nammunition supplies, every hostile\nhad the potential to be lethal.\nAnd if that didn\u2019t scare you, the nature of the hostiles would. To start with\nthey were all soulless, mutated people,\nstill wearing the remains of their shredded trousers, pierced through the neck\nby a 5-foot parasitic worm. As they\nstalked the corridors of the deserted\nspaceship, you never knew when you\nwere going to turn the corner and face\na wrench swinging towards your face.\nAs you moved closer to the source of\nthe infestation the mutations grew\nworse, birthing hunch-backed mon-strosities, all flesh and sharp teeth, that\nhad somehow all been human at some\npoint. It was the kind of thing that put\nHalf-Life\u2019s zombies to shame.\nThe similarities between System\nShock 2 and BioShock should be obvious \u2013 from the method of storytelling to the story of a society in extreme circumstances being destroyed\nfrom within. The former inhabitants\u2019\nconsciousness reduced to the most\nprimal instincts, driven by a will not\ntheir own. Both games recognized the\nhaunting nature of such a story and\nembraced it fully, leaving you to wander the desolate halls, paranoid and on\nedge throughout.\nThe differences between the two are\nmainly cosmetic, but do make a great\ndifference. System Shock 2 is set on a\nspaceship, lightyears away from anything resembling home \u2013 BioShock\nthousands of feet below the sea in a\nutopic city: a place just as alien. The\nother difference, though, is one of\nchoice. System Shock 2 made you select a branch of the military, with each\nof the three choices affecting the way\nyou do combat and the resources available to you. BioShock made the choices more streamlined \u2013 every player\ncould use Psi pow..., I mean plasmids,\nwith the allocation of cybernetic, err,\nADAM limited to these skills and a few\nminor passive upgrades. In a big way,\nSystem Shock 2 was more open-ended\nthan BioShock, featuring a greater degree of replayability than its successor.\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that BioShock isn\u2019t an excellent game \u2013 it is.\nIts art sets the bar far higher than any\ngame before it, and really, recycling a\nfew (great) ideas from System Shock 2\nis hardly a bad idea. BioShock is a very\nfitting continuation to the legacy of\nSystem Shock, and gamers are better\noff to have two such fine games exist.\nIt is a shame, however, that both games\nfeature a completely throw-away boss\nencounter \u2013 a final reminder that the\ngames truly are of the same heritage.\nSimilarities\nStory is told through voice recordings of dead\ncharacters\nPlayer is guided by a seemingly benevolent\ncharacter\nPlayer has supernatural powers\nRPG elements of inventory management and\nupgrades\nEnemies are formerly humans\nDifferences\nGreater choice of playing style in System Shock\nSettings and environment\nBioShock has a faster pace than System Shock\nBioShock has the finest game art ever, System\nShock is (and yes, was) a bit meh\nHigher emphasis on supernatural abilities in\nBioShock\nS\nequels sell. Fact. You can\nwrite whatever you want\nabout continuations being\nunimaginative, repetitious\nand plain grating at times,\nbut they\u2019re the ones that unfortunately\nrake in the monies.\nSo, it\u2019s always encouraging in situations when sequels are usually rather\nexcellent and maintain a certain level\nof quality and distinction. Of course,\nsometimes you don\u2019t just want to just\ncontinue the mythos but rather build\non what was brilliant and then retain\nthe soul as you prepare to transfer to a\nnew vessel.\nSuch games aren\u2019t strictly sequels but\nneither are they wholly celibate, original titles. Join us as we take a look at\nsome of more inspiring ones.\nSebastian Nordgren\nGames Editor\n\n"

    "content": "39\nfelix\nFriday 25 January 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nWinter sports, without hurt\nHannah Barr\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nPeople spend hours of winter recreation time on activities ranging from\nsledding, snow-skiing and tobogganing to ice hockey, ice skating and\nsnow boarding. However, if the proper\nprecautions are not taken to ensure\nwarmth and safety, severe injuries can\noccur. This article focuses on skiing\nand snow boarding.\nWinter sports injuries get a lot of\nattention at hospital A&E\u2019s, doctor\u2019s\nsurgeries and clinics. Injuries include\nsprains, strains, dislocations and frac-tures. At this time of year injury clinics\nusually report high numbers of winter\nsports-related injuries. For example\none practising physiotherapist mentioned that in the past she had noted\nthat out of 20 patients who came in\nwith a knee injury, 19 were likely to\nhave been caused by a winter sport.\nHowever, it was also reported that the\nmajority of these were actually caused\nby other skiers/snow boarders losing\ncontrol and colliding with them! So be\nwarned - you can take all the following precautions but at the end of the\nday, winter sports are dangerous so\nyou should always be prepared for any\neventuality, especially oncoming skier\ntraffic!!\nThe most common winter sports\ninjuries are sprains and strains. That\u2019s\nbecause your muscles never completely warm up and cold muscles are more\nprone to injury. Skiing and snowboarding both place heavy demand on the\nknees, ankles, and feet and these are the\nthree most common areas for sprains.\nMany winter sports injuries happen at\nthe end of the day, when people over-exert themselves to finish that one last\nrun before allowing themselves to indulge in the apr\u00e8s ski activities. The\nmajority of these injuries can easily be\nprevented if participants prepare for\ntheir sport by keeping in good physical\ncondition, staying alert and stopping\nwhen they are tired or in pain.\nFollow these tips for preventing winter sports injuries:\nKeep in shape and condition muscles before taking part in winter\nactivities\nPre-training should include aerobic\nexercise to ensure fitness levels can\ncope with the intensity during winter\nsport participation. Make sure you\nalso include a resistance routine to\nstrengthen the muscles in advance of\nthe daily work out they\u2019ll be getting.\nThe best thing to do is book in for a\nsports specific personal programme\nat the gym. You should expect to cover squats, lunges, core conditioning\nand flexibility. As well as having programmes of differing intensity set up\nfor you on the CV equipment.\nWarm up thoroughly before starting\nout. Cold muscles, tendons and ligaments are vulnerable to injury.\nJust because you are off on a sporting holiday does not mean basic procedures you would automatically include\nin a gym session should be removed.\nBy the way, wearing heavy duty winter\nattire does not constitute a full warm\nup!\nWear appropriate protective gear,\nincluding goggles, helmets, gloves\nand padding.\nInvest in a lesson or two\nIf you\u2019re new to the sport (swallow\nyour pride if this is necessary) take\na lesson from a qualified instructor\nbefore you get started. You will have\na much more enjoyable trip (sorry,\nhopefully you won\u2019t be tripping any-where) if you take the opportunity to\nlearn the ropes first. Learning how to\nfall correctly and safely can reduce the\nrisk of injury.\nWear several layers of light, loose\nand water- and wind-resistant clothing for warmth and protection.\nLayering allows you to accommodate\nyour body\u2019s constantly changing tem-perature. Wear proper footwear that\nprovides warmth and dryness, as well\nas ample ankle support.\nPay attention to warnings about upcoming storms and severe drops in\ntemperature to ensure safety.\nNo amount of fitness training will\nensure you survive a night in a snow\nhole!! Although warm clothing will\nhelp!\nSeek shelter and medical attention\nimmediately if you, or anyone with\nyou, is experiencing hypothermia or\nfrostbite.\nDrink plenty of water before, during\nand after activities.\nAgain, do what you would normally\ndo in the gym (those of you who don\u2019t\nhydrate during work outs ignore the\n\u2018normal\u2019 comment).\nAvoid alcohol consumption.\nSkiing and snowboarding do not mix\nwell with alcohol or drugs. Beware of\nmedicines or drugs that impair the\nsenses or make you drowsy. You can\nstill drink alcohol, just not at the same\ntime, which would be tricky anyway!\nAvoid participating in sports when\nyou are in pain or exhausted.\nIf you\u2019re tired, stop and rest. Fatigue\nis a risk factor for injuries. Take this\nopportunity to watch others, maybe\npick up some tips/ideas to try later, and\nenjoy other aspects of the trip such as\nsocialising!\nWinter sports are a whole lot of fun\nand wouldn\u2019t you be annoyed if you had\nto sit the season/holiday out because\nyou sustained an injury? Be smart and\nbe ready for a season of adventure and\nfun and leave the injuries to someone\nelse. Whether you are skiing or snow-boarding, or participating in any other\nwinter sports these common winter\nsports injuries can be avoided, well\nsome of the time!

The return of Spanner in\ngoal, who incidentally has never lost a\nCup match, meant that the ladies were\nin high spirits and ready to face GKT\n3rds, who are currently bottom of the\nleague above us in BUSA.\nThe game went underway with both\nteams making positive starts. It was\nclear from the beginning that this was\nto be a close match, with both teams\nplaying a similar level of hockey. IC\nhad a few close chances early on, with\nAA, Isabel and Brownie all seeing opportunities to score. Before long, some\ngood, smooth stick passing down the\nright by Hoover and Isabel resulted\nin IC drawing first blood, with a goal\nneatly slotted in by Captain Ghostbuster. GKT worked their way back\nwith some good play through midfield\nbut Spanner\u2019s deadly habit of charging\nand diving prevented them from scor-ing. IC had another good period of\nplay and Spandex came close to finding the back of the net. Shortly before\nhalf time, GKT rudely secured a goal\nfrom a short corner having just injured\nour very own Unicycle from a previous\nunsuccessful short corner routine.\nAfter some inspiring team talk at\nhalf time, IC started the second half\non fire, bursting out of the blocks with\nsome slick two-touch hockey and concentrating on moving the ball early as\nwell as taking advantage of the whole\nwidth of the pitch to bypass the opposition\u2019s midfield. Both teams made\ngood chances to score but it was IC\nwho broke the deadlock, with Brownie\nscoring a goal which originated from\na perfectly executed short corner rou-tine. IC held on to the lead for a while\nbut with 15 minutes to go, GKT equal-ised after a period of sustained pres-sure, despite the best efforts of SpanDetermined IC ladies\nprogress to Quarter Finals!\nHockey\nImperial Ladies 2nd 3\nKings Medicals 3rd 2\nAmanda Cheung\nner in the IC goal.\nThe battling spirit of the IC Ladies\ncame through, with a rallying call from\n3 Times a Lady in defence, spurring\nthe whole team on. IC kept their heads\nup and after numerous unsuccessful\nattacks, were finally rewarded a goal,\nwith Brownie scoring her second of the\nmatch thanks to some smooth passing\nthrough midfield.\nDespite several hair-raising moments during the dying minutes of the\ngame, solid defending from Dominator, Thombelina, Unicycle and 3 Times\na Lady meant that IC managed to hold\non to the lead and prevented the match\nfrom reaching penalty flicks, emerging\nfrom the final whistle victorious.\nThanks must go to our most vocal supporter of the day, Mountie, for\nshouting invaluable instructions, making effective substitutions and generally spurring the team on throughout\nthe match.\nWith the mission accomplished, it\nwas down to the pub for some celebratory drinks. \u2018Man of the Match\u2019 was\nawarded to Spandex for excellent all\nround effort. \u2018Twat of the Match\u2019 was\nUnicycle for injuring her own teammate from a free hit... after the full\ntime whistle was blown!\nto test yourself and to meet some\nnew people.

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\n30 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nUnlike the usual relations between\nspiritual brethren, the couple Ico and\nShadow of the Colossus share an evoc-ative, unusual symbiosis that extends\nfar beyond the superficies.\nThe key theme that binds these two\nperspicuously is that of rescue. The\nsegue lies not in thematic similarities\nbut rather in a sense of dichotomy.\nIn Ico, you find yourself a prisoner of\narchaic, superstitious circumstances.\nAs per village tradition, the kid with\nthe horns sprouting out of his head\nmust be locked away before calamity befalls the people. Incarcerated in\na gargantuan castle hewn of stone, a\nfreak earthquake releases you from\nyour cell and upon exploration you\nwander upon a pallid, almost-lumi-nous woman trapped in a cage. Fueled\nby a mixture of bravado and curiosity,\nyou set about releasing her and pay the\nprice for your heroism. From then on,\nfor your entire journey you are dogged\nby sinister spectral shadows that will\ndo anything to capture the girl.\nThe combat is simple and hardly the\nfocus; even the shades aren\u2019t a true enemy of sorts. Rather, it\u2019s the castle that\nyou must contend with. The design is\nequally sublime and subliminal. The\nbleak darkness of each massive room is\naccentuated by tiny shafts of light that\ntrickle through, creating strong ebbs of\nisolation. The harsh cries of seagulls\nand the staccato-esque crashing of\nwaves outside enhances the longing to\nbe free. The puzzles are of an organ-ic, seamless nature that are ingrained\ninto the mechanistic workings of the\ncastle itself. While these brain-teasers\nare laterally gratifying by their own\nrights, another oblique and unique level of challenge is proferred upon your\nsuccess.\nBeing impaired of mobility, the girl\nYorda, can only join you once you\u2019ve\nset out an easier path for you. This is\nwhere the game achieves something\nthat no blurb will ever boast about: a\ngenuine sense of attachment, of affin-ity. There\u2019s a latent yet ever-nurtured\nsentience to Yorda that\u2019s somewhat in-tangible, but still there. It\u2019s the way she\nrefuses to listen to you if you put her in\nany danger, it\u2019s the way she\u2019ll look curiously around and point out a possible\nsolution to the conundrums, it\u2019s the\nway she eventually trusts you and takes\ncertain leaps of faith and more impor-tantly, it\u2019s the gentle way the controller\nvibrates whenever you\u2019re leading her\nby hand, turning those tugs a little bit\nmore real.\nIn Shadow of the Colossus, the protagonist Wander has taken it upon himself\nto enter a forbidden realm from which\nthere is no escape. His motivation lies\nin his arms: the lifeless figure of his\nlove, Mona. Legend has it that whosoever slays the ancient Colossi intrinsically bound to this desecrated land\nwill be gifted with the power of gods.\nHis trusty steed Agro now in check,\nWander brandishes an arcane sword\nwhich has the power to defeat the be-ings. The land surrounding you is an\nexpanse that stretches as far as the eye\ncan see and you can definitely find no\nColossi. Holding up your blade to the\nsun reveals a shaft of light focused into\nthe distance and that\u2019s where you find\nyour quarries. The land, despite being\nseemingly sparse, is a character in and\nof itself. Quiet rivers are deafened by\nrushing waterfalls, the winds from barren wastelands blow into lush copses.\nThere is far more to see and throughout your journey you will witness sights\nthat ensnare the senses. This sense of\nscale creates a dizzying aura of insignificance and lonliness that is punctuated by the antics of your horse. As you\nride onto each battle, you\u2019ll learn not\nonly to control your equestrian comrade but to care for it and respect it\nbecause it truly embodies a spirit of its\nown. There\u2019s a beautiful sense of camaraderie that is both unusual and somewhat unsettling if you think about it.\nHowever, at sixteen junctures you\nwon\u2019t have time to think about such\nthings since you\u2019ll be in heated battle\nwith the Colossi. Coming across in\nall manner of shapes, sizes and coun-tenance, the Colossi brim with originality and unfettered creativity. The\nsame applies to methods in which you\nneed to defeat them. It\u2019s not just about\ndiscovering the weak point(s), but\nrather how you get there. The Colossi,\ndespite being mostly large and cum-bersome, will make every attempt to\nprotect themselves, often leading to a\nbattle of attrition. When the final blow\nis administered, there\u2019s almost a need\nto stand at attention to respect and\nmourn at the fall of something rather\nmagnificent.\nVisually, both games embody the\nsame Impressionistic art styles and\nsubtleties in animation. A minimalist approach to music is used to evoke\ndeeper emotion and there is always this\noverarching thought of a girl dressed\nin white who wants to be free. Even in\nterms of the rather elusive stories of\neach lie hints and vestiges of embodying the same world. Similarly, both\ngames are equally quite divergent. One\nfocuses on combat and exploration\nover a vastness littered with minutiae\nwhereas the other is about escape from\nan enclosed fortress.\nWhere these games achieve union is something that no hardcoding\ncould achieve: an illusion so convincing that it goes beyond palpable and\ninto the transcendental. Whether it\u2019s\nthe uncanny evocation of isolation or\nthe genuine relationship between the\nonly two characters existing in the\nworld, both games offer an ethereal\nexperience that\u2019s almost dream-like in\nnature.\nSimilarities\nSimilar styles in visual presentation\nThe themes of isolation and escape\nEvocation of a tangible world\nStories that are almost evanescent yet existent\nThe need to rescue a pale young girl dressed in simple white\nThe sense that the more you proceed, the further you are from\nthe end\nPuzzle elements that are organic and lateral\nAn emotive segue with the only other sentient character\nDifferences\nA focus on exploration as opposed to that on combat\nThe dichotomy in evoking claustrophobia and agoraphobia\nrespectively\nThe circumstances of the main characters\nIco features a fully functional castle/fortress, whereas\nthe temple/shrine in Shadow of the Colossus,\ndespite being no less large, is mostly\ncavernous space\nAzfarul Islam\nGames Editor\n\n"

    "content": "infection, pneumonia, TB, cellulites,\ninfectious diarrhoea, UTI and even\nan insidious presentation of AIDS.\nMalnutrition, dehydration and worms\nwere a huge problem in the young, and\nother than this we saw many varied\nand interesting surgical and medical\nproblems.\nOne gentleman, who flummoxed me\nduring my second week of clinics, came\nincomplainingofpaininhiswristsfrom\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk Travel\nThis man needed an amputation we could not provide\nThe team. My flies are sadly undone\n33\nFriday 25 January 2008 felix\nexcessive digging. But as I finished my\nquestioning, he pulled his trousers up\nto reveal an enormous 2 year-old hole\nin his leg as a final niggling problem!\nApparently, it had happened due to a\npickaxe accident and was now infect-ed, needing amputation. Another man\ncame in with two massive lumps under\nthe skin of his chest claiming that his\nfamily had decided to insert batteries\nunder his skin to \u2018recharge\u2019 him after\npneumonia had made him feel \u2018very\ntired\u2019. He was deadly serious. The sad\nthing in both cases was that we could\nnot do anything for them, as our clinic\ncould not conduct surgery.\nFor me, this is also where the frustrations started. We saw many cases where\nwe could have done so much had we\nthe right resources and our hands were\nnot tied by our situation. Yet at times,\nthere were patients coming in declaring every symptom known to man in\nthe pursuit of cheap medical treatment\nor in the lust of dear drugs. For exam-ple, one lady complained of a headache\non hearing bad news and would not\nleave until she was given \u201csomething\nat least\u201d, as she put it. There was also\na craze for needles with many people\nbelieving that an injection, no matter\nwhat the content of the syringe, was\na cure for any illness and a protection\nagainst further disease. Add to this the\ndisorganised management of ICODEI\nand the concept of \u2018African timing\u2019 and\nyou get closer to understanding the\nfeeling of defunctness that sometimes\novercame me.\nOne mother came to clinic with a\nseverely malnourished toddler; evident by his swollen belly. She said that\nshe was feeding him \u201cugali, beans and\nporridge\u201d day in, day out. There was\nno meat or even milk in the diet, and\nhearing this really angered me. I was\nquick to make judgements on her poor\nmaternal skills and not surprised that\nthe child was in this state going by his\ndiet of pure starch. I made it clear to\nthe translator that the mother should\nbe told how angry I felt and be asked\nwhy she was not feeding the child any\nprotein- \u201c...because we can\u2019t afford to\nfeed him anything else\u201d came the reply.\nThis was truly a heartbreaking thing to\nhear, especially considering the state of\nthe child, and it made me very annoyed\nat myself for a long time after she had\nleft. Needless to say, poverty is at the\nroot of the health situation people here\nface.\nAnd then we obviously have the AIDS\ncatastrophe. Kenya faces a very high\nprevalence of the disease and many\npatients we saw had several terrible\ninfections ensuing from their positive\nHIV status. One such patient whom\nwe set out to visit at her home, died\nas our jeep approached her house; this\nleft the whole team visibly depressed\nconsidering we had just talked to her\nthat very morning.\nIn my humble and inexperienced\nopinion, what Kenya needs to improve\nits health situation is a strong education plan to dispel the strongly-held,\nincorrect health beliefs (where, for\nexample, kids with wet malnutrition\nare thought to be healthy because of\n\u201cclaiming that\nhis family had\ndecided to\ninsert batteries\nunder his skin to\n\u2018recharge\u2019 him\u201d\nfour hours away from some villages\nwe saw, via a 30-60 Kenyan shilling\nmatatu journey. Most of these facilities\nwere being run by one or two nurses,\nwithout the support of any qualified\ndoctors and one such clinic I visited,\nto try and learn about local diseases,\nmade so many errors that even as a\nmedical student, I could see they were\npracticing atrocious medicine. What\u2019s\nmore, they were charging 300 Kenyan\nshillings plus per sub-standard basic\nconsultation and treatment! Compared to that, our mobile clinic was a\nsteal at 50 shillings for the same thing,\nand it was much easier for us to take a\nmobile clinic to them rather then they\ncome to us. But with so many people to\nhelp, where could one jeep go to make\na lasting difference?\nThe majority of patients we saw were\nyoung adults or children suffering from\nfever. Fever implies many things: mostly malaria, but also dispersed amongst\nthese were typhoid, respiratory tract\ntheir swollen bellies and faces) and an\neducation plan on germ theory, to annul the rampant misuse of antibiotics\nresponsible for the rising bacterial re-sistance. Basic health and nutritional\nneeds should also be addressed and the\ninternational community has to act to\nhelp Kenya alleviate poverty, in order\nto let the locals move beyond purely\nsubsistence farming. Furthermore,\nHIV awareness needs to take a surge, as\npeople still have a shockingly low level\nof awareness by western standards and\nsome unreal beliefs on the spread and\ncontrol of HIV which I won\u2019t mention\nhere. All of these ideas are obviously\neasier said than done.\nUpon my return, a friend was quick\nto point out that my visit sounded like\na \u201cglamorous\u201d one, but in reality it\nis anything but. It is a saddening and\nfrustrating experience that opens your\neyes to the world\u2019s indifference as you\nultimately realise that you can try your\nbest but not make any lasting differ-ence. To achieve such change requires\nfar more than the individual.\n\u201c\u2018\u2026because\nwe can\u2019t afford\nto feed him\nanything else,\u2019\ncame the reply.\nThis was truly\na heartbreaking\nthing to hear\u201d\nAn AIDS patient\nFungal infection gone septic\nSimple problem, no solution\nA patient with varicose veins\n\n"

Fans of the\ngame were left disappointed when the\ndevelopers disbanded and rights to the\ngame were sold off, leaving them without a hope for a true sequel. However\nthe light shone upon humanity and\nthe lead developer of the original TA,\nChris Taylor, started work on his latest project, which he dubbed Supreme\nCommander.\nUsing TA as a starting point and upping the scale the battles are fought on\nis the first line to say about Supreme\nCommander. Everything about the\ngame has been streamlined and tweaks\nto the control systems allows the controlling of several armies numbering\nin the hundreds which are scattered\nall over the map. One my personal favourite additions is called the \u201cstrategic\nzoom\u201d, as in Supreme Commander the\nnormal view may be zoomed out until\nthe whole map is visible and each unit\nis simply displayed by a little coloured\ntoken. Other more minor changes to\nthe control system includes things like\ncoordinated attacks, where one army\ncan wait for another to move into position before making its move and repeating build queues have been fleshed\nout a lot. The overall control system\nallows full control over both your epic\narmy that spans miles across while still\nkeeping an eye on your airforce that\nwould make the Spartans fight in the\nshade.\nThe economy system from TA has\nalsoreturnedforitssuccessor,SupCom.\nThere are simply two resources in the\ngame mass (TA has metal instead) and\nenergy, and each one has a different resource deposit on the map (mass/met-al deposits and hydrocarbon/geother-mal vents). One of the major features\nof SupCom and TA is that resources\ndon't run out as the game goes on, the\nresource deposits just keep on generating funds to finance rebuilding your\narmy. Coupling this with the fact that\nhalf of your economy doesn't rely on\nthese deposits but instead on standard\npower generators and mass fabricators\nmeans that as the game goes on rather\nthan players becoming more and more\ncareful with money they instead start\nto build larger and larger armies, and\nthose armies don't stop becoming\nlarger and more dangerous until someone takes a hefty hit to their economy\nwhich normally pushes them out of\nthe game. However, do not be fooled\ninto thinking that both resources are\nof relatively equal value like wood/gold\nin WarcraftIII and minerals/vespene\nin Starcraft, energy in Supreme Commander is more like power in C&C\ngames, as things like shield generators,\nradars and turrets require it to carry on\nrunning.\nSo Supreme Commander allows armies far larger than the ones seen in\nTotal Annihilation to be built and managed with any sort of effectiveness, its\nworth mentioning some of the things\nthat make lots of difference in small\nnumbers. First up is the Commanders\nthemselves still return in all of their\nbase building glory. At the start of each\ngame each player only starts off with\na single commander which in turn is\nused to produce factories and an econ-omy, and the final victory condition in\nthe game is to kill off your opponents\ncommander. The commanders themselves have had a few tweaks, as they\nstart out weaker than their TA counterparts but can be upgraded to further specialise at a particular role, such\nas becoming a dedicated combat unit\nor perhaps an engineering powerhouse\ncapable of building a wall of turrets in\na minute. The other units that make a\ndifference even in small numbers are a\ncall back to the TA expansion, the Core\nContingency, which brought in the\nCore Krogoth. For those who haven't\nplayed TA:CC the Krogoth is a massive unit, magnitudes above all others\nin terms of armour, size and firepower,\nand capable of taking out small armies\neven without support. Supreme Commander takes this single unit a step\nfurther and adds 3 experimental units\nto each race, each one unique in its\nbattlefield role and capable of taking\na small army if its fighting on its own\nbattlefield. Some of the experimentals\nfurther the epic numbers strategy despite only being a single unit, as they\ncan function as a mobile factories, setting up mobile command posts and\npushing out units in the field to further\nfortify themselves.\nWith such a focus on economy, Supreme Commander still keeps the powerful base defences of TA to stop errant\nharassment of your base. However, like\nin TA they can still be brought down\nwith a suitable application of force,\nwhether its launching 5 nukes at his\nlines to overwhelm his missile defence\nsystems, or doing a quick strike by a\nlarge bombing fleet to disable his shield\ngenerators. Also worth mentioning is\nthe effectiveness of artillery, which puts\nthe ranges displayed in other games to\nshame. A single artillery cannon often\nhas minimum ranges similar to a normal units maximum ranges, with shells\nflying between bases or onto oncoming armies a common sight.\nThe unit strategy has been subtly altered since TA, as now there is\na fixed divide between anti-air and\nanti-ground attacks so now you have\nto remember to bring AA flak guns or\nfighter support with your army. On a\nmore personal note I miss seeing the\nsight when a scout flies above my army\nand I see rockets and artillery shells fly\neverywhere as my units try in vain to\nland a hit on the agile aircraft (just because everything can attack everything\ndoesn't mean its any good at it).\nSo overall Supreme Commander\nholds everything that TA holds dear,\nwhile still upping the ante and tightening the control system. The fact that\nall the cool stuff returns, even if it may\nhave been renamed or altered slight-ly, with a whole host of new features\nadded makes Supreme Commander\na worthy successor to Total Annihilation. For those who haven't played total annihilation, it probably wouldn't\nhurt to think of Supreme Commander\nas a cross between C&C Generals and\nthe tactical combat on the Total War\ngames.\nAlex Stubley\n\n"

    "content": "4 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nEducation Proclamation\nToday, the Union launched its Higher Education funding survey. If you want to influence the Union\u2019s policy\nand stance on HE funding, take it online now by heading to www.imperialcollegeunion.org/hesurvey.\nBelow is an overview of how we\u2019ve arrived at this point and what could possibly happen in the future\nA brief history...\nThe most significant recent review of Higher Education funding was the Dearing Report in\n1997. It was commissioned to find out how funding should develop over the following 20\nyears. Before 1997 universities were funded entirely by the government from taxpayers\u2019\nmoney. University was free to attend, there were no tuition fees and there were grants\nfor the poor to pay for living expenses.\nSir Ronald Dearing, the lead author of the 1997 inquiry made a number of\nrecommendations to the government, most notably the introduction of \u00a31,000 per year\ntuition fees. He also recommended the continuation of means tested grants and loans.\nThe Labour government came to power in 1997 and in 1998 Prime Minister Tony Blair\nintroduced tuition fees. On top of this, Mr Blair introduced student loans which replaced\nmaintenance grants too.\nIn 2003, Mr Blair announced it had made plans to introduce \u201ctop-up fees\u201d. Despite a\nnarrow five vote victory (316-311), the 2004 Higher Education Bill was passed and top-up fees became a reality. Later that year maintenance grants were re-introduced for\nstudents from poorer backgrounds. This all leads us to the current funding model...\nWhy are we all talking about HE funding again?!\nAt the start of last term, Imperial College Union Council passed a policy to revise its\nstance on Higher Education funding, pending a consultation with the student body. The\nUnion\u2019s old policy mandated it to campaign for free education. The President, Stephen\nBrown, and Deputy President (Education & Welfare), Kirsty Patterson, believed that \u201cfree\neducation funded entirely by the taxpayer is unrealistic.\u201d\nRather than having Council determine what the new policy should be, the Union\ndecided that it should listen to the entire student body to get a broader idea of the views\nit should be representing. The time has arrived for the consultation to begin; as of today\nyou will be able to go online and complete a survey which asks you questions about\nyour views on Higher Education funding. The answers will be used to form the Union\u2019s\nrevised Higher Education funding policy.\nWhat\u2019s the current funding model?\nIf you are starting University now you will be paying top-up fees. At present they are capped\nat \u00a33,000 and most universities charge the full amount. Top-up fees, unlike tuition fees, are\nnot payable up front. Rather, once you graduate, the fees get paid back automatically from\nyour salary with the amount dependant on thresholds.\nAlong with a new payment scheme came a new funding and bursary scheme. Students\npaying \u00a33,000 top-up fees may be eligible for an additional \u201cHE Maintenance Grant\u201d. This\nmakes up a proportion of your total loan amount and is not repayable. The Maintenance\nGrant is calculated according to your family\u2019s income and acts to reduce the level of debt\nincurred by students from poor economic backgrounds. A \u201cSpecial Support Grant\u201d is also\navailable to students entitled to benefits which acts in a similar way to reduce the amount\nrepayable on a student loan.\nInstitutions are also encouraged to offer bursaries that will widen participation in Higher Education. From 2007 Imperial\nCollege has awarded \u201cStudent Support Bursaries\u201d of up to \u00a34,000 per year to students from low income families. These\nbursaries are awarded to cover maintenance and study related costs during a student\u2019s time at Imperial.\nUnion Council back in October last term\nTony Blair\u2019s Labour Government introduced tuition\nfees in 1998 and top-up fees later on in 2004\nMoney: the root of many discussions,\nincluding this one\n\n"

As I put my corpulent rucksack down, I let out a sigh of relief, having just travelled for over 10 hours on\na rattling bus across possibly the worst\nroad in the world.\nI can make out many new faces huddling around me in this hut; I am told\nthey are my colleagues in volunteering.\nThere is no electricity and so no light,\nso I give up on making eye contact\nand swiftly proceed to engage them in\nsome friendly chit-chat. Devoid of any\nfreshness or originality, I say \u201chi\u201d. They\nall say \u201chi\u201d back and introduce them-selves. So far, so banal, but amongst the\nmany polite Canadian, American and\nKenyan accents I hear, I pick up a British one which comforts me a little, being so far away from SW7 and mercifully opens up a natural avenue for me\nto progress in my predictable banter. I\nask the Brit her name, and she replies\ntelling me it\u2019s Heather.\n\u201cAre you from the UK?\u201d I ask. \u201cYes\u201d\nshe replies. \u201cWhere from in the UK?\u201d\nI ask back. \u201cLondon\u201d she replies.

I\nwas to be based at this sugar cane plantation for one month, residing with the\nfamily of a local reverend by the suave\nname of Reuben Lubanga and my accommodation here was to be a simple\nmud hut shared with other volunteers,\nwith no running water, electricity or\ngas.\nThe organisation I was working for,\ncalled ICODEI, ran the mobile clinic\nprogramme I volunteered in as just\none facet of its operations, with programmes in micro-enterprise develop-ment; micro-financing; teaching and\nHIV awareness also running. While\nI was there, it was also looking to set\nup a cheap HIV testing scheme and a\ncheap ceramic water-filter project.\nThe situation that we operated in\nwas a sad one. Funds were limited,\nvolunteers short in supply and the objectives to be achieved huge. We went\nout to set up and run a mobile clinic\nin the rural areas everyday, hours from\nthe few tarmacked roads to be found\nand accessible only by a bumpy, muddy\n4x4 ride. Since this was field medicine\nincarnate, we had no access to labs for\ntests, no imaging and no beds. Actually, the list of no\u2019s could be indefinitely\nlonger but our biggest problem was\nthat due to the numerous localities we\ntook responsibility for, we could not arrange for any \u2018follow up appointments\u2019.\nThis implied that any treatments had\nto be administered on the spot, empirically fashioned, basing them on history\nand physical exams alone.\nPeople we saw all across the area\nwere, as expected, struggling with\nhealth or economic problems and livelihoods carved out of subsistence farming equating to no stable income. For\npeople needing healthcare in Kenya,\ntransport is a significant limiting factor\nwith medical facilities dotted around\nthe country at great distances, up to\nMalnutrition is a serious problem in the young\nDiscussing cheap testing with a HIV support group\nVarious skin symptoms were often the main presenting complaint\nAppeasing our little patient\nMy desk at the office\n\n"

Most\nof the material here would probably\nbe considered art, for example \u201cLeftsided orchidectomy II\u201d by Michael\nLandy (2005). This is a down-to-earth\ncoloured pencil drawing of the scar left\nafter an operation to remove the artist\u2019s left testicle. At the other end of\nthe room, bringing attention to the human genome project, Andrea Duncan\u2019s\n\u201cTwenty three pairs\u201d (2002) is a human\nkaryotype \u2013 a map of chromosomes \u2013\nmade up of socks. There is also a range\nof artistic manipulations of the human\nform, such as a rearranged human\nskeleton and a hideous blob monster\nto alert us to the dangers of obesity.\nOn a far wall, there is the opportunity\nfor visitors to contribute a postcard of\ntheir own writings and drawings related to health and medicine. They are\nwonderfully varied, and I could have\nlooked at them all day. One person had\ndrawn \u201cthis is what is in my brother\u2019s\nveins\u201d, depicting some limp, mutated\nred-blood cells. There were several\ndoodlesofevilvirusesattackingpeople,\nsome more science-based than others.\nI also noticed there was an oddly large\nnumber of unicorn drawings.\nBut Medicine Now isn\u2019t just art, it\u2019s\nalso hard science. The Sanger institute has contributed a giant robot that\nwas previously used in the sequencing of the human genome. Next to it\nis a bookshelf full of lever arch files\ncontaining the Gs, Ts, As and Cs that\nmake up the genome itself. One file is\nopen, revealing a typeface so small as\nto put into perspective the staggering\nvolume of genetic information that is\nrequired to generate a human being.\nAlso present are some droppings and\nfleece taken from Dolly the Sheep.\nSomething else that should be noted\nabout Medicine Now is the interactivity\nof the gallery. There are touch-screen\ncomputers to tinker with, books to\nread and there was a whole crowd of\npeople drawing their own postcards to\ncontribute to the wall. There are also\na lot of headsets dotted about, where\nyou can listen to patients\u2019 stories. I\u2019m\nnot usually a big fan of interactive exhibits \u2013 they tend to detract from the\nsubstance and attract small children\nwho want to bang on the touch-screens\nmindlessly. But I think Wellcome have\nused them unimposingly, usefully and\nto great effect here.\nNext door is the second permanent\nexhibition, Medicine Man. This contains historical artifacts collected by\nHenry Wellcome, founder of the Wellcome Trust, himself. It\u2019s a treasure\nchest of medical oddities from around\nthe world. Many will enter and see a\nstuffy museum of old junk, but there\nare some real treats to be found here.\nObjects range from simple bleeding\nbowls to \u201cporcelain fruit and vegeta-If the Wellcome Collection is good enough for Stephen Fry then it\u2019s good enough for you. He doesn\u2019t look\ntoo happy about being there. Possibly because he\u2019s being followed by some kind of blob monster\nThis is Stephen Fry after the blob monster was done with him. Now\nhe\u2019s doomed to stand for all eternity, greeting visitors\nA\nfew months ago I started\nout writing the occasional art exhibition review,\ngenerally with an emphasis on the phallic symbols I found in the art and how good\nthe cake in the caf\u00e9 was. This term, I'm\nsuddenly one of the Arts Editors. I like\nthe way things work here at Felix.\nThis week I review the Wellcome\nCollection. I could ramble on about\nhow AMAZING this place is for hours\non end, but until now I've never persuaded anybody else to go. I hope this\nweek's Felix changes that. You'll notice\nthat the article doesn't discuss my caf\u00e9\nexperience, this is because I didn't have\none. However, the cake I have eaten\nhere on previous occasions was excel-lent. They do some kind of chocolate-y\nMillionaire's Shortcake which I highly\nrecommend. But you will be pleased to\nknowthatIfoundplentyofphallicsym-bols to satisfy your expectations. Not\nto mention Napoleon\u2019s toothbrush.\nOne problem I did encounter on my\ntrip to the Wellcome Collection this\nweek was with getting there. Normally\nI can zip over to Euston Square on the\nHammersmith and City line in less\nthan half an hour. But this weekend\nthe Hammersmith and City line was\nclosed, as was most of the District line-and the buses were all diverted because\nof some kind of religious procession.\nLondon public transport at its finest!\nNevermind \u2013 five buses and multiple\nhours of travelling was a small(ish)\nprice to pay for art. Don\u2019t ever say I\u2019m\nnot dedicated to my journalistic craft.\nIt looks like I\u2019ll be out and about being arts-y in the next few weeks, to\nkeep you entertained. Not that I have\nany objection. The last time I set foot\nin an art gallery was in fact yesterday,\nwhen I nipped into Tate Modern. But,\nOK, I\u2019ll be honest with you- I was in\nthere for a grand total of six minutes,\nas I only went in there to use the toi-let. It turns out there\u2019s a distinct lack\nof public facilities on the South Bank\n(if you\u2019re reading this, Ken, sort it\nout!). It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done it\neither. Sorry, Tate, I love you for your\nart really.\nIn addition to my introduction to\nthe Wellcome Collection, we have\ntwo new regular features starting this\nweek. Rosie Grayburn is fed up of you\nall sitting at home in your bedrooms all\nweekend. Don\u2019t claim you\u2019re working \u2013\nwe don\u2019t believe you! Rosie\u2019s going to\ncome up with some exciting ideas for\nday trips in London on a student (i.e.\nvery, very low) budget. And then we\u2019ve\ngot our resident musical theatre buff,\nLucy Harrold, poised and ready to introduce you to a few shows you may\nnot have discovered yet.\nObviously, I can't be much of an editor if I don't have anything to edit, so\nI'm very eager to receive any contribu-tions. Rantings and reviews of books,\ntheatre, musicals, art, opera and classical music are all welcome here. I can\neven try and get you free press tickets\n(yes, free! Every student\u2019s favourite\nword) to anything you want to see \u2013\njust drop us a line.\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nBittersweet laughs and comedic tears from The Savages\nIt\u2019s going to take more than just a book (or indeed a film) to sort this mess out\nElah, Elah, Elah, Ay, Ay, Ay\nThe analogy of the Valley of Elah in the\ntitle here is destined, probably against\nthe wishes of the filmmakers, to be\nthe largest talking point of this film.\nThis, the latest in a series of Iraq-centric films has chosen the location for\nDavid\u2019s biblical confrontation with the\ngiant Goliath as a metaphor for the deployment of young heroes into Iraq in\na somewhat oversimplified, misguided\nmetaphor, assuming as it does that this\nwar was (a) won, (b) justified (seem-ingly contradicting the film\u2019s central\nmessage) and (c) as swift as the launch\nof a stone from a catapult. Oh dear.\nThe story follows Vietnam vet Hank\n(Jones) searching for his son, a soldier\nwho has gone missing following his\nsquad\u2019s return from duty in Iraq. The\nevents leading up to his disappearance\nslowly unwind with the \u2018help\u2019 of the\ninept local police, fronted by the Detective Emily Sanders (Theron), who\nsimultaneously seems to be getting a\nbit of stick for being a woman. Why?\nJust because.\nWith Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom\nand Rendition released over the last\nyear to lukewarm box office figures,\nElah has tried to sex up its image by\ngiving Charlize a gun on the poster.\nThis is mournful talkie, not gun-toting\naction flick. More honest would be a\nPaul Haggis\u2019s take on the human cost of the Iraq War. For the Americans, of course\nsign saying \u201cHypocritical lecture, this\nway\u201d, but I can see the advertisers rethinking that one.\nElah is of the award fodder breed:\ndeftly crafted but lacking soul. In this\ncase, it loses out because it\u2019s so well\nmade. There is nothing outstandingly\noriginal about it, but what Haggis has\ndeveloped in narrative ability since\nCrash, has been countered by loss of\ncharm. The naivety with which Crash\nwas constructed seemed to lend itself\nwell to the black-and-white picture of\nracism it was trying to dispell. Here,\nThe sight of Laura Linney on screen\nis always enough to make me leave\na cinema smiling. Her unique style\nand talent convey a knowledge of her\ncraft beyond that of her peers, and her\nSpeechless ad in favour of the Writers\u2019\nGuild Strike made me question why\nthey do need writers with Linney on\nthe books. Not the point it set out to\nmake, but with a script like The Savages, Linney can really pull it out of the\nbag.\nThe Savages is not a slasher movie as\nits strange title would suggest, but the\nstory of a brother-sister pair who suddenly are left to look after their aged fa-ther. Given director Jenkins\u2019 young age,\nmaking a picture about the depressing\nrealities of old age would seem to be a\ndare, but The Savages manages to keep\na spring in its step.\nFrom its Blue Velvet-esque open-ing, The Savages never quite panders\nto simple expectations, and with two\nof Hollywood\u2019s finest character actors\ntaking on the idiosyncratic siblings\nthere\u2019s enough to keep you intrigued.\nHoffman doesn\u2019t shy away from roles\nin which he may not be exactly likeable\nand this would be one of those ones:\na Brecht scholar seemingly more interested in his work than his father or\nsister, but an idealised version of the\ncharacters would render the whole\npicture pretty pointless. Old life sucks\nis the message, deal with it.\nThe film itself does seem to slow\ndown towards the end, however. Its\nbittersweet look on life has a depressing tinge of reality involved, although\nnot to the same shattering effect as\n4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days. Its dark\ncomic stylings are an inviting prospect,\nbut there are times when it all seems\na bit convoluted. The central storyline\nis intriguing, yet the creation of baggage for the two siblings in the form of\ntwo characters implanted in the script\nto assumedly give us a further vantage\npoint to see into their lives weighs the\npace down slightly.\nThe Savages was never seen as one\nof the films of the year. For a starter,\nneither of the leads seem interested\nin those kind of pictures. Instead it is\nan interesting, sometimes comedic,\nlook at an issue that does require real\nemotion. The moniker \u201cSavage\u201d may\nbe a bit extreme, but the film itself is a\nnicely understated family story.\nAlex Casey\nT\nhis is actually the second\ncolumn that I\u2019ve written\nfor Felix this week, the first\nbeing some stupid awards\ncrap that you might get\nnext week if nothing exciting happens\nbefore then. And then Heath Ledger\ndied, and it showed the whole awards\nfiasco for the trivial bollocks that it is.\nTo be fair, given the prevalence of\ndeath in the media - young boys shot\ndown by teenage gunmen, exchange\nstudents gang-raped and stabbed, x-number of soldiers killed in a Baghdad\ncar bomb attack - a 21st century was-it-suicide-or-was-it-accidental passing\nof a Hollywood actor, albeit one who\ntried to do things differently, is a poor\nindicator of injustice in the world, but\nthere is still something haunting about\nthe news.\nI heard about it on Tuesday night, just\nafter the BBC website found the story\nand a friend called to tell me. Stopping\nshort of professing massive swathes of\ngrief that overcame me, I\u2019ll simply say\nthat it was a shock. I can\u2019t say I was a\nmassive fan - I\u2019ve certainly never hidden my dislike of Brokeback in particu-lar, not least his inaudible mutterings\nthat meant I only ever got Jake\u2019s half of\nthe conversation - but only in the past\nmonth I had a respect for him as one of\nthose actors, alongside Cate Blanchett\nor Christian Bale, who did something\nslightly different.\nIt is all the more shocking in that he\ndidn\u2019t seem sensationalist in his private\nlife at all. This isn\u2019t an iconic figure on\nthe lines of Marilyn Monroe, but someone who maintained a very closed private life, only to have the unfortunate\ncircumstances of an untimely death\nbeamed out worldwide. I imagine it\nwould be quite embarassing if he were\naround to see it, suicide or not. After\nall, he couldn\u2019t even watch his own\nfilms without being self-critical.\nWe don\u2019t know him. Those who do\ncan pay proper tribute to something\nmore than characters he created. For\nthose that can\u2019t, though, there is still\nsomething to feel there. I won\u2019t comment on what that is, but the questions\nsurrounding it should be something\nmore respectful than \u201cSo what happens to Batman now?\u201d\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nevery shot recalls an acceptance speech\nto Oscar, and its no surprise that it\nhasn\u2019t exactly made the buzz list.\nThe acting is the star here, with Jones\nat his best (better than No Country) and\nmost wearisome, leading every frame.\nSusan Sarandon is almost a cameo as\nhis wife and seems to have jumped on\nboard just to espouse the liberal cause,\nwhile Charlize Theron seems to have\npicked a pretty slim role with some\npointless feminist squabbling to be\nhad, North Country-style. Yawn.\nElah probably doesn\u2019t deserve to be\nsavaged. It\u2019s a good film, albeit with a\nslightly dubious message. The human\ncost of war is very real, but the innocent Iraqi children who have died\ndidn\u2019t get their own film. Surely they\nshould have been higher on the agenda\nthan a soldier nicknamed \u201cDoc\u201d for\nhis penchant for poking the exposed\nwounds of Iraqi soldiers. Elah makes\nit look like all soldiers have a labotomy\nof common decency on entering the\nbattlefield, a message I\u2019m sure wasn\u2019t\nintended. This is simply soap box Hollywood; too little, too late.\nIn the Valley of Elah \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Paul Haggis\nWriter: Paul Haggis\nCast: Tommy Lee Jones,\nCharlize Theron,\nSusan Sarandon\nAlex Casey\nThe Savages \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Tamara Jenkins\nWriter: Tamara Jenkins\nCast: Laura Linney,\nPhilip Seymour\nHoffman,\nPhilip Bosco\nLaura Linney, bless\nHeath Ledger (1979-2008)\n22 felix Friday 25 January 2008\n\n"

It also\nutilised other musical styles such\nas those of the American doo-woop\ngroups and rock and roll.\nThe show had its off-Broadway\ndebut in 1982 but didn\u2019t make it to\nBroadway until the 2003 revival. The\nfilm of the musical came out in 1986\nstarring Rick Moranis (that geek\nfrom Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk\nthe Kids\u2026) and Ellen Greene (she\u2019s Sylar\u2019s mum in Heroes!).

See page 38\nThe Medicals entertained Hampstead\nat Twickenham looking to cement 2nd\nposition in the London 3NW table\nwhereas, the visitors, reeling after a\n17-7 defeat to the Medicals earlier in\nthe season, arrived fired up and seeking revenge. Skipper Austin Dekker selected a familiar looking side with the\nexception of fresher Ed Pickles, fresh\nback from injury, in the front row and\nhooker Peter Russell, available for the\nfirst time this season, on the bench.\nDespite the heavy mid-week rain the\nTeddington pitch was, as ever, in superb condition allowing for the open,\nrunning game the Medicals favour.\nHowever, the resolute visitors and a\nreferee seemingly gripped with the minutiae of the game meant that the first\nhalf was repeatedly punctutated by\nset pieces and penalties. The referee\u2019s\nwhistle was to allow the Medicals their\nfirst opportunity to open the scoring\nwhen he adjudged the visitor\u2019s backline to be offside at the ruck. Directly\nin front of the posts and 30 metres out\nMedicals\u2019 weekend team continues good form\nthe penalty caused centre Dan Neville\nlittle trouble as his sweetly struck effort\nsailed over the posts. Almost immediately Hampstead were awarded two\nchances to score penalties, however,\nthe visitor\u2019s kicker pulled both penalties wide of the left hand upright.\nWith both sides unable to string\nphases together the game deteriorated\ninto an atritional affair with every metre keenly contested as the set piece\nbecame increasingly important. In this\nrespect the Medicals were able to hold\ntheir own in the scrum and disrupt the\nvisitor\u2019s lineout, whilst Ruairidh Crawford and Peter O\u2019Neill kept the Medicals lineout in good order. Proceedings\nwere brought to life by a piece of exceptional Medicals play. From a lineout\non the Hampstead ten metre line the\nball was taken up by James Saffin and\nthe resulting ruck superbly cleared out\nby the back row. Quick ball from Tom\nMaynard allowed the backline to move\nthe ball wide where Martin Borthwick,\nwho had cut a superb line from full-back, was fed by Graham Sidorowicz.\nNeat interplay between Borthwick,\nSam Codrington and Joe Codrington\nresulted in the fly-half able to power\nhis way over into the corner. Neville\nmasterfully added the extras.\nNow more established in the game\nthe home side began exerting more\npressure on the Hampstead defence.\nUsing the strong left to right wind Joe\nCodrington and Dan Neville kept the\nvisitors pinned in their twenty-two\nwith an accurate kicking game. Chris\nHallewell was able to steal a Hampstead lineout 10 metres out from\ntheir line. With a huge overlap to his\nright Francois Tudor chose to go for\nthe line himself. Despite being hauled\ndown just short Tudor was, rather for-tuitously, able to shovel the ball back\nto Borthwick who, making light of a\nsmack to the face, crossed under the\nposts. Neville again made no mistake\nwith the conversion.\nAs the half-time whistle blew the\nMedicals knew they had set a platform on which to build for the second\nhalf but were as yet not playing to the\nstandard they are capable of. Kevan\nBell implored his charges to string\nphases together and look to play with\nmore confidence in attack.\nThe coach\u2019s words were clearly taken\nto heart as the Medicals started the\nsecond period in electric form. Immediately from the restart the Medicals become more inventive in attack\nwith forwards and backs alike cutting\nimaginative running lines and looking\nto offload at every opportunity. The\nhome side\u2019s play forced the visitors to\nconcede numerous penalties, which\nwhen asked to by his captain, Neville\nsteered into the corners or successfully kicked between the posts. Winning quick ruck ball and playing with\nan air of assurance the Medicals soon\ncrossed the tryline again when Austin\nDekker received the ball 5 metres out\nand dived over to the right of the posts.\nNeville again made no mistake with\nthe boot.\nSuperman!\nJeremy Bartosiak-Jentys\nRugby Union\nLondon 3NW\nImperial Medicals 1st 39\nHampstead Men\u2019s 1st 19\n\n"

The Kinetic gym at the King\u2019s College Waterloo\ncampus, for example, charges students\n\u00a3199 for a 12 month pass. Similarly, a\nswim in the pool at Energybase, the\nUniversity of London\u2019s sports com-plex, requires day membership, costing \u00a34.50.\nImperial remains the only university in the country with a sports centre offering free pool and gym to all\nstudents.\nSome students, however, have voiced\nconcerns over whether the centre\nmight become more commercial in the\nfuture.\nSituated in the heart of Kensington,\none of the wealthiest regions of London, Ethos could generate considerable\nrevenue from external membership,\nbut would risk marginalising student\ninterests in doing so.\nIn response, the centre assured Felix\nthat there were no plans to alter student access to the pool and gym and\nrestated its commitment to student\nneeds.\nThis year, total membership rose to\nover 1400, of which 73% is made up of\nstudents, 22% of staff and the remaining 5% of external members, who are\nrestricted to off-peak hours to prevent\na build-up of visitors during lunch\nhours and early evening.\nLesser concerns have also arisen regarding registration. Some new students experienced long waits of up\nto a month for gym inductions when\nthey joined in October. Ethos says this\nis unavoidable due to high demand at\nthe start of the academic year, stating\nthat a proper induction is essential for\nHealth and Safety compliance, and this\nnecessitates small groups for extended\nperiods of time.\nTo ease the October congestion this\nyear, it became possible to register for\nthe centre online, preventing the recurrence of the long queues experienced\nin the first year.\nBy far the most popular section of\nthe centre is the gym, with on average\n600 visitors every day. The most popular sport in the main hall is badminton,\nclosely followed by 5-a-side football,\nbut the centre is keen to encourage less\nfamiliar sports as well, such as ultimate\nFrisbee and handball.\nEthos has several new initiatives in\nthe pipeline. The centre is planning a\nHealthy Campus week for some point\nduring the spring, during which its\nstaff will be present on the South Kensington site to talk to students and staff\nabout their fitness, the facilities available at Imperial and offer guidance\nabout healthy living.\nIt is also keen to strengthen existing bonds with the university sports\nteams. Last year, the centre organised\npre-season training weeks for several\nteams, as well as sports massage pro-grams, and this year it is investigating\nsports psychology training.\nIn addition, Ethos can produce, on\nrequest, training programs for any of\nthe university sports societies, tailored\nto the demands of their specific activ-ity, free of charge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the centre,\u201d\nsaid Iain Reid, Ethos Centre Manager,\n\u201cbut we\u2019re always keen to keep improving in any way we can and welcome\nfeedback from students and staff.\u201d He\nadded that, further details regarding\nthe running of Ethos and its future are\npublished in the Sport Imperial Strategic Plan.\nLeft: The Ethos sports centre facade. Right: Ethos swimming pool will remain free to IC students along with the gym\nUnion Council descends into bickering\nM\nonday evening\u2019s\nCouncilmeetingtook\na turn for the childish\nas discussions about\nthe legitimacy of the\nUnion\u2019s Constitution boiled over.\nFormer Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) and former GSA Chair Jon\nMatthews presented a paper to Council highlighting flaws in last year\u2019s\nsubmission process of the Union\u2019s\nConstitution.\nAny changes made to the Union\u2019s\nConstitution have to be presented to\nand approved by Union Council at two\nconsecutive meetings of the commit-tee. These changes are then taken to\nCollege Council which has a reading\nand makes the final approval.\nMr Matthews\u2019 report pointed out\nthat changes were made to the Constitution in between the meetings of last\nyear\u2019s Council. Effectively, Councillors\nhad seen two different Constitutions.\nMoreover, further changes were made\nbefore the Constitution was presented\nto College Council.\nMr Matthews was supported by the\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare, Kirsty Patterson, who wrote a\nsupplementary note. The pair requested Council to repass the current, operating Constitution, in the hope that it\nwould become legally sound.\nHowever, both papers were met with\nopposition by members of Council,\nmost notably the Union President who\nTense: the Union Sabbatical Officers at Monday evening\u2019s Council\nJon Matthews, whose paper\nsparked the heated discussion\nSALLY\nLONGSTAFF\nbelieved the changes were unnecessary\nand could wait until the summer when\nwork eases off.\nThe discussion quickly descended\nbeyond farce and into bickering. Miss\nPatterson was clearly irate and Mr\nBrown even told her to \u201cpipe down\u201d at\none point.\nIn the end Mr Matthews\u2019 paper\nwas rejected by Council: 18-6, with 5\nabstentions.\nUnion officials will be watching their\ntongues\u2019 from now on. With the upcoming Sabbatical Officer elections,\nthey will be keen to give a good impression of politics within the Union.\nSALLY\nLONGSTAFF\n\n"

You may not\nknow me, though my\nname has graced the top\nrow of this page for the\nentirety of the year, and so I feel introductions are in order. I am the mysterious Sebastian Nordgren, and though I\nhave not addressed you directly before,\nthat is an imbalance that I hope to correct during the remainder of the year.\nThis week, we find ourselves firmly\nin the middle of the post-Christmas\ndry spell, with most holiday releases\nalready played through during the holidays and nary a worthy title coming\nout in a long time. In other words, the\nperfect time to dig into those game collections and uncover a forgotten gem.\nRecently, I did exactly that and found,\nburied under too many sequels and\nmediocre games, a great game indeed:\nSystem Shock 2.\nIt was a game that I remember\nwell from the time before ESRB rat-ings, playing it as a mere 14-year old\n(against all industry recommendations\nto the contrary). I remember delving\ninto the world, progressing further\nand further into the ship \u2013 and as the\nambient noises of monsters unknown\ngot louder and more terrifying, I finally\ncaved in and set it aside to gather dust\nuntil I become more courageous. So it\nwas with great excitement that I played\nthrough the game for the first time,\nenjoying the experience thoroughly.\nMost interesting, though, was having\nplayed it only shortly after finishing BioShock, a bonafide spiritual successor\nto the System Shock series.\nAnd with this experience still fresh\nin my mind, this week we bring you\na roundup of the most well-known\nspiritual successors of recent times,\nmaking our English teachers proud by\ncomparing and contrasting the original\nand the successor. Though the quality\nof these successors varies across the\nboard, and the links are sometimes\ntenuous from one to the other \u2013 I for\none am glad that good game concepts\ndon\u2019t get completely lost in the quagmires of intellectual property laws.\nThis week in Byte we also bring you\ntwo very different rhythm games, the\nelectronic and rather psychaedelic\nSynaesthete; and the thoroughly rock\nFrets on Fire. Both require a bit more\nthan a browser to get working, but all\nbut the most rhythmically challenged\namong you should put in the effort and\ngive them a twirl. It\u2019s refreshing to see\nthat the rhythm genre has branched so\nfar from its popular origins in Dance\nDance Revolution.\nGoing with the succession theme,\nwe\u2019ve decided to talk some smack\nto counteract the love. That\u2019s right:\nFlamebait is back and this time it\u2019s\nSamir Talwar who\u2019s drawn his katana\nand prepared to make sushi out of\nsequels that have almost driven great\nfranchises to te ground. That\u2019s the secret behind a trilogy: the third game\nneeds to be the saviour.\nI hope you enjoy the issue! As always,\nplease feel free to mail your musings to\nfelix.games@imperial.ac.uk.\nThis\nWeek\nBurn under our fiery gaze\nFlamebait: More is less\nSamir Talwar runs over sequels and then doubles back to make sure they\u2019re dead\nP\nlayed a sequel lately? I have,\nandI\u2019mbitter.It\u2019slikereturning to a theme park: you\u2019re\nfull of wide-eyed wonder as\nyou walk in, but you soon\nrealise you\u2019ve seen it all before, the\nqueues are longer and the rides aren\u2019t\nas fun as they were last time around.\nAdd to the fact that at some point a\nfifteen-year old ape-child with far too\nmany spots will step on your foot and\ncrush three bones, and a little girl will\ndrop her ice cream on you and then\nstart howling as if it\u2019s your fault, and\nyou may as well have stayed at home.\nFrickin\u2019 kids...\nButIdigress.Onlyslightly,ofcourse...\nmany sequels do make you feel like this.\nMetal Gear Solid 2 springs to mind, introducing perhaps the most hated protagonist since Macbeth (who spends\nfar too much time running around sans\nundergarments), a story more confusing and boring than my ex-girlfriend,\ncompletely disregarding my preferred\nending to the first game and adding\ncut-scenes as if removing the gameplay\nfor far too long will make it all better.\nThankfully, I still had the first game, so\nafter forcing myself through the second\nout of sheer loyalty (read: stupidity) to\nHideo Kojima\u2019s genius, I sacrificed it to\nthe heathen Gods, stuck the battered\ndisc of the original into my PlayStation\nand purified my soul.\nIt may interest you to know (or not...\nto be honest, I don\u2019t care) that Deus\nEx: Invisible War is the sequel to my\nfavourite game. It got glowing reviews\nand was generally regarded as a must-buy... unless you played the prequel.\nThe reason? While it\u2019s good, the first\none was better. The story was more en-gaging, the weapons and gizmos were\na damn sight cooler and to be honest,\nthe game was just more fun. But why?\nSurely the design team, with a bigger budget, more staff and a loyal fan\nbase, have all the right wooden blocks\nin their slots? Not only that, but with\na killer game under their belt, cod-ers, artists and lackeys a-plenty were\nclamouring to work for them... so what\nwent wrong?\nEverything, apparently. The designers suffered from visionary conflicts,\nwhich is basically a fancy way of saying they argued a lot and generally the\nidiots won. In addition, the programmers were no doubt missing a few\nbolts, choosing to develop a game that\nbarely worked on the Xbox and assuming it would run amazingly on the PC\nwithout any real work at all. The result\nwas a half-finished product that, in\ncomparison to its big brother, looked\nlike it had been run through the Texture Crippler a few too many times and\nplayed about as well as a three-legged\ndog with no lungs.\nThere are many problems that plague\nany developer looking to make a few\nquid quickly and quietly by creating\nsequels. A huge one is a lack of moti-vation, often brought on by the parent\ncompany (we love you really, EA) bullying their friendly neighbourhood subsidiaries into milking the public for all\nthey\u2019re worth, but it\u2019s definitely not the\nonly one. It\u2019s hard to create something\nfresh and exciting while still staying\ntrue to the original game\u2019s roots \u2013 just\nask Nintendo what the hell they were\nthinking of when they released Super\nMario Bros 2: The Vegetable Throwing\nContest. Often, designers will attempt\nto bring in new features \u2013 such as the\n3D environment in the case of Worms\n3D \u2013 even if it actually worsens the\ngameplay.\nSequels don\u2019t just have to be good. As\nDeus Ex proved, they need to be better than the original, or you\u2019ve wasted\nyour time. Valve figured this one out\nwith their Half-Life series: they beefed\nup the graphics tremendously, tweaked\nthe gameplay just enough to keep it\nfresh without ruining everyone\u2019s perception of the first game and added a\ncool new widget that blows stuff up in\nstyle. The only problem was that goddamn Steam thingy that refuses to let\nme play until I\u2019ve given it my credit\ncard and let it fondle me a little, but\nit seems to be getting slightly better\n(though not faster \u2013 it\u2019s still a pig on\nolder systems) with every iteration.\nA bit of research (or searching on\nWikipedia, which passes for research as\nfar as my assignments are concerned)\nshows that Halo 2 came out just a week\nbefore Half-Life 2. Now there\u2019s some\npolar opposites if I ever saw them:\nwhile both were big successes based\nalmost solely on their prequels, HalfLife 2 was brilliant in every way. Not\nso much for Halo... while many think\nthe multiplayer far surpasses the first\ngame, for many, the single-player was\nthe reason they bought it. Of course,\ntheir expectations were dashed when\nthey found out Bungie had been snorting crack until the last possible second\nand then thrown in what amounts to\nlong, drawn out bullshit scattered\nacross a dark room so you can\u2019t see it\n(or anything else) clearly... which incidentally was what a lot of the levels\nwere like. There were good moments...\nand then you had to shoot yet another\ngrunt who got too happy and started\nfiring his pistol at his partner like a\ntrigger-happy US marine. Moments of\nreal action were few and far between,\nwith most of the game following the\nexact same story arc as the first game\nbut with less actual plot and more\nfunny-shaped aliens with big heads\nand annoying voices. To this day, I still\ndon\u2019t know what the game was about,\nbut I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s not worth\nplaying again to find out.\nThinking about it while my subconscious rattles off a list of reasons why\nyou\u2019re wrong and I\u2019m right, there is\none reason above any other why sequels have a tendency to fail: it\u2019s your\nown nostalgic brain. Your memory has\nfinite space, and is much better at storing those moments you really treasure,\nas opposed to the ones where you were\npretty much indifferent to the entire\nsituation.\nAs such, if you liked a game when\nyou were seven years old, there\u2019s a\nhigh probability you\u2019re looking back\non it fondly right at this moment...\napologies for bursting your bubble, but\nDouble Dragon really wasn\u2019t that good\ncompared to its younger siblings. Go\nback and play it, assuming you can find\nthat bloody NES \u2013 it may still retain\nits charm and revel in its glory as your\nlove for it blossoms... but on the other\nhand, it may tank under your petrifying stare as you realise that even Peggle gloriously storms past it in the Fun\ncharts.\nI wonder if the BBFC actually played the game before deeming it a 15\nDeus Ex: The Invisible War \u2013 bigger, prettier... but better?\nNFS has made visual strides since NFSIII (\u201898); gameplay, not so much\nColossal successor\nShock therapy Total commander\n\n"

    "content": "8 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nNoel Forrest\nCelebrities say the funniest things\nA\nren\u2019t celebrities silly! The\ncharity Sense About Science have flagged up\nsome classic science\ngaffes from 2007, including Sarah Beeny\u2019s, \u201clovely make up\nand moisturisers which don\u2019t have any\nchemicals in them\u201d and Heather Mills\u2019\nviews that animals farmed for meat\nand dairy \u201care at the heart of almost\nall the world\u2019s environmental catastrophes.\u201d Richly comic, but based on personal experience, I really can\u2019t believe\nmy state of knowledge about the world\nis any good either, even as a scientist.\nNot because there\u2019s so much information out there, but because there is so\nvery much horse manure out there.\nAs an ecology student I fretted about\na sixth and this time human-led mass\nextinction, but was then taught that\nplant diversification has actually constantly progressed upwards throughout earth\u2019s history, as explained by the\n\u2018zoo versus botanic garden\u2019 paradigm. I\ndiligently uprooted the invasive Himalayan Balsam from the banks of my\nlocal river, but did I poison the alien\nRhododendrons in my garden? I did\nnot. I believed the eminent climate scientist Jim Hansen when he said we\u2019d\n\u201cexceeded the normal operating range\nfor carbon dioxide in our atmosphere\u201d,\nand in the context of the recent glacial/\ninterglacial cycling that\u2019s true, but is it\ntrue in the context of geological time?\nWell, no actually.\nGeologist Stephen Drury sums up\nearth\u2019s history as \u201cconstant change\u201d,\nwhich kind of puts things in perspec-tive. We may even have averted the onset of the next ice age. I walked in the\nwoods and I marvelled at nature, and\nthen I read Oliver Rackham\u2019s The History of the Countryside. Nature went\nwhen Bronze Age man cut down all the\ntrees I\u2019m afraid (that\u2019s if you still believe there was ever such a thing as wilderness in the first place.). Legendary\nplant scientist Peter Grubb (\u201cspend an\nhour with him you\u2019ll think he\u2019s Darwin, spend a week and you\u2019ll think he\u2019s\nGod\u201d) rounded off my undergrad days\nwith a lecture on how many intelligent\npeople leave ecology because they can\nsee it\u2019s faults too clearly, and that the\nonly people who ever really discover\nanything anyway are the obsessive\n\u201cshrinking violet\u201d types. So I left too,\nand went into banking.\nBut let me tell you, things aren\u2019t any\nbetter there either. If you think you can\nread the business section, see M&S\u2019\nsales falling and think \u201coo I\u2019d better sell\nthose shares\u201d, and make some money\nlike that, you are very, very much mis-taken. You\u2019ll probably sell them to a\ntrader who is buying the dip because\nhe has a hunch there\u2019ll be a private equity bid, and what\u2019s more if he himself\nmakes any real money then that too\nwill be basically luck. Because unless\nyou\u2019ve worked in an industry or consulted for it, you\u2019ll be hard pushed to\nsay which company in that sector is\nlikely to outperform over the coming\nyear. And as for timing entry and exit\ninto asset classes, well just forget it.\nBut does that stop heavy advertising\nby fund managers to get your money\ninto a zero-sum game where they\u2019re\ncharging a fee? Or sales driven stockbroker chat for the commission on the\ntrades they make, all well within the\nFSA regulations? You know it doesn\u2019t.\nMany adverts boast of established positions in India and China, but could\nthey please explain why that\u2019s a good\nthing? Ever heard of emerging market\ncrashes? Nah, China\u2019s all the rage! Fine,\nI\u2019m sold. Buy. Buy manure.\nThis is why enhancing our sense of\npersonal responsibility is thankfully\nmoving up the political agenda. Vulnerable members of society will not\nmake the most of life unless they realise they have to work things out them-selves. Interestingly, at the other end\nof the spectrum, the message appears\nto be the same. According to the Vice\nChancellor of the University of Cambridge, Alison Richard, the aim of an\nelite education is to learn to think for\noneself.\nMy point is simply that this is very\nimportant, because of the vast swathes\nof claptrap we need to navigate through\nin life. We need to start asking more\npertinent questions, like why must Imperial\u2019s front doors rotate slower than\nthe earth? If I die in there after someone touches the sides and it stops, then\nI don\u2019t want to be moved. I want to rot\nin a bloody Catherine-wheel of protest\nagainst getting it wrong. That\u2019s if it\never gets going again.\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\n\u201c\nWe need\nto start asking\nmore pertinent\nquestions,\nlike why must\nImperial\u2019s front\ndoors rotate\nslower than the\nearth?\n\u201d\nHeather Mills: Speaking sense\nsince the dawn of time.

    "content": "26 felix Friday 25 January 2008\nGot more cash than sense?\nAndrew Lyle, Andrew Slater and James Finnerty find out what to spend it on\nW\nith people going\nnuts over the recent release of the\nApple iPhone, we\nthought it would\nbe just to compare it to the products of\nmore experienced phone manufactur-ers. Who will win? A company fabled\nfor product design and user experi-ence? Or the team of companies who\ncreated the mobile phone market in\nthe first place?\nNow aside from the iPhone there are\nseveral stand-out phones on the mar-ket. I\u2019ve tracked down as many people\nwho own these little guys as I could\nso we can get some authentic user\nfeedback and put together a proper\ncomparison.\nLets start with the popular N95 from\nNokia. Now I\u2019m going to try and set my\nbias to one side as I own one of these\namazing little gadgets.\nDue to its popularity this phone has\nnow become very affordable for what it\noffers. You can expect to get it free on\na \u00a330 a month, 18 month contract with\na decent plan, pretty good for a handset valued between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400.\nThere is also a newer version which\nhas a slightly larger screen, more user\nRAM and 8Gb\u2019s of flash storage built\nin. However, this version is limited to\nVodafone and as such is difficult to get\nhold of for good value.\nA phone like this is what we call\na smart phone, basically meaning\nthe user can add applications to the\nphone\u2019s roster. This comes with heaps\nof benefits and an equally daunting pile\nof problems. The phone is very powerful and has tonnes of cool features such\nas a 5 megapixel camera, high resolution decent size screen, loud speak-ers, 3g, WiFi and Bluetooth to name a\nfew. What do these accessories have in\ncommon though? They all eat batteries\nfor breakfast. I am lucky to get a day\u2019s\nworth of battery if I use the N95 as an\nmp3 whilst I walk to and from college\nand then as a phone throughout the\nday.\nA cool little feature is that this phone\ncan be plugged into a TV. So you can\nput films onto it and play them in your\nliving room or anyone\u2019s living room.\nAlso, with some of the console emulators that have been developed for this\nphone, you can even play games on the\nTV.\nSo overall it\u2019s clear that this phone\u2019s\npopularity is very well justified and\nNokia have really kept their reputation\nas premier phone designers.\nThe other big boy in the market is\nobvious. The dreaded iPhone. Now I\nthink practically everyone has heard of\nit by now but not everyone will know\nwhy it is so popular. Well, a portion of\nits popularity is rooted in the army of\nloyal Apple consumers, but this only\nexplains why people pay over the odds\nfor it.\nIn a lot of areas the iPhone is dwarfed\nby other phones. Its camera is reasonably dated, no swappable storage and\nno 3G but the beauty comes in what\nApple always strive for. An enjoyable\nuser experience. The biggest tool that\nallowed this was the new multi-touch\nscreen. Now touch screens have been\naround for years but they have only\never been able to accept a single in-put. You can see them get confused if\nyou put two fingers on the screen in\ndifferent places. The iPhone, however\n,can recognize these as separate inS\no what happened this week?\nThe tech world seems to have\ntaken a bit of a break after\nall the releases at the events\nfrom the last issue.\nSo as I sit here in the Felix office\nstruggling to fill up this column with\nwho-knows-what I\u2019ll begin with an intro to what\u2019s sprawled across the next\ntwo pages.\nWe have the promised phone reviews\ncomparing some of the big sellers and\ntop-end models in the phone market.\nSome of the phone reviews are written\nby owners and others are written based\non opinions we got off of people who\ndo use them but were to lazy to write\nabout it.\nAlso, to fill up a little bit more space,\nAndrew Slater has written about tablet\nPC\u2019s. Watch as he tries to justify the\nmoney that these things cost.\nNow lets try and find out if anything\nsignificant happend in the last seven\ndays. The whole of the Hull lost access\nto the internet, now whether or not\nyou feel this is good or bad news is up\nto you but the phrase \u201cnothing of value\nwas lost\u201d springs to mind.\nMicrosoft has decided to rush out\nanother new version of Windows that\nwill replace the void which was Vista\u2019s\nintended sales. Windows 7, as it is currently creatively dubbed, is planned for\nrelease at the end of 2009. So if past\nrecords are any indicator we\u2019ll be lucky\nif we start seeing an ad campaign at the\nLondon Olympics.\nThe ex-boss of Gizmondo has been\nreleased from an American prison and\nis being deported back to Sweeden. He\nwas jailed after admitting to embezzlement and some charges relating to\ntotalling his Ferrari Enzo.\nThe army of people against mobile\nphones has had new fuel added to their\nfire this week. Apparently, using a mobile phone in the hours before you go\nto bed will cause a bad night\u2019s sleep.\nI wonder if someone could argue the\ncase that not having the conversation\njust before bed would have caused a\nworse night\u2019s sleep?\nInternet social networking sites are\nbeing blamed for glorifying suicide.\nThe argument is that after people witness the affection someone receives\nonline after suicide they begin to crave\nthe same attention. Arguably this has\nbeen happening for years but sites like\nFacebook and MySpace just amplify\nthe scale.\nIn more news more red tape is blocking the widespread use of the $100 laptop in developing countries. It goes to\nshow that even the most humanitarian\nof projects can be brought to a halt by\nthe actions of a few.\nWhat a cheerful week it\u2019s been. After\nthat depressing revelation let\u2019s hope\nthat reading about some of the world\u2019s\nmost popular hand-held gadgets will\nput you in a better mood.\nP.S. I know I\u2019m kind of stealing this\nfrom Azfar\u2019s section but EA are breaking down some bonudaries in digital\nvideo game distribution. The next title\nin the Battlefield franchise, \u2018Battlefield\nHeroes\u2019, will be released for free online.\nIt\u2019s been designed to run on older machines and is being targeted at the large\nAsian online gaming community.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nputs, allowing you to do cool stuff like\npinching your fingers together to make\nthings smaller. Getting all this together\ninto the polished version that was released was a fantastic piece of work as\nit is pretty much glitch-free.\nThis phone definitely ain\u2019t cheap. A\none-off payment of \u00a3269 and a compulsory \u00a335 a month 24 month contract is\nthe price you pay. This makes it one of\nthe most expensive contracts there is\nand this is solely down to branding.\nI\u2019m gonna cut the coverage of the\niPhone a little short as so much information of it is readily available. Ultimately it is a very impressive device\nbut it\u2019s very hard to justify its cost.\nWe now move onto the LG Viewty.\nIn many ways this phone is the only\nthing that competes directly with the\niPhone in terms of user experience. It\nhas a similar-sized touchscreen, but it\u2019s\nonly single input, and has a menu system that is as easy to use.\nIt does surpass almost all other\nphones in one area, though. If you\nfancy yourself as a photographer, this\nphone takes some of the highest quality pictures available to a camera phone.\nAt 5 megapixels it seems on a par with\nthe N95 but in reality it produces much\nbetter results.\nThe big con of this phone is that it\nhas no WiFi functionality. So if you\nwant any internet access on it you\u2019re\ngoing to have to go through the hefty\nprice tags of your network provider.\nThis is a real shame as if this has been\nincluded we could have seen a serious\ndirect competitor to the iPhone.\nThe next phone to cover is the brick\nlike e90. This phone was originally going to have its own article but we decided to attach it to this one, so apologies for its far more in-depth coverage.\nOh; and this is the bit written by Andrew Lyle.\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when all\nyour mates whip out their sleek new\nphones. The new iPhone, the LG Viewty - both undeniably sexy pieces of kit;\nthe acclaimed Nokia N95 with its huge\nNokia N95 - Anything you can do I can do better\nfeature set or perhaps the new SonyEricsson K850i \u2018Cyber-Shot\u2019 camera\nphone. I get asked what my new phone\nis and amid looks of utter disbelief,\nI take out this asymmetrical, dirty\nbrick. Go back to the early 90\u2019s and this\nphone would fit right in. So why, you\nmay ask, was I so overjoyed to finally\nget my hands on one?\nWell, this phone is more than it first\nappears; open it up and what greets\nyou is a miniature laptop complete\nwith a gorgeous wide-screen display\nand full qwerty keyboard. If I went\nback again to the 90\u2019s or even to a few\nyears ago, this phone could put a lot of\nhome PCs to shame. With an obscene\namount of RAM it\u2019ll multi-task better\nthan your mum and it has a processor\nto match, keeping all the applications\nyou could wish to run whizzing around\nat top speed.\nIt is termed a \u2018Business Communicator\u2019 and rightly so - with a full suite\nof office-esque editing applications\nyou can flick through your lecture note\nApple iPhone - Don\u2019t really need to point this out but it\u2019s the best selling phone model in the world\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFriday 25 January 2008 felix\nComment\nJourney to the End of the Paragraph\nL\net\u2019s go on an expedition.\nYes, that\u2019s right, you and\nme. Don\u2019t be nervous \u2013 I\u2019ve\nbeen told I\u2019m pretty good\ncompany. In any case, we\u2019re\nnot going very far. In fact, you don\u2019t\neven have to move to make the highly\nglamorous Journey to the End of the\nParagraph.\nWhat drives a person to set off and\nmake their mark on the vast, daunting expanse of a white page? Some are\ndrawn by the rumour of hidden treas-ure, theirs for the unearthing if they\nsteer the right course. Others want\nnothing else but to leave the world they\nknow, and immerse themselves in the\nmagical lands they may find beneath\nthe cold whiteness of the page. Then,\nof course, there are those who seek the\nthrill of exploration. Who are driven\non by the insatiable need to unlock\nthe potential of these uncharted ter-ritories. Armed with but a handful of\npunctuation marks, a sturdy thesaurus\nand a strong pair of glasses they resolutely set off for the Terra Incognita.\nThe journey that lies ahead is not\nan easy one, and adequate preparation has to be taken. The first step is to\nensure the possession of a sufficiently\npowerful vocabulary to fight one\u2019s way\nacross the verbal wasteland. Without\none, even the most ardent explorer will\nbe lucky to cross into the second para-graph; the firepower a decent vocabulary provides is crucial for the success\nof a literary expedition.\nAssuming that transportation is taken care of, a good supply of grammatical rules is indispensable for creating a\nhealthy atmosphere; making sure the\ngroup stays united and structured, and\nthat no individual words go straying\noff into the wilderness, where no feat\nof construction, however daring, will\nsave them.\nGilead Amit\nAny such trip\u2019s failure can be guaranteed by the absence of proper plan-ning. Paths have to be sketched out,\ngoals must be set. Certain fixed destinations must be reached before others.\nAbove all, random meandering in the\nwild leads nowhere. For a sentence to\nbe successful it must have a fixed aim,\nand a detailed map must be drawn up\nas to how to get there.\nThe trip seems more daunting now\nthan it did before, doesn\u2019t it? Constructing a sentence outline, ensuring\nsufficient word-power, being familiar\nwith the grammar? Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re\nwell equipped. You have the finest set\nof punctuation marks in the history of\nman in your rucksack; an invaluable\naid if you know how to use them.\nVital to success is the comma; the\nmost precious tool available to you.\nYou can now embark on the longest of\nsentences without fear. The steep climb\nto the end of a thought can be danger-ous, and without the assistance of a\ncomma, one can fall all the way back\ndown the cliff face to the beginning of\nthe sentence. The \u2018fallen apostrophe\u2019 is\na crampon for these sheerest of slopes,\ngiving you a resting-place while you\nplan the next section of your climb. Be\nwarned, though \u2013 use too many and\nyou won\u2019t get anywhere.\nThe semi-colon is the big-boy equiv-alent. A much more powerful, more\nfinely-crafted tool, it is extremely dangerous in the wrong hands. Needless\nto say, it is very effective; but unsupervised use can result in structural cha-os. It is, of course, made by the same\nmanufacturer as the colon, which is\nno less risky, and should be used only\nin the event of an emergency. It serves\nas a warning shot: it slows the pace of\nyour expedition down, but keeps them\nmoving. Be prepared though: the general tension will rise after its use, and\neveryone will be desperately eager to\nreach the end of the sentence as soon\nas possible.\nThe dash is a helpful and compact\nrope bridge for getting across the most\nperilous of breaks in the sentence\nstructure. The linguistic framework\ncan collapse under your feet in a moment \u2013 and it is the dash that can guide\nyou to safety. Should you fail to use it\nin time, however, a solitary ellipsis will\nindicate the final resting-place of a\nthought cut off before its time...\nThere will be times when your words\nwill get restless and want to stray from\nthe arranged path. Occasional deviations are very healthy (so long as you\nmark your trail properly with paren-theses, so as to able to return to it\neventually), but if your phrasing gets\noverexcited, you may have to pull the\ntrigger and fire a full stop through its\nhead. Sentences that are going nowhere do sometimes need to be put\nto sleep; as gut-wrenching as that can\nsometimes be.\nThese adventures are by no means\nrare, but they are remarkable, and\ncan be as thrilling and terrifying as\nany. They are voyages that anyone can\nmake with ease, so long as one plans\none\u2019s trip well, is well-equipped, knows\nwhere one is headed, and, above all,\navoids excessive comma usage.\nRoses are red, violets are more costly\nF\nour weeks, then. Less than\nthat, by the time you\u2019re reading this. I don\u2019t need to tell\nyou what it\u2019s four weeks un-til, because there are amoeba\nliving at the bottom of trenches in the\nPacific that have already begun to put\nup Valentine\u2019s Day decorations in their\npresumably single-celled shopfronts.\nYou can\u2019t not know that it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s\nDay soon, because if you\u2019re single then\nHigh Street Kensington looks like it\u2019s\ndangling its genitalia and laughing at\nyou from every shop window you pass,\nand if you aren\u2019t single then you\u2019ve\nprobably been obsessing about gift-buying for the last two months, and if\nyou haven\u2019t then why not? Don\u2019t you\nlove your partner? Don\u2019t you? Then\nwhy aren\u2019t you buying You2Me bears to\nexpress it? Why not, you loveless shit?\nNot that people are predictable, but\naround this time of year you generally get two camps forming based on\nthe groups above. There are those\nwho are ready to chow down the colour pink in every available form for\nthe two weeks running up to The Big\nDay, and there are those that claim that\nit\u2019s \u201ca manufactured holiday\u201d that \u201cthe\ngreetings card companies\u201d made up. I\ndon\u2019t know whether the greetings card\ncompanies deserve being referred to in\nthe same tones as OPEC, but I\u2019m pretty\nsure that if they\u2019re planning anything,\nit\u2019s more likely to be how to make their\ncelebrity-parody cards even bloody\nA. Geek\n\u201c\nMy point\nbeing this \u2013\ndealing drugs to\nprimary school\nchildren? Moral\ngrey area\nnoisier rather than convincing people\nto express their love in paper form.\nBut what\u2019s so bad with a manufactured holiday, anyway? It\u2019s not like it\nmakes the gestures any less sincere. It\u2019s\nnot Hallmark that\u2019s screwing you over\nreally, it\u2019s just you that\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s like\nhow heroin on it\u2019s own is actually kind\nof pretty, if you put it in jars and shine\nhalogen lamps through it. But if you\ngive it to nine year-olds, suddenly it\u2019s\na massive evil and bang! You\u2019re in jail\nfor twelve to eighteen months. Jesus.\nMy point being, firstly \u2013 dealing drugs\nto primary school children? Moral\ngrey area. But secondly, and more im-portantly, it\u2019s you that\u2019s to blame deep\ndown.\nNow, I like to think that my girlfriend\nand I are different, but then again I\nwould. And though I should point out\nthat she not only knows I write this,\nbut also \u2013 god forbid \u2013 actually reads\nthe shit I churn out, you might have a\nright to be cynical about anything I say\nthis week. But that\u2019s up to you, really.\nAnyway, there\u2019s this girl, as mentioned above, and God love her she\nmanages to tolerate my unhappiness\nand general anger on a weekly and\nfrequently daily basis. I\u2019m incredibly\ngrateful for this. It makes me ludicrously happy, in fact, and there are times\nwhen she manages to entirely defeat\nthe whining, rage-filled sloth that pulls\nthe majority of my levers. I don\u2019t know\nif that\u2019s supposed to be something a\ngirl puts up with, but I guess it beats\nputting up with, say, physical abuse or\na private stash of pornographic maga-zines. Maybe.\nThe point is that I\u2019m extremely grateful and take any opportunity I can to\nshow this. That means that Valentine\u2019s\nDay is just a convenient marker, a kind\nof \u2018why the hell not\u2019 label in the diary\nwhere we think it might be a good idea\nto put aside trivial things like study\nor other people and take the time to\nremind each other that we really feel\nbetter with the other around. And\nthat whiny sloths can never beat roses\nbought from French people.\nNow, if you\u2019re looking at Valentine\u2019s\nDay as a day where you\u2019ve got something to prove, then you\u2019re just setting\nyourself up for a fall. This is why most\npeople end up collapsing under the\nweight of their own self-pity, or panic-attacking every time they see a stuffed\ntoy in January. The \u2018commercialism\u2019 is\njust what shops do. It\u2019s why there\u2019s a\nguy selling umbrellas outside Gloucester Road every time it rains, and sure,\nI want to punt him in the groin with\none of his own products just as much\nas you do, but it\u2019s not his fault. When\nthe hell else is he going to sell them?\nNo, the reason everyone gets so depressed is because they convince themselves that there\u2019s some kind of demand\nbeing put on them by everyone else. It\u2019s\nwhy you want a pair of Converse now\nthat you\u2019ve seen them in Felix\u2019s fashion\npage, and it\u2019s why you can never tell\npeople \u2018no\u2019. Because you can\u2019t, can you?\nYou feel bad, as if there\u2019s going to be\nsome repercussion that the Universe\nitself will exact upon you. Well, good\nnews \u2013 there won\u2019t be. No-one\u2019s going\nto care if you\u2019re single come this Valentine\u2019s Day, and if you\u2019re so desperate\nto have someone for that particular day\nthen it\u2019s probably time to reassess your\nlife vis-\u00e0-vis being a normal human be-ing. Similarly, if the best you can think\nof your partner is that they\u2019re going to\nabandon you unless you offer them a\nchocolate box so big that it interferes\nwith the Earth\u2019s own gravitational field,\nthen you\u2019re probably not in a healthy\nrelationship. Trust doesn\u2019t just mean\nleaving your boyfriend alone with\nthat pretty research assistant from the\nfourth floor. It also means that you\ndon\u2019t think they\u2019re so gullible as to\njudge your commitment to them on\nthe basis of confectionery.\nThis compulsion thing, actually, is\none of the more frustrating things I see\nfrom day to day; the fact that so many\nof us are bounded by expectation.\nMost of the time, though, I can\u2019t find a\nway to make it sound funny rather than\njust very, very sad. If you\u2019re lucky, I just\nmight tell you that story another week.\nFor now you should scurry off to the\nlocal commercialism store and stock\nup on exploitation. I will be at in my\napartment, looking after my garnet.\nMuch love.\nNot quite as glamorous perhaps, but just as thrilling\n\u201c\nArmed with\nbut a handful\nof punctuation\nmarks, a sturdy\nthesaurus and\na strong pair\nof glasses they\nresolutely set\noff for the Terra\nIncognita\n\u201d\n\n"
