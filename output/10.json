    "content": "FELIX\nTO ALL MINES FRESHERS\nOn behalf of the older hands, may we offer\nyou a very sincere welcome to the Hoyal School of\nMines. We are glad that you have chosen the senior mining college at which to study your particular aspect of the profession. In doing BO you\nare entering a college with a great reputation\nand nearly a century of tradition - a tradition\nof which all past and present students are extremely proud, for It is they who have built up\nthis stature. Its future lies In your hands and\nbecause we are a small community your individual\ncooperation is needed in some of the many student\nactivities. It is as a result of this pulling together that the \"Mines spirit\" has been formed.\nBy giving a hand and showing an interest you will not only be fostering this comradeship, but will also enrich your short stay here. Furthermore,\nmany of the social activities afford the possibility of meeting past students now established in the profess.ion.\nThe organisation of which you are now a mem ber that runs these sporting and social functions\nIs the R.S. M. Union, the constitution and rules\nof which are explained In a handbook you will shortly receive. The officers of the union will do ever th lng to make your stay as pleasant as\npossible, but its ultimate success depends on\nyour support.\nAcademically, the teaching staff are very approachable and extremely willing to offer all the\nadvice gained from wide experience.\nThus ahead of you lie three or four very full years, during which your personal success and to a great extent that of your college rest largely in\nyour hands. We wish you a very happy and successful stay at the Mines.\nR.S. M. Union.\nGUILDS\nIn welcoming you to Guilds I would cast before\nyou a few pearls of wisdom, to show you what the\ncollege can offer you if you cooperate.\nI want to Impress on you that there are numerous Social, Athletic and Bacchanalian activities\nopen to you, and if you will only show some enterprise - then you're in! Now \"being in\" will provide just that opportunity for getting the most out\nof your life here, and far from interfering with\nyour work will avoid any chance of mental collapse\nas the year progresses.\nTo help you pursue these activities there are\nvarious Guilds Clubs which are quite separate from\ntheir I.C. counterparts, but are complementary to\nthem, so get your name down at once for the Clubs\nthat interest you.\nThere are various dates that I would like to\ncall to your attention now - Oct. 20th, Guilds\nFreshers' Buffet: Oct. 27th, I.C. Commemoration\nDay: Nov. 5th, Guy Fawkes Day: Nov. 22nd, Morphy\nDay: the Guilds Carnival and Civils Dance in the\nEaster Term: and the Field Cup in the Summer\nTerm. Mark these days down now and you'll find\nthat more Information will filter through to you\nabout them as time goes on.\nGuilds was most successful last year in the\nfield of sport, particularly against our brother\nand sister colleges the Mines and the R.C.S., so\nwe must keep that up this year, but we want the\nEngineers' Cup for rug ger this year as well.\nThe Guilds Engineering Society holds frequent meetings at which papers are read by present students and other distinguished engineers,\nand a \u00a35 prize is offer red for the best student\npaper of the year. Its magazine, \"The Guilds Engineer\" is also intelligible in parts, and appears\nannually.\nGuilds Union Meetings provide more colourful\ndiversion from the common task. Room 17, whose\nnormal capacity is 100 sleepy students, for Union\nMeetings holds 400 raving maniacs. Come to these\nmeetings and voice your opinions.\nIn a nutshell, avoid brown bagging i and let\nme emphasize again that what you gain from college\nlife will depend directly upon what you put Into\nit, and upon your own initiative.\nA LETTER TO R.C.S. FRESHMEN\nDear Fresher,\n\"Welcome to R.C. SjH\nThe yearly Influx of new student a to the College Is one of the vital moments in its existence,\nfor at this time we look to the ranks of the Freshers to enable us to fill the gape in the fabric\nof the Union. This letter is to show you the sort\nof support we want.\nIn the main, the University is non-resident-i al and the fusion of social and academic life la largely organised by the college Unions. You are\na member of R.C.S. Union and also I.C. Union. If\nyou are going to get anything out of University\nlife at all, it is your duty to support both these\nbodies to the utmost. The \"Law of Conservation of\nEnergy\" applied to Union affairs, means that unless you put something Into them you'll get nothing\nout.\nGet to know your Union officers. It must be\nobvious that Union officers cannot know all the\nstudents at College, but it is much easier for you\nto know them. If you have any queries, suggestions\nor complaints introduce yourself and fire away - we\nshould be delighted by this evidence of interest by\nany Fresher. You will have, or will be getting, a copy of the R.C.S. Booklet, which tells you how you\ncan contact Union and Club Officials and which contains many other things which will help to put you\nIn the picture.\nThe main social life of the College revolves\naround the Athletic and Social Clubs. Join them,\nsupport them; you will find it well worth the ef-fort. In addition, your support for corporate College functions is important. The Commemoration Day\nCeremony (see R.C.S. booklet) needs the active support of every student to be an effective and rewarding occasion as it was last year. Morphy Day\n(Nov. 22nd this year) is a day of battle on the\nriver and sometimes in the river. Whilst two VIIIs\nfrom each college race for the Morphy and Lowry\ncups, a great battle takes place on the towpath for\ncertain sacred symbols -told of elsewhere - and\nyour support on the towpath is lm Der at ive. You must not assume from tms letter that your\nactivities at I.C. and R.C.S. will consist solely\nof Union and social affairs - work 13 also essen-ti al. But I.C.( and to start a controversy, I think it originated in R.C.S.) has coined a word,\nnow preserved for posterity in the Dictionary of\nUniversity Slang, which castigates those who,\nhe d fed in by books and work, emerge only rarely\ncarrying a little brown bag. Such are the 'brown-bag gers, an odious tribe.\nFinally, a special word to overseas Freshers:\nthis college is proud to accept you. It has a considerable reputation with regard to overseas\nstudents and it hopes that by your efforts, this\nreputation will be further enhanced.\nLet me end with ac liche, none the less sin-ce re: 'Best of luck, Freshers'.\nPeter Haskell.\nPRESIDENT, R.C.S.

    "content": "FELIX DUCKS IN DEVON\n(or How We Bowled a Maiden Over).\nSixteen members of the cricket club went on,\nthe- traditional end-of-term tour of South Devon.\nAll the matches were played, - and there was one\nevery day, whl eh will surprise those who assert\nthat the cricket is but the ostensible reason for\nthis annual caravans era i. The evening of our arrival In Torquay was occupied by keen discussion of the finer points of\nthe came (and etc.) at the \"Hole in the Wall\" and\nthe Devon Arms\". But in spite of this the opening\nmatch, against Paignton, ended in a disappointing\ndefeat by four wickets. The captain and captain-elect (Pete Davies and John Rambaut) conferred over\nthis perturbing result late into the evening. Next\nday John was still too upset to play against Torquay, while Pete felt compelled to delegate his\nduties to the vice-captain and field during the afternoon in the shadow of a friendly tree. Torquay\ndeclared at 168-8 and I.C., betrayed by their own\numpire, were 123-9 at the close. Pete emerged from\nthe shadow to score 57, and the inimitable Rowland\nReynolds played out time by scoring 8 off the last\nover, thus doubling his season's total.\nAnother more favourable draw followed against\nSrixham, and the team then moved to Exeter where\nUniversity College of the South West, after two\nyears of restoration and rebuilding, again provided\nus with rooms. From these a descent was made upon\nWhimple and Whlteway's G.C. whose orchard-flanked\nground boasts a large tree (two runs if you hit it) close to the wicket. A collapse from 37-1 to 72\nall out augured ill, but the consumption at tea of\na very great quantity of gooseberry tart restored\nsome long-departed fire to Peter Justesen's bowl-ing. On a helpful pitch, he took 6 wickets for 4\nruns in 26 balls and the game was worn by 21 runs,\ni he evening passed in an Inspection of the products\nof local industry.\nAt Tavistock on the next afternoon, \"Useless\"\nwas again in lively mood, and succeeded in felling\nthe opposing skipper with a sharply rising ball. Tavistock's total of 107 proved however a winning\none. Their hill-top ground, bounded by a circle of\nstanding stones, has a vague air of prehistory;\nand I.C., batting as if under some druidic spell,\ncould muster only 71.\nThe last game at Exeter was against University\nCollege. Sent into bat on a wet wicket, I.C. scored 84 (Rambaut, restored in spirits, making 34)\nand won by 21 runs. Useless took another 4 wickets\nand Reynolds 3.\nThen to Plymouth and Malcolm's restaurant,\nwhere the enormous mixed grills, especially if consumed with the local form of apple-juice, are well\ndesigned to revive flagging energy. Both matches\nhere were played on the excellent ground at Mount\nWise. In the first, against the United Services,\nPete Davies scored 102 in less than ninety minutes\nand the I.C. total reached 194. Brilliant batting\nby Commander Thackara (114 not out) rapidly brought\nthe United Services back into the picture, and they\neventually reached 198-2. The I.C. bowlers, led by\nthe undaunted Reynolds, never gave up, not even\nwhen the boundary fields men took to stopping each\nother instead of the ball. The Royal Marines began the final game by dismissing two I.C. batsmen practically instantaneous-ly. Unjustified expectations were thus aroused\namong local supporters, who could not know that\n\"Useless\" and Reynolds had been eccentrically promoted in the batting order. Derek Wyles and Chris.\nWilson added 123 for the next wicket, and the innings was declared closed at 156-4. The Marines,\nchecked by accurate bowling, had reached 138-6 at\nthe close of play.\nFurther gluttonous activity at Malcolm's occupied much of the last evening and was found to\nreduce greatly the capacity to absorb liquid re-freshmen t. Davies, in particular, was only equal\nto a pint and a half (No cracks by request).\nAll who went on it will agree that the tour\nwas a highly enjoyable cricket ing holiday, for\nwhich much thanks to the hospitable Devon cricket\nclubs who were our hosts during - and after - the\nmatches.\nHENLEY - 1950\nFrom Our Rowing Correspondent.\nHenley - What a vista the word conjures up to\nthe rowing man. That lovely course with the triangular field below the woods on the hills behind\nthe start. White flannels and .blazers; coaches on\nramshackle bicycles; the boat tents; \"Strawberry-nose\"; pretty girls in flowered dresses in the\nStewards' Enclosure; flowers and green lawns; the\nroses on Phyllis Court wall; punts and skiffs lining the booms; the \" Barrier Club\" on the Saturday before the Regatta. The scarlet of Lady Maggy,\nthe yellow of Clare, the striped trousers of First and Third, the hooped zephyrs of T.C.D. The \"An-gel\", the \"Red Lion\" and the \" Little White Hart\".\nThe railway station bedecked with flags and bunt ing. And, above all, to the I. C.B.C., that won-de rful place at Marsh Lock where the crew stays, under the motherly guidance of Mrs. Tebb - the Old\nHouse. For those who have never seen it, it is quite another world, where time, that horror of modern life, just does not matter. For those who\nhave ever been there a Mecca of Meocas indeed.\nAfter the ups and downs of the year, I.C. was\nrepresented by an eight in the Thames Cup and a four in the Wyfolda. Both crews rowed well esp ec i ally the eight which put up a far better performance than had at one time seemed possible. The\neight won their first heat against3.0. A. II., with out being unduly pressed. Their best row of the\nyear, however, was in the second round against a very good First and Third Trinity crew, in which\nthe latter, rowing extremely well, won by If lengths, the Fawley time being very fast for the prev ailing conditions. Although losing, the I.C. crew rowed really well and lifted the prestige of\nthe I. C.B.C. out of the doldrums into which it had\nfallen in recent years.\nThe four also rowed well, winning their first heat against Be relays Bank comfortably. In their next round, they had a very close race with London\nR.C. and were unfortunate enough to hit the booms\nat the beginning of the enclosures when they were\nleading and only thirty strokes short of the\nfinish.'* Several ex-I.' C.B.C. members were also active at Henley. Three members of the Thames R.C. eight\nin the final of the Thames Cup, one member of the\nThames \"Grand\" eight and two of their \"Stewards\"\nfour as well as last year's \"Ho. 6\", who was in the\nEmmanuel four in the final of the Visitors, had all represented I. C.at one time or another.\nCrews and results: THAMES CHALLEHG-jB, CUP.\nR.H. CLARK (bow\"); R.D. HUGHES; F. MORIARTY;\nJ. L. HAYCOCK; P.G. ALLISTON: D. NOVELL;\nCM. BAIHES; H. METCALFE ( stroke); C.3. BRACEWELL (cox).\nHeat 5 : Beat B.O.A.R. by If lengths, Fawley\ntime 3 mins. 29 sees, Finish time\n7 mins. 24 sees.\nHeat 21: Lost to 1 st&3 rd Trinity by If lengths, Fav/ley time 3 mins. 25 sees\nFinish time 7 mins. 30 sees.\n\u2022CTGLD CHALLENGE CUP.\nH.J.

    "content": "EVERY FORTNIGHT\nHo. 10. IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEDITORIAL\nFRESHMAN'S EONEYMppH.\nThis issue of FELIX, the first this term, is dedicated to the Freshmen. We hope that they may\nfind something of interest and enlightenment in its pages and we take this opportunity of we lot e& ng\nthem to Imperial College.\nWe all remember (don't we?\") our own first few\n\u2022bewildered days as Freshers: when we first gazed\nwith uncertain eyes at the strangeness of it all. We were confused, we lost our way, we talked to\nstrangers and accepted whatever came next, all rather meekly and naively. We went to free teas,\ndrank much beer, listened to speeches and sales\ntalk from professors and club captains. Come one\nand all. A few lectures would be starting in a day\nor two and although the idea of work had not yet\npenetrated the consciousness we might perhaps go\nalong, if only not to miss anything. Then the\"\nTrials - Ah.' the Trials I great days for ambitious\nsportsmen. So each day, full of new impressions,\nwe would wander back to our new digs and lie on our\nunbelievably hard bed whilst a kaleidoscope of pro-fess or s, notice boards, pints, secretaries, corridors, booklets, towers and minarets passed before\nour eyes. Life, in fact, oo ul d not be more plea-sant.\nBy the time you have read this, you will al ready have had a few days of this life and will be\nbeginning to get used to it all. And so it will continue a week or two. But gradually you find\nyourself drawn into lectures, the free dinners will trail off, the exhortations will diminish in intensity and, caught in the snares of lecture room and\nlaboratory, you will realise that the honeymoon is over.\nBut cheer up5 The daily round is quite lively. Things do happen here J You will find life pleasant\nenough if you play your part. Join a club, society\n- but not too many - and take an active interest in the affairs of your college. Read the article addressed to you by the President of your own college\nUnion. Finally, remember to do some work - even\nin this your first term - but don't become a brown-bag ger:a university is more than a vocational\ntraining centre. It is a seat of learning but also\nof living, where you will spend some of the happiest years of your life. FELIX.\nReaders will see that FELIX appears in new\ndress this year. Although now only four pages, the\nreduced size of type enables us to print the same\namount of subject matter as before. The method of\nprinting allows us much greater scope in the matter of layout and illustration than was possible in the 'Roneo-ed' FELIX of last year. The new presentation is by no means final and we welcome suggestions for its improvement.\nFinality is far off for other reasons - economic ones. With the costs of typing and printing we\nare working to a very o lose margin. We have resisted temptation to increase the price and this means\nthat, to remain financially healthy, FELIX must\nmaintain its circulation of a thousand - at least.\nTherefore, buy your own copy each fortnight or subscribe for the year (15 issues, subscription forms\nin I.C. Union and in Bar).\nOne further point. FELIX'S smiling countenance depends largely on your contributions. We\nwill accept, and print where possible and prudent,\nyour poems, humorous art iole s, news snippets and\nletters.

    "content": "FELIX3 PROFILE\u2014 IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nProfiles a drawl ns silhouette or other representation of a side view. How can one draw a silhouette or \"other representation\" of an institution which has no outline exe ep t in the architectural sense, and a personality so complex and\nintangible that even such die-hard students as. Mr.\nScott-Fleming (1936 and still going strong) would\nfind it difficult to analyse. In search of inspiration, we consulted the Oxford Dictionary and\nfound amon st other meanings \"a shallow vat in\nwhich beer is left to clear\"; Interesting, but\nseldom applicable to our Union.\nThe Freshman for his first few weeks has the\nphysical layout and component clubs of the Union\nquickly drummed into him. He soon discovers that\nthe main building housing the bar is usually called the Union, that the new building opposite is called the Belt building and includes the New Host el, New Lounge, Bookstall and Administrative of-f ices, and that the Old Hostel is tucked away in a corner and seems Impossibly small to house about\n50 raving maniacs. On his first day, it is energetically brought to his notice that the Union\nAthletic clubs include almost every form of student sport (the remaining forms being facilitated\nby the social clubs) and that the Union sports\nground is near the Red Lion at Harlington. Thsy\nlearn that the organisation of the Union as a whole is run by a student Council, that Mr. Coomber (R.C.S.) is President and Mr. Nicholas (R.C.S) the Secretary; that 'Me Union office is next to\nthe Bookstall; and that the affairs of Council\nare second favourite to the Refectory Committee\nwhen the Editor of Felix is feeling vitriolic. Thus, the outline of the Union is quite\nquickly and easily distinguished. What of the\nfiner lines and shading that give the outline\ncharacter? These can only be filled in by time.\nAt one moment the Union is quiet, comfortable and\nalmost a normal gentlemen's club - with a few\nladies tolerated (except in the bar) for their\ncharm and their civilizing influence on the wilder elements; at the next it will be transformed\ninto a den of howling dervishes Intent on divesting some unfortunate of his trousers. On Saturday nights it becomes a sort of nightmare palais\nde danse, with girls from far and wide in their\nbest dresses and the College in its usual old\ncorduroys and blazer, too many people dancing and\ntoo many in the bar drinking too much beer* -in fact everyone thoroughly enjoying themselves.\nThroughout the year there is a succession of dinners and dances, ranging from white ties and prepared speeches to the mat-throwing chaos of certain club dinners. Carnival nights have to be\nseen to be believed - they defy sober description.\nThus the picture is slowly filled in. The\nUnion forms the student life, and the students'\nlives form the Union, Its history has never been\nwritten, but is hidden in ancient archives and\npeoples' memories. It almost atrophied during\nthe war, and its rapid recovery since then has\nbeen due to a succession of energetic Presidents\nand a Rector who has the welfare of the College\nvery much at heart. Plans are now afoot for extensions and modifications to the buildings, and\nif the recent increase in interest in Union activities continues It should ensure that, although\nwe are a technical college, we can yet enjoy a full life.( A meaningless phrase - Ed.)\nAhi.2.3.4.
