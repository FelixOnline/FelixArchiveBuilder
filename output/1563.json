    "content": "22 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe\nGovernment\nInspector\nD\nramSoc\u2019s winter play this year is Nikolai\nGogol\u2019s satirical comedy The Government\nInspector. Banned by the tsarist government\nof Imperial Russia on its \ufb01rst publication,\nthe play makes a mockery of the stupidity,\ngreed and corruption of the o\ufb03cials of a small provincial\ntown.\nThe director, Simon Parker, has done a fantastic job\nof staging the play in an engaging, thought provoking\nand somewhat surreal way. There are many points in\nthe play which will intentionally bemuse the audience,\none of which is the rather original freeze-frame used to\nconclude the show. Many of his personal touches can\nbe witnessed throughout, including the niche music\nthat accompanies the play, and a strange old man with a\nlong beard who sits and watches as Khlestakov (Nicolas\nPimpar\u00e9) proposes to Marya (Svetlana Guggenbuehl).\nAmongst the newcomers to DramSoc are Helen Root\nas Anna Andreyevna and Svetlana Guggenbuehl as\nMarya Antonovna. Helen gives a pristine performance\nas a morally grounded older woman who competes with\nher daughter, Marya, for the a\ufb00ections of Khlestakov.\nSvetlana is a pleasure to watch as a \ufb02aunting, beautiful\nand eloquent young woman who is continually shunned\nby her mother, but whose persistence pays o\ufb00 as she\nwins over Khlestakov\u2019s heart.\nKhlestakov (the \u2018inspector\u2019) is played by Nicolas\nPimpar\u00e9, whose outrageous \ufb02amboyance and\neccentricity suits the role perfectly. So good is his\nperformance that his speech, during which Khlestakov\nutters outlandish lies about his supposed life as a high\nranking o\ufb03cial, will trick the audience into thinking\nthey are in the Apollo theatre.\nTiberiu Chis (Tib) plays the highly stressed Mayor,\nwhosee\ufb00ortstocontrolthechaosthatensuesthroughout\nthe town are hilariously futile. Tib\u2019s character perfectly\nblends an air of authority with that of hopelessness\nand complete impatience, and he manages to keep the\ncharacter funny and relatable whilst hinting from time\nto time at a darker, more tyrannical man.\nThe townspeople provide laughter throughout in\neach of their own dysfunctional ways. Dobchinsky\nand Bobchinsky (Jack Williams and Joseph Hosier),\nultimately the cause behind the chaos which engulfs the\ntown, pile laugh upon laugh as their complete naivety\nand stupidity are embodied in ridiculous one-liners\nand episodes of physical humour; the sheer nonsense\no\ufb00ered by their characters is something all lovers of\nsilly jokes will appreciate. Zemlianika (Max Falkenberg\nMcGillivray), the Judge (Joseph Dudley), Luka (Paul\nCosma) and the Postmaster (Prashant Mahendran) as\nthe corrupt o\ufb03cials complement each other\u2019s characters\nvery well, and all try to impress Khlestakov in their\nuniquely fruitless fashion.\nThe costumes are spectacular and the props and set\nalso convey the mood and setting of Imperial Russia\nvery well. The crew, especially the costume designers,\nhave performed a stellar job in that department. The\nshow is a very entertaining one, and I urge you to go\nand watch it on the two remaining nights!\nThe Government Inspector is being performed this Friday\n6th and Saturday 7th December in the Union Concert\nHall in Beit Quad. Tickets can be bought from the union\nwebsite and are \u00a35 for students, \u00a37 for non-students, \u00a31\nextra on the door.\nJack Williams\nDramSoc Social Secretary\nWho is Paul Smith?\nT\nhe title of the Design\nMuseum\u2019s latest exhibition,\n\u2018Hello My Name Is Paul\nSmith\u2019, feels slightly\nredundant. Over the last\n40-odd years, Paul Smith has become\none of the most recognisable men in\nthe British fashion industry, heading\na brand of global renown, and\nproducing a vast range of products, all\nemblazoned with his own signature.\nSurely he is a man who needs no\nintroduction?\nBut the museum promises to give\nmore than a cursory overview of\nthe man and his designs. Instead it\nproclaims to \u2018o\ufb00er a unique insight\ninto the magni\ufb01cent mind of Paul\nSmith\u2019. So does the exhibition manage\nto get under his skin, stripping away\nthe tailoring and stripe patterns,\ngiving us a peek at what makes the\nman tick?\nUnfortunately not. Instead, all they\nmanage to o\ufb00er is a shallow glimpse\nat one of the most famous menswear\nbrands on the planet, in a show that\nseems to add up to little more than\nshameless advertising.\nBeginning with a mock-up of his \ufb01rst\n\u2018shop\u2019 \u2013 in reality a boxy, windowless\nroom in Nottingham \u2013 the exhibition\nmoves through various stages in both\nhis life and his design process, until\nwe end at the \ufb01nished product. Born\njust outside Nottingham in 1946,\nSmith showed more interest in cycling\nthan fashion for most of his youth,\nbut underwent a change of heart as\na teenager working in his father\u2019s\nclothing warehouse. After taking\nclasses in tailoring, and a brief stint in\nSavile Row, he set up his \ufb01rst shop in\nWhat: Hello My Name is Paul Smith\nWhere: Design Museum, SE1\nWhen: 15th Nov - 9th Mar 2014\nPrice: \u00a37.50 students, \u00a311.85 adults\n(including donation)\n1970, and showed his \ufb01rst collection\nin Paris in 1976. The exhibition\nfeatures a recreation of this \ufb01rst \u2018show\u2019,\nin which Smith laid out his collection\nof around 10 pieces on the bed of his\nfriend\u2019s apartment, highlighting how\nhard Smith worked to set up his \ufb01rst\nshop in London in 1979.\nIn a post-internet world, where\ndesigners are often plucked out by\nbenefactors such as Lulu Kennedy\nbefore they have even \ufb01nished their\ngraduate collections, it\u2019s interesting\nto see how designers used to get\nthemselves noticed. In Smith\u2019s case,\nit was his knack for combining\ntraditional tailoring with a uniquely\nwitty edge; boring jackets reveal \ufb02orid\nlinings, traditional shirts are spiced up\nwith garish prints, in what I suppose\nwould now be called \u2013 somewhat\nnauseatingly \u2013 \u2018eccentrically British\u2019.\nThis, along with his charming\npersonality helped spread his brand\nacross the world, most notably in\nJapan, which now has over ten times\nthe number of Paul Smith stores than\nthe UK. Now approaching 70, and still\nactive, it is di\ufb03cult to see Smith as\nanything other than the grandmaster\nof British menswear.\nHowever, while \u2018Paul Smith\u2019 itself is\na personal brand, the exhibition does\na very poor job in getting across any of\nSmith\u2019s personality, instead presenting\nhim as a sort of sterile amalgamation\nof in\ufb02uences, a faceless face behind\nthe label, a Betty Crocker of the\nfashion world.\nWe explore a recreation of his o\ufb03ce,\nwhich resembles a kooky antique store\n- co\ufb00ee table books \ufb01ght for space with\ntoy robots and cycling paraphernalia,\nwhile papers \ufb01ll up every available inch\nof desk space. While I am sure that this\nidiosyncratic range of interests has\ngreatly contributed to Smith\u2019s success,\nthis magpie approach to design and\nretail has been co-opted by high\nstreet giants like Urban Out\ufb01tters or\nTopshop, making what might have\nonce been a unique attribute seem like\na cynical marketing ploy.\nSimilarly, the recreation of his HQ,\nwhere he and his team cook up their\ncollections, seems like little more\nthan an intern\u2019s idea of what a \u2018trendy,\nLondon design \ufb01rm\u2019 would look like:\nApple computers gleam on white\ncountertops cluttered with fabric\nsamples and copies of Fantastic Man,\nwhile various fashion sketches are\npinned up around the room. It is as\nfar from a \u2018unique insight\u2019 into Smith\u2019s\ndesign process as possible.\nThe only interesting tid-bit of\ninformation we are given is that they\nwindstringaroundcardboardtocreate\ntheir iconic stripe patterns. But other\nthan that, there is little to make Smith\nstand out from his contemporaries.\nWhile other designers, such as the late\nAlexander McQueen or the doyenne\nof Italian fashion Miuccia Prada,\nmanage to make their collections\nseem like an exciting continuation of\ntheir personal vision, Smith seems\nsomewhat removed from the entire\nprocess \u2013 a \ufb01gurehead of a brand that\nhas its own separate identity.\nThe exhibition culminates with a\ncorridor of Paul Smith designs from\na number of previous collections. It\nis worth pointing out that this is the\n\ufb01rst time we are exposed to any actual\nclothes from his collections, and the\nresult is somewhat lacking.\nA victim of his own success, Smith\u2019s\nclothing, when presented as a solid\nblock, appears quite dull and banal.\nHis formula of British tailoring with\na twist has served him well, but after\nnearly 40 years in the industry, it is\nbeginning to wear somewhat thin;\nthere are only so many times you can\nchurn out a \ufb02oral shirt, no matter how\nwell designed. What was once exciting\nand new now seems almost staid.\nIt is therefore something of a pity\nthat Smith has come to represent the\npinnacle of British menswear, when\nthere are so many young, unique\ndesigners ready to take up his mantle.\nNew talents such as Craig Green\nand Nasir Mazhar are producing\nextremely daring garments, adding a\nshot of danger and intrigue into the\nnear-catatonic world of menswear,\nbut are obscured by the long shadow\ncast by those like Paul Smith.\nAll in all, it would be churlish not\nto recognise the service that Paul\nSmith has done for the British fashion\nindustry; by spreading his clothing\nall over the world, Smith has ensured\nthat UK menswear continues to be\nrelevant in today\u2019s globalised fashion\nworld. However, I felt let down by\nthe exhibition. Rather than giving me\nan \u2018insight\u2019 into Paul Smith\u2019s mind,\nit left me frustrated that none of my\nquestions about the man and his\nworking practice has been answered.\nThe exhibition feels less like an\nexploration into one of the most\nfamous men in fashion, and more like\na cheap exercise in self-promotion \u2013\nsomething of which Paul Smith has\nlittle need.\nANTHONY CROLLA\nFred Fyles\nWriter\n\u201cThe recreation\nof his HQ seems\nlike little more\nthan an intern\u02bcs\nidea of what a\n\u02bbtrendy, London\ndesign \ufb01rm\u02bc\nwould look like\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s all in our head\nPhilippa Skett on how our minds are already made up when it comes to sex\nINGALHALIKAR, M. PNAS, DECEMBER 2, 2013\nN\new research has\nshown that the brains\nof females and males\nhave di\ufb00erent patterns\nof connectivity,\npossibly alluding as to why men\nmay not behave the same as women.\nIn this impressively large study\npublished by PNAS, 949 people had\nthe connections of their neuronal\nclusters mapped, and results indicated\nsigni\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the\nwiring of the minds between the two\ngenders.\nSo what were the connectivity\ndi\ufb00erences? Males often had stronger\nconnectivity pro\ufb01les within the\nseparate hemispheres compared to\nfemales, although females were found\nto have signi\ufb01cantly more inter-hemispheric connectivity across the\nwhole brain. This means that although\nmales have greater connectivity\nbetween the front and the back of\nthe two sides of the brain, both of\nthe two hemispheres in females are\nmore intricately connected from left\nto right.\nThe study, carried out by\nPennsylvania University, was led\nby Dr Ragini Verma, an associate\nprofessor in the department of\nRadiology. Verma thinks there is\na link between these results and\ndi\ufb00erences in behaviour between the\ngenders: \u201cThese maps show us a stark\ndi\ufb00erence \u2013 and complementarity \u2013\nin the architecture of the human brain\nthat helps provide a potential neural\nbasis as to why men excel at certain\ntasks, and women at others.\u201d\nIn behavioural experiments also run\nby Pennsylvania University, females\noutperformed males when it came\nto testing attention spans, memory\nretention and facial recognition,\nwhilst males were better at spatial\nprocessing and had quicker reaction\ntimes. Meanwhile, males generally\nperformed better when only working\non one task, whereas females could\nprocess several at one time and were\nalso found to have superior social\ncognition skills.\nSuch results could be seen as\nindicative that the connectivity\npatterns Verma has identi\ufb01ed relate\nto these di\ufb00erences in behaviour,\nalthough little was mentioned in the\npaper about neurological plasticity\nas a result of external environmental\nin\ufb02uences. Could it be that a gender-biased lifestyle is shaping such\nconnectivity instead?\nWhen looking at age, the contrast\nbetween male and female connectivity\nincreased as the subjects got older.\nSubjects of both genders below the\nage of 13 were found to have very\nsimilar connectivity pro\ufb01les, whilst\ndi\ufb00erences were most prominent in\nthose that were 17 or older. This may\nindicate that puberty could play a part\nin shaping the dimorphism of adult\nhuman brains, almost as much as it\nin\ufb02uences physical gender-orientated\ndevelopment too, although more\nresearch is needed.\nTracking the connectivity patterns\nwas done using di\ufb00usion tensor\nimaging, an\nMRI technique\nthat maps the\nmovement of\nwater particles\nm o v i n g\nthroughout the\nbrain. Being able\nto see where water\nmoves can allow\ntracing of the\nunderlying \ufb01bres\nof the brain that\nare directing the\nwater movement.\nSuch \ufb01bres\nare composed\nof large bundles\nof hundreds of\naxons of neurons,\nand show which\nregions of the\nbrain connect\nto and in\ufb02uence\nothers.\nModelling the\nentire pro\ufb01le of all\nthe connections\nwithin the brain\nat a cellular level\nis still yet to be\ncompletely done,\nbut would be the\nultimate endeavour in brain mapping.\nThe Human Connectome Project,\nlaunched back in 2010, is aiming to\ndo this, although estimations of its\ncompletion in 2015 have been met\nwith varying levels of scepticism.\nStudies into the connectivity of the\nbrain are no longer novel, but are still\nproviding increasingly interesting\nresults. Although this study looks at\nneural bundles, being able to study the\nbrain at an even greater resolution is\nnext in the neuroscience agenda. Not\nonly that, but coupled with further\nresearch in behaviour and neural\ndevelopment and better imaging\ntechniques, we may one day be able\nto pinpoint exactly what in our minds\nmake us who we are.\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.1316909110\nConnection patterns of the \ufb01bres within the brain.

The\nanswer: probably not,\nbut ambient noise could\nincrease the e\ufb03ciency of solar cells,\nresearchers at Imperial College and\nQueen Mary University of London\nhave found.\nProfessor James Durrant of\nImperial\u2019s Department of Chemistry\nspoke to Felix to explain the \ufb01ndings.\n\u201cMyself and Steve Dunn from\nQueen Mary have been looking at\npiezoelectric e\ufb00ects, which are when\nmechanical strain gives an electric\ncurrent \u2013 electric lighters are the\nexample Steve always gives. There is\nevidence that these e\ufb00ects are helping\nin the \ufb01eld of photocatalysis, where\nsunlight is used to degrade pollutants.\nWe were interested in whether this\nsort of approach might be applicable\nto solar cells, and whether sound\nmight be able to induce this e\ufb00ect.\u201d\nSound produces a strain which\ncould induce a current in piezoelectric\nmaterials; however, due to the random\norientation of sound waves and the\nfact that the high and low pressure\ne\ufb00ects could cancel each other out, the\nImperial team were initially doubtful\nthat it would signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ect power\noutput or e\ufb03ciency. \u201cSteve thought it\nwould work,\u201d said Professor Durrant,\n\u201cbut I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nTo investigate the e\ufb00ect, they\nmanufactured small solar cells\ncontaining zinc oxide nanorods,\nwhich are a piezoelectric material, and\nmeasured their response to di\ufb00erent\nlevels and frequencies of sound. They\nfound that sound as low as 75dB, such\nas conversation or roadside noise,\nincreased the e\ufb03ciency of the cells,\nand that the best response was to\nsound at around 10kHz.\nAs music is usually played in\nProfessor Durrant\u2019s lab, the team also\nlooked at the response of the cells to\ndi\ufb00erent kinds of music.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very scienti\ufb01c,\u201d he admits,\n\u201cas it\u2019s hard to quantify the sound\nas the amplitudes and frequencies\nchange.\nStill, we found that the response to\nAdele was better than to Beethoven or\ntraditional Persian music.\nAt \ufb01rst we didn\u2019t know why that was,\nbut then found that electronically-synthesised music has more high-frequency sounds than classical.\u201d\nThough common silicon cells do\nnot contain piezoelectric materials,\nthey can easily be manufactured into\nnewly-developed printed and polymer\nsolar cells.\nDr Steve Dunn said, \u201cafter\ninvestigating systems for converting\nvibrations into electricity, this is a\nreally exciting development that shows\na similar set of physical properties can\nalso enhance the performance of a\nphotovoltaic solar cell.\u201d\nNext, the researchers will be looking\nto understand the mechanistic\nreasons behind the e\ufb00ect, and how it\nscales with di\ufb00erent sound intensities.\nAdele\u02bcs fan base at her sold out concert\nWWW.ASSETS.INHABITAT.COM\n\n"

    "content": "20 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe invention of vibrators...\nWorld class opera in our backyard\nO\nur prestigious\nneighbour, the Royal\nCollege of Music,\nis a fortress tucked\naway behind our\nown Sher\ufb01eld building. Until now its\nactivities had been hidden from me;\nbut I am so glad that that has \ufb01nally\nchanged.\nThis week I attended the premiere\nof a Ravel double bill opera, produced\nand performed by the Royal College\nof Music (RCM) International Opera\nSchool. Given the relatively low ticket\nprices and the proximity to campus \u2013\nit\u2019s basically on campus \u2013 there\u2019s not\nmuch of an excuse not to go, and if the\nworld of opera has yet to open itself to\nyou, then this is an ideal introduction.\nI must admit I wasn\u2019t entirely\nsure what to expect. Yes, this is the\nfamous RCM, but surely I shouldn\u2019t\nanticipate all too much from a student\nproduction? But to put it in those\nterms is misleading; these aren\u2019t simply\nstudents, but the next generation of\nstars, some of whom I suspect may\none day grace the stage in Covent\nGarden. To put it simply, the vocal\nperformances were of the highest\nquality, and in such a small theatre\nthese young voices carried magically.\nThe orchestra, too were fantastic, with\nthe \ufb01nesse and virtuosity of the best\nprofessional ensembles.\nThe \ufb01rst opera performed was\nL\u2019Heure Espagnole (the Spanish Hour),\na raucous, witty and sexy a\ufb00air about\na rather \u2018hungry\u2019 housewife juggling\nher three suitors while her husband\nis out. Ravel\u2019s sensuous scoring gives\neach character a colourful and distinct\npersonality, yet isn\u2019t afraid to descend\nto humourous sound e\ufb00ects when\nslapstick is called for. The production\nwas genuinely funny and beautifully\ntransparent in its approach. Only\nthe \ufb01nal quintet was clumsy, and the\nchoreography a little confused. The cast\nmanaged to portray their obnoxious\nand self-absorbed characters without\nbecoming caricatures, which is no\nmean feat \u2013 even if some of the greater\nsubtleties of comic acting weren\u2019t fully\nthere.\nWe were then witness to Ravel\u2019s\n\u2018other\u2019 opera, L\u2019Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges\n(the Child and the Spells), also in one\nact. This magical fairy tale involves\nfurniture coming alive and talking\nanimals teaching an insolent boy his\nEmiel De Lange\nWriter\nWhat: Ravel Double Bill \u2013 L\u2019heure\nEspagnole & L\u2019enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges\nWhere: Royal College of Music,\nBritten Theatre, SW6\nWhen: 6th and 7th Dec, 7.30pm\nPrice: \u00a310, \u00a320, \u00a330, \u00a340\nROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC\nlesson. In my view these technical\nchallenges were handled less\nsuccessfully than in L\u2019Heure, although\nfor a group with such limited resources\nthey were inventive and impressively\ncarried out.\nMy companion was more convinced,\nthough we were both left a little\nconfused at some of the directorial\nchoices, such as \u2018trees\u2019 being\nrepresented by cogs on chains. Apart\nfrom this, the performance was equally\nstrong as L\u2019Heure, and showcased\nsome fantastic action for the chorus.\nThe end result was a beautifully lit and\ntouching portrayal of the boy wanting\nhis \u2018maman\u2019.\nOpera is after all a kind of \u2018total\u2019\nart form, a gesamtkunst (to borrow a\nterm from Richard Wagner), and this\nis clearly a concept understood by\nthe creative team. The stagecraft was\nimpressive for such a small platform,\ncomplete with multi-layered sets and\nmoving staircases, and some theatrical\nillusions were pulled o\ufb00 brilliantly. The\nlightingwascreativeandatmospheric\u2013\nalthough a little limited as occasionally\nsingers were left in the dark.\nAll of this gave an impression of\nprofessionalism, and, when combined\nwith the enthusiastic and skilful\nmusical performance, an enthralling\nand engaging spectacle resulted. I\ncouldn\u2019t think of a better way to spend\na few evening hours away from the\nlibrary.\nWhat: In The Next Room, or, The\nVibrator Play\nWhere: St James Theatre, SW1\nWhen: 13th Nov \u2013 4th Jan 2014\nPrice: \u00a315 to \u00a350\nW\nhat\u2019s in a name?\nProbably some\nerotica, as the\nname is \u201cThe\nVibrator Play\u201d\n.\nUnquestionably the play lives up to its\nname, with a certain amount of overt\nsexual content. But In the Next Room\nor The Vibrator Play is also much,\nmuch more than a bawdy comedy or\ntheatrical pornography. American\nplaywright Sarah Ruhl has created a\npiece that deals with the most intimate\nof human relationships: husband and\nwife, doctor and patient, woman and\ncon\ufb01dante, mother and child, man and\nwoman.\nThe starting point of the drama is\nthe 19th century practice of treating\nwomen with hysteria with a \u2018pelvic\nmassage\u2019\n, a tiring and time-consuming\nmedical massage (known to you and\nme as masturbation), which resulted\nin a \u2018hysterical paroxysm\u2019 (that\u2019s an\norgasm), thus relieving the patient\u2019s\nsymptoms. In case you\u2019re wondering,\nthis treatment is no longer available on\nthe NHS.\nTowards the end of the 19th century,\nwhen this play is based, electrically\npowered instruments were developed\nto help achieve this paroxysm in less\ntime \u2013 and yes, I\u2019m talking about the\ninvention of the vibrator.\nRuhlusesthisratheramusingpremise\nto kick start her piece; Dr. Givings is a\nrenowned New York doctor who treats\npatients for hysteria, helped by his no-nonsense nurse Annie. Meanwhile,\nas the patients come and go, his wife\nCatherine sits downstairs fretting\nabout her baby, who she cannot feed\nsu\ufb03ciently for lack of breast milk.\nThe next room, the doctor\u2019s\nexamination room, is the real keystone\nof this performance. Not only is the\nstage brilliantly set up in a two tiers,\nso that the public can follow the action\nin both rooms at the same time, but\nthe physical space represents the\nemotional content that the play is\ncentered around. The concept of a next\nroom highlights the female condition\nin a male-dominated society, in which\nthe action happens in another room,\nabove the heads of the women, who are\nleft waiting outside closed doors. The\nnext room is what Dr. Givings closes\nhimself into to escape from his marital\ntensions, where he devotes time to his\nfemale patients while his unhappy wife\nwaits outside, lonely.\nThe other characters weave in and\nout of this wife-husband relationship,\nwith a progressively chirpier Mrs.\nDaldry coming in for regular treatment\nwith her overbearing husband, the self-centered, heartbroken, English artist\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\ncoming in to be treated for \u201ca rare case\nof male hysteria\u201d, and the black wet\nnurse Elizabeth, who visits regularly\nto compensate for Catherine\u2019s lack\nof milk. These characters intertwine,\ncreatingacomplexwebofinterpersonal\nrelationships, by turns comic, touching\nand shocking.\nThe two female leads, Catherine\n(Natalie Casey) and Mrs. Daldry (Flora\nMontgomery) are truly captivating\ncharacters from the very \ufb01rst scene,\ndrawing the audience into the chaotic\nGivings household and making up for\nthe sometimes shakier performance of\nthe other cast members. The second\nact picks up considerably, with the\nwhole cast showing a remarkable talent\nand turning the piece into a far more\nvivid, real performance than what the\n\ufb01rst act achieved. As the curtains close\non a romantic, snowy embrace you\nmight even \ufb01nd yourself shedding a\ntear or two.\nIn The Next Room encompasses\ncomedy, emotion, sex, scienti\ufb01c\ninnovation, race, history, gender\nrelations and mental health issues.

But\ninstead of asking \u201ccan it be done?\u201d the\nconversation is changing to \u201cshould it\nbe done?\u201d\nThe possibility of bringing\nspecies back from the grave \u2013 a\nprocess known as de-extinction\n\u2013 was widely popularised by\nMichael Crichton\u2019s 1990 book, and\nSpielberg\u2019s 1993 \ufb01lm, Jurassic Park.\nInspired by the advent of genetic\nengineering, Crichton\u2019s tale gained\ncult-status, but just as Aldous Huxley\u2019s\nvision of arti\ufb01cial reproduction was\nbrought closer with the advance\nof IVF technology, so the process\nof de-extinction has moved from\nsci-\ufb01 concept to real life science.\nIn2003,ateamofFrenchandSpanish\nscientists achieved the impossible\ntask of bringing a species back from\nthe dead, although only temporarily.\nThe Pyrenean Ibex was a large,\nmountain-dwelling member of\nthe goat genus Capra that went\nextinct due to grazing pressure\nfrom domestic and wild ungulates\nin 2000. When the last Pyrenean\nIbex died, its cells were preserved\nand, later, a nucleus from these cells\nwas injected into a denucleated\ndomestic goat egg, which was then\nimplanted into a surrogate mother.\nIn 2003, a clone was born. For\nthe \ufb01rst time ever an animal had\nbeen brought back from extinction.\nSadly, the baby ibex died shortly\nafter birth due to lung defects. Rather\nthan rejuvenating the Pyrenean\nIbex, it served only to provide\nan unfortunate demonstration\nof the obstacles that remain in\nreproductive cloning technology.\nNot only that, but of the 439\neggs used, only 57 developed into\nembryos, only four made it to full\nterm, and only one survived to birth\n\u2013 a pretty poor survival percentage.\nDespite these problems, this\nbreakthrough gave hope to the\nemerging de-extinction movement\nand, propelled by a combination\nof curiosity and conservation,\nmany more de-extinction\nattempts are on the horizon.\nThe Tasmanian tiger and the\npassenger pigeon are just two of\nthe candidates being vetted for\nresurrection. Furthermore, in March\n2013, a team from the University\nof New South Wales announced\nthat they were attempting to\nbring back the gastric brooding\nfrog \u2013 a bizarre creature that\nused its stomach as a womb.\nThe birth of the ibex has also\nfuelled more ambitious and\ncontroversial ideas. For instance,\ncould such technology be applied\nto ancient, long-dead species?\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem\nlike dinosaurs will be brought back\nany time soon as DNA decays with\ntime, and cloning technologies\nrequire pristine DNA for success.\nWithin hours of death, cells start\nthe process of apoptosis, which\nreleases enzymes that shatter\nDNA into an indecipherable mess.\nAs it ages, DNA also undergoes\nchemical changes that alter the\nnucleotides \u2013 the base guanine\nchanges into adenine, and\ncytosine changes to thymine.\nSo much time has passed that it\u2019s\ninconceivable the full genome of\ndinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus\nRex, which died out around 65\nmillion years ago, would have\nsurvived to the present day.\nCould a woolly mammoth be a\nmore realistic goal? Disappearing\nbetter use by boosting the populations\nof currently endangered species.\nIn anticipation of this, San Diego\nZoo has created the \u2018Frozen Zoo\u2019\nproject, a biobank storing tissue\nfrom over 1,000 extant species.\nIn a similar vein to the Millennium\nSeed Bank Project, it is hoped\nthat the Frozen Zoo can help the\nsurvival of critically endangered\nspecies as well as providing a kind of\ninsurance policy against extinction.\nWWW.COLLIDER.COM\nWILDLIFE-BLOGSPOT.COM\nLike it or not, de-extinction\ntechnology does have a future. When\nscience is this exciting we just can\u2019t\nhelp being curious. After all, who\nwouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to see a\nreal life woolly mammoth? Whether\nor not it leads to the all-action\nsci-\ufb01 ending remains to be seen.\nFind this article, alongside many more\non the theme of life and death in I,\nScience this week!\nbetween 6,000-10,000 years ago,\nwell-preserved mammoths are\nroutinely dug out of the Siberian\ntundra and scientists have been able\nto collect enough DNA fragments\nto piece the genome back together.\nSadly, cloning requires much\nmore than a reconstructed genome.\nArti\ufb01cially assembling DNA can be\ndone easily with current technology,\nbut free-\ufb02oating DNA is of little use to\na cell. The real challenge is packaging\nthe DNA into chromosomes and\ninserting this into a nucleus. The\nshape of the DNA a\ufb00ects how it\ninteracts with chemicals in the\ncell, and these interactions control\ngene expression, a factor every bit\nas important as the DNA itself.\nFinding a living mammoth cell\nwould sidestep such di\ufb03culties, and\na Japanese-Russian collaboration is\ncurrently leading the hunt for such a\ncell. The team plan to use a technique\npioneered for cloning mammals\nfrom frozen tissue, which was\nsuccessfully implemented on a mouse\nthat had been frozen for 16 years.\nThe idea is for an elephant to then be\nused as an egg donor and surrogate to\ngrow the properly packaged DNA. If a\ngood soft-tissue sample is found, the\nresearchers say a woolly mammoth\ncould be born in a matter of years.\nEven so, there is a great di\ufb00erence\nbetween bringing back an individual\nand bringing back a viable population.\nDe-extinction would at best produce\na handful of individuals that may or\nmay not reproduce. And how can\nwe engineer the mammoth\u2019s social\nstructureandbehaviouraladaptations?\nDespite these challenges,\nambitious plans have already\nbeen made for a Pleistocene\nPark in North-Eastern Siberia.\nIn a similar spirit to the Jurassic\nPark of literary \ufb01ction, the dream is\nto restore the tundra to the mammoth\nsteppe, a vast grassland habitat.\nBison and reindeer have already been\nreintroduced, but the arrival of the\nmammoth may take a little longer.\nUnsurprisingly, de-extinction is\nhighly controversial. The implications\nof such initiatives are hard to predict,\nand there are questions regarding\nthe well-being of the clones.\nRecent sequencing of Neanderthal\nDNA has made cloning the homo\nspecies theoretically possible, bringing\nus into unfamiliar ethical territory.\nEven e\ufb00orts to resurrect recently\nextinct animals are divisive.\nWhile advocates say that we have\na moral responsibility to bring\nback the creatures we drove to\nextinction, critics argue that such\nstrategies hinder e\ufb00orts to save the\nhabitats and species that remain.\nPerhaps resources would be put to\nJeff Goldblum struggles to come to terms with de-extinction\nWolly mammoths...possibly coming to a zoo near you\n\n"

We won the toss and elected to bowl \ufb01rst, and our opening\nbowlers, Zain Rizvi and Vignesh\n(Viggy) Venkateswaran took early\nwickets, with Zain \ufb01nishing with\n\ufb01gures of 3 overs, 3 wickets for 9\nruns, accompanied by some \ufb01ne\nbowling by Matthew Knights who\npicked up 2 wickets o\ufb00 his 3 overs.\nDue to the impressive bowling effort by Imperial, UCL could only\nmuster a mere 78 runs in their 10\novers. Imperial began their run\nchase perfectly, with Vishal Nair\nretiring not out on 27, and Juhin\nPatel (22*) and Viggy (10*) seeing\nImperial through to a solid win\nwithout the loss of any wickets.\nThe second \ufb01xture of the morning was against Brunel University.\nThis time, Imperial lost the toss\nand Brunel elected to bat \ufb01rst. Following the success in the \ufb01rst game,\nImperial made breakthroughs\ncourtesy of Viggy and Zain, with\nJayanth Ganapathy bowling superbly at the death, picking up 2\nwickets as well as keeping the runs\ndown. Brunel crawled their way to\n67 all out before Imperial launched\ntheir run chase.\nVishal played with class on his\nway to 26 not out, accompanied by\na mature knock from Viggy (25*)\nand some late hitting by Jayanth, to\nsee Imperial home by 5 wickets.\nTour Match\ndoesn\u2019t offer\nmany clues for\nEngland\nKunal Wagle\nSports Editor\nAfter a traumatic \ufb01rst Test in the series for England, in which they lost by\na large margin, as well as seeing Jonathan Trott return home for a stress-related illness, it was important that\nthe team used their tour match against\nthe Cricket Australia Chairman\u2019s XI\ne\ufb00ectively. What happened instead\nwas unlikely to instil much con\ufb01dence\nin an already faltering batting line-up,\nwho struggled to 212-7 on day one. In\naddition to this, England\u2019s pace bowlers were only able to take one wicket\nbetween them.\nBut it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom for\nEngland \u2013 Tim Bresnan has been\nadded to the Ashes Squad, having\ncome back playing strongly for the\nPerformance Squad. Gary Ballance is\nalso looking solid whilst playing in the\nTour Match in Alice Springs \u2013 he was\nthe only player to pass \ufb01fty for England in the \ufb01rst innings.\nEarly indications suggest that it will\nbe Ballance who wins the race to replace Trott, ahead of Jonny Bairstow\n(who showed signs of weakness\nagainst the short ball in the sum-mer), and the all-rounder Ben Stokes.\nBresnan is also likely to be selected,\nthis time ahead of Chris Tremlett, who\nseemed lacklustre in the \ufb01rst match.\nThe selection of Bresnan will also have\nthe added advantage of giving England\nmore batting depth.\nGraham Gooch, England\u2019s batting\ncoach, has dropped the biggest hint\nyet that it will be Joe Root who bats\nin Jonathan Trott\u2019s position at three.\nHow successful this venture will be\nremains to be seen. When he has\nopened for England, Root has seemed\nto struggle, suggesting he might be\nvulnerable if England were to lose\ntheir \ufb01rst wicket early.\nAdelaide presents a huge opportunity for England to get back into the\nseries. The last time they played here\nthey trounced the Australians, with\nGraeme Swann picking up a \ufb01ve-wicket-haul. The Australians have opened\nthe door to the Ashes \u2013 England have\nto make sure that it shuts again this\nweek.\nThe Ashes Column\nZain Rizvi\nIC Indoor Cricket Player\nIC score\nwalk-off\nwin\nOxford started brightly, scoring\ntwo runs in the \ufb01rst innings due\nto some sloppy \ufb01elding in the Imperial out\ufb01eld. After the \ufb01rst two\nbatters struck out, the innings\nstarted to look up as Zack Wang\nhit a single into centre \ufb01eld. Unfortunately, the two runners were\nleft on base as Oxford struck out\nthe next batter.\nAfter the second inning, the\nOxford batting progressed stead-ily, and the runs crept up. This\nwas complemented by the Oxford\npitcher\u2019s impressive performance\n(albeit with a less than impressive\nMovember attempt), recording\nten strikeouts as he shut out the\nImperial o\ufb00ence, giving Oxford a\nfairly uneventful (hence only two\nparagraphs) 11-0 win.\nImperial feared the worst as\nOxford started the second game\nstrongly, hitting 6 runs in their\n\ufb01rst innings. The Falcons clawed\ntwo runs back courtesy of Zack\ngetting a hit in the bottom of\nthe inning. In the bottom of the\nsecond innings, however, the\nImperial o\ufb00ense started to come\ngood. After the lower order batters all got on base, the big hitters\nat the top of the order came back\nto drive the runs in. As the score\nracked up, the Falcons began to\ntake control, as J.D. Smith was\nwalked to tie the game at 7-7. Imperial \ufb01rst baseman Chris Carter\nstole home to put the home team\nup by one run going into what\nwould be the \ufb01nal innings.\nIn the top of the third, Oxford took the lead. Oxford\u2019s big\nAmerican shortstop launched a\nhuge hit towards left centre \ufb01eld.\nAs the away team looked certain\nto score, the ball was plucked\nfrom the air by left \ufb01elder Steph\nMangeon, making a fantastic\ngame-saving catch. After the \ufb01nal Oxford batter ground out to\nJ.D. Smith at second base, Imperial needed two runs to win from\ntheir \ufb01nal innings.\nAlex Fung launched a line drive\ninto right \ufb01eld for a single, bringing the Imperial top order back\nup. After a new pitcher walked\nthe next two batters to load the\nbases. On the third pitch, Ashley belted a line drive into centre\n\ufb01eld. Vincent slid in, meaning\nthe Falcons took a tense 10-9 victory after a tremendous walk-o\ufb00\nsingle from Ashley.\nChris Carter\nIC Baseball\nJames White\nFootball Columnist\nArsenal v Everton\n(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)\nRoberto Martinez\u2019s To\ufb00ees remain\noutsiders for a Champions League\nspot after quietly impressing thus far.\nBut their commanding league position is based largely on their outstanding home form, and they remain\npretty inconsistent away from the fortress that is Goodison Park. Their full\nbacks like to play an open, expansive\ngame but will have to be disciplined\nand batten down the hatches against\nthe Gunners. Arsenal remain impossible not to back at the Emirates and\nAaron Ramsey, Olivier Giroud and\nco. should have no problems here. But\nthe real test of their title credentials\nwill be provided by the teams around\nthem.\nPrediction: 2-0\nMan United v Newcastle\n(Saturday 12:45, BT Sport 1)\nDavid Moyes\u2019 men are \ufb01nally starting\nto look like title contenders, but they\nare making a bad habit of dropping\npoints, rather like Moyes\u2019 Everton\nsides of yesteryear. It won\u2019t be easy\nhere against a bang in-form Newcastle side. Alan Pardew has gone from\nfavourite for the sack to \ufb02avour of\nthe month; that he has left the likes of\nHatem Ben Arfa on the bench recently\nshows the Magpies have real strength\nin depth. They will believe they can\nfollow in the footsteps of West Brom\nand claim all three points here, so\nhopefully we are in for a classic like\nlast season.\nPrediction: 3-2\nSouthampton v Man City\nThis is a fascinating match-up. The\nSaints have failed to beat the big guns\nof late despite their strong start. But\nfor all their exceptional home routs,\nMan City are poor on the road and do\nnot possess the same fear factor. Make\nno mistake, Mauricio Pochettino badly needs to reinvigorate his side \u2013 they\nwill be hurting from defeats at Arsenal and Chelsea. But you always feel\nCity are prone to errors \u2013 just look at\nhow this \ufb01xture panned out last sea-son, when City\u2019s title bid e\ufb00ectively\nended at St Mary\u2019s Stadium. The \ufb01rst\ngoal will be crucial and the Saints are\nexperts at bagging it, so I\u2019m backing\nthem to share the spoils.\nPrediction: 1-1\nSunderland v Tottenham\n(Saturday 5:30)\nGus Poyet has been luckless of late\nand the Black Cats have found the net\nhard to come by. But they have already\nbeaten Man City and Newcastle at the\nStadium of Light and I expect them\nto overcome an under-pressure Spurs\nside short of goals.\nPrediction: 1-0\nStoke v Chelsea\nRather like Man City, the Blues\u2019 away\nform is not that of champions. But\nStoke were atrocious at Everton last\nweekend, posing no attacking threat\nwhatsoever, and Jose Mourinho can\nsilence some of the doubters here.\nPrediction: 0-3\nCrystal Palace v Cardi\ufb00\nCrystal Palace make up for lack of\nquality with desire and excellent or-ganisation. Cardi\ufb00 pose little o\ufb00ensive\nthreat away from home and this is a\nbrilliant opportunity for Tony Pulis to\nclaim 3 vital points.\nPrediction: 1-0\nWest Brom. v Norwich\nThe Baggies seem to give everybody\na really good game nowadays. Steve\nClarke has moulded a quality side\nnailed on for regular top-half \ufb01nishes.\nBy contrast, the Canaries have been\nvery average of late and rarely produce\na surprise result.\nPrediction: 2-0\nFulham v Aston Villa\n(Sunday 1:30)\nMartin Jol\u2019s sacking last weekend was\nno surprise at all and Rene Meulensteen has his work cut out to stop the\nrot. Unfortunately for Fulham, Aston\nVilla produce their best performances\naway and will be up for this after frustration last weekend.\nPrediction: 3-0\nLiverpool v West Ham\nDespite their setback at the KC Stadium last weekend and Daniel Sturridge\u2019s injury, Liverpool remain a free\nscoring side \u2013 in stark contrast to the\nHammers. Sam Allardyce\u2019s men never\nconcede lorry loads of goals but there\ncan surely only be one outcome.\nPrediction: 2-0\nSwansea v Hull\n(Sunday 4pm)\nYou get the sense Swansea\u2019s indi\ufb00erent\nform is down to the di\ufb03culty of balancing European and Premier League\ncommitments. Hull are notoriously\nhard to break down but Michael Laudrup at least has the \ufb02air players to\ndo it and claim an important home\nwin.\nPrediction: 2-1\nIC INDOOR CRICKETGETTY IMAGES\n\n"

I cannot recommend that\nover the next few months. The current\nexhibitions are spread across their\ntwo venues; Wael Shawky: al-Qurban\nat the Serpentine Gallery and Jake and\nDinos Chapman: Come and See at the\nSerpentine Sackler Gallery. Both are,\nin their own ways, dark, challenging\nand absorbing, requiring serious\ninvestment in the artists\u2019 languages\nand totems. Wael Shawky\u2019s\nthree short \ufb01lms are at least relatively\naccessible. The emerging middle-eastern artist is fresh enough not\nhave yet acquired a Wikipedia page,\nyet his brace of prestigious awards\nis growing rapidly. His works, most\nnotably his \ufb01lms, explore the history\nand culture of the region of his birth,\nwith an emphasis on questions of\nmythmaking, truth and authority.\nThe Horror Show File and The Path\nto Cairo both cinematically retell\nthe history of the Crusades, utilising\nmarionettes and unravelling stories\nof con\ufb02ict, death and betrayal. The\npuppets themselves are on display at\nthe gallery and are worth examining.\nTheir grotesque, occasionally\nchimeric, design plays on the notions\nof mutability and caricature that are\nthreaded through his explorations of\nhistorical narrative.\nBoth \ufb01lms are narrated in Classical\nArabic, the language of news reports,\nlending a super\ufb01cial authority the\nstories, which, in reality, interlace fact\nand legend. Allusions like these may\nbe lost on those (such as myself) who\nlack a familiarity with Arab history.\nHowever, the \ufb01lms stand on their\nown as eerie, atmospheric and self-contained tales of human nature.\nA third \ufb01lm, Al Araba Madfuna II, is\nalso on show. This newer work utilises\nchild actors to tell two parables by the\nEgyptian writer, Mohamed Mustagab.\nThe cinematography is beautiful and\nevocative, anchoring the stories amid\nancient mud building and waterways.\nThe children\u2019s speech is provided by\nadults. They also wear adult clothes\n(and fake moustaches) but, far from\nveering towards absurdity, the device\nlends a strange naivety and pathos to\nthe parables.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to avoid seeing the\nshow in the light of contemporary\nevents in the middle-east, many of\nwhich seem to echo those of the past.\nThe question hangs in the air: how\nwill the stories we are living through\ntoday be told in years to come?\nAny meditations on human nature\nand ancient history with which you\nleave the gallery are but airy whimsy\nin comparison to what the Chapman\nbrothers have in store for you. For\nthose who damn contemporary\nartists for peddling provocation\nand shock, the Chapmans are chief\namong sinners. Torture, gore,\ngenocide, perversion and pain are\ntheir media and they employ them\nwithout restraint. The bewildering\nshow constitutes a mass of work\ndating back to the 90s. The show-stealers however are a set of four of\nthe brothers\u2019 infamous dioramas.\nFor those unfamiliar with the\nChapmans\u2019 work, these deserve some\ndescription. Each piece consists of a\nlarge, intricate diorama composted\nof painstakingly painted plastic\nmodels\u2026 of Nazis in hell. Whatever\ndepraved, evil, genocidal activities\nyou can think o\ufb00, the Third Reich and\ntheir skeletal accomplices are doing it\nto themselves. The scenes are horri\ufb01c\nillustrations of human evil and overtly\nreference Hieronymus Bosch.\nThe dioramas are only one example\nof a cornucopia of confrontational and\ndarkly humorous works. The gallery is\nalso populated with mannequins in\nthe garb of KKK members, peering\nat the artwork and lounging on\nchairs. Beneath their robes the plastic\nKlansmen wear brightly striped\nwoollen socks.\nWhilst nightmarish and shocking,\nthe Chapman brothers\u2019 work provides\na provocative and thought provoking\nexploration of the darker side of\nhuman nature. The show may not be\nfor everyone, but as an overview of\nthe artists\u2019 work it is worth a visit for\nthe adventurous. Art may have lost its\nability to shock, but not to disturb.\n\u00a9\nJAKE\nAND\nDINOS\nCHAPMAN\n\n"

    "content": "34 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nFILM Editor: John Park\n\ufb01lm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHere\u2019s looking at you,\nIt\u02bcs been a bad year for...\nFailed Oscar hopefuls\nAustralian actresses Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts had big biopics planned to be released during the awards season;\nKidman playing Grace Kelly in Grace of Monaco with Watts taking over the role of Lady Diana Spencer in Diana.\nKidman\u2019s film was bumped for an insignificant release date in March next year, whereas Watts\u2019 film was widely panned\nby critics who had nothing but scathingly harsh words to say about it, and became an industry laughing stock. The boxoffice result for Diana was also abysmal, completely ruining whatever chance the film had in competing for awards.\nThe same goes for Benedict Cumberbatch and his muddled film The Fifth Estate. Despite the world\u2019s favourite Sherlock putting on his best Aussie accent to impersonate Julian Assange, it failed to take off, having one of the worst opening\nweekend numbers this year. \u201cThe Cumberbitches have got my back\u201d he said. Err...sure about that?\nWolverine\nEvery Wolverine movie ends up making less money than its predecessor\nand this one was no exception. Simply\ntitled The Wolverine, the immortal\nAdamantium-filled hero was sent to\nJapan to fight assassins on a bullet\ntrain and then throw that all away to\nbe a part of one of the worst final climax sequences a 2013 film has so far\noffered. It baffled and bored despite\nHugh Jackman\u2019s best efforts to flex\nevery single muscle in his body, although the end-credits scene hinting\nat next year\u2019s big X-Men reunion was\nreassuring.\nAbdellatif Kechiche\nDespite his deserving Palme d\u2019Or win this year, it\u2019s not every director\u2019s dream\nto be labelled as being a nightmare to work with by two of his leading actresses (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, L\u00e9a Seydoux). But such is the fate of the Blue is the\nWarmest Colour director. The crew behind his film are claiming his never-end-ing shooting schedule was illegal (harassment, unpaid hours), and his incredibly\nlong, graphic sex scenes have attracted controversy. It was all smiles, kisses and\ntears of joy when the film premiered in Cannes, but since then there has been\nan ugly war between the director and the cast/crew. Kechiche is now threatening to sue the defaming actresses, and has stated his wish the film should never\nbe released with all this bad press going with it. However this should only be a\nminor setback for the Tunisian-French director, who is very much respected in\nthe European film market.\nDesperate Twilight wannabes\nNow that the Twilight and Harry Potter films are over, 2013 marked the race to see who could fill this gap with a lasting\nfranchise. Three potential candidates came forward, with all of them falling flat both in terms of not being able to make a\nmark on the box office, as well as failing to impress the critics and cinema-goers.\nFirst up was Beautiful Creatures, a story about good and bad witches, which had promising leads, with Alice Englert\nand Alden Ehenreich doing their best not to sulk and be useless. It had a great supporting cast too, with Viola Davis, Jeremy Irons, Emmy Rossum and Emma Thompson filling the adult roles. But the story went nowhere and although equipped\nwith so much supposed magic, the film failed to have fun with its fantasy concept. A box office disappointment? For sure.\nReleased next is the worst on the list, which was penned by the same woman who was responsible for Twilight. The\nHost, arguably one of the most awful films of 2013, had the talented Saoirse Ronan caught up in a laughable love triangle as\nshe battled with her mind when it came to debating over who to kiss. The two lads in question were frustratingly slow, with\na possessed-looking Diane Kruger acting as an unintentionally hilarious villain. This also didn\u2019t set the box office on fire.\nMost disturbing however, was The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, a film that came dangerously close to advocating incest as long as it doesn\u2019t feel wrong in the heart. Any film that can quite seriously say with a straight face that Johannes Bach was a demon hunter is one that you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about laughing at, which is the one thing this film was\ngood for. There are talks of a sequel for this, which is completely baffling since it barely made back its production budget.\n\n"

If you\u2019re not sure\nwho that is, look up the London\nUnderground song on YouTube and\nsend us a letter of thanks.\nQ: Hi Adam, I think to start I have\nto ask the obivous question, why\nwould anyone put themselves\nthrough Imperial Medical School\nfor 6 years and then decide to sing\nsmutty songs for a living?\nWell, I think you sort of decide what\nyou\u2019re doing at University when you\nchoose your GCSEs, particularly for\nmedicine \u2018cause you know you have to\nkind of do sciences. I didn\u2019t quite know\nwhat I wanted to do when I was 16 and\nthe idea of being a doctor was a thing\npeople did, so I did it and I guess I knew\nwhen I was studying that it wasn\u2019t\n100% suited to me but I ploughed on\nbecause I was halfway there and then I\nworked as a doctor for a bit but whilst\nI was working as a doctor I was also\nperforming and doing various other\nthings so that when I eventually had\nmy full epiphany that I couldn\u2019t do\nthat forever I was able to jump ship.\nBut you don\u2019t want your hospitals\nfull of doctors who don\u2019t particularly\ngive a shit about being a doctor, it\u2019s\ngenerally a good thing that that cohort\nnotice and try something else.\nQ: How did you get through the app\nprocess then, did you have to lie on\nyour personal statement?\nNo, I mean medicine\u2019s a lot harder to\nget into now than it was. The sort of\napproach was they wanted someone\nwho had good predicted grades who\nseemed just a nice chap; either did\nmusic, or played rugby or did drama\nor the school magazine, whatever it\nwas. I\u2019d done music and things and\nthey decided I was the right sort\nof \ufb01t. But whilst I was at Imperial\nsomething changed and it became\nquite an academic medical school so\nI de\ufb01nitely wouldn\u2019t get in now. But\nI think I was relatively honest on my\npersonal statement; certainly the facts\nwere there, whether I egged it up a bit\nwith how much I loved being a doctor.\nI probably did, but it was probably\nfactually accurate.\nQ: Are there any particular\nmemories you have of Imperial\nCollege?\nUmm, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sort of\nindividual stories. No there actually\nare, I keep thinking of individual\nstories but I literally can\u2019t tell you\nbecause the people involved are now\nconsultant physicians and surgeons\naround the country and I\u2019d hate for\ntheir careers to end as a result of this\ninterview.\nQ: Any non speci\ufb01c stories then?\nI\u2019m sure medical students haven\u2019t\nchanged in the slightest, a lot of\ndrinking, nudity and the occasional\narrests.\nQ: Did you see the Daily Mail article\nabout the Reynolds? How does that\ncompare?\nIt\u2019s not a very pleasant environment,\nif you\u2019re a rugby playing drinking boy\nit\u2019s very fun to do all these drinking\ngames, but if you\u2019re not that, if you\ndon\u2019t \ufb01t into that mould it\u2019s a very\nscary environment \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of\npressure on to drink and I think in\nall honesty it wouldn\u2019t do any harm\nfor everyone to take a bit of a look\nat themselves and think \u201cam I happy\nthat this is happening in a university?\u201d,\nparticularly people who have to\nhave some degree of probity who\nare training to be doctors. I\u2019m sure\nat Imperial it was all painted as \u201coh\nthey\u2019re being such killjoys and this is\njust tradition and fun\u201d. But you know\nI wasn\u2019t one of the rugby guys and\nI often did think I was being forced\ninto drinking more than I would.\nOtherwise I was going to be picked\non as an outsider. I think there\u2019s the\ndiversity for fun and the diversity\nfor drinking without that. It can be a\nhorrid environment so I don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019s any harm in someone noticing.\nQ: How would you advertise\nyourself to Imperial students who\nknow of you only from the London\nUnderground song?\nI ruin all their favourite songs. I\nhaven\u2019t quite shaken my science roots\nso there\u2019s probably no nerdier smutty\npiano based comedian. I\u2019m playing\na Christmas show that is literally\nthe opposite of any other West End\npantomime sort of thing; it\u2019s just sort\nof horrendous, swearing, blasphemy,\nwith vague scienti\ufb01c undertones.\nQ: Have you ever had a song that\u2019s\ntoo o\ufb00ensive or is it anything goes?\nNo I have to self-censor but you self-censor for a number of reasons, you\nwrite something and take a step back\nand think \u201cis it funny? Is it clever? Is it\no\ufb00ensive?\u201d And o\ufb00ensive is something\nI have to think about a lot because if\nyou go and see a comedian the idea\nis that you leave happier than when\nyou went because if you don\u2019t then\nyou\u2019ve absolutely failed as a comedian,\nso a lot of what I do is near to the\nknuckle but I try quite hard to make\nsure people aren\u2019t going to be actually\nupset by what happens. Hopefully I\nachieve it because they don\u2019t seem to\nwalk out or call the police or write\narticles however stressful it was.\nQ: What do you see in a news story\nthat makes you want to sing about\nit?\nProbably half the time it comes from\na topic I want to explore and half the\ntime it comes from a song I\u2019ve heard\non the radio and I\u2019ve realised I can\nchange one of the words to bum and\nstretch that out to three minutes. I\nthink what I do is quite broad; I don\u2019t\nstick to one particular topic. I think\nif I have a song people would like to\nhear I write it. I think there\u2019s also a big\nattrition rate, probably a quarter of the\nsongs I write ever hear the light of day\non stage. Though when I\u2019m playing in\na week or so the theme is very much\nChristmas, then again it is nearly\nChristmas.\nQ: So do you have a favourite song in\nparticular to perform? Or one that\ngets the best audience reaction?\nI don\u2019t know, I mean often it\u2019s one of\nthe more recent songs I\u2019ve written. I\nenjoy playing those just because the\nLondon Underground song I must\nhave played 300 billion times.\nNearly as much as it\u2019s been seen on\nYouTube.\nYeah, I am grateful for that song, but\nif I was told I never had to play it\nagain I wouldn\u2019t say no. But I mostly\nenjoy songs which are fairly new\nto me because I\u2019m still hearing the\npunchlines for the third or fourth\ntime. I wrote a version of the John\nLewis ad and played that at a gig a\nfew days ago and that was enjoyable\nbecause it was so new to me.\nQ: Have you ever thought about\nwriting a song about Imperial in\nparticular?\nNo, I mean you\u2019ve got to look at how\nbig an audience is. If I have a speci\ufb01c\ngig at the association of whateverers\nI will write often some material for\nthat occasion, but the occasion hasn\u2019t\narisen for me to perform at Imperial.\nQ: So we have to book you to get our\nown song?\nExactly, you have to fucking pay me!\nI\u2019m not a charity! I\u2019m not sure what\nI would say about it, but I think that\noverall it was an enjoyable experience.\nQ: Did you ever read Felix when\nyou were here? And what were your\nthoughts?\nI did, the Editor was called Will\nDugdale and it was very good actually,\nit was a useful resource and it had\nreally good cryptic crosswords. I\ndon\u2019t know if you still have them, but\nit taught me how to do them which I\nstarted doing in my \ufb01rst year and I still\ndo every day.\nThat\u2019s useful life skills being taught\nat Imperial\nProbably the thing at Imperial that\u2019s\nhad the most impact on my life, but\ncertainly not anything in the degree I\ndid, just learning how to complete the\ncryptic crossword.\nQ: Do you have an opinion on the\nnew 24 hour tube hours and lack of\nticket o\ufb03cers, is there going to be a\nrevision to the song?\nThere will de\ufb01nitely be a revision to\nthe song. It\u2019s never nice when people\nlose their jobs but on the other hand\nI\u2019m yet to see a smile from a London\nUnderground worker so I can\u2019t be so\nsad that they\u2019re all going to be replaced\nwith robots. Inevitably there will be\nstrikes so my song will get a bit more\nairplay. But my overall feeling about\nthe 24 hour opening is at the moment\nhalf the tubes are closed during the\nday at the weekend, so can we sort out\nthe days \ufb01rst and then move on to the\nnight? They seem to be running before\nthey can walk. I live on the District\nLine, I can\u2019t use it any weekend. So\nit\u2019s all well and good telling me I can\nuse it at night, but I think we all know\nfull well that\u2019s not true. Also can you\nimagine the stench? A river of vomit\nrunning through the centre of the\nnight tube? It\u2019ll be worse than the\nbuses, and if it\u2019s running 24 hours how\ndo you clean it? Or will there be this\nconstant smell of sick 24 hours a day?\nQ: Finally, what would you say to\nanyone at Imperial thinking maybe\nthey want to go into something a bit\nmore creative?\nFinish your degree, you\u2019ve always got\nthe option to go back and do it later.\nIt\u2019s always good to have a vocation,\nbut on the other hand it\u2019s a fucking\nawful job. Why anyone would go back\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s such a long degree\n\u2013 everyone thinks about quitting at\nsome point. But I\u2019m pleased that I\nstuck it out because if for any instance\nvariety and gigging dries up at some\npoint I can always grit my teeth and\nwork as a locum again or something.\nThe Amateur Transplants Christmas\nShow hits London on Friday the 13th of\nDecember at the Bloomsbury Theatre,\nwith student tickets costing \u00a316. Check\nit out for the funniest, sweariest night\nyou can get to on the tube.\nInterview: Adam Kay, Musical Comedy\nIDIL SUKAN/DRAW HQ\n\n"

How to decide\nI\nf you \ufb01nd yourself in the position of\nhaving more than one job o\ufb00er give\nyourself a pat on the back. Well done!\nHowever, it can be surprisingly hard to\ndecide which one to accept\nRemember that di\ufb00erent factors are\nimportant for di\ufb00erent individuals. Make\nsure you have su\ufb03cient information when\ntrying to make up your mind. You can\nask prospective employers for both more\ninformation and more time to decide.\nThe list below is an attempt to cover the\nfactors you might consider when making\nyour decision, but it is not exhaustive.\nYour decision will be uniquely your own.\nRemember that your \ufb01rst job is simply that,\nand not a life-sentence. However an unwise\ndecision can mean a few very di\ufb03cult\nmonths.\nMoney, hugely important but\u2026\nWhen you have debts to pay o\ufb00, this seems\nlike a big factor. However, remember that\nsalarymayrisequitequicklyinthe\ufb01rstcouple\nof years of employment. Then there may\nbe bonuses, and other bene\ufb01ts to consider.\nDo not attach too much signi\ufb01cance to the\nstarting salary. Remember also that salary\nprogression may be much faster in some\nareas of employment than in others.\nNonstop training\nThink about the training opportunities\neach job will provide. In today\u2019s relatively\n\ufb02uid job market, it is more important than\never to take responsibility for your own\ncareer development. Being in a good position\nto keep learning and developing skills is a\ngreat advantage, whether you are hoping\nfor progression or for a change of career\ndirection later on. If formal study is required,\nmake sure the issue of study leave and fee\npayment is clear.\nThe daily grind\nDo you know enough about what you will\nactually be doing day-to-day in the job? Will\nit provide enough variety and intellectual\nchallenge? Is the level of responsibility about\nright, and how soon will that responsibility\ncome? Is the job likely to be pressured, with\nlots of deadlines, and are you likely to enjoy\nthat? Will you be essentially o\ufb03ce based, out\non site, meeting with clients and customers or\nworking with other parts of the organisation?\nWhat about the future?\nThink about the state of health of the\nprospective employer and/or its sector \u2013 is\nit expanding or contracting? Is the company\npro\ufb01table or does the organisation have a\ngood reputation? In an uncertain world, it\nmay be better if a job o\ufb00ers a range of career\ndevelopment options, rather than leading\ninto a narrow \ufb01eld. How marketable are you\nlikely to be after two years\u2019 experience?\nLittle or large?\nAdvantages of larger employers can include\nthe following: more training on o\ufb00er, internal\nmoves are possible, more recent graduates\naround so better support/social life.\nHowever, in a larger \ufb01rm you may feel your\ncontribution is not signi\ufb01cant, you might\nget \u201cstuck\u201d in a department and you might\nstruggle with bureaucratic systems. On the\nother hand, in a smaller organisation it may\nbe possible to gain a responsible position or\nbe \u201cmaking a di\ufb00erence\u201d more quickly. There\nmay be the opportunity for wider ranging\nexperience and the organisation may be less\nbureaucratic. On the negative side, there may\nbe less opportunity for formal training, the\npeer group may be small leading to feelings\nof isolation, and there may be little chance of\ninternal moves.\nComfort factors\nYou should consider whether the job may\ncon\ufb02ict with your values. Do you admire the\nproducts or services of this employer? Does\nits environmental stance cause you concern?\nAre there other ethical issues? You won\u2019t\nbe happy working somewhere if there\u2019s a\nfundamental misalignment here.\nShirt & Ties or T-shirts & Jeans\nThis may not be easy to de\ufb01ne, but it\nincludes things like whether or not the\norganisation is static, formal and rigid\nor \ufb02uid, informal and embraces change.\nIs there a very clear hierarchy within the\norganisation? Who would you be reporting\nto and where do they \ufb01t within the structure.\nWhen you visited the organisation what was\nthe level of formality, how did people meet\nand greet each other. Think about the other\nemployees you have already met. If you liked\nthem, you would probably be quite happy\nworking with them.\nNine to Five?\nMany employers these days talk about the\n\u201cwork/life\u201d balance which is quite important\nto many graduates. However, in some\norganisations there can be a \u2018long-hours\u2019\nculture with lots of uno\ufb03cial overtime and\nweekend work. Does the organisation\nencourage working from home? Will you\nhave a set location or desk or is \u2018hot desking\u2019\nthe norm? What about travelling away from\nhome? Is this something that you will do\nregularly and if so what proportion of your\nday/week/month will be away? Consider\nwhat your priorities are. Is it important for\nyou to maintain regular social, sporting or\nrelationship commitments outside of work\nand how will the job impact on this?\nLocation, Location, Location\nThink about your journey to work, the cost\nof living in the area and any likely advantages\nor disadvantages of the location. House\nprices and the cost of renting might have\nan impact on your decision. Can you still\nget access to the things that are important\nto you, culture, entertainment, friends and\nfamily? Satisfy yourself that you will be able\nto a\ufb00ord to live within a reasonable distance\nof the job and that you are likely to be happy\ndoing so.\nHopefully these ideas will help you to\nevaluate any o\ufb00ers that you receive and make\na well informed choice. The important thing\nis to keep your employer contacts informed.\nDo not just accept everything and think that\nyou can make a decision later. Reneging\non job o\ufb00ers is very de\ufb01nitely frowned\nupon by recruiters and, as the graduate\nrecruitment market is a surprisingly close\nknit community where people do actually\nmeet and talk with each other, you could get\na bad reputation very quickly by reneging. It\nis much better to be honest and open and let\nall concerned know that you might like some\nmore time to make a decision. Asking for a\nweek or perhaps two is reasonable but don\u2019t\nexpect a company to keep a job o\ufb00er open for\nmuch longer than that. Remember that every\no\ufb00er you are hanging on to is an o\ufb00er that\nsomeone else cloud bene\ufb01t from. If you need\nhelp making your decision talk it through\nwith others, friends, family, you can also use\nyour careers consultant at College as a useful\nsounding board.

    "content": "19\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 DEC\nARTS\nKamil McClelland talks to Mendel Kaelen, an Imperial PhD student\nwhose artwork is on display in the GV Art Gallery in London\nMendel Kaelen received his BSc and\nMSc in neurological and behavioural\nsciences at the State University of\nGronigen, and is now doing a PhD\nat Imperial College. He also works\nas a sound artist and experimental\nmusician and is currently exhibiting\nat the GV Art Gallery\u2019s NOISE &\nWhispers exhibition.\nSo Mendel, what are you researching\nat the moment in your PhD?\nWe are looking at the neurological\ne\ufb00ects of psychedelic drugs. We do so\nat \u2018resting state\u2019, meaning that people\nin the scanner are allowed to lie there\nwith their eyes closed, letting their\nminds wander freely.\nIn 2001, researchers found that\ncertain brain regions are actually\nmore active at rest. My supervisors\nfound that psychedelics seem to very\nspeci\ufb01cally target these resting state\nnetworks, and my research builds on\nthis.\nMoving on to your art, how would\nyou describe what you do?\nEver since I started experimenting with\nsounds, I became really fascinated by\nenvironmental ones. Field recording\nplays a very central position in my\nwork \u2013 although I also work with\nobjects and instruments.\nFurthermore I often don\u2019t use these\n\ufb01eld recordings in their pure form. I\nam more interested in how the sound\nfeels, rather than what it is. After I\nmodulate my recordings, you often\ndon\u2019t recognize the original sound any\nmore, but you still have this organic\nquality to it.\nWhy do you find natural sounds\nso appealing, as opposed to purely\nelectronic sounds?\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019re more interesting.\nFor instance, I have a deep appreciation\nfor the work of artists like Carsten\nNicolai, where often there is no natural\ncontext at all. I just tend to constrain\nmyself at the moment, to give myself\nfocus.\nHowever, I do \ufb01nd it appealing that\nthey represent, both concretely and\nin a more abstract sense, forces of\nnature. We are constantly surrounded\nby mechanistic sounds, so it is easy\nto become estranged from these\nnatural ones. Maybe I still have a\nkind of romantic vision of nature at a\nsubconscious level in my practice.\nWhat are you trying to do with your\nmusic? Are you trying to capture\na landscape, reveal some hidden\nreality, or just create emotion? Do\nyou think about these things when\nyou create your music?\nAbsolutely! That question has much\nto do with how I de\ufb01ne art. I see\nart as a form of communication \u2013 a\nlanguage that is irrational, and that\ndoesn\u2019t bother to be rational. It gives\nvoice to those forces you feel inside\nthat are di\ufb03cult to quantify. When\nI create art myself, I see it as giving\npeople a symbol that that bypasses\nthe intellect. It\u2019s about giving people a\nphenomenologically rich experience.\nDo you see your work as academic?\nNo, not at all; I see it as art, and\nart is not academic for me. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean it cannot be inspired by\nscienti\ufb01c concepts, though. Science\nis about objective truth; it provides\nexplanations of reality no matter what\nyou may feel about this reality, whilst\nart is about subjective reality and what\nyou experience. Theoretically they\nare extremely di\ufb00erent, but they both\nhave to do with, in a very abstract\nsense, \ufb01nding explanations for your\nexperience of life.\nWhat are your main artistic\ninfluences?\nThey are a rich blend of science,\nliterature, music and visual art. I keep\nbeing inspired by new musicians;\nit\u2019s a never-ending process. Works\nby Francisco Lopez have greatly\na\ufb00ected my artistic development. He\nworks with \ufb01eld recordings in very\nimmersive, abstract works. There is\none of his albums called La Selva that\nreally opened my ears to new ways of\nlistening.\nTalk to me about your piece on\ndisplay at the GV art gallery.\nAltered Space of Consciousness started\nvery intuitively back in Groningen,\nwhere I was studying neuroscience. I\noften found myself driving home in the\nmiddle of the night. At night, the city\ncentre turns into this carnage of human\ninstincts; people are very disinhibited.\nI would always try to avoid it; it had a\nkind of intrusiveness to it. However, I\neventually found it fascinating to listen\nand overcome my resistance to that\nsoundscape. So then every time I drove\nback home, I would bring my sound\nrecording equipment with me.\nAfterwards, I thought about how\nI could recreate that experience for\nlisteners. I came up with the idea of\nhaving a beer can hanging upside\ndown, lonely in a dark space, and\nplaying these sounds really subtly.\nThere was intrusiveness in the original\nsoundscape, and I wanted to invert\nthat by playing the sounds very softly,\nas an invitation for closer inspection.\nPlanet Earth \ufb02oats as a peaceful pearl\nin black space, but a close look reveals\nthe acts of joy and genocide being\nplayed out simultaneously. So only\nwith your ears next to the can do you\nhear the songs that celebrate booze and\nfootball and those that glorify rape and\nprostitution, all performed together.\nWhat is psychologically interesting\nis that as an outsider, you won\u2019t hear\nthe di\ufb00erence. The sounds are locked\nup, and resonance and overtones are\ncreated by it being played inside this\nenclosed metal space.\nDo you feel a visual element to your\nsound art is quite important then?\nYes, although this is not always the\ncase, as some is best experienced in\ncomplete darkness. Then, the visual\nelement is your mind\u2019s eye. It is\nhowever often the visual part of a work\nthat triggers your \ufb01rst associations,\nwhen it\u2019s presented to you. So I\nthink it is important that the visual\nart resonates with what you want to\ncommunicate with your sound.\nIn your works are you actively trying\nto convey the emotion the field\nrecording originally gave you?\nI always make something from my own\nemotions, but the output is always a\nsurprise. You also never have control\nover what the audience feels. I got\nrid of that idea very soon after my\n\ufb01rst release in 2010, when it became\nclear that everyone had their own\nunique thoughts about the music. In\nthe beginning, a part of me didn\u2019t like\nthat because I wanted to communicate\nsomething very speci\ufb01c. But now I\nrealise that this is something beautiful;\nyou create a piece, but what people do\nwith it is up to them.\nWhat do you see for the future of\nyour art?\nRight now I\u2019m focusing more on\nlive performances and installations.\nWhere everything is going, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I do want to keep creating\nand developing the character of my\npieces. My art will always express how\nI develop as a person.\nSo how was the exhibition?\nIn 1913, the futurist Luigi Russolo constructed a manifesto that was to\ntransform how we thought of sound. In L\u2019arte dei Rumori (The Art of Noises),\nhe rede\ufb01ned music for an era of machinery, electricity and dynamism.\nWestern musical convention was, for him, far too limiting when an in\ufb01nite\npalette of noises lay out there.\nToday, sound art aims to realise this dream, and one hundred years\non, NOISE &Whispers at the GV Art Gallery displays works that, by any\ntraditional de\ufb01nitions, would not be considered music. Here, art is fused\nwith modern technology, generating sound works that manipulate Earth\u2019s\ninnate rhythms into pieces that enhance our experience of our environment.\nFrom the moment you put on the headphones, you see just how radical\nRussolo was. Any ideas of conventional melody are abandoned, replaced\nby an expanse of microtonal minutiae created through \ufb01eld recordings and\ndigital modulation. Is this music? Well, it depends on how you de\ufb01ne it \u2013\nbut most of those I have asked don\u2019t think so, regarding it as unpleasant\nbackground noise that has no place in the \u2018elite\u2019 art of music.\nTherefore, one must approach NOISE &Whispers with an open mind.\nDespite representing one hundred years of musical development, some\nworks may still seem unconventional or hard to understand. Preconceptions\nwill be challenged; that is for certain. However, in places, pieces may seem\noddly familiar, preserving the repetitive, electronic texture of much of\ntoday\u2019s popular music whilst abandoning its \u2018pleasant\u2019 chord progressions.\nScience and art, so often at odds, \ufb01nd harmony in this exhibition.\nThrough science, the artists are able to unearth the inherent sounds of our\natmosphere, revealing melody that we never knew existed. Raxil4\u2019s Solaris\nBeta even manages to extract the sound of the sun through conversion of\npressure oscillations on the solar surface into an audible format, creating an\nacoustic domain like nothing ever heard before.\nWithout any formal musical background, I found the lack of visual art\nin the exhibition disconcerting at \ufb01rst. It appeared occasionally, maybe a\nphotograph or \ufb01lm clip, but existed more as an accompaniment to audio\nrecordings, as opposed to being the focus of sensation. It seems sound art is\na genre often best experienced with closed eyes, introspective, allowing you\nto construct your own imagined world.\nSound art never achieved any great commercial success. It is often\ndescribed as monotonous, uninteresting and overly academic, and I can\nunderstand where this criticism is coming from. Listening to a whole gallery\nof such intense music can become strenuous and tiring. I feel it takes a\ncertain state of mind to fully appreciate these works, a state of utter mental\nrelaxation, and only then are you able to succumb to this deep sonic massage.\nBut NOISE & Whispers is a must-see. It may seem experimental, and\nnot conventionally beautiful, but it cannot be missed. The exhibition has\nchanged my perception of the environment, honing my ears to pick up on\natmospheric noises usually ignored and appreciate them for their unique\ntimbral characteristics. Moreover, its ability to combine science and art\nso seamlessly is exceptional, applying scienti\ufb01c objectivity to art where\npreviously only the subjective experience of truth and emotion existed.\nWhat: NOISE & Whispers\nWhere: GV Art Gallery, W1\nWhen: 8th Nov - 14th Dec 2013\nPrice: FREE\nCOURTESY SUSAN ALEXJANDER AND GV ART\nScientific sound art at GV Art\n\n"

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for your\nfavourite event of the year: the Winter AllNighter.\nImagine if you will, a Tuesday night in the\nUnion. Everything seems normal downstairs,\nas the bar is full of people enjoying their\nslightly-too-expensive pints. Up a \ufb02oor\nand things begin to change. Winding down\nthe staircase you see a queue of people in\ndressing gowns, their nonchalant poses\nslightly ruined by the fact that they are\ncuddling pillows. You try to \ufb01gure out what\nis going on, you hear talk of people \ufb01lled\nwith regret at having to spend an extra two\npounds on an all-night ticket as they forgot\nto buy online beforehand. You realise this is\nwhere you\u2019ve wanted to spend your evening\nall along: the cinema.\nAs you take the seat that will become your\nhome for the next fourteen hours, you are\n\ufb01lled with anticipation, almost bubbling\nover with excitement. This is soon replaced\nwith an uncomfortable sensation in your left\nbuttock as you realise why people decided to\nbring pillows, which you attempt to rectify by\ndoing a strange dance in your seat to remove\nthe pressure, resulting in strange looks from\nall around you. But, this soon passes as the\n\ufb01rst \ufb01lm begins.\nThree \ufb01lms pass and you\u2019re doing \ufb01ne. But\nas midnight comes and goes, you begin to\ndream of the staple of university students\neverywhere: ca\ufb00eine. You pray to every deity\nyou can think of to supply you with just\none drop, before you remember that you\nactually paid for free food and make your\nway upstairs.\nWarmed to the depths of your soul by\nsoup, and energised by co\ufb00ee near saturated\nwith sugar, you feel ready to continue. You\nwatch as the people around you slowly give\nup, dropping o\ufb00 to sleep in their seat, or for\nsome lucky few, sneaking back to their room\nin Beit for a quick nap. But you know that\nyou are stronger than them. You know that\nyou can make the entire night.\nAnd you do. As dawn breaks, you feel the\npride of being alert and aware, satis\ufb01ed by\nthe \ufb01lms you have just witnessed. Now you\nreturn to your home, to be reunited with the\none you know as sleep.\nNow only one question remains. What\n\ufb01lms are we actually showing?\nFirst up, we have the new and genius\nconcept of precocious children capable\nof greatness, as Earth\u2019s brightest kids are\ntrained to become military commanders\nagainst an alien threat, the Formics. But\nthis is much more than Harry Potter in\nspace, as we follow the life of six year old\nAndrew \u2018Ender\u2019 Wiggen, watching him\ngrow from bullied child to a man capable\nof ful\ufb01lling his destiny. Based on the 1985\nnovel by Orson Scott Card, Ender\u2019s Game\nboasts gorgeous cinematography, zero\ngravity battle sequences and the \ufb01rst time\nwe\u2019ve seen Harrison Ford in space since Star\nWars. And if you are worried about Card\ngaining your hard earned cash (also known\nas booze money) to put towards his famous\nhomophobic rants, you need not worry. He\ndoesn\u2019t see a penny of the pro\ufb01t of this \ufb01lm.\nNext, from Formics to Formula 1 we have\nRon Howard\u2019s racing drama: Rush. Even\nfor those who have better things to do on a\nSunday than watch people drive in circles,\nthis \ufb01lm is an engaging watch. Set during the\n1976 racing season, Rush is the tale of the\nrivalry between English ladies man James\nHunt, and austere Austrian Niki Lauda from\nBrazilian beginnings, through \ufb01ery German\ncrashes to the adrenaline fuelled Japanese\n\ufb01nale. Overall, with superb acting, a well\nwritten script and action packed directing,\nRush is a slick, well-oiled machine (sorry).\nThe \ufb01rst in our accidental trio of hostage\nrelated \ufb01lms is Captain Phillips. This is far\nfrom your stereotypical pirate \ufb01lm, you won\u2019t\nhear a single \u2018arr\u2019 in this chilling thriller based\non a true story. The eponymous Captain\nPhillips has his cargo ship overtaken over by\nSomali pirate Muse, who decides to hold him\nand his crew hostage in the hope of making\nmillions. This plan gets even more dangerous\nfor both parties involved when the US Navy\nget on the scene. Captain Phillips is exciting,\ntense and will probably make you think twice\nabout that beach holiday to Somalia you\nwere planning over the summer.\nThe stakes have never been higher for\neveryone\u2019s favourite Norfolk DJ as he returns\nfor his big screen debut. In Alan Partridge:\nAlpha Papa, after fellow DJ Pat Farrell is\nthreatened with redundancy, he decides that\nthe only solution is to hold the rest of the sta\ufb00\nhostage. And the only person that he will\nnegotiate with is Partridge himself. Despite\nnearly twenty years since his \ufb01rst outing, this\n\ufb01lm shows that Partridge still is, as he always\nhas been hilarious, embarrassing and still\nsomehow loveable.\nPrisoners asks the question of how far you\nwould go keep your family safe. After his\nyoungdaughterandherfriendarekidnapped,\nand the only suspect is released due to a lack\nof evidence, Keller Dover decides to take\nmatter. With a great performance by Hugh\nJackman, and Jake Gyllenhaal tattooed and\nrugged like we\u2019ve never seen him before, this\nis the perfect \ufb01lm to keep you awake at four\nin the morning.\nOur \ufb01nal \ufb01lm is Joss Whedon\u2019s latest\no\ufb00ering. From the genius behind Bu\ufb00y and\nCabin in the Woods, and featuring cast that\nincludes Agent Coulson from Avengers:\nAssemble and Mal from Firefly, this is a\nrecipe for sci-\ufb01 magic. Or Shakespeare for\nthat matter. Filmed in Whedon\u2019s house\nin the two weeks between \ufb01lming and\nediting Avengers: Assemble, this modern\nadaptation of Much Ado About Nothing is a\nmonochrome masterpiece.\nSo there it is. A chance to see six \ufb01lms for\nthe price you would usually pay to see one.\nAnd a decent excuse to miss lectures the\nnext day. So what are you waiting for, book\nyour tickets now. I\u2019ll see you there!\nLine Up:\n18:00: Ender\u2019s Game\n20:30: Rush\n23:30: Captain Phillips\n02:00: Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa\n03.45: Prisoners\n06:30: Much Ado About Nothing\nThe Winter All-Nighter is on Tuesday 10th\nDecember.\nTickets are \u00a310 online (until 4pm on the day)\nor \u00a312 on the door.

The aim of the\nprogramme was to give a taste of some\nof the numerous activities o\ufb00ered by\nour many Clubs, Societies & Projects. These were\npredominantly free or cheap taster sessions, events\nand activities which most importantly did not require\nthe purchase of any membership beforehand. The\naim was to enable students to try new activities with\nmany di\ufb00erent clubs before committing to becoming a\nmember. As many Clubs, Societies & Projects already\nran such activities it seemed a natural step to help\nthem publicise them all under the one banner.\nWe had almost 3,000 students participating in the\nactivities on o\ufb00er and it really highlighted some of the\namazing activities that our Clubs, Societies & Projects\no\ufb00er. Synchronised swimmming, Greek dancing,\nlearning how to run a cinema projector, and building\nan energy kiosk were just a few of the varied activities\nfor students to experience.\n71 clubs in total were involved in our \ufb01rst Give It A\nGo and received publicity in booklets distributed at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2013 and on the What\u2019s On pages of the\nUnion website. Membership \ufb01gures are almost 5% up\non where they were at the same point last year and our\nfeedback suggests that Give It A Go certainly helped\nwith this.\nSo where next with Give It A Go? We asked\nparticipating clubs if they thought they would\nbene\ufb01t from a second scheme in January and 76% of\nrespondents thought they would. Many people miss\nopportunities in \ufb01rst term due to the time constraints\nof adapting to new timetables and London life and it\u2019s\nnot too late to try something new and to join a Club,\nSociety or Project that you\u2019ve not been involved in\nbefore. That\u2019s why Give It A Go will be making a return\nin January, with more opportunities to get involved\nin the exciting opportunities provided by our Clubs,\nSocieties & Projects.\nClubs, Societies & Projects can sign up to Give It A\nGo online until Wednesday 11 December. This will\nensure you get for free advertising and promotion of\nevents in booklets, online and through promotional\nactivities on South Kensington campus.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION CINEMA\u00a7\nGive It A Go!\n\n"

However the original\nmotivation for the challenge was only\nknown to a select few \u2013 now it can be revealed.\nSome years ago a curious old RCS alumnus\nfound he had insu\ufb03cient life expectancy\nto exploit the ideas and inventions he had\naccumulated over the years. He decided to \ufb01nd\na group of IC students to explore these ideas by\nissuing a challenge with a cash prize with the\nassistance of the RCSU, which had just been\nreformed. That original question proved too\ndi\ufb03cult and was shelved. However it is still on\nthe table and even though the prize was claimed,\na. signi\ufb01cant number of ideas remain to be\nshared with anyone willing to try.\nThis was that challenge :-In order to encourage the reformed RCSU and\nto forge ties with the RCSA, it was suggested\nthat there should be a competition based on the\nfollowing proposal.\n--ooOOoo--RCS Association Competition\nDuring the foreseeable future an event will\noccur which will either kill most of humanity or\nmake the planet\u2019s surface uninhabitable. Once\nthat happens it will be too late to take any useful\naction, consequently it would seem prudent to get\nready now, while we are still alive.\nThe information needed to give our descendants\na \ufb02ying start on the way to a new civilisation will\nneed to be in a long-lasting form and a format\nthat will make sense to whoever is left of whatever\nethnicity and language.\nWe are asking you to propose a terminal\ndisaster, be it asteroid impact, super volcano or\ntotal global warming, and then propose a way to\npreserve the most suitable group of people and\na method of supplying them with survival data,\nwhich you will de\ufb01ne, in an indestructible way.\nClearly I and a few members of the RCSA,\nwould like to be included but this may not be\nacceptable to everyone else. Our chances of living\nfor 100 or more years to see some new habitat are\nreally doubtful.\nSo who would be there and where would it\nbe \u2013 on the surface \u2013 below ground \u2013 above the\natmosphere? But please, not in space! This planet\nis home for some time to come.\nWhat language would the information be\nin? How will it be presented and where are we\nto put it? All these questions and more present\nthemselves.\nIf you\u2019re clever enough to be here how will you\nsurvive?\nA small prize is o\ufb00ered to the group that\nprovides the most practical solution and an even\nsmaller prize for the most amusing answer.\nWhat would be left \u2013 and has someone done\nthis before? If so, where is it?\n--ooOOoo\u2014\nIn the event the students opted for a far more\nimmediate and practical challenge and decided\nto throw it open to the whole college. This\nbecame the Imperial College Science Challenge\nand on 20/2/06 appeared in Broadsheet as :-How will science allow a long-term, self-contained settlement on Mars to become a\nreality?\nIn order to attract as much interest as possible\nthere were signi\ufb01cant prizes o\ufb00ered and free\ndrinks at the prize giving ceremony. It worked\nwell with many competitors from across the\nCollege taking part. Five of the best entries were\nchosen for the judges to evaluate and the turnout\nfor the \ufb01nal presentations in the Sir Alexander\nFleming lecture theatre was impressive.\nScience Challenge\u2019s Original Aim Exposed\nJon Sanderson\nFormer RCSA President\nT\nhe Holland Club was so\npopular because it was a\nunique facility within the\nCollegeo\ufb00eringatraditional\n\u2018local\u2019 pub ambience for\nsta\ufb00 and postgraduates to relax and\nsocialise in. The bar was carpeted and\ncomfortably furnished, the lighting\nsympathetic, the atmosphere warm\nand friendly.\nThe new bar in no way \u201cpreserves\nthe ethos of the Holland Club\u201d, the\noriginal assurance made to sta\ufb00 and\npostgraduates by the college. Instead\nwe have been provided with a prime\nexample of corporate catering.\nThe h-bar is now identical to other\ncollege outlets and is little di\ufb00erent\nto either the Students\u2019 Union or\nEastside: it has been likened by some\nto a motorway services; add some\nscreaming kids and you could be in a\nMcDonald\u2019s. We struggle to think of a\nless welcoming place to enjoy a drink\nin the entire district. The idea that it is\na \u2018pub\u2019 is contemptible.\nThe worst thing about the whole\nexercise is that it was totally\npreventable. The Holland Club\nCommittee could have maintained a\nseparate bar whilst making additional\nspace for student meetings, meeting\nspace being a primary reason given for\nmaking the changes.\nThe takeover was from the outset\nconducted in an underhand manner.\nRumours and secretive visits to the\nHolland Club by senior management\nwho were apparently \u2018casing the joint\u2019\npreceded any approach to the Holland\nClub Committee. A sudden need\nto serve evening meals in the MDH\nwas contrived so that it could then\nbe deemed unsatisfactory for that\npurpose. Sta\ufb00 representatives and the\nBar Manager, Kevin Young, spent a\nlot of time trying to reach a mutually\nagreeable solution, but the college had\nalready decided on the outcome and\nthe plans. There was the usual sham\nconsultation, something the college\nspecialises in: not one of the several\nhundred comments were taken on\nboard.\nThe Holland Club was established in\n1948 by a benevolent and far-sighted\nCollege Rector who realised that\nsta\ufb00 needed their own haven from\nthe demands of work; a haven that\nbecame increasingly important as\nchanges within the College developed\nan increasingly more pressurised\nworking environment. Over time\nthe social facility was extended to\npostgraduate students and in recent\nyears the Holland Club has fostered\nnew friendships and networking,\nfacilitated informal and sometimes\nvery productive discussions about\nresearch work, and above all provided\nsomewhere welcoming to relax and\nwind down after work.\nFormer Holland Club users will no\ndoubt be divided between those able\nto accept the change and those who\ncannot, and those unable to adapt will\nno doubt be dismissed as whining.\nHowever it must be said that many\nusers of the old club decline to use\nthe new facility not out of rancour\nbut because it is just so unpleasant.\nCommercial services claim much\npositive feedback though strangely the\nh-bar remains unlisted on their review\npage: a case of Emperors\u2019 Clothes?\nNew sta\ufb00 and students will only\nknow of the h-bar but, as with\nSouthside, the name and reputation\nof the Holland Club will linger on for\nsome time yet.\nSadly , the h-bar will above all\nremain a monument to the college\u2019s\ncontempt for its sta\ufb00.\nOpinion: h-bar \u2013 Revisiting the Holland Club\n\u201cThomas Holland\u201d\nSAVE THE HOLLAND CLUB\nFELIX\n\n"

NASA has invested\nUSD$125,000 into a project looking\ninto this, but you don\u2019t need to be\nan astronaut to try this cutting-edge food. Although the idea might\nnot sound appetising, a Barcelona\nstartup is now working on a\nmachine that can sit comfortably in\nyour kitchen. The idea is similar to a\n3D printer you may \ufb01nd in the lab,\nraw ingredients are made into paste\nform and the dish is built layer by\nlayer.

Using what we have\nlearnt in lectures to twist and turn this set of straws and create loads of crazy\nshapes will be quite interesting in any situation! There are 21 pieces in total\nso it will keep you entertained after the end of term when you su\ufb00er from\ncoursework withdrawal symptoms.\nThis could be more fun if you arrive at the party and have a few packs to hand\n- not only is it a great game to play with everyone, but also, you can probably\nbuild a network to drink from two glasses at the same time! Who needs mixers\nanyway?\nDIY Drinking Straws\nPREZZYBOX.COM\nLet\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a problem we face every day, not just at Christmas:\ntaking cold drinks out of the fridge. To the standard of most people, room\ntemperature is not exactly ideal for \u2018best served cold\u2019. Ice cubes might do the\njob for half an hour, but soon it might make your coke tastes like it\u2019s from a\ndispenser machine in the JCR.\nThis ice tankard has a sealed outer wall that is \ufb01lled with freezable liquid, so\nthe product is portable and \u2018cool\u2019. Just freeze the mug and the liquid will keep\nyour drink cold without the need for ice! The only thing we can pick on is that\nit can only hold 400ml \u2013 that\u2019s not even a pint!\nIce Tankard\nFIREBOX.COM\nThis gift is for two types of people: avid tea/co\ufb00ee drinkers and people who\nare plain lazy! Let\u2019s be honest, washing up a teaspoon can be quite an e\ufb00ort\nsometimes, or worse, it could leave stains on shiny silverware/steelware.\nThis mug could potentially change the world for the better, you only need\nto \ufb02ick the switch and the mug stirs away, creating a tea vortex. The switch is\nergonomically located at the top of handle, so there really is no excuse for an\nimperfect cup of hot drink. Just need to remember to buy the batteries, and oh,\nyou can\u2019t put it in a dishwater \u2013 so it\u2019s not completely lazy-proof.\nSelf Stir Mug\nFLUFFYPUFFPUFFS.COM\nMarshmallows are a must for any barbecues. Sadly it is way too cold to have\none in December. Just to remind you and your friends of that toasty feeling,\nwhy not try these gourmet marshmallows? London-based start up Flu\ufb00y Pu\ufb00\nPu\ufb00s makes them with unusal \ufb02avour combinations, like key lime pie, caramel\nslice and even Oreos.\nA new \ufb02avour has recently been added to the store \u2013 a Christmassy one with\nrum and dried fruit Christmas pie. These mallows have no added preservatives\nso that even suits those who like natural ingredients!

The device gives a chance\nfor users to know what exactly is\nin the food they are about to eat.\nAnd since we are living in the 21st\ncentury, the device is even cloud\nconnected, making recipe sharing\nand instagramming that much\neasier. This might sound a bit like\na gimmick, but the machine is due\nto be on the market in the next\nfew years at around \u20ac1000. So still\nslightly cheaper than the cheapest\nMacBook Air, would you consider\nit?\nThe end of term is upon us and it\u2019s time\nto celebrate what we have achieved\nthis term and year. Want a traditional\nChristmas meal but feel lazy and\ndon\u2019t want to spend a fortune? There\nis so much to try, even at Imperial!\nFiveSixEight\nFiveSixEight is serving Christmas\ndinner at a bargain price of \u00a36.50\nnext Tuesday and Thursday. It\u2019s got\nall you can expect \u2013 roast turkey,\nroast potatoes, pigs in blankets and\nthe usual vegetables. You even get\na free cracker \u2013 so enjoy it with\na couple of friends or even just\nyourself, but that will be a bit boring.\nOn a slightly di\ufb00erent subject,\nMushroom, Tomato and Basil has\nwon out on the pizza poll and will be\navailable all week until the end of term!\nEastside Bar\nWant something more substantial?\nThe Eastside bar is serving a three\ncourse dinner at \u00a313.95 \u2013 starting with\nsalmon, turkey roast with port and\neven Christmas pudding.

Back\non their own (partially fan-funded)\nlabel, they\u2019ve been busy readying\nanother album slated for release in\nMarch 2014, and came to London as\npart of a low-key tour to test their\nnew material. The superhero outfits are gone. They mean business.\nThey opened with their latest single \u2018Somewhere in the Distance\u2019, currently available on Spotify and as a free download if the\nalbum is pre-ordered. This nodded to indie-bands-du-jour with\nsynth sounds reminiscent of Everything Everything and a Foalslike spacey pre-chorus and choppy\nguitars, while vocal melodies and\nthe powerful chorus sounded reassuringly Hoosier-ish. Other new\ncuts sounded equally promising,\nD\nsuch as the bouncy \u2018Fidget Brain\u2019\nor the crowd-pleasing lyricism of\n\u2018Handsome Girls\u2019 and \u2018Pretty Boys\u2019.\nWhile lead singer Irwin Sparkes\nwas in fine voice throughout, in full\ncontrol of his impressive falsetto\nregister, and Alan Sharland banging\nthe drums with goofy enthusiasm,\nthe quality of their live sound\nwas mixed at times. First album\nsong \u2018Everything Goes Dark\u2019 was\nparticularly impressive, building to a swelling, emotional crescendo that far outweighed the\nalbum version, but songs like\n\u2018Worst Case Scenario\u2019 sounded\nlightweight and insubstan-tial, lacking the \u201coomph\u201d provided by the studio recordings.\nAs someone more used to\nGlasgow audiences that jump\naround constantly chanting riffs\nand basslines when there\u2019s no sing-ing, the smartphone-toting London\naudience appeared a bit sterile, but\nthe band got everyone into the spirit\nof things masterfully with good song\nchoices and excellent between-song\nbanter, part self-deprecating, part\nfaux-pomposity. Swedish ex-fire-man and bassist Martin Skarendahl\nplayed the straight-man through-out, alongside long-standing live\nmulti-instrumentalist Sam Swallow\nwho recently became an official\nfourth member. With the gig ending on the massive high of \u2018Goodbye Mr A\u2019, given a full rocky outro,\neveryone left with a great big grin\non their face. While yours truly was\na big fan of the second album and\nso would\u2019ve preferred more songs\nlike \u2018Bumpy\u2019 Ride or the Muse-isms\nof \u2018Glorious\u2019, it\u2019s no doubt that the\nHoosiers offer a great night out and\nsome cracking songs - even if they\nare unlikely to ever again reach the\ngiddy heights of their commercial\npeak. Beats Guns \u2018n Roses anyway.\nThe Hoosiers\u2019 fourth album, The\nNews From Nowhere, is set to be\nreleased some time next year.\nThe Who?-siers Emiel\u02bcs Guide to\nOnwards we march! Well, not\nquite marching, as the first notated\nrhythms tended to be divisible by\nthree. During the 13th Century, a\nnew class of literates emerged as a\nresult of the university at Paris, and,\ncombined with the now well-estab-lished body of written works, music\nbecame an intellectual pursuit, theorised and written about \u2013 but more\nimportantly, the first complete system of writing music came together.\nNotation could now convey almost\neverything necessary for perfor-mance, allowing literate music to set\noff on its independent course.\nThe foundations for this were laid\nin the 12th Century Ars Antiqua,\nwhich we discussed at length in the\nprevious instalment. Aside from the\nalready-mentioned developments in\npolyphony, perhaps the most important contribution of the old school at\nNotre Dame was the clear division\nof music through time. Music had\nbecome metrical; notes were quite\nsimply held for different lengths\nrelative to each other and alternated\nto give what is called a rhythmic\nmode (for example, long-short-long-short-long, where a long has twice\nthe duration of a short). However,\nthese rhythmic modes were derived\nfrom \u2018quantitative\u2019 poetic meter and\ndidn\u2019t require a new notation of any\nkind; the mode could simply be given\nand applied to a whole composition.\nIt wasn\u2019t until now, the 13th Century\nthat a method was devised to assign\nduration to each written note indi-vidually.\nThe music of Paris at this time was\nsecular, urban and playful. Composers became renowned for their \u2018virtuosic\u2019 composition, often pulling\ntogether melodies from many different sources and arranging them into\na single piece. Polyphony became\nmore complex, with different voices\nusing different rhythms. Often the\nhigher voices moved at a faster pace\nthan the lower and so modal rhythm\nhad in effect already become redun-dant. Once again visit the Felix website and have a listen to composers\nsuch as Adam de la Halle.\nOne hundred years later, in the\n14th Century, a style developed call\nthe \u2018Ars Nova\u2019 \u2013 still centred on the\nuniversity at Paris. This movement\nhas been compared in magnitude to\nthe introduction of perspective in\npainting and marks the beginning\nof the Renaissance in music. Paradoxically, many Ars Nova composers were also mathematicians, and\napplied their knowledge to explore\nnew rhythms and combinations of\nrhythms to achieve an unprecedented freedom of expression.\nThe prototypal music here is the\ncollection of motets known as the\nRoman de Fauvel, which set various\nsatirical poems to music. However,\narguably the greatest musician was\nGuillaume de Machaut (d. 1377).\nNot only was his \u2018stacking\u2019 of voices\nincredibly intricate and sensuous\nbut his harmonic language was to\nbe emulated for the following two\ncenturies. Previously, a historical imperfection in the notation of scales\nor \u2018modes\u2019 had made it necessary to\nsing notes outside of the system in\norder to properly harmonise certain\nintervals. We now call these notes\nsharps or flats which lie between the\nnotes of the scale. For example, C#:\na pitch slightly higher than C, but\nstill lower than D. Machaut made\nfree use of these for the first time\nand wrote them into his music. The\nresult is dissonance for the sake of\ndissonance and a powerful sense of\nresolution\u2013 a potent expressive tool.\nMusic could now ache and throb\nmuch like the heart does.\nMachaut spent the majority of his\nlife in the service of various aristocrats and kings. At the time, he was\nbest known as a poet and writer of\nlove-songs and courtly ballads, yet\ntoday he is remembered mostly for\nhis setting of the mass \u2013 the first\nto be attributed entirely to a single\ncomposer, functioning as a coherent whole. Luckily for us, in his later\nyears he became preoccupied with\nthe preservation of his manuscripts\nfor posterity.\nAs we have seen, the development\nof musical thought and language has\nbeen inextricably linked to the development of a means to notate it. We\nhave already covered some 5 centu-ries, but only now is literate music\nfully diverging from oral traditions\nand coming in to its own. Next week\nwe will enter the renaissance; a period of massive change and development and the birth of modern music.\nEmiel de Lange\nEpisode IV: A New Art\nClassical Music\n\n"

The battle\ufb01eld\nseries has always interested me, and\nI almost splashed out for Battle\ufb01eld\n3. However I either never seemed to\nhave the money or time and therefore\nmy time to play this seemingly\nawesome game had passed. Yet with\nthe release of Battle\ufb01eld 4, the next\ninstalment in this series, major steps\nforward seem to have been taken\nand an improvement of an already\ngood game. With levolution, updated\ngraphics and generally sick maps, this\nlooks like a shooter I would really\nenjoy, but at a combined value of \u00a380,\nthis bundle is quite an investment. If\nI had enough money, this would be\n\ufb01rst thing I would buy, on the other\nhand you never know might actually\njust get this game if I save up enough!\nIf I had more money than sense,\nthis would be the gaming laptop I\nwould go for. Alienware is known\nto be one of the best manufacturers\nof gaming laptops (if a bit on the\npricey side), and use some of the\nbest ingredients for their products.\nCosting about \u00a34,000, the Alienware\n18 includes a full 1080p 18\u2019\u2019 screen,\n2 Nvidia GTX 780M (one of the\nbest GPU\u2019s on the market at the\nmoment, 32GB of RAM, the list\njust goes on. Everything that is\nconsidered the best on the market.\nEvery game you could think of, this\ngame could run it very comfortable\non the ultra graphics settings and\nnot drop below 60 frames per\nsecond. Using the Alienware 18\nwould make playing any game an\nabsolutely great experience. Also,\nthat lighting doesn\u2019t look half bad,\nnow does it!\nI myself am quite an avid strategy\ngamer. Being the first genre of\ngames I really played intensively,\nI have gone through all kinds of\nvariations on the tried and tested\napproach. Therefore this game,\nwhich has been on my steam wish\nlist for quite a long time, seems\nlike exactly the kind of game I\nwould enjoy. However for 40 (at\nsome points actually 80) pounds,\nI find this would be a bit much\nto spend on an unknown quantity\nregardless of its apparent epicness.\nFurthermore at the moment it is in\nBeta, meaning it could be buggy.\nThe risk is just too high that I\u2019m\nthrowing a significant amount\nof money down the drain for me\nto really warrant purchasing it.\nHowever if money was not an issue,\nthis would be one of the games I\nwould totally go for.\nAudio is a very important aspect of\ngaming. In fact the quality of your\nheadset can be the deciding factor\nbetween you hearing your opponents\nfootsteps and killing him, or him\nsneaking up on you and knifing you!\nThis is indeed true for shooters and\nother online games, however even\nfor other single-players games, the\natmosphere that excellent quality\nmusic and sound is paramount to\na great gaming experience. For my\nchoice of Headset I go for the A50s,\nwhich are 300 pounds a pop, but\nmake up for the price impressively.\nDolby 7.1 surround sound and\nwireless just make these puppies\na joy to use, and should make any\naudiophile drool. Also they not just\nlimited gaming, and make great\ngeneral use headphones. So if I was\ncrapping gold, this is one of the first\nthings i would buy!\nIf I had an absolutely enormous\namount of money, and really\ncouldn\u2019t care less, I would buy about\na thousand CS:GO keys. A quick\nexplanation of what they are: if\nyou play a round on CounterStrike\nthere is a random chance that you\nare assigned a box of loot, which\nyou can only open if you buy a key.\nWithin these boxes they have some\nabsolutely epic decals and skins for\nsome of your most common guns.\nThey do not add anything to the\ngame play, except for the visuals of\nyour gun change, which if you are\ndominating make you feel that extra\nbit more like a badass. However at\n1.50 a pop, which relatively low\nchance of actually getting what you\nwant, the risk versus reward is way\nto high. Yet if I really couldn\u2019t care\nless, I would just buy a boatload of\nthese things\nAs a massive fan of Super Mario 3D\nland for the 3DS and of all other\n3D Mario games I have been super\nexcited about Super Mario 3D world.\nA game which combines all the fun\nof 3D Mario but in stunning HD\nand, for the first time, multiplayer.\nSuper Mario 3D world for the Wii\nU lets you play up to 4 people\nmultiplayer with Mario, Luigi,\nToad, and Princess Peach (and her\numbrella) as playable characters. I\nfor one am super excited to play as\nPrincess Peach. A great Present for\nany holiday season.\nI missed this title when it came out\nearlier this year and Christmas is\na good time to pick it up. Offering\nthe same fun as Pikmin 1 and 2\nall those years ago but in HD and\nwith the added functionality of\nthe Wii U gamepad this is a game\nto get excited about! Whether you\nhave played the previous games in\nthe series or not I think this game\nhas a lot to offer and I hope that\nit delivers. It will be interesting to\nsee how my experiences of Captain\nOlimar and his Pikmin differs now\nthat I am older.\nThe combat system in the earlier\ngames has ensured that this game\nhas a special place in my heart.\nAfter honing my skills in Batman\nArkham Asylum and perfecting my\nstyle in Arkham City I am definitely\nready for the next title in this\nseries. More story, more challenges,\nmore Batman lore. This is a great\nsuccess in super hero games. I love\nBatman , DC comics and these\ngames are awesome! Taking all\nin consideration I may even buy\nthis game regardless of how much\nmoney I have!\nI am hoping that this game is like\nthe 4th Pirates of the Caribbean\nmovie and so it will make me\nexcited about this franchise again.\nAfter loving the first game and\nthen experiencing the magic that\nis Assassins Creed 2 I felt let down\nby the rest of the series. I wish that\nthis game brings the series back to\nthe excitement I had when playing\n2. I want more days spent jumping\nover rooftops and finding hidden\nfeathers. I\u2019ll have to wait and see\nif this game offers more than just\nPirates.\nIf I were to get another console this\nis what I\u2019d go with. After missing\nout on the Playstation 3 maybe it\u2019s\ntime to get back in on their list of\nexclusives.

    "content": "38 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRecently a lot of console love has\nbeen going round in the game\nsection. With the releases of the PS4\nand Xbox One, the reactionary Wii U\narticle, I just felt that one big part of\ngaming, namely PC gaming was being\na bit left out. Therefore I wanted to\nbring it back into the spotlight by\ndescribing my love for one of the big\nchampions of PC\u2019s gaming, Steam.\nFor all you unlucky ones who don\u2019t\nknow what steam is, imagine an\namazon just for games. However\ninstead of actual physical goods, you\nonly get the software. Therefore once\nyoubuythegameyoucanimmediately\ndownload it. Furthermore once you\nbuy a game it stays in your inventory\nforever, meaning that you can never\nmisplace it.\nNow before I gush on about this\nabsolutely wonderful service, I\u2019ll run\nthrough all the negatives so you guys\ndon\u2019t think I tried to deceive you.\nFirstly, the thing that caused so much\npain to the Xbox One, DRM, which\nmeans that you cannot exchange\ngames with friends and/or sell them\non, is impossible with steam games.\nHowever to be perfectly honest, this\nwas almost always so on PC and\ntherefore something that most PC\ngamers are used to. This will be only\nSteamy love for PC Gaming\nMaximilian Eggl wants to give credit to where its due\na concern for you console gamers\nout there. Secondly if anything goes\nwrong, there is no helpline telephone\nnumber. This means if somehow you\nare locked out of your account, play\nyour game etc. you are pretty much\nscrewed. You have to email Valve\n(the developers of steam) and wait\nfor a reply (which can take anywhere\nbetween a few hours to several days),\nwhich may or may not be helpful. The\nlast and absolutely worst thing is the\nsteam sales. Coming around every\nother month, the o\ufb00er great games\nat incredible prices. These sales also\ncome at a time when I think I am\ndoing quite well in terms of \ufb01nances,\nboom the sale comes along and after\nhaving bought about 5 games I am\nbroke yet again.\nHowever these steam sales are also\none of the best things about this\nonline store. This way you can get\nsome of the best games ever at super\nlow prices. In fact for the last sale\n(which ended on tuesday) I managed\nto get the Skyrim legendary edition\nfor 10 pounds!! If I walked into a\nstore this would be possible in the\nsame capacity. In store, the number\nof games that you can buy is limited\nby the demand and actual physical\nsize of the building, while steam\nis limited only by its server size.\nTherefore most games that you can\nthink of will be available, that would\nhave been physically unavailable for\nyears. Another positive thing that\nsteam does is its support of multiple\noperating systems. Regardless if you\nplay on Windows, Mac OS or Linux\nsteam is available on your platform\nas well as o\ufb00ering games for you.\nApart from Blizzard no major game\nstudio or distributor really does this\nto such an extent. The last thing I\nwant to mention, is related to my\ncarelessness. In my past when games\nstill were on CD\u2019s and you needed\na game key to install it, I would\nfrequently either lose the CD, little\nbooklet with the game key, case\nwhich would have the game key or\nany combination of these three. This\nwould mean that if I would want to\nreinstall the game, I would have to go\non a massive treasure hunt to \ufb01nd the\nmissing piece, with failure meaning\nI would have to re-buy the game if I\nwanted it really play it. With steams\nsystem, once you have bought a game\nit is in your inventory inde\ufb01nitely and\nyou can download it as many times\nas you want. This has just made my\nlife so much easier, and means that\nfor each individual game I do not\nneed to put in a new game CD. There\nare so many more great things about\nsteam, e.g. achievement systems,\nbundles, auto-updates of games and\nintegration with demos.\nSteam is one of the best things that\nhas happened to gaming for a while,\nI mean its one the biggest success\nstories of the gaming industry at the\ncurrent time. Steam is a great service\nto be part for even if you are not the\nbiggest gamer, and furthermore its\nfree! For all the things you get, why\nwould you not sign up???\nFor those who loved the original\nKingdom Rush are really in for a\ntreat with the new Kingdom Rush\nFrontiers available on android, apple,\nand now Armorgames. This game\nemploys the same incredibly polished\nTower Defence gameplay, artstyle, and\npresentation as its prequel with new\nelements that enhance the gameplay.\nFrontiers makes some changes in the\ndeeper elements of the gameplay. The\nenemies are a lot more varied and some\nof the enemy bosses can pave their own\npaths through the map forcing you\nto completely rethink the course of\nstrategy defence. The four basic tower\ndefences still remain the same as in the\nprequel but the tower upgrades have\nbeen completely revamped with some\nreally cool towers that can for example\nraise undead minions from enemy\ncorpses and use totems to dispel enemy\nmagic all to allow for a more varied\nstrategy.\nBut it\u2019s the really subtle additions\nthat leave the prints of an artist. The\nbackground environment for almost\nevery map is interactive so you can \ufb01nd\nyourself poking camels in the desert\nand explode them if you poke them\nenough. There are side-missions and\nachievements in the game that relate to\nthe environment interactions such as\nhelping Indiana Jones escape a temple\nin a jungle. Sometimes the creatures\nthat live on the map can aide you in\nbattle.\nFrontiers retains the much loved\nHeroes addition from the prequel but\nwith a wider range of Heroes to aid\nyou in battle. Unfortunately, many\nof the heroes are only available upon\npurchasing them with real money\nhowever the game can be completed\n\ufb01ne without purchasing additional\nheroes.

Mika Vainio & Joachim Nordwall\nMonstrance\nWhile both have distinguished themselves with impressive\nsolo releases this year, Vainio & Nordwall\u02bcs collaboration\nmanages to capture the best elements of both of their work.\nDespite the small selection of instruments on the album,\nvariety abounds. From rhythmic bassy rumbles (courtesy of\nVainio) to ambient synths via metallic scrapings and screaming guitars, Monstrance is one of the most richly diverse and\nsatisfyingly eerie musical journeys of recent times.\n2. Fire!\nWithout Noticing\nSwedish noisy jazz trio Fire! followed February\u02bcs orchestral\nalbum Exit, with Without Noticing, an album that really emulates the live experience. As well as being bookended by\nnoisy sketches, \u02bbAt Least On Your Door\u02bc starts with a classic\nnoisy sax jam before dropping into an irresistably catchy\nbassline augmented by Mats Gustafsson\u02bcs always enthralling saxophone heroics. That pretty much sums up what is\nan insanely catchy yet agressively hard hitting album.\n3. Abul Mogard\nDrifted Heaven\nAbul Mogard, a retired Serbian factory worker, maintains\nthe cathartic, hauntingly beautiful industrial tones of previous works, like a modernist Steve Roach. Where it has\nchanged, is that it sounds more like many of his VCO coun-terparts, with a more classically electronic sound in places\nand more open suggestions of melody. The result is a more\ninstantly rewarding listen, being dipped for the length of the\nalbum in swathes of Mogard\u02bcs ethereal electronics.\n4. Nicholas Bullen\nComponent Fixations\nFor the most part, I\u02bcve tried to avoid albums I\u02bcve covered\nbefore, but I really felt I did the Napalm Death founder\na slight disservice last time round. Like Japanese noise artist\nAube, Bullen uses a single sound source - his garden, yet the\nresults approavh more closely the abstract electronic experimentation of Eleh, where common garden sounds like running\nwater combine with more processed counterparts to make a\ncomplex, serrated, intimidatingly claustrophobic experience.\n5. Slow Walkers\nSlow Walkers\nSlow Walkers is a collaboration between Lawrence\nEnglish and Grouper. The result contains the brilliance\nyou\u02bcd expect from two cornerstrones of the ambient genre.\nGrouper\u02bcs warmly dissonant pop-ambient and English\u02bcs\nevocatice drone based soundscapes combine to perfect\neffect in a wonderfully \ufb02owing homogenous soundscape of\nthe most sumptuous ambient you will hear this year.\n1. The World is a Beautiful Place and I am no\nLonger Afraid to Die\nWhenever, If Ever\nI am obsessed with this album. The range of moods and styles is\ncaptivating, and how it \ufb01ts together so coherently is breathtak-ing. Mixing midwest emo with post-rock, indie pop and math\nrock, this album is everything I\u02bcve ever wanted (in an album).\nIt\u02bcs exciting, it develops with every listen, it\u02bcs bursting with emo-tion, it namechecks Rival Schools, I mean, what else do you\nwant?\n2. Old Gray\nAn Autobiography\nI imagine most of you are looking for an album chock full of\ntwinkly guitar, frenzied crescendos and intense screaming.\nThis is what you\u02bcre looking for. An Autobiography is a fantastic blend of screamo, midwest emo and post-rock. From\nthe opening track through to the last it is just fantastic. It\u02bcs\nheavy, but it\u02bcs also really beautiful. It will blow your socks\noff and bring you to the point of tears simultaneously, and\nthat is the dream, so, yeah.\n3. The National \u2013 Trouble Will Find Me ll\nTrouble Will Find Me\nThe National have long been one of my favourite bands,\nand this might be their best yet. \u02bbI Need My Girl\u02bc is de\ufb01nitely my song of the year. A lilting guitar line backs a beautiful vocal performance\u2026 and it just blows me away every\ntime. To be honest, it\u02bcs all great. The tightest rhythm section\nin indie rock continue to impress good, the guitar lines are\nbrilliant and Matt Berninger\u02bcs baritone is at its silky best.\nTop stuff.\n4. Pity Sex\nFeast Of Love\nThis shoegaze / emo hybrid has had me hooked since my\n\ufb01rst listen. Hiding amongst layers fuzz are some really\ncatchy hooks, a driving rhythm section and some top notch\nalt rock tracks. There are tracks about masturbation and\nloneliness, but for the most part it\u02bcs about bad casual sex.\nHappily, it\u02bcs much closer to self-deprecating humour than depressing self-analysis. If you want to immerse yourself in fuzz\nand unhappiness, then this is the best 2013 had to offer!\n5. Iceage\nYou\u02bcre Nothing\nIceage play visceral post-punk. Full of snarling vocals and\ndissonant instrumentation, their sounds owes more to The Fall\nand Wire than the more obvious touchstones of Joy Division\nor Gang of Four. From the accelerating madness of \u02bbCoalition\u02bc to the pure manic brilliance of \u02bbWounded Hearts\u02bc, this is\none to get you on the dance\ufb02oor, and then embarrass yourself\nbadly by throwing yourself around without any semblance of\nstyle. This is a spectacular listen, if a slightly exhausting one.\n\n"

    "content": "33\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 DEC\nFILM\nkid: a 2013 round-up\nJennifer Lawrence\nFor starters, she won an Oscar earlier\nthis year, and it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s becoming one of the most talked about and\nloved young actresses around. She\u2019s\nthe cool, new, hip young woman to\nlike, which explains why so many returned for the sequel of The Hunger\nGames. Catching Fire is doing great\nbusiness, with everyone fully invested in the revolution that is brewing\nagainst the Capitol, who quite frankly\ndeserve everything coming their way.\nIndependent films\nOnce again, films grabbing the important awards buzz are the more\nmodestly financed (but by no means\nless advertised) films that are winning glowing reviews from critics and\ncinema-goers alike. Steve McQueen\nhas already bagged numerous awards\nwith his latest slavery drama 12 Years\na Slave, which is looking to be the one\nto beat come the Oscar season, Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto\nshould be winning a handful of awards\nfor their work in the funny and touching Dallas Buyers Club, Woody Allen is on career-peak form with Blue\nJasmine featuring Cate Blanchett\u2019s\nbravura performance, whereas once\nagain the Coen brothers work their\nmagic with Inside Llewyn Davis.\nLeonardo DiCaprio\nThere is always some sort of an Oscar\nbuzz surrounding DiCaprio, who sadly hasn\u2019t currently won any. The Great\nGatsby was looking to be a juicy role\nbut the film was bumped from its\noriginal award-bait 2012 Christmas\nDay release schedule to all the way in\nMay 2013 where, to be fair, the movie\nenjoyed great box office success (al-most $350 million globally).\nHope remains however, as Martin\nScorsese\u2019s new film The Wolf of Wall\nStreet will certainly be going for that\nawards glory. This could serve as DiCaprio\u2019s fourth acting nomination. A\nfirst win? Only time will tell.\nSleeper hits\nFilms that hold steady week after week despite stiff competition can give surprising results, as demonstrated by Now You See Me, a light-hearted heist movie\nwith slick magic acts to trick the audience, that showed some mighty holding\npower in the charts. It opened modestly compared to its not-so-cheap budget,\nbut has now grossed over 350 million worldwide. Sequel? Already on the way.\nThen there\u2019s Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler, an inspirational true story about an\nAfrican-American witnessing all the important 20th Century American Civil\nRights events as he works in the White House. The American audience loved it\nfor obvious reasons, there\u2019s talk of Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey getting\nsome well-earned nominations, and it\u2019s posting some more than respectable\nnumbers elsewhere, for a current grand total of $150+ million. Probably not appropriate to expect a sequel for this one though.\nComedies\nAmongst all the summer blockbuster madness, quite a few comedy films came\nto light and enjoyed some effective counter-programming successes. We\u2019re the\nMillers turned out to be one of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s highest grossing films ($269\nmillion worldwide) even though it was facing what seemed to be an unfair fight\nagainst the eagerly anticipated Elysium and other late-summer blockbusters\nthat attempted to steal the spotlight.\nThis is the End, starring everyone you can think of in an American stoner\ncomedy movie, opened in direct competition with Man of Steel, and yet was not\ncompletely crushed by the superhero and did decent business in its complete\nrun, crossing the $100-million mark in the States alone, although results from\naround the world were a touch disappointing.\nLast but not least, Jonny Knoxville of Jackass fame decided to dress up as an\nold man and do inappropriate things in front of his grandson. With a modest\nbudget of $15 million, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa is currently the second\nbiggest money-maker of the Jackass franchise, with almost $130 million in the\nbank.\nAnimation\nFamilies still love going to the cinemas, it seems, as there was quite a number of\nanimated hits this year, regardless of actual film quality.\nPlanes, an ill-advised Disney spinoff of Pixar\u2019s Cars, was a flat, generic ride\nwith a colourful voice cast, and The Smurfs 2, which ended up being a whole\nlot worse than its precessor, both generated a respectable number of ticket sales,\nwhich means there are sequels planned for both films (oh dear God).\nTwo of this year\u2019s earlier animated releases were The Croods and Epic. The\nCroods did better business, but Epic also managed to hold its own despite Fast\n& Furious 6, The Hangover Part III and Star Trek Into Darkness trying to out-compete for the audience cash.\nAnd who can forget the little yellow\nminions of Despicable Me 2? Those\ntiny little things are so popular they\u2019re\ngetting their very own movie, set to\nbe released in 2015. Illumination Entertainment has found a gold mine\nwith this series, with Despicable Me\n2 earning $900 million+ (!) this year\nworldwide.\nLet\u2019s not forget about Pixar either,\nwho did well with their first ever pre-quel, Monsters University.\n\n"

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nC\nhristmas at Imperial as an\nundergrad quite literally\nsucks. All I can remember\nwas all my friends from\nalternative universities\nhaving a fantastic time with mulled\nwine, carols, slightly questionable\ndecisions at the Christmas dinners,\nand retiring home to make snowmen\nwith all their lovely family. Meanwhile\nI had more than \ufb01ve peices of\ncoursework on the go, numerous\ntests, and \u2018fun\u2019 end of term activities\non my course, that were hideously\nweighted so you could not pass if\nyou were slightly the worse for wear\nin the morning. Instead of acting out\nthe Christmas dream, I was struggling\nto get out of the department, at all. I\noften found myself wondering what\nhalls actually looked like at this time\nof year, or whether it was light outside\n(there\u2019s an app for that). I was at my\nmost excited on the last day of term, at\nmy joyful reunion with my bed.\nThe low point had to be fourth year.\nMy course was such that I had \ufb01nals in\nJanuary, and not mid to late January,\nbut starting on the 5th. That holiday,\nI took one day o\ufb00 for Christmas. It\nalways ba\ufb04ed me why Imperial was\nconfused about the low satisfaction\nratings. Tests on a Friday afternoon on\nthe last day of term are not exactly a\npositive in\ufb02uence on our mood levels.\nThis year, looking at it from the other\nside, the undergrads look as ill as I felt.\nI have three invigilations booked in\nthe next two weeks and still more for\nthe \ufb01rst week of January. So I\u2019m afraid\nit is not looking bright for a change in\nthe future. So for all of you who are\nsu\ufb00ering this I wanted to instil a bit\nof Christmas hope; It really does get\nbetter.\nI\u2019ve always thought I hated\nChristmas.Allthepressuretobehappy\nand thrilled about life, but actually it is\npretty great when you don\u2019t think you\nare going to fail anything if you take\nthe weekend to go shopping. Suddenly\nI was helping with a carol concert,\nputting up decorations, enjoying a\nmulled cider, and chatting about the\npossibility of snow. I have two weeks\no\ufb00! This has not happened since mock\nGCSEs over 7 years ago.\nSo my confession for this week,\nthough not as cheery as I would like\nChristmas Confessions of a GTA\nA\ns a student at Imperial,\nthe lead up to\nChristmas can seem\nlike one of the busiest\ntimes of the year, a\nfeeling compounded by the multitude\nof seasonal events that you just have\nto go to. No matter how overwhelmed\nyou\u2019re feeling, there are always some\nparties that you will just refuse to\nmiss, because everyone knows that\nreservations and propriety \ufb02y out\nthe window as soon as mulled wine\nand mistletoe are involved. Whether\nyou\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s at the\nfront line of the drama, or you just like\nwatching it unfold, Christmas parties\nare often unmissable, and a good way\nto release the stress that\u2019s gradually\nbuilt up throughout the term.\nSo we get it; no matter what else you\nshould be doing, Christmas (or other\nseasonal celebrations) parties are\nalways fun and we should make sure\nthat we \ufb01nd time to enjoy them. But\nwhat if you really need to be studying\nfor those exams, and the constant\nstudy guilt prevents you from relaxing\nproperly? I think that I solved this\nproblem, and I would encourage you\nto do the same: turn the festivities into\nstudy material.\nAre you an engineer? Use some\nof your recently-acquired skills to\nbuild something challenging. Out of\ngingerbread. Are you a physicist or\nmathematician? Conduct an analysis\nof the \ufb02ows of people around the\nmistletoe. A medic? Examine alcohol\nrelated injuries and o\ufb00er your friends\nhangover cures. Not obviously\nspecialised to the season, but you\u2019ll\nmake a lot of people happy if you do it\nwearing antlers or a Santa hat. You get\nthe idea; every subject can be adapted\nto some festive fun.\nYou\u2019re studying at Imperial because\nat some point, you decided that you\nlove your subject. It\u2019s really easy to\nlose track of that amidst all the maths\nlectures and tedious labs, so why not\nuse Christmas as an opportunity to\ntake a step back and do something\nnot directly related to your course\npurely because you enjoy it. It won\u2019t\nnecessarily get you better marks in\nthat coursework (unless someone\u2019s\ninvolved in a project investigating the\nmaterial properties of gingerbread,\nplease someone let me know if that is\nactuallyathing),orhelpyouremember\nthat equation you\u2019re inevitably going\nto forget in your upcoming exam,\nbut it might rejuvenate your passion\nfor your subject, which will help get\nyou through all those times over the\nholidays when you\u2019ll be cracking open\nyour textbooks when all your non-Imperial friends are passed out in a\nfood coma at the foot of the Christmas\ntree.\nEveryone needs a break now and\nthen, but you\u2019ll feel a bit less guilty\nabout the time o\ufb00 if you utilise it\nin a somewhat productive manner.\nAnd if, like me, you opt for a giant\ngingerbread creation, you\u2019ll \ufb01nd that\no\ufb04oading large quantities of sugar\nonto your friends does wonders for\nyour social standing.\nHow to procrastinate at Christmas\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\navey\nEditor\nWith a bit of ingenuity and a lot of \ufb02our, you could make something this delicious\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nThere will come a time when you don\u02bct have to work at Christmas\nis: if this rings a bell with you, keep\ngoing. There will be Christmases\naround the corner where you can get\ncompletely drunk at a party and hit\non someone you\u2019ll never talk to again,\nbut right now enjoy the little things\nlike half price mince pies or \ufb01nishing\nthat stupid coursework.

    "content": "31\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 DEC\nTELEVISION\n2013: A Television Odyssey\nEmily Fulham looks back at some of the TV highlights of the year\nP\nhineas and Ferb is a show\nthat\u2019s all about formulae.\nAlmost every episode of\nthe show follows a fairly\nrigid structure: it\u2019s about\ntwo pre-teen stepbrothers on their\nsummer holidays, and every day\nthey decide to do something that\u2019s\ncreatively impossible (opening a\nrestaurant, or building a city-spanning\nrollercoaster, or building a rocket), at\nwhich point their controlling teenage\nsister Candace tries to \u201cbust\u201d them\nby showing their mum the dangerous\nCartoon Corner\nPhineas and Ferb\nTom Rivlin\nNew Shows\nHannibal\nA surprise hit, HBO\u2019s Hannibal was a\nslow burner that turned out to be one\nof the best shows of the year. A lot of\ncredit goes to Mads Mikkelsen for his\n\ufb02awless performance as everyone\u2019s\nfavourite cannibal, but Hugh Dancy\nalso deserves praise in his portrayal of\nWill Graham, the unstable FBI agent\nHannibal deceives and manipulates,\nas his grasp on sanity becomes\nincreasingly tenuous. Throw in a\ngreat supporting cast, inspired guest\nstars (including Eddie Izzard as\nyou\u2019ve never seen him before) and\ncinematography that makes even\nthe most brutal murder look oddly\nbeautiful, and you\u2019ve got an intriguing\npremise for a show which is far more\nthan your standard crime procedural.\nSleepy Hollow\nAnother surprising success, Sleepy\nHollow combined the unlikely partners of apocalyptic horror and American history with unforeseen success.\nIchabod Crane, Oxford professor and\nCivil War soldier, is transported into\nthe future thanks to a curse from the\nHeadless Horseman, where he partners up with local policewoman Abbie\nMills to solve supernatural mysteries.\nThe 21st century takes Crane some\ngetting used to, with co\ufb00ee machines\nand the concept of paying for bottled\nwater some of the biggest obstacles. A\nlikeable cast and a propensity to not\ntake itself too seriously gave Sleepy\nHollow its edge in the latest wave of\nAutumn shows imported from the US.\nthings they\u2019ve been doing. Just before\nshe can show Mom, the amazing\ncreation of the boys is cleaned up\nthanks to the antics of their pet\nplatypus, Perry, who is actually a\nsecret agent battling his nemesis Dr.\nDoofenshmirtz on a daily basis (I\nam not making a single word of this\nup), leaving Mom to think Candace\nis crazy. At some point there\u2019s also a\nmusical number, because why not?\nBesides the catchy tunes and\ncreative high concept wacky fun,\nthe real appeal of the show is in\nhow it plays with the formulae it\ncreates for itself. The \ufb01rst episode is\nthe archetypal one \u2013 every point in\nthe checklist is ticked in a rote way\n\u2013 but after that it gets interesting.\nThe characters become aware of the\nroutine, and some try to actively \ufb01ght\nit, while others learn to live with it.\nFor example, in one episode, Candace\ntries to keep staring at the Thing the\nboys make for the whole day. (It then\nturns invisible as soon as she turns her\nhead.) In another, Doofenshmirtz has\na waiting room for Perry the Platypus\nto wait in while he \ufb01nishes his latest\nevil contraption (which, as a group,\nhe calls his \u201c-inators\u201d), because, of\ncourse, Perry can\u2019t foil his evil scheme\nuntil he\u2019s \ufb01nished preparing it.\nIt extends beyond main story\nbeats, though. There\u2019s an assortment\nof catchphrases, running gags,\nrecurring characters, and settings\nthat get introduced, built up, and\nthen deconstructed in various\namusing ways. In early episodes,\nDoofenshmirtz talked about various\ntragic backstories he had which made\nhim want to do his various schemes\n(\u201cIt all began on the day of my actual\nbirth. Both of my parents failed to\nshow up.\u201d), but eventually it devolves\ninto \u201cwhen I was a boy my mother\nwould never let me swim in public\npools\u2026 What? That\u2019s it! You know, not\nevery back story has to have some big,\nin-depth spiel.\u201d\nThe creators have shown a very\nkeen understanding of TV show\ntropes and formulae, and of how to\nplay with them, but they are just plain\nfunny. Most of the best gags come\nfrom Doofenshmirtz (who is voiced\nby one of the creators), but everyone\ngets great lines at some points.\nFor most of this review I\u2019ve just\nbeen going \u201coh and that time where\nthat thing happened was so funny!\u201d\nbut that\u2019s kind of how it is. The\ncharacters aren\u2019t especially dynamic\nor remarkable, and, for the most part,\nthey don\u2019t get much room to grow.\nThe plots are deliberately repetitive\n(with some notable exceptions). The\nmain thing the show has going for it is\nthat it just has really solid, clever, and\nfunny dialogue \u2013 it\u2019s just a collection\nof really great gags.\nAt over 200 episodes, it\u2019s Disney\nChannel\u2019s longest running show,\nsurviving long past the channel\u2019s\nmove away from animation towards\nlame sitcoms, purely on the basis of it\nbeing just that good; de\ufb01nitely worth\nchecking out.\nFinales\nBreaking Bad\nAfter \ufb01ve glorious series, we \ufb01nally\nbade farewell to Walter White, the\nmeth dealer who made students\neverywhere look at their Chemistry\nteachers with new-found respect.\nThe \ufb01nal series started o\ufb00 with a bang\n(literally), and rarely let up the pace.\nWith more plot twists and shocking\nmoments than you can shake a stick\nat, Breaking Bad kept audiences on\nthe edge of their seats until the very\nlast episode. With actors Bryan Paul\nand Aaron Paul consistently outstanding in every scene, the \ufb01nal stage in\nWalter\u2019s metamorphosis from unassuming high school teacher to mastermind drug lord cemented the show\u2019s\nstatus as one of the greatest of all time.\nThe IT Crowd\nThe escapades of Roy, Maurice and\nJen came to an end as one of Britain\u2019s\nbest comedies in recent years gracefully bowed out in September. And\ngraceful it was \u2013 with each of the actors going on to bigger things (Chris\nO\u2019Dowd now a familiar face in Hollywood blockbusters and Richard\nAyoade a well-received director in his\nown right), The IT Crowd chose to go\nout on a high. With nods to some of\nthe highlights of previous series and\nseveral fan-favourite cameos, the \ufb01nal episode was a crowd-pleaser all\nround. Undoubtedly, the sitcom will\nbe sorely missed, and we\u2019ll have to\nwait until next year for Channel 4\u2019s\nother comedy jewel, Peep Show, to return to help ease the pain.\n2014\nPreviews\nGame of Thrones\nGame of Thrones tested its reputation\nfor killing o\ufb00 characters to the max in\nthe \u2018Red Wedding\u2019 of the penultimate\nepisode of its third series. Those who\nknew what was coming watched between their \ufb01ngers as (spoiler alert)\nthe Starks proved themselves to be the\nmost ill-fated family in the whole of\nWesteros. The fourth series, starting\nin Spring, will continue to deal with\nthe aftermath of the event, as well as\nbuilding up to the series\u2019 next wedding\nbetween the hateful King Jo\ufb00rey and\nMargaery Tyrell.\nGirls\nThe much-talked about show has divided opinions, with loyal fans and\nskeptics abound. Hannah Horvath\nand crew return in January; while details of any storylines are being kept\ntightly under wraps, it\u2019s a safe assumption that there\u2019ll be plenty more nu-dity, painfully awkward sex scenes and\ninteresting hairdos.\nDoctor Who\nOK, it might not be on until August,\nbut the news that Peter Capaldi has\nbeen chosen as the 12th Doctor has already got everyone hyped up. Fans of\nThe Thick of It will be intrigued to see\nif he can shake o\ufb00 his foul-mouthed\npersona to play the family favourite\nDoctor.\nHBO\nFOX\nAMC\nCHANNEL 4\n\n"

    "content": "35\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 DEC\nFILM\nkid: a 2013 round-up\nOld people\nDie Hard came back for yet another addition to its struggling franchise, with the 58-year-old Bruce Willis teaming up with\nJai Courtney acting as John McClane\u2019s tough CIA agent son (he had a son?!) as they cause chaos in Russia. The \u201cold man\u201d\njokes certainly got old and tiresome quickly as that was the only kind of dry humour the script had to offer in the midst\nof highly unsatisfying action sequences.\nBut nothing could have been clunkier and more repetitive than Red 2, even with the kind of talent involved. Dame Helen\nMirren acting as a bad-ass spy never got the screentime that she deserved, and the \u201cbanter\u201d hinging on Bruce Willis looking careless, laid back and cool was downright embarrassing. Not even the newest additions to the cast, Anthony Hopkins\n(old), Catherine Zeta-Jones (getting there), and Byung-hun Lee (also getting there) could add something genuinely fun to\nthe film.\nAnd perhaps 2013 was the year in which has-been tough guys all collectively decided to stage simultaneous comebacks.\nIt all started with Sylvester Stallone beating everyone to a pulp in Bullet to the Head, a film that was both badly received\nand bombed at the box office.\nThen it was Arnie Schwarzenegger\u2019s turn to produce something mediocre, which he did, with The Last Stand, in which\nwe found Forest Whitaker where he should never have been.\nAs if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Stallone and Schwarzenegger teamed up for Escape Plan, where they found themselves\nimprisoned in the world\u2019s most secure prison by Jesus Christ Jim Caviezel.\nClearly these guys need the money have the energy, passion and, most importantly, stamina to handle such physical\nroles, which is probably why The Expendables 3 is set to be released in 2014 with an even bigger cast.\nBox office losers\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect that every movie will turn a profit and become a runaway hit. For every hit there\u2019s a miss, and this\nyear quite a few of those misses managed to haemorrhage money for their studios.\nJack the Giant Slayer did debut at the top of the United States box office but opening to a feeble $27-million three-day\nweekend gross. Its budget? $195 million. Without a bankable star (Nicholas Hoult is not yet someone whose name alone\ncan attract a large group to cinemas) and without an appealing idea that clearly aimed at a broad demographic (word is,\nthe director\u2019s darker, adult-themed vision clashed with the studio who wanted a family-friendly action-adventure film), no\none was all that keen on Jack and his dangerous quest to save a princess he has a crush on.\nDisney has reportedly broken its studio record with $4 billion at the global box office. Perhaps that can be used to plug\nthe gigantic hole that was made when Gore Verbinski\u2019s hugely expensive western The Lone Ranger flopped hard. The film\nalone created a loss of $160-190 million, but given the $4-billion intake, are we really feeling sorry for them? The failure\nmust come as a blow, however, to the usually hit-making producer Jerry Bruckheimer and his regular collaborating director Verbinski. They tried blaming the critics for the diappointing financial performance, which of course is ludicrous, since\ncritics more often than not have very little sway over what the public chooses to watch (as evidently proved by the ever-so\npopular Transformers franchise).\nNow Sam Raimi\u2019s Oz the Great and Powerful wasn\u2019t as big a flop as the two films already mentioned, but given the extremely high production cost, the cast, as well as the big hype involved in trying to become Disney\u2019s next early-year March\nhit (much like 2010\u2019s Alice in Wonderland), it should have performed much, much better. A sequel is in the works, thanks\nto a good push from the international contribution, but it will be a struggle to keep this one alive for long.\nScience-fiction\nIt\u2019s a genre that is tough to crack, especially if working with original material\nthat doesn\u2019t have an established fanbase, and this year was no exception when\nit came to expensively-shot movies not securing a big-enough audience to truly\nconsider itself a massive success.\nCloud Atlas is one that no one saw but everyone should see, Oblivion un-derperformed despite carrying the name Tom Cruise as its leading man, Guillermo del Toro\u2019s robots vs. monsters movie Pacific Rim wasn\u2019t as explosive as its\nbombastic action scenes, South African director Neill Blomkamp\u2019s sophomore\ndirectorial feature Elysium was muddled and received mixed reviews and failed\nto become a big hit, Ender\u2019s Game hardly turned into the worldwide motion\npicture event it promised to be, with R.I.P.D. and After Earth severely flopping,\nas very few people had nice words to say about either of those films.\nThe White House\nTerrorists just can\u2019t help themselves when it comes to attacking the most iconic\nbuilding in the United States. The beloved White House that houses the President was attacked not once, but twice in 2013, and each time America was lucky\nto have a lone-wolf hero working his butt off trying to first save the President,\nbut then the world.\nOlympus Has Fallen saw Gerard Butler, the retired Secret Service agent being the last hope for America as terrorists tortured the highest ranking government officials for nuclear codes.\nWhite House Down had Channing Tatum protect Jamie Foxx the President as\nthey humourously banter with one another in the direst of circumstance while\neveryone looks on in disbelief.\nHasn\u2019t the White House suffered, seen, and been through enough by now?\n\n"

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nFILM Editor: John Park\n\ufb01lm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHere\u2019s looking at you,\nSandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy\nHot off her Oscar-nominated comedic turn (comedy not something that is generally recognised by awards ceremonies \u2013 she was really that good) in Bridesmaids, McCarthy continued her successful streak in the film industry with her\nbox-office number one financial hit, Identity Thief. The critics hated it, with\none rather unpleasant review comparing McCarthy to a hippo, but the audience clearly loved it, grossing well over its budget internationally, with a sequel\nalready in the works.\nTeaming up with Bullock, the pair starred in The Heat, a female-driven buddy\ncop comedy that went above and beyond everyone\u2019s expectations by actually\nbeing very, very funny. With Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids, McCarthy\nscored yet another solid comedy role, this time more foul-mouthed than ever,\nwith Bullock enjoying quite a considerable paycheck ($10 million) compared to\nher more modestly paid co-star ($2.5 million).\nOscar buzz is also building for Bullock, who genuinely looked to be giving it\nher all in Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s terrifyingly intense space drama, Gravity. The critics\nloved it, and the world can\u2019t seem to be getting enough of it. Already $600 million dollars in the bag, the sales keep coming in strong, and is a hotly anticipated\nOscar contender this year.\nIt\u02bcs been a good year for...\nFlying high...defying gravity\nThe 6th installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, the aptly named Fast &\nFurious 6 showed no signs of slowing\ndown by pulling out all the stops. The\nRock? Check. Vin Diesel? Check. Fancy cars? Of course. Women? Oh yes.\nA tank? Why not. The sillier it gets\n(who can forget THAT airport runway scene?), the more money it makes\nit seems, as it went on to become the\nbiggest money-maker of the series,\neven taking inflation into account.\nTom Hanks\nHis films both opened and closed the\nLondon Film Festival (Captain Phillips opening, Saving Mr Banks clos-ing), and they have both been incredibly well received. There\u2019s even talk of\nhim scoring a double nomination (for\nboth best leading and supporting ac-tor), an achievement only a handful of\nthespians have managed in the past.\nSuperheroes who aren\u2019t Wolverine\nMarvel\u2019s world cinema domination of course continued in 2013, with both their\nfilms benefiting greatly from the phenomenal success of last year\u2019s Avengers\nAssemble.\nGeared up as a direct sequel to the events of Avengers Assemble, Iron Man 3\nis currently the highest grossing film of 2013, and became a billionaire globally.\nThor: The Dark World wasn\u2019t quite as huge, and although it won\u2019t come close to\nhitting that billion point, it\u2019s already reached half of that, which is still an impressive feat, done within a month of its release.\nDC has also been making a bold comeback thanks to Christopher Nolan\u2019s\ninput into the Batman saga, and they rightly paraded his name around every\nadvert there was for their Superman reboot, titled Man of Steel, with relative\nnewcomer Henry Cavill taking over the coveted role. It made enough money to\nwarrant a sequel, although both fans and critics alike were somewhat let down\nby Superman\u2019s complete disregard for the concept of collateral damage in his\nfinal action sequence.\nLuke Evans\nThe Welsh actor has been busy of late,\nstarring in Fast & Furious 6, scoring a\nsignificantly sized role in the remaining Hobbit films, whilst also landing\niconic roles of both Dracula and The\nCrow in their newly rebooted films\n(Dracula Untold and The Crow re-spectively). How they will turn out no\none knows for sure, but by this time\nnext year he could be the big name on\nHollywood campus.\nJames Wan and low-budget hororr films\nSpending very little (relatively) then recuperating a final total that is considerably more is a tactic that has served director Wan well this year, with both of his\nhorror hits, The Conjuring and Insidious Chapter 2, which were made with\nsmall budgets ($20 million, $5 million respectively), earned a cool combined\ntotal of $460 million+ internationally.\nSimilar success was enjoyed by The Purge (budget: $3 million, earnings: almost $90 million), a simple, yet interesting and thought-provoking idea, well\nexecuted and incredibly well advertised during a box office period where not\nmany great new releases were out to entertain and grab the audience\u2019s attention.\n\n"

Italy\nmightotherwiseremainadisappointment\nfor me. It should be a country of great\nculture, of immense value and potential,\na nation that could and should help\nEurope and the world. Alas, it is shackled\nby ineffective and corrupt leaders.\nRamblings on Personal Legend\nP\naul Coelho\u2019s best-selling\nnovel, The Alchemist,\nreminds us to be true\nto ourselves and to seek\nout our \u2018personal legend\u2019.\nA king advises Santiago, the chief\nprotagonist, that, \u201cwhen you really\nwant something to happen, the\nwhole universe conspires so that your\nwish comes true.\u201d. This in itself is an\nuplifting prospect. In spite of this\nthe various realities and su\ufb00erings\nhappening around the world on a daily\nbasis demonstrate that this is, all too\noften, far from the truth. A line that\nI read in Albert Camus\u2019 The Plague\nemboldened this for me. \u201cTo the day\nI die I shall refuse to love this creation\nin which children are tortured.\u201d The\nso-called \u2018lost generation\u2019 of Syrian\nchildren serves as a case in point. How\ncan an individual best serve humanity\nin the modern age while staying true\nto oneself?\nOne might argue that the 21st century is one of pragmatism, that with a\ngrowing population and consumption\nof both our land and resources, administering to \u2018the self\u2019 is fundamentally unjust. The concept of pilgrimage\nserves as a suitable allegory. People\nhave travelled for centuries, yearning\nto absorb and utilise as much of our\nnatural world as possible by searching for inner unity and insight. The\nmodern irony is that, when travelling,\nwe actively tarnish the world around\nus (through travel on planes, trains\netc.). Even the pursuit of knowledge\nvia modern channels impinges on the\nplanet (laptops, tablets etc. require\nboth plastic and rare earth metals).\nThis might be perceived to be a\nnegative take on things. The pursuit of\nknowledge has yielded dividends for\nhumanity as a whole. Particle physics\ndemonstrates that, as we continue to\nstrip layers from the fabric of the uni-verse, there will always be more surprises awaiting us. Modern medicine\nhas extended our life span. Freedom\nof information undermines inequality.\nThese revelations share the common\nthread of our humanity in an imperfect world. To my mind Coelho hit the\nnail on the head in a 2005 New York\nTimes interview, \u201cI believe enlightenment or revelation comes in daily life.\nI look for joy, the peace of action. You\nneed action.\u201d\nIn brief, it could be argued that, in\nsearching for our personal legend\nin the 21st century, we a\ufb00ect (for\nbetter or worse) humanity\u2019s collective\nlegend. We cannot turn back. Our\nsphere of existence is what it is. Each\none of us will do as we always have and\nadminister to ourselves. Who knows?\nThe world may change for the better\nby doing so.\nO\nn the 27th of\nNovember 2013\nat 17:43 Silvio\nBerlusconi was\nexpelled from the\nSenate of the Italian Republic; he no\nlonger represents anyone but himself.\nHe cannot abuse his parliamentary\nseat anymore to avoid his legal\ntroubles. He cannot run for o\ufb03ce\nand may even be tried for his various\ncrimes.\nIn a way, if you\u2019ll forgive me a clich\u00e9,\nit\u2019s the end of an era. Berlusconi has\nwarped and corrupted Italian politics\nby neglecting the country to solve\nhis personal issues. He has created a\nbarbarouscultureofillegality.Theright\nhas become a joke (divided between\nxenophobes and his spineless serfs).\nThe left has either been entrenched\nin its own pseudo-intellectualism or\ntoo complacent to \ufb01ght him properly.\nFurthermore, another party has risen\nas the direct expression of Berlusconi\u2019s\nmessage of base populism, appeal to\nthe masses and divinely inspired self-righteousness.\nWith his political demise, however,\nwe can, perhaps, hope to move on.\nMaybe we\u2019ll get a political party worthy of de\ufb01nition instead of the bands\nof conniving speculators that mostly\nsit in parliament. Maybe we can start\ndiscussing the economy, investment\nin education and research and the role\nof Europe without having to hold long\ndiscussions regarding Berlusconi\u2019s tri-als. Maybe we can extirpate the mentality of illegality that he has protected\nand fostered. I, for one, am not going\nto hold my breath.\nI\u2019ve been awaiting this moment\nfor many years, and I don\u2019t mean my\nadult life. As a child I remember being\nlectured on how Berlusconi was a\ncrook and a cheater. Luckily, at that\ntime, his crimes \u2018merely\u2019 consisted\nof tax evasion, fraud, Ma\ufb01a deals\nand conspiracy against the state, so\nI was spared from having to learn\nabout prostitution rings. Despite this,\nBerlusconi has always been the central\nplayer of Italian politics as long as I\u2019ve\nbeen able to rudimentarily understand\nit (if anyone can claim to). You might\ninfer that the end of his reign should\nbe a signi\ufb01cant event.\nDespite the momentousness of\nwhat has happened I cannot cheer.\nBerlusconi has made the country\npoorer, both in wealth and spirit. The\ne\ufb00ects of these twenty years will long\noutlast him. Apart from running the\neconomy into the ground and making\nmany useless or deleterious reforms,\nhe has made my country the subject\nof jokes and ridicule. He has forced\nme, along with thousands of my\ncompatriots, to leave Italy, in order\nto \ufb01nd proper studying opportunities\n(let alone work). He has prolonged the\nculture of chauvinism, homophobia\nand intolerance that other, better\nnations have already begun to cast\no\ufb00. Only Mussolini has done a worse\nSilvio Berlusconi: Down and Out\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\njob at running Italy and he had to ally\nwith the Nazis to accomplish that.\nThis is not something that can be\nsolved overnight. People vote for\nhim in droves because he has an iron\ngrip on the minds of many. He has\ninculcated a mentality of nepotism\nand corruption in Italy that has taken\nroot to unprecedented levels. There\nhave been corrupt people in Italy\nbefore (including corrupt people in\ncharge) but none of them have been\nso successful at it.

    "content": "FRIDAY 06 DEC\n16\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRory Fenton\nUsman S.\nComment Writer\nComment Writer\nDebate: Should gender\nsegregated seating be\nallowed in universities?\nYES NO\nY\nes, student societies should be\nallowed to have events where\nmen and women who wish to be\nseated separately have the option\nof that accommodation. When\nit comes to an individual\u2019s beliefs, views and\nchoices (which, by the way, are at the very heart\nof human rights and not merely a sidenote),\nthe ethical standpoint must be to respect that\nindividual\u2019s autonomy if it is within our capacity\nto do so. There needs to be watertight reasoning\nfor the beliefs in the column opposite to come\nbefore the beliefs of the audience of an event\nand their student society.\nTime now for the inappropriate and, frankly,\ndisrespectful comparisons between separate\nseating arrangements and Apartheid, US pre-civil rights, and even Nazi Germany (honestly,\nI\u2019ve seen this last analogy with my own eyes).\nIn this shadow, it is unsurprising that the word\n\u2018segregation\u2019 carries a lot of emotional baggage,\nbut the di\ufb00erences could not be more signi\ufb01cant.\nRacial supremacism in all its forms is a stain\non humanity, a hatred fuelled by the desire to\ndominate the other. What we are talking about\nhere is a choice made by both males and females,\nit is not about discrimination towards one or the\nother as it is so often made out to be.\nWhich brings us to the elephant in the room. The\ntrue problem, and the reason why this altogether\nharmless issue receives so much undue\nattention, is because of the false conception that\ngender segregation by some conservative groups\nfollows the same model as the supremacism\noutlined above. Indeed, my respected opponent\nhimself has previously written that it \u201cstems\nfrom ideologies that view women as very much\ninferior to men\u201d. Whether he still believes this\nor not, I don\u2019t know, but it could not be further\nfrom the truth. In conservative religious groups,\nmaintaining a respectful distance between the\ngenders is important \u2013 as with, for example,\nrespect for the elderly, or compassion for the\nyoung \u2013 in preserving the moral fabric of\nsociety. Why should it be assumed that the\ncultural narrative in the column opposite under\nthe guise of \u201cfair access\u201d is superior? Just as the\nright to sit beside one\u2019s male or female friend\nis being championed, so must we protect the\nrights of those who choose to sit apart.\nThe Universities UK conclusion on the matter\n(as published this November as part of guidance\nto student unions regarding external speakers),\nthat the Equality Act 2010 does not object\nto separate seating by gender (a separation\nthat happens all around us, from changing\nrooms to hospitals) in the absence of less\nfavourable treatment, is a reasoned one. It\ndevelops further and becomes more interesting,\ndiscussing the question mark over the \u2018right\u2019\nto a third, unsegregated area, in light of\nresponsibility towards divergent views. It seems\nto me, however, that we cannot progress in our\ndiscourse until we \ufb01rst accept that forcing men\nand women to sit together should they not wish\nto do so is an infringement on their autonomy.\nWe cannot progress until we accept that this is\nnot about hierarchy or oppression, and \u2013 just\nperhaps \u2013 it might be worth asking both the\nfemales and the males who subscribe to this\nposition why it is they do so.\nTo close, I would say that there is room for\nfurther mature and academic discussion\non the subject, but we must be ever wary\nof delegitimising beliefs which we may not\nunderstand, of sensationalism creeping into the\ndiscourse, and of views tainted by baseless or\nfundamentally misconstrued assumptions.\nI\nt is astounding how quickly we forget or\nwilfully ignore that human rights are there\nto protect people \u2013 not beliefs. Worryingly,\nwe increasingly see this confused notion\nof rights being applied on UK campuses.\nWhether it\u2019s student groups intimidated\nfor \u201cblasphemy\u201d, as at LSE and Reading, or\nreligious societies refusing unmarried women\npermission to speak, as at Bristol, this trumping\nof individual rights by the supposed rights of\n\u201cbeliefs\u201d is increasingly common.\nThe recent guidance from Universities UK was\nby-and-large what you would expect; how to\nhandle far-right speakers, what kind of speech\nmight fall foul of hate-speech laws and what\ngroups are banned under anti-terror legislation.\nBut nestled in the report was a bizarre and\nbackward recommendation; universities should\nbe willing to enforce sex segregation between\nmale and female audience members if a speaker\nrequests it.\nThe report\u2019s peculiar logic ran as follows:\nspeakers have the right to free speech but if their\ndemands for sex segregation are not met they\nwill refuse to speak. Therefore to not enforce sex\nsegregation is to deny the speakers\u2019 freedom of\nspeech. The report is careful only to endorse the\n\u2018nice\u2019 kind of segregation with men and women\nsplit on the left and right hand sides of a lecture\ntheatre rather than front and back, the logic here\nbeing that men and women are being treated\n\u2018equally separately\u2019, whatever that means.\nThis logic has echoes of the old racially\nsegregated Deep South of the United States;\nseparate but equal. To argue that segregation\nis not inherently unequal is to fail to see just\nwhy men and women are being kept apart in\nthe \ufb01rst place; this drive for segregation stems\nfrom ideologies that view women as very much\ninferior to men. To allow these ideologies\npower in UK universities is to betray hard-won\nindividual rights and the principle that in public\nspaces all must be treated equally. Separate is\nnever equal.\nThe Universities UK report treats the ideology\ndriving the segregation as if it were something\ninherent to the speaker that he (and it will\nalways be he) can\u2019t help, as if requiring him to\nspeak to a mixed sex room would be like asking\nhim to levitate. The reality is that ideologies are\nchosen and speakers alone are responsible for\nthem, not their audience.\nMany religious student societies will hold their\nown events, such as collective worship, at which\nstudents will choose to separate themselves by\nsex in accordance with their beliefs. Insofar\nas this is voluntary, this is acceptable. What\nUniversities UK have endorsed, however, is\nenforced segregation, with students told where\nto sit, according to their sex, or they can leave.\nThe report then goes on to consider having a\nthird, mixed sex section of the audience as well\nas a male and a female section. Incredibly, this\napparent compromise is then rejected by the\nreport, which warns that to insist on a third\nmixed sex section may still be infringing on\nthe rights of the speaker to have a segregated\naudience. The report goes as far as to say that\nnon-religious beliefs, such as feminism, should\ntake second place to \u201csincerely held\u201d religious\nbeliefs. That\u2019s right; the mere fact that they are\nreligious makes some beliefs more important\nthan others because, of course, Feminist can\u2019t be\nsincere in their beliefs.\nThe Universities UK report focuses on sex\nbecause it\u2019s an issue that has come up before but\nthere is no reason for its logic to stop there. If a\nracist is invited to speak \u2013 should he not have\nthe audience forcibly segregated into whites\nand non-whites? What if his beliefs are really\n\u201csincerely held\u201d? Could the EDL insist on all\nMuslim students sitting separately? Of course\nUniversities UK would never support this.\nIn advocating for enforced sex segregation\nthey are cowardly capitulating to religious\nextremists in a way they surely never would\nto political extremists. In bending to these\nextremists, universities betray the moderate\nmajority in religious groups who do not wish\nto see segregation or, at least, would not want it\nto be forced on others. Men and women should\nsit where they wish. Universities have a duty to\nprotect the rights of their students, they do not\nhave a duty to protect their beliefs.\n\u201cThe true problem,\nand the reason why this\naltogether harmless issue\nreceives so much undue\nattention, is because of\nthe false conception that\ngender segregation by\nsome conservative groups\nfollows the same model as\nthe supremacism outlined\nabove.\n\u201d\n\u201cUniversities have a\nduty to protect the rights of\ntheir students, they do not\nhave a duty to protect their\nbeliefs.\n\u201d\n\n"

With one week left\nuntil the end of the\nCollege term, the Felix\nteam is happy to present you one \ufb01nal issue\nbefore we take a break over the Christmas\nholidays!\nBut never fear, because although we might\nnot be in print for the next few weeks, we\u2019ll\nstill be fairly active online, when not sco\ufb03ng\nmince pies or drinking some of Tessa\u2019s lovely\ngingerbread vodka (it really is nice).\nNow you may not celebrate Christmas,\nbut there\u2019s one gift that we all receive from\nour belevolent masters at College, and that\nis a novely break far away from campus (well\nfor most people). Think not of coursework,\nrevision or exams while you frolick around\nin the snow outside (during your 20 minute\nrevision break) or while you set up yet another\nepisode of Archer on NetFlix.\nAs you prepare to come back next term and\nface whatever comes next Felix hopes that you\nrembember that you\u2019re at least 1/3 through\nthe year now, so things can only get better!\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to see some snow,\nsend some tweets to @felixImperial and we\u2019ll\nbe sure to give you some retweet love! Maybe\nwe\u2019ll even be able to beat the BBC\u2019s insipid\nsnow coverage (no pun observed).\nFor those of you who have revision over\nthe festive period, don\u2019t forget to take a break\nevery now and then, lest your energy stores\ndry up and you involuntarily collapse in\nfront of a day long special edition of the Paul\nO\u2019Grady Show. Trust us, there are far better\nthings!\nFelix hopes you have a wonderful winter\nholiday and a fantastic new year :)\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nLetters\nStudent Protests in Ukraine\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nT\nhe dramatic events in Ukraine in\nrecent weeks have again brought\nthe country into the headlines. The\nmainly student protests in Kiev\nare about reneged promises over\nfurther integration with the EU.\nBefore we come to the table with our\npersonal prejudices and biases over the EU\n(and both UKIP and the idiotic liberal reaction\nto UKIP suggest we have many) we need to\nremember Edward Said\u2019s warning that very\nfew political principles survive translation,\ninserted, as they are, into a new set of power\nrelations. The \ufb01rst directly relevant point here\nis that Ukraine is the world\u2019s third largest\nexporter of grain. Certainly the EU protects\nits farmers (and as a leftist I should like to\npoint out the cost to third world farmers that\nthis protectionist policy has) and Ukraine\nhas much to gain from joining the EU.\nHowever, as the continuing economic crises\nin Greece, Spain etc. show, the integration\nof a notoriously fragile economy into the EU\nmay well be tantamount to handing the keys\nover to Germany.\nEU aside, there is the ever perennial Big\nBrother to the East. Putin clearly doesn\u2019t want\nUkraine to integrate more with the EU, and\nthe oil debacles in 2006 and 2009 show Putin\nisn\u2019t scared of punishing sheep that stray\ntoo far from the \ufb02ock. The criminal actions\nin Chechnya are perhaps a more sinister\nexample. This brings us nicely to internal\npolitics: President Yanukovych was widely\nseen as the \u2018Russian\u2019 candidate in the 2004\n\u2018election\u2019, and indeed the base of his support\nis in the predominantly ethnically Russian\neast. Ukraine is infamous for its East/West\ndivide, with the country more pro-Soviet as\nyou head east, and these protests have once\nagain thrown this factor into relief.\nYanukovych is without doubt a dubious\ncharacter, with very serious allegations\nof corruption levelled at him, despite the\nhighfalutin rhetoric. Then there was the\nblatant electoral fraud in 2004 which led to\nthe Orange Revolution. The revolution was\nperhaps more of the type we physicists are\nused to dealing with as Yanukovych soon\nsaw himself back in power in 2010, elected\nin perhaps the cleanest election in the post-Soviet bloc to date.\nMind you, Yulia Tymoshenko is not\nperhaps as much the fairy-tale candidate\nthat Guardian readers would like to believe.\nPerhaps this is just prejudice, but I am not\nsure that becoming one of the richest people\nin the country during a period where GDP\nshrunk to 40% of its Soviet era economy is\nquite justi\ufb01ed by business sense and initiative.\nDespite the personal di\ufb03culties she has no\ndoubt faced since her arrest in 2001, it was the\nincompetence and in\ufb01ghting of the Orange\nrevolutionaries that brought Yanukovych\nback to power. Finally, Tymoshenko is all too\ncosy with the wrong sorts of people: note her\nmeetings with Dick Cheney and Condoleeza\nRice in 2007, or her transformation into\nRussia\u2019s preferred candidate in 2010.\nOne \ufb01nal word: democratic uprisings have\na life of their own. Slavoj \u017di\u017eek once made a\nwonderful point about how best to rewrite\nAntigone. Forget the \ufb01ghts between Creon\nand Antigone, the chorus should send both\nto the prison camps and start life in a new\ncommune.

    "content": "37\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 DEC\nGAMES\nI\nremember the turbulent release\nperiod of Pokemon Gold & Silver\nback in 2001. As a gallant eight\nyear old boy I had anticipated its\narrival in April. Unfortunately\nthe date of release coincided with the\noutbreak of \u2018Foot-&-Mouth\u2019 disease.\nAs an Irishman, ensnared by water\non all sides, the ensuing aerial trade\nembargo dashed and de\ufb02ated my\nhopes. My anticipation incrementally\nratcheted to breaking point between\nApril and October. In that interval,\ndeprived of the game, I envisaged it\nin all its glory in the classroom, in the\nplayground, at the dinner table. When\nGold \ufb01nally arrived, it was every bit as\nsatiating as I had hoped. The Legend of\nZelda: A Link Between Worlds is the\n\ufb01rst game in twelve years to emulate\nthose infantile impulses of nostalgia.\nMy own copy is lying in wait under the\nChristmas tree back home in Ireland...\nRoll on December 14th!\nIGN eloquently summed up the\nessence of the latest addition to the\nseries.\n\u201c Not only does it pay homage to\nLinking Ages Past and Present\nZelda\u2019s past glory: It reinvigorates its\nspark.\u201d\nTrailers and reviews not only led\nme to relate to the a priori form of\nprevious Zelda games but subtly\nhinted at a new and unprecedented\ndynamism. Its crux is said to lie in\na multi-tiered, challenging puzzle\nplatform, bolstered by colour coding\nand a retro Gameboyesque top-down\n2D view. As a massive supporter\nof Nintendo, I am glad to see them\ndevelop yet another memorable\ngame that simultaneously exhibits\ntraditional traits and innovation.\nIf you are a true Zelda veteran\nyou will immediately draw parallels\nbetween A Link Between Worlds and\nA Link to the Past, released on the\nSNES back in the 1990s. The Hyrule\nmap shows many similarities with that\nof its predecessor. These blueprints\nare touched up by the impressive\ngraphics on the 3DS platform. Other\ncharacteristics of the game also stand\nout. Many items can be \u201crented\u201d at\na given location, ensuring that the\nplayer is well-equipped for the tasks\nat hand. This saves time searching\naround in dungeons and caves for\ntreasure chests.\nThe puzzles have been awarded an\nincreased level of intricacy. Some\nargue that A Link Between Worlds is\nthe \u201cbest puzzle game that Nintendo\nhas ever released\u201d. From trailers and\nteasers it looks like they\u2019ve drawn\nfrom P\u00f8kemon, Mario Kart and even\nMetroid Prime (if it is possible to do\nso). Whether it will surpass that of\nThe Ocarina of Time remains to be\nseen. Link\u2019s ability to morph into a\n2-Dimensional shadow gives him the\nability to merge with walls and pass\nenemies and obstacles with relative\nease. When combined with the ability\nto \u201cfast track\u201d around the map, it is said\nthat the game never fails to surprise:\nA given dungeon, plain or village will\nalways yield a welcome surprise upon\nreturn.\nIf you want to reminisce about the\ndays when your only concern was\nthe myriad of puzzles contained in\nyour SNES, Gameboy, Nintendo 64,\nto name but a few, A Link Between\nWorlds will not fail to disappoint.\nBy honouring the Nintendo pledge\nto continually surprise, it will also\nchallenge a player. To my mind this\ncan only be a good thing.\nT\nhe 3DS has sometimes\nsu\ufb00ered from its line-up,\nbut it\u2019s always had great\nZelda games. Starting with\nOcarina of Time 3D which\nwas a great remastering of the original\nwith a Master Quest. It\u2019s a seriously\ngood game which was enough for me\nto buy a 3DS. Since then there have\nbeen a great many good games for the\n3DS, but a Link Between Worlds is\ntruly a special game not only for the\n3DS but for Zelda games in general.\nA Link Between Worlds is somewhat\nof a Link to the Past remake, but its\nmore than that. Yes, the world is\npretty close to Link to the Past and\nsome elements are the same, but it is\nreally a new game in its own right. The\ngame has its own charming art style\nand Link controls more \ufb02uidly than\never before. Just walking around this\ngame is fun! The world being similar to\na Link to the Past just provides many\nmoments of nostalgia, but also causes\nmoments of surprise when things\nare di\ufb00erent. It\u2019s a modern top down\nZelda and this is a really great thing.\nOne stand out thing about this game\nis the music. It\u2019s a beautiful sounding\nscore that draws on the soundtrack\nto a Link to the Past and will make\nyou feel so entranced by the magic of\nZelda. Nintendo has had success with\nthe New Super Mario Bros games and\nI feel that this Zelda is akin to that.\nThe overall feeling of a Zelda game is\nthere but it is a di\ufb00erent experience to\nplay. Players of the Ocarina of Time\nremake will enjoy this just as much or\neven more!\nThere are some new features unique\nto this game that really make it stand\nout. The 3D provides depth and is a\nwelcome but not necessary feature.\nThis game brings back the feeling of\nthe older games in which you must\ndiscover for yourself instead of being\nled. Dungeons can now be done in\npretty much whatever order you\nwant, with the items you need not\nbeing obtained throughout the game\nbut rented from a cute, and nowhere\nnear as annoying as Tingle, character\nnamed Ravio. Shortly into the game\nyou have access to all weapons and\nthe game allows you to decide which\nitems you want to rent. At \ufb01rst I really\nliked this feature, and as I had amassed\na small fortune in Rupees decided to\ninvest in the whole lot, but then I died.\nShortly after my death Ravio\u2019s assistant\ncame and took my weapons back to\nthe shop, meaning I had to travel back\nto the shop to rent the items again.\nThis can get annoying if you \ufb01nd a\nparticular boss hard meaning you die\nand need to repeatedly go to the shop\nto rent the items you want, but on the\nwhole the extra freedom you have\nenables you to enjoy and explore the\ngame more as you follow no set path.\nThe freedom to do the dungeons in\nany order is a feature I wish to see in\nthe future in other Zelda games, but\nmaybe re\ufb01ned a little. The travelling\nrequired is made better by a handy\nWitch who will take you around on\na magic broom to various Weather\nVanes you have discovered, and is a\nbit like the teleportation from other\nZelda games. Another new feature\nis the ability to merge into walls and\nmove around. Once you get used to\nthis (I got stuck for ages because I\nforgot I could do this) it makes the\ngame so much fun. The dungeon\npuzzles are the best they have been\nin ages and this is largely due to the\nmerge ability. If I were to play a Link\nto the Past again, something this game\nreally makes you want to do, I would\nfeel sad that the merge ability is not\nthere as its already become one of my\nfavourite game mechanics, not just in\nZelda.\nA Link Between worlds isn\u2019t just a\ngreat 3DS game, it\u2019s a great game and\nshouldn\u2019t be missed by any Zelda fan.\nI strongly believe this game should\nbe up there with other Franchise\nfavourites like Ocarina of Time and\nWindwaker. The game is a refreshing\nnew Zelda experience after all the\nremakes Nintendo has done. With the\n3DS virtual console having Oracle of\nAges and Seasons you can now get the\nmajority of 2D Zelda games on the\n3DS system, and I highly recommend\nyou pick up this one!\nEoghan Totten\nComment Editor\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nZelda: a link to my past\nA bright outlook for Zelda\u02bcs future\n\n"

At the moment I\nhave an iPhone 5, and I don\u2019t see\nthe 5S as enough of an upgrade to\npay out that much money. I mean\nsure the 64-bit processor and the\nfingerprint scanner are all really\nnice, but do I want to pay upward\nof \u00a3500 for it? I\u2019d rather wait for the\n6, and get some real improvement\nfor my money. However if the\ndough was not an issue, I could\neasily imagine myself going for the\nnew iPhone.

Therefore if I had unlimited\ncash, I would totally go for one of those\ncharger mats. Basically you throw a case\naround your phone, plug in the mat, lay\nyour phone on the mat and voila it will\ncharge. This just seems the ultimate\nconvenience for me, as it doesn\u2019t look\nhalf bad and the concept is just so cool,\nhow could I not consider it?\nA hoodie with built in earphones, that\neven exists, I hear you say? Yes, and it\nhas been my dream to wear one of these\nfor a long time now. Perfectly machine\nwashable, I consider these jumpers the\nheigh of human invention.

However at \u00a360-80, the price tag is\na bit too much for what I get considering\nthat I can only use these earphones for 3\n(maybe 4) days max before they have to\nbe washed, which means that 3 days out\nof the week I have no earphones.\nRight now I have a 30Mb connection\nfor my home, which considering my\nneeds is more than enough.

Both men and\nwomen are being treated equally, as\nthey are both being segregated in the\nsame way. Concerns to accommodate\nthe wishes or beliefs of those opposed\nto segregation should not result in a\nreligious group being prevented from\nhaving a debate in accordance with its\nbelief system.\u201d\nNicola Dandridge, the UUK chief\nexecutive said \u201cThese are issues that\nare arising all the time and these are\nreally di\ufb03cult issues. What emerged\nfrom our work on this particular issue\nis that there is no clearly de\ufb01ned right\nor wrong here as to whether to allow or\noutlaw segregation. It is going to very\nmuch depend on the facts of the case.\nExternal speakers play an important\nrole in university life, not least in\nterms of encouraging students to\nthink for themselves, challenge other\npeople\u2019s views and develop their own\nopinions. Although most speakers are\nuncontroversial, some will express\ncontentious, even in\ufb02ammatory or\no\ufb00ensive views. Universities have to\nbalance their obligation to encourage\nfree speech with their duties to ensure\nthat the law is observed, the safety and\nsecurity of sta\ufb00, students and visitors\nsecured, and good campus relations\npromoted. In practice, achieving this\nbalance is not always easy.\u201d\nCampus Services:\nBring yer buckets\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nUUK\u2019s report on gender\nsegregated seating\nwas attended by over 300 students,\nmany with their families. Inspiring\nspeeches were given throughout\nthe dinner, with the guest speakers\npainting a vivid picture of the su\ufb00ering\ntaking place around the world. An\nenthralling auction soon followed,\nwhich saw beautiful canvases go for\nas much as \u00a32,000 a piece, as well\nas intricately decorated cakes being\nsold for nearly \u00a3400! All in all it was\na heart-warming sight seeing students\nuniting together under one roof for a\nnoble cause, and more than \u00a323,000\nwas raised on the night for orphans\nand needy children.\nHowever, that was not the end of\nCharity Week, as the weekend saw the\nreturn of the now UK famous Smoky\nnot Smudgy ladies pampering event.\nBigger and better, this consisted of a\nmassive bazaar, as well as two fashion\nshows. Hundreds of students from\nboth Imperial and other universities\nattended, as well as famous bloggers\nwho were invited as special guests.\nOverall, Imperial College came\nthird nationally, raising a monumental\n\u00a369,697. To put this number into\ncontext, this is nearly half the total\namount of money raised by Imperial\nstudents during the whole of last\nyear (\u00a3147,684), through RAG,\nMedics RAG and CW 2012! With\nCharity Week celebrating its 10th\nyear anniversary this year, a massive\n\u00a32,993,176 has been raised to date,\nand this \ufb01gure continues to grow\nrapidly each year.\nAs Charity Week 2013 draws to\na close, volunteers now have the\nopportunity to vote for the projects\nthat they would like the money raised\nto go towards. It is memories such\nas those formed in CW that help\nshape our students, sprouting and\ndeveloping their ambition to grow\nboth personally and on a societal level.\nThe Islamic Society commented on\nthis achievement: \u201cWe would like to\nthank everyone who made Charity\nWeek the success that it was this year,\nfrom the dozens of volunteers who\ntook part, to the Union who were\nsupportive throughout \u2013 this was truly\na collective Imperial College e\ufb00ort\nand is a testament to what we students\ncan achieve through dedication and\nuniting together for a common cause.\nWe pray that our e\ufb00orts go some way\nto ful\ufb01lling our obligation to serving\nhumanity and helping those less\nfortunate than ourselves.\u201d\nCharity Week 2014, we wait for you\nwith much impatience.\nCampus services takes steps in the\nright direction \u2014 Still silent.\n... continued from page 1\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CHARITY WEEK 2013\nO\nver 100 protesters\noccupied the\nUniversity of London\n(UoL\u2019s) headquarters\non Wednesday 4\nDecember.

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nt is di\ufb03cult to exaggerate\nhow important the band\nDeath is within extreme\nmetal circles. Whilst Possessed may have coined\nthe term \u2018Death Metal\u2019 with their\n1984 demo of that name, it was Chuck\nSchuldiner and the vehicle for his musical vision, the band; Death that laid\nout the blueprint for the death metal\nsound. Death\u2019s debut album Scream\nBloody Gore has been described variously as \u201cdeath metal\u2019s \ufb01rst archetypal\ndocument\u201d and \u201cthe \ufb01rst true death\nmetal record\u201d, whilst Chuck is widely regarded as the \u201cFather of Death\nMetal\u201d. Whereas in\ufb02uencial groups\nCeltic Frost and Venom had previously stumbled onto the territory that\nwould one day evolve into the myriad\nforms of extreme music. In Chuck,\ndeath metal had a pioneer who sought\nout the blazing, savage, and lyrically\ngraphic music that abounded with\nDeath: A Restrospective\nI\nAMS album of the week\nTOY are basically the voice\nof British Krautrock, or at\nleast its closest descendent.\nAn online stream of their\nsecond album, Join the\nDots, due to be released on\nDecember 9th, went online\nthis Tuesday. Almost exactly\na year after their first album\n\u201cTOY\u201d came out, once again\nI am pleasantly surprised by\nwhat I hear.\nOpening with a throbbing\nbassline and the typical TOY\nsynth, the leading single,\n\u201cJoin the Dots\u201d is an almost\n8 minute piece that drives\nitself forward and is well worth a listen.\nThe hectic touring schedule [including several successful festival\nappearances this summer] and a well received single with Rose Elinor\nDougal have focused the band and the effect on this first snippet of music\ncompared to pieces from TOY is noticeable.\nThey are slowly carving out a distinctive sound, somewhere between My\nBloody Valentine and [to my immense pleasure] some of the earlier and\nlonger Pink Floyd compositions \u2013 Join the Dots and especially Conducter\nsound as if they could burst into an extended \u201cSet The Controls for the Heart\nof the Sun\u201d type soundscape everytime the lyrics stop. This slightly darker\nand yet more experimental direction makes me glad since it would be very\neasy for them to continue riding the Krautrock-revival image that\u2019s been\npinned to them, and therefore not explore their unquestionable potential\nwith their new album.\nThere are some minor gripes with the overly repeated and simplistic lyrics,\nbut I think the whole presentation of the music makes it clear what frontman\nDan Carey and the boys are trying to get across \u2013 this album definitely gets\nmy seal of approval, as well as a retrospective recommendation to listen to\ntheir first if you have any love for Krautrock, Floyd or slightly left-centre\npop rock.\nTOY \u2013 Join The Dots\nEamonn Postlethwaite\nfrantic double bass\nand blast beat drum-ming, down-tuned\nbee-swarm guitars,\nand low guttural and\nlargely unintelligible\nvocals. \u201cChuck said:\nHey listen, my band\nis gorier and darker\nthan anything else.\nHe stepped out on\na limb at a time\nwhen that wasn\u2019t\nfashionable.\u201d \u2013 Kelly\nShaefer (Athe-ist, Neurotica).\nAs one of the \ufb01rst to embrace\nthe death metal genre and movement Schuldiner became central to\nthe scene at its heart in Florida. After\nplaying guitar for only six months he\nbegan recording at the age of 16, from\nhere his constant drive for musical de-velopment, and search for increasing\nlevels of complexity and\ntechnicality\nkept Death\u2019s\nline-up in\nconstant \ufb02ux.\nThe in\ufb02uence\nof Death can\nbe seen simply by looking\nthrough the\nroster of its\nex-members.\nTwenty-seven\nm u s i c i a n s\nwere in the\nband over its eighteen year career, with\nSchuldiner as the only constant. This\nreveals the auteur like role being played\nby Chuck, in his attempts to drive the\ngenre he helped to create forward.\nAs well as its high levels of musicianship death metal\u2019s obsession with\ngraphic subject matter can also be\ntraced back to Death. A lot of songs\non Scream Bloody Gore were based\ndirectly on horror movies. \u2018Torn to\nPieces\u2019 is about Make Them Die Slowly, \u2018Regurgitated Guts\u2019 is about Gates\nof Hell, \u2018Scream Bloody Gore\u2019 is about\nReanimator and \u2018Evil Dead\u2019 is about,\nyou guessed it, Evil Dead. But as one of\nthe \ufb01rst adopters of the style Schuldiner can also be credited as one of the\n\ufb01rst to feel pigeonholed and try to\nmove away from what was becoming\nthe norm towards a more mature progressive feel on later records. He even\nregretted his choice of band name,\nwhich at 16 had seemed the height\nof cool but at 30 just seemed silly.\nGiven all this the early loss of\nChuck to brain cancer in 2001, at\nthe age of only 34, was a heavy blow\nto fans. Not only because of the\nlost creative output that may have\nbeen yet to come from such a proli\ufb01c personality, but also because they\nhad lost an icon within the genre.\nTwelve years later there is some\nconsolation for Death listeners as the\nline-up from the record Human, with\nthe addition of Max Phelps on vocals\nand guitar, present a sampling of works\nfrom across all seven albums in a \u201ccelebration of Chucks Legacy\u201d. Projections inside the Kentish town forum\nshow footage of interviews from the\nman himself and those on stage are\nkeen to focus attention on his memory\nrather than themselves. For those in\nthe crowd this is a rare and unlikely\nopportunity to enjoy a live performance of so many classic and beloved\ntracks. It is hard to see Death returning without the virtuoso frontman\nat the helm, it wouldn\u2019t be right. This\nline-up touring under the name Death\nTo All, and giving proceeds to char-ity, is as close as many of us are ever\ngoing to get to the true Death experi-ence. Romanos Skiadas said after the\nshow the he could now \u201cdie happy\u201d\nhaving seen the performance. This\nis a sentiment likely shared by many\nwho never thought they would have\na chance to experience track like \u2018Pull\nthe Plug\u2019 and \u2018Flattening Of Emotion\u2019.\nIf you would like to listen to\nsome Death yourself I\u2019m afraid I\ncan\u2019t pull that o\ufb00 via newspaper, but\nRocksoc: The Aftermath will be doing their own Death retrospective\non icradio.com so you can appreciate Chuck\u2019s genius there if you like.\nThomas Heaven recalls the band synonymous with death metal\nJames & the Rabbit Hole have\nworked hard as a band since we last\nheard from them and it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely\npaid o\ufb00. The band was assembled following an application to the music\ncompetition Uni Music League, and\nnew material was scribbled down\nhurriedly as they powered through\nthe competition. Although the musical talent of each member was clear\nfrom the start, the slight lack of depth\nto the songs and their disjointed corners hinted at their speedy creation.\nNow, however, it\u2019s a di\ufb00erent story.\nTheir debut EP is due to be released\ntoday and it sure packs a punch.\n\u2018Quoth the Ravin\u2019 sets the funk vibe\nrolling. The guitar and bass ri\ufb00s merit\ncomparison to Stevie Wonder tracks\nand will have your foot tapping within\nseconds. The next treat is the \ufb01rst vocal entry. New member of James & the\nRabbit Hole, Katie Addy, has a voice\nthat sounds as if it were designed for\nsuch a punchy track. She maintains a\nrich vocal tone throughout spiky articulation and accentuation of lyrics\nand decorates phrase ends with warm\nvibrato. It becomes grittier as the song\nbuilds. With many talented female\nvocalists following the crowd toward\nelectronic music at the moment, it\u2019s refreshing to hear such a voice in a Rock\n\u2018n\u2019 Roll band. The harmonies and guitar \ufb01llers in the chorus of \u2018Quoth the\nRavin\u2019 complete a great hook, whilst\nthe instrumental solos toward the\nend of the song are equally exciting.\nThe vocals and guitar stabs are seductive from the beginning of \u2018Lions\u2019.\nBut the highlight of this song is the\nchorus, if one can call it that. Three\nvocal sections, which sound a little like\na 90s pop song sung by a gospel choir,\nare alternated with three instrumental\nsections, which are more reminiscent\nof a B.B. King melody. Against all\nodds, it works. The ease with which\nJames & the Rabbit\nHole straddles multiple music genres\nwithout overcompli-cating songs is bril-liant. The musicians\nadapt to each style\nseamlessly. This is\nespecially audible\nfrom the guitarists as well as the\ndrummer, Dan Day,\nwho builds a huge\nnumber of com-James & The Rabbit Hole: EP Review\nJulia Spindel\nMusic Writer\nplex rhythms into the three track EP.\nThe \ufb01nal track of the EP, \u2018Edyta\u2019, is\nthe most memorable track from when\nI \ufb01rst saw James & the Rabbit Hole live.\nIt\u2019s slightly less cleverly constructed\nthan the other two songs on the EP.\nHowever, the fast tempo, complicated\nguitar ri\ufb00s, harmonised choruses and\nreams of lyrics ensure that everyone\nwill have a good time dancing to this.\nJames\u2019 twangy voice and progression from singing into almost talking\nat some points suits the song well.\nJames & the Rabbit Hole are\nplaying at the Workshop on the\n14th of December to celebrate the\nrelease of their EP.

Open Minds are here to debunk some of the\ncommon preconceptions of depression.\nDepression is not a real medical illness\nDepression is a diagnosable illness, de\ufb01ned as \u201ca common mental disorder, characterized by sadness, loss of interest\nor pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration\u201d\n(World Health Organisation).\nThere are many different types of depression\nAs a general term, depression can be classed as: major, which may involve feelings of lowered self-esteem, and a\nlack of motivation to work, sleep, eat, or do once-pleasurable activities for a certain period of time; chronic, where\nsymptoms are less severe but depression lasts for a longer period of time; or bipolar/manic, where one\u2019s mood may\nswing between extreme depression and extreme happiness. Other mental health conditions may also be associated\nwith depression. Depression will likely manifest itself di\ufb00erently in di\ufb00erent people.\nYou can inherit depression from your family\nThere is some evidence that depression runs in families, although no speci\ufb01c causative genes have been found. This\ndoes not mean that you will de\ufb01nitely get depression if someone in your family has it, nor does it mean that you cannot\nsu\ufb00er from depression if it does not run in your family.\nEveryone gets depressed sometimes\nLife can be very stressful, and everyone will go through spells of feeling down. However, with depression, these\nfeelings persist for weeks, months, or years. Depression is an illness with speci\ufb01c symptoms such as losing interest in\nthings that you previously enjoyed, feeling like you are a failure and having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much. If you\nthink you may be depressed, you should see your GP as soon as possible.\nYou\u02bcre depressed because you don\u02bct exercise enough\nDepression cannot be classed as a mood that can be \u2018snapped out of\u2019. Rather, it is an illness that requires recognised\ntreatments and, likely, a certain recovery time. Good diet and exercise can help to alleviate a low mood, but they are\nnot a cure for depression.\nDepression is treatable\nYes! There are many di\ufb00erent treatment options for depression. The treatment will depend on the type, and severity,\nof depression you experience. Some common options are:\n\u2022 Medication: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat depression and anxiety.\nThey boost serotonin levels in the brain to help lift mood. Medication is not a magical cure for depression, and\nSSRIs are often taken in conjunction with talking therapies or CBT.\n\u2022 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT aims to link how you feel (cognition) to how you act (behaviour). It\ndoes not focus on your past or what may have caused your depression, but rather on practical ways to manage\nyour feelings in a positive way. Treatment may include keeping a mood diary or making a diagram linking your\nthoughts, feelings and behaviour, in order to break the negative cycle of depression.\n\u2022 Counselling: counselling is a form of talking therapy where a trained counsellor will provide a safe environment\nin which for you to express your feelings. Rather than o\ufb00ering advice, counselling will help you to \ufb01nd your own\ninsight and understanding of your problems.\nThese things are often easier said than done and you need to be fully committed to treatment for it to work. However,\nmost people do recover from depression if they seek treatment early.\nDo you have any \ufb01rst-hand experiences of\nmental health conditions that you would like to\nshare? Send them in to: disoff@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you would like to get involved in the\nIC Open Minds mental health awareness\ncampaign, \u02bblike\u02bc us on Facebook: https://www.\nfacebook.com/ICOpenMinds\nOr contact Moeko: disoff@imperial.ac.uk\nWorld AIDS Day: 1st December 2013\nEducation is key in the \ufb01ght against stigma associated with HIV, believed to\nbe one of the biggest barriers that hinders the drive towards more testing and\nhelping those living with HIV live a life without fear of discrimination.

    "content": "26 FRIDAY 06 DEC\nBOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n!\nHannah Edmondson interviews Christopher Yates on the inspiration behind his university-set psychological thriller\nDrawn in Black Chalk\nIt started out as a game to win\n\u00a310,000, but the stakes were so\nmuch higher than expected.\nChristopher Yates\u2019 Black Chalk\ncenters on six Oxford first years\nwho set out to play the ultimate\ngame. Not a game of fake money\nor expanding colonies, but a\npsychological game that asks its\nplayers to risk what they cherish\nmost: their self-images, their lives.\nWhile predictable twists and\nunrealistic events might be\nexpected from a thriller like this,\nYates truly excels in suspenseful\nplot development. The novel\nbegins in first person narration by\na character the author describes as\n\u201ca hermit living a peculiar life driven\nby strange routines.\u201d As the story\nprogresses, so does the reader\u2019s\nrelationship with the narrator\nand by extension, the characters.\nPage by page the reader becomes\nmore acquainted with this isolated\nnarrator and his tale only to second-guess everything learned because of\none sentence or hint.\nThese cruel realizations and\nstunted growth reflect the narrator\u2019s\nown experience. His return to his\nyouthful past shows that this story\nis not a coming of age, but rather an\nanti-bildungsroman. The narrator\nhas not grown in life; he has shrunk\nuntil all he knows are the bedroom\nwalls in his poky Manhattan\napartment. Yates juxtaposes this\ncloistered deterioration with the\nunending optimism originally\npresent in the university setting.\nWhen asked why he chose Oxford\nas his story\u2019s location, the author\nand former alum said, \u201cI love the age\nof the characters and their youthful\nenthusiasm for holding certain\nbeliefs, for their desire to experience\nlife.\u201d\nThe Oxford setting also fuels\nthe characters\u2019 increasing interest\nin the game. The competitiveness\nbetween these university friends\nis what elevates the game to such\nunpleasant heights. The rivalry is\npresent from the beginning, when\nthe group tries to outdo each other\u2019s\nunderprivileged backgrounds,\nand becomes increasingly more\nvicious as the story goes on.\nThe tipping point comes when\nthe narrator critiques another\nplayer\u2019s intelligence, for while\n\u201cobscenities were not terms with\nwhich they could hurt or offend\none another, such words meant\nalmost nothing [\u2026] never had any\nof them called another stupid.\u201d\nThrough the backdrop of the game,\nthe author explores this theme of\ncompetitiveness, so prevalent in\ncampus life, while ridiculing the\nstudents\u2019 conceit.\nHowever, not everything is\ngloom and doom in this tale.\nYates offers comic relief through\nJack, the typical clown of the\ngroup, and the obscure memory\ntechniques of the narrator. In one\npassage, the narrator is standing\nnaked above a salad bowl trying\nto remember what the mnemonic\ndevice represents. He eventually\nrealises the undressed salad is a\nreminder for him to clothe himself.\nWhile Yates depicts a brutal side\nto humanity, he inserts humorous\nscenes and realistic situations, such\nas six friends hanging out at the pub\nor one student staying up all night\nto finish the three papers he has due\nthe next day, to make his characters\nrelatable, and identifiable. It\u2019s like\nLord of the Flies in a familiar setting.\nNothing is quite what it seems\nin Black Chalk. The game, the\ncharacters, the narrator are not\nas straightforward as they first\nseem, for, as the author reminds\nus in the introduction, nothing in\nthis tale is to be trusted. Even the\nmotives behind the individuals are\nunreliable, making readers question\nwhat truly drives people.\nOnce the characters move\npast the ingrained social rules of\nbeing respectful to others, caring\nfor all, loving their neighbors as\nthemselves, they see what actually\nmotivates them: power, success,\nand the desire to be loved. Once\nthe white chalk rules are erased,\nthe characters\u2019 genuine outlines are\nrevealed, drawn in plain black chalk.\nHannah Edmondson: What was the\ninspiration behind Black Chalk?\nChristopher Yates: The inspiration\nfor Black Chalk came from real life.\nI really did have an idea to play a\ngame of psychological dares much\nlike the one played in my story. This\nwas something me and my friends\nchatted about in the bar a great deal,\ntrying to come up with interesting\nforfeits for each other. I think it\u2019s\nvery fortunate that we never did\nplay because it means we\u2019re all still\nfriends.\nHE: How did your personal\nexperience at Oxford influence\nyour novel?\nCY: There\u2019s a lot of my own personal\nexperience in Black Chalk. Not a\nsingle one of the events that occur\nin the book actually took place in\nreality but I used my own experience\nto shape the settings and plot. And\nit was my own experience of Oxford\nthat helped me in trying to build as\nplausible a tale as possible. I suppose\nyou might say that my own Oxford\nexperiences are the DNA of Black\nChalk.\nHE: Why did you choose a\nuniversity setting?\nCY: I loved everything about writing\na novel that used a university for\nits setting. I loved the age of the\ncharacters and their youthful\nenthusiasm for holding certain\nbeliefs, for their desire to experience\nlife. The intimacy of such a setting is\nalso a huge plus to a writer; I went\nto a college of around 400 people\nwhich meant that, to some degree,\nI knew just about everyone there,\nand this creates an atmosphere that\ncan be both excitingly convivial\nand frighteningly suffocating. All\nexcellent ingredients.\nHE: In what way do you see this\nnovel as a bildungsroman or rather\na missed bildungsroman?\nCY: Yes, I suppose there\u2019s a sense\nin which it\u2019s a bildungsroman in\nreverse because what we see is\nnot the psychological growth of\nsomeone but actually their decline.\nThe narrator doesn\u2019t come of age in\nthe world so much as want to lock\nthemselves away from the world\nthat\u2019s uncovered.\nHE: Which of the characters did\nyou find it hardest to write about?\nCY: The narrator was the hardest\ncharacter for me to pin down. The\nstory is told fourteen years on from\nwhen the game began. We know right\nfrom the start that the narrator\u2019s\nbeen damaged by this mysterious\ngame and that the narrator is a\nhermit living a peculiar life driven\nby strange routines. So the narrator\nhas no one to talk to but the reader,\nwhich means I had to find a way to\nsuck the reader in without using any\ndialogue between characters (and\nI have a particular love for writing\ndialogue). So this was a challenge to\nwrite. But challenges can be fun. And\nchallenges can also lead to bursts of\ncreative thought. So in the end, I was\nvery happy with my peculiar hermit.\nHE: Which authors are you\ninfluenced by?\nCY: Graham Greene for his sense\nof writing meaningful books with\ngreat prose; but not for one second\ndoes he ever forget to entertain\nand beguile his reader. And this\nis something Donna Tartt does\nbrilliantly as well. Also Vladimir\nNabokov for his love of language\nand games (he is constantly toying\nwith his reader, a chess player who\u2019s\nseveral moves ahead of you). And\nI love great sentence-writers such\nas Martin Amis, John Updike and\nCormac McCarthy.\nBlack Chalk by Christopher J Yates\nis published by Random House\nand is out now!\n\n"

ICT\ncouldn\u2019t have been too pleased. It was\nalso suggested that the registration\nprocess was unclear in general and\nthat departmental activities were\nhaphazard and not really apparent.\nAfter I\u2019d made several further\nunsuccessful attempts at distracting\npotential students from the actual\nevent, I thought I\u2019d annoy some of\nthe (momentarily) less active booths\nand give them someone to talk to,\nalthough we could also go with the\no\ufb03cial reason of wanting to hear both\nsides of the tale.\nFirst I sat myself before the Institute\nof Chemical Biology\u2019s Centre for\nDoctoral Training (ICB-CDT) booth,\nto \ufb01gure out what they were all about.\nGenerally speaking, they were all\nabout a multi-disciplinary approach\nto PG work and focussed on drawing\nstudents with a STEM background\nto work on \u201cinterfacial projects to\naddress the world\u2019s problems\u201d. They\nplan to take about 15 fully funded\nO\nne cold Wednesday\nafternoon earlier this\nweek, your fantastic\nFeatures editor\ndeigned to trespass\nand snoop around formally check out\nand report the annual Postgraduate\nOpen Day happening at the South\nKensington Campus. It was much\nless of a hassle than expected, as I had\nturned up with Joe Letts\u2019 name card\nfor clearance purposes but may as well\nhave come dressed as a school kid for\nall the di\ufb00erence it made.\nAs an undergraduate myself,\nmy objective was to \ufb01nd out what\nmotivated people to consider\nbecoming postgraduates and to come\nto or stay at Imperial for PG studies,\nand how Imperial addressed their\ninterests in the form of the Open Day.\nThe focus point of the day\u2019s\nproceedings was the departmental\nexhibition in the Great Hall, with each\ndepartment also organising their own\ntours throughout the day. As such, the\nbulk of sleuthing around was con\ufb01ned\nto the Sher\ufb01eld building itself.\nIt was clear that some departments\nwere much more bothered about the\neven than others; evidenced by the\nrelative abundance of sweets on o\ufb00er\natop their tables and the spread of\npamphlets and other assorted paper\nwhat-have-you-nots (that are great for\ngrabbing and walking away with when\nyou don\u2019t want to talk to the other\nparty anymore, handily enough.) The\nawesome Physics department even\nmanaged to magic up a \ufb02oating shark\nto supposedly earmark their location\n(the link between the two was beyond\nme.)\nWhile lapping the Hall a number of\ntimes that would impress Avogadro,\nand trying not to look the part of\na dodgy creeper taking pictures of\npeople repeatedly, I managed to\ncircumvent the focal point of the\nspotlight away from me a couple of\ntimes, by interviewing some attending\nprospective postgraduates.\nLawrence, a 3rd year EEE student\nalready at the College, felt that he\nwanted to come back to continue\nhis PG studies here because: all his\nfriends are here \u2013 why leave? His other\nmotivations to pursue a PG degree in\ngeneral were so that he could \u201clearn\nmore technical aspects of things, and\ngain specialisation in a particular\n\ufb01eld \u2013 something you don\u2019t get from\nthe broader scope of a UG degree\u201d. In\naddition, he felt he wanted to make\na contribution to academics after\ngaining so much from it.\nJane, a UCL Geology MSc alumnus\nwho\u2019d grown weary after ten years in\nthe working world and felt becoming\na Doctoral candidate was in order\nto spice up her life, put it bluntly:\n\u201cImperial is one of the best places to\ndo a PhD in Meteorology \u2026 especially\nas it is twinned and closely linked with\nthe NHM next door\u201d \u2013 who\u2019d have\nthought our neighbours would be\nluring students in for us?\nThomas, a 3rd year IC Physicist,\nand Federico, a 1st year PG student\nin the High Energy Particle Physics\n(HEPP) focus group decided they\nwanted to answer my questions\ntogether. They agreed that carrying on\nand doing a PG degree commanded\ngreat recognition and respect even in\ntoday\u2019s hyper-competitive world, and\nit was enthusiastically noted to be a\ngreat way to avoid having to get a job.\nPlus, it was a perk to remain at the\nlargest Physics department in the UK!\nRyan, an Accountancy graduate\nfrom Birkbeck (UOL), claimed he\nwas drawn to Imperial because\nin the Petroleum and Geoscience\nindustries, many employees speak\nhighly about our graduates and are\nusually themselves past students from\nhere. Furthermore, London is a place\nhe can\u2019t stay away from, and not many\nuniversities o\ufb00er the diverse range\nof technical specialisation courses\nthat are available here at IC. He also\nrevealed that he \u201cregretted not doing\na science degree for UG as it\u2019s more\nvaluable than what [he] has now \u2013\nso [he] reworked his personal 5-Year\nPlan to make sure [he] end[s] up in a\ntechnical vocation.\u201d\n4-year PhD candidates into their\nprogramme. When asked why they\nthink students would want to come\nto Imperial and walk this path, they\ncasually let on that Imperial\u2019s ICBCDT was one of the founding CDTs in\nthe country back in 2003 and is world-leading in its research focuses.\nNext, I approached the pair of\nClimate-KIC (CK\u2026 no, not that\nCK) and the Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change (GICC). Following a\nsimilar discussion, I gleaned that what\ndistinguished the two departments\nwas that while CK was more of a\nnetwork for PGs to learn how to\ntranslate their innovative ideas into\nbusiness models and a way to gain\nentrepreneurship skills (not least\nthrough a 5-week summer school),\nGICC was a decentralised body that\nworked across many departments at\nImperial to fund PhDs that addressed\ntheir climate and environmental\nfocuses. Moreover, GICC felt they\nwere alluring as they were exclusive\nto Imperial and o\ufb00ered public\nengagement and policy exposure\nopportunities, while CK served up\nunparallelednetworkingopportunities\ndue to Imperial\u2019s reputation and good\ncareer opportunities due to industrial\npartners.\nI also asked all three departments\nabout how valuable they found the\nOpen Day event to be in garnering\napplications, and what other publicity\nstrategies they preferred to use \u2013 ICBCDT said they found it extremely\nvaluable to be there as usually a third\nof their applicants are obtained as\na direct result of the Open Day and\nCK expressed similar sentiments,\nhowever GI admitted that they were\npresent only to \u201ccover all their bases\u201d\nand usually got their applications as a\nresult of word-of-mouth publicity and\nthe internet.\nWith my job done, I swiftly grab\na \ufb01stful of chocolates from a booth\nnear one of the exit doors, capped my\ncamera lens and walked out, savouring\nthe fact that I was still merely an\nundergraduate.
