The jealousy stems from\nthe fact that whilst\nall you Freshers will be intoxicating\nyour young, worthless bodies during\nthe next week and beyond, I\u2019ll probably be laying a brick or two wondering\nhow likely it is that I\u2019ll actually end up\nwith a degree. Hence the dread.\nI am ever the optimist, though the\nabove paragraph suggests otherwise.\nAs you probably read this half-tram-pled copy of Felix on the floor of Da\nVinci\u2019s, you should come to the realisation that Felix will be your only\nsalvation from the insanity that is\nImperial College. In the almost incomprehensible words of one of my\nfriends, the first year is \u201cjokes as\nfucks.\u201d You heard him; and it will be.\nSince you\u2019re going to be avoiding\nany real work this year, there\u2019s going\nto be plenty of time for exploration of\nthe local area. When you\u2019re in London, though, your local area is the\nmajority of London. A short tube or\nbus journey will unravel the semi-de-lights of this beautiful city, including\nall the shopping you ever even bothered to dream about.\nSo, when the money comes rolling\nin from Daddy or you\u2019ve decided your\nstudent loan is far too big a sum of\nmoney to be just sitting in your bank\naccount \u2018unused\u2019, you\u2019ve got no other\nchoice but to whip out a few bills\nand splash-da-cash on another pair\nof unneeded shoes. Or even that top\nyou\u2019d seen in a magazine once, but\nthe village where you were born and\n(in)bred was too much of a Shitsville\nto actually have any decent shops.\nHence I lay upon you the holy Felix\nFashion guide to the freshest, sick-est, (insert another recent-era slang\nsuperlative) shops and boutiques\nwithin reachable distance. The ones\nthat will provide you with the style\nthat will last you throughout the next\nfew years of your life here in South\nKensington.\nYou may not be as ridiculously clever as the guy sitting in front of you;\nyou may not be hard-working as the\ngirl sitting behind you, but I\u2019m going\nto make damn sure that out of the\nthree, you\u2019re going to be the one that\nis looking the best.The Felix Fashion\nteam also come wandering around college armed with a camera and a note-book, scouting for those of you that actually made an effort that morning to\nlook like something other than a tramp\non the street. We\u2019ll then nervously ask\nyou if we can take a picture and ask\nwhat you\u2019re wearing, crawl back down\ninto the dingy Felix basements and\nfeature you in that week\u2019s issue. So be\nprepared. Don\u2019t let yourself look like a\ntramp. You dirty tramp.\nOn another note, if you\u2019re interested\nin fashion, and always wanted to write\nabout it, there\u2019s only one obvious solu-tion. Write for Felix Fashion. This year\nI\u2019m look for fresh blood to stain the\npages of upcoming issues. You\u2019ll get to\nknow Felix\u2019s deepest and darkest se-crets. Trust.\nPrimark\nMarble Arch\nThe largest Primark in the UK\nis located down the Marble\nArch end of Oxford Street, and\nattracts thousands at a time. This is your\nplace for moderately guilt-free shopping\nsince you could probably buy a new\nwardrobe with the change you found in\nthe communal washing machines that\nweek. For a rather sweaty, disorienting\nand delightfully exhausting day, head over\nto Primark. You may not walk out with\nsomething you ever needed or wanted in\nyour hands, but you can guarantee they\nwill never be empty either.\nStyle: 4 Catwalk to highstreet quicker\nthan Kate Moss can snort a line.\nExpense: 1 Peanuts. (Contrary to\nbelief, Primark actually do\naccept peanuts as\npayment)\nAmerican Apparel\nHigh Street Ken.\nSome call this California-based highstreet\nchain plain and boring. I call those people\nblind. American Apparel offers, yes plain,\nbut also stylish essentials. No tacky prints on\nany of their clothes, they base their image\non block-colours with hints of 80s panache.\nThough slightly pricy, you pay for ethical and\nwell-produced clothes; an AA hoody can last\neras. The cut of their clothes mean that most\nbuys will be fairly slim-fit. If you\u2019re a fan of\nbaggy clothes, buy several sizes up.\nStyle: 4 Strays away from the norm, but not to\neveryone\u2019s taste.\nExpense: 4 Fairly expensive on a student\u2019s\nbudget, but just don\u2019t think about it.\nTopshop / Topman\nOxford Street\nThough Topshops are appearing on every\nstreet corner on Earth and beyond, seeing is\nbelieving when it comes to describing the company\u2019s\nflagship store. Taking one corner of Oxford Circus, it spans\nacross four floors. Three floors are dedicated to all things girly, and\nthe top floor toTopman. It can be heaven or hell with the frantic\ncombination of low prices and masses of people. My advice?\nDon\u2019t go there on a Saturday afternoon or risk losing limbs.\nStyle: 4 To-the-minute fashion at the expense of\nbeing a Topshop clone\nExpense: 2 Hard to beat quality for\nthe relatively inexpensive cost.\nRetro Shop\n/ Retro Man\nNotting Hill Gate\n\u2018Retro Man\u2019 and \u2018Retro Shop\u2019\nare coupled shops, located seconds\naway from the Underground station,\nand buy, exchange and sell high street\nand designer brands. You\u2019ll find classic items of the\nhighest names in fashion past and present. Great for\naccessorising for the final touch of an outfit. For the\ndamn cool with record players, you might also want to\npick up some rare vinyls a few doors down.\nStyle: 5 The most famous names of past era.\nExpense: 3.5 Second hand doesn\u2019t mean\ndirt cheap, but prices can vary.\nPortobello Market\nLadbroke Grove\nPortobello Market is a haven for\nthe retro-loving average of today.\nStall upon stall exhibits second-hand clothing; where a classic 1979\nLiverpool jersey is at home precariously squeezed between a tattered\nPanAm messenger bag and an essentially New-Wave ra-ra skirt.\nSomeone else\u2019s worldly possessions can now be yours for a haggled\nprice. However, retro is back these days and don\u2019t the sellers know\nit!? Portobello also offers an afternoon\u2019s worth of entertainment and\nnovelty shopping.\nStyle: 3 Retro is back, what else can I say?\nExpense: 2.5 Any market offers a decent bargain. Finding it is the\nproblem.\nJoy\nFulham Broadway\nJoy\u2019s self proclaimed \u201cwalk-in uber-boutiques\u2019\nsprawl to every corner of the UK. Regular\nvisitors include Kiera Knightley and Sienna\nMiller.

The day started\nwith Imperial College School of Medicine Student Union [ICSMSU] President Mark Chamberlain giving a talk\non what being a medical student is all\nabout, and what they should expect\nfrom the six-year course.\nAfter this introduction, the potential medical students sat through talks\nabout the various requirements needed to become a medical student, as\nwell as talks on what it will eventually\nbe like to roam the wards as a doctor.\nVarious role-play interviews and student panels followed, where the guests\nasked the medical students whatever\nthey liked. The definite highlight of the\nday, however, was the keynote speech\nby Prof. Lord Robert Winston.\nThe lecture room for the keynote\nspeech was packed with prospective\nand current medical students alike,\nas well as a few members of staff and\neven some of the guest speakers. The\ntopic of the speech was \u2018what it means\nto be a doctor\u2019; an enthralling topic\nfrom arguably the most famous doctor in the country. Everyone was eager to hear his views, and he didn\u2019t\ndisappoint. His speech had two main\npoints: that students should always be\nprepared for any eventuality, and that\nthey should be willing to give up their\ntime to do the best they can for their\npatients. He went on to say that: \u201cby\ndoing medicine, you gain a huge perspective on life. As doctors you have to\nbe human beings; you must listen, be\nopen-minded and patient. The NHS\ndoes not value these issues, they care\nabout paperwork more than the doctors connecting with their patients.\u201d\nThe issue at the heart of Lord Robert\nWinston\u2019s talk was the fact that doctors\nrarely have time to spend listening to\ntheir patients, which can lead to unacceptable oversights.\nThis is by no means the first time\nthat Lord Robert Winston has been\nin the spotlight over his attitude to\nthe NHS. In a 2000 interview with the\nNew Statesman, he criticised the funding given by the Labour Government\nto the NHS: \u201cit\u2019s ludicrous that we\nspend so much less than the European\nmodel\u201d. The resulting pledge of billions\nfor funding earned Lord Winston the\ntitle of the \u2018man who saved the NHS\u2019;\nthough this has not stopped him campaigning in an attempt to save it again.\nLast month, the government decided\nto reverse a decades-old policy by no\nlonger providing free accommodation\nto doctors in their first year of their\nmedical career. It is for this reason\nthat the government has not increased\nthe wage of first year doctors. Medical\nstudents and the British Medical Association [BMA] are worried that this\ndecision will cripple the already debt-stricken medical students, though\nHealth Minister Anne Keen MP has refused to open discussions on the matter \u2013 much to the dismay of the BMA.\nProf. Lord Robert Winston, the \u2018man who save the NHS\u2019\nStudents to live at Thames\nValley University\nThe Imperial College Accommodation\nOffice has had to deal with a record\nnumber of applicants this year, a direct\nresult of the increasing number of students studying at Imperial. This led to\nfears that some students would not get\nstudent accommodation in their first\nyear; as guaranteed by the university to\nthose who apply in time. Three weeks\nbefore the start of term, felix was informed that there were about 160 students who had applied for accommodation but had still not received it.\nThis problem occurred because\nsome students, unhappy at what they\nbelieved to be an unreasonably high\nrent for halls close to Imperial, rejected\ntheir offers in order to receive less expensive accommodation. One student\nwas even trying to swap his single en\nsuite room in Beit on Facebook, as it\nhad not been one of his choices and he\nwould struggle to afford it.\nThe accommodation office has been\nunable to change the offers made to\nstudents due to the understandable\ndifficulty in making individual changes\nonce everyone has been catered for.\nThis year 80% of students received one\nof their top 5 accommodation choices.\nIt is a combination of a shortage of\nrooms and a demand for cheaper accommodation that has put this pressure on the accommodation office.\nWhile all students want to be situated\nas close to university as possible, the\nhigh cost of rooms in the area (the\nmajority of single rooms in South\nKensington range from \u00a3140 to \u00a3180 a\nweek) has put many off.\nHannah Theodorou, Deputy President for Education and Welfare, admitted that \u201cthe price of accommodation\nis certainly climbing out of the reach\nof many students\u201d but argued that\nthe rent was in line with other London universities. felix then conducted\na survey of the three central London\nuniversities: LSE, UCL and Kings. The\nmost expensive hall was High Holborn\nHall, where LSE students could be expected to pay up to \u00a3160 a week for a\nsingle en suite room. UCL\u2019s most expensive accommodation was at John\nDodgson, where a single en suite room\ncosts \u00a3145 a week. Kings\u2019 Great Dover\nStreet Apartments, the most expensive\nKings accommodation, costs only \u00a3128\na week. Hannah Theodorou then concluded that \u201cImperial was focusing too\nmuch on quality\u201d; presumably instead\nof on affordability. Eastside, the new\nhall being built at Princes Gardens, will\nconsist almost entirely of high quality\nsingle rooms with only around 17 affordable twin rooms.\nThis is not the first year that there\nhave been problems with 1st year stu-dents. Last year, due to redevelopment\nwork on halls in Princes Gardens,\nImperial was forced to rent out two\nUNITE Halls of Residence (Piccadilly\nCourt and Orient House) at nearly\n\u00a3500,000 each in order to house all the\n1st year students.\nIn addition to UNITE, this year\u2019s\naccommodation office has looked to\nThames Valley University (TVU) to\nhouse the overflow of students. The\ncollege is planning to house over 20 1st\nyear students in Paragon Hall close to\nBoston Manor tube station in Zone 4,\nand is currently looking for a warden\nto accompany these students.\nThe wardening staff have rejected\nthe scheme, however, on the basis that\nthe students will not receive appropriate pastoral care. An alternative solution was offered to the college by the\nwardens, which included reconverting\nsingle rooms that were once twins back\ninto twin rooms, though this was later\nrejected. A contract has already been\nmade with TVU, making it difficult for\nthe wardening staff to prevent college\nfrom housing students at TVU.\nThe accommodation problem has\nlargely been \u2018solved\u2019, however, by the\nfact that many students who were unhappy with their accommodation offer\nhave decided to either live at home or\nseek housing in the private sector.\nIn total around 10% of this year\u2019s\nintake has been unable to obtain, or\nhave chosen to opt out of, student\naccommodation.\nThere is significant work being done\nto address this problem in the long-term, and work on the new halls of residence on the east side of Princes Gardens has been progressing rapidly over\nthe summer. The hall is being built in\na similar manner to Southside, with\nthree adjacent halls being built, each\nexpected to house close to 400 stu-dents. On the first floor there will be\na bar to replace Harrington\u2019s Bar and\nGrill (looking out onto Prince\u2019s Gardens) as well as a cash machine and a\nsmall shop for everyday groceries. This\nnew hall, which will be opened in September 2009, will deal with the steady\nincrease in the number of students\ncoming to Imperial in the near future.\nFor students desperate for cheap ac-commodation, however, these halls are\nnot a viable solution. As stated above,\nfewer than 20 rooms in these new\nhalls will be affordable twin rooms. A\nfollow-up story will run sometime this\nterm.\nMedical student killed by\ntram in Croydon\nJeevan Sivalingam, affectionately known as Jeeves, a medical student who was about to enter his fourth year at Imperial, unfortunately\npassed away on the afternoon of the 13th of September 2008. He had\nbeen cycling near his home in South London when he collided with\na tram. By all account he did not suffer as he immediately fell unconscious before passing away later in hospital.\nHe was born on the 18th of June 1987 and his mother had become\npregnant with him despite having undergone a sterilization. His parents were told that the chances of this happening were 1 in a million\nand so when they decided on a name, the thought it appropriate to\ncall him \u201cJeevan\u201d, which roughly translates into English as \u201clife\u201d.\nThroughout his life Jeevan maintained a reputation of being cheeky,\nfunny and full of life. This is something that his many friends throughout Imperial can confirm. Many of these friends were in the Medics\nHockey Club, which he was a devoted member of for 3 years. He\ncommitted himself to this club fully both on the field and off, and\nthere is no doubt he will be missed.\nThe Tamil Society was another club he was fully committed to and\nhe made huge contributions to their show Mega Maalai in 2007, helping to raise a large amount of charity in the process. Many will also\nremember Jeeves as a resident of Bernard-Sunley House in his first\nyear, a place where he made many of his most valued friends.\nHis smile and his friendly nature will be missed by many throughout\nImperial. He always stopped to chat and rarely left until he had put a\nsmile on your face. Unfortunately he has left this World prematurely,\nbut hopefully the memories of him can make us smile from time to\ntime in the years to come.\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy & News Editor\nDon\u2019t forget to register at the Health Centre and\nmake sure you are up to date with your MMR and\nMeningitis vaccines\nFor more information visit\nwww.imperialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk\nImperial College Health Center\nAnd finally...\nNew beers, new bar, new\nunion\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in chief\nThe Union has received a facelift over\nthe summer, with dB\u2019s and daVinci\u2019s\ngetting a new lick of paint and a brand\nnew style.

It is not the kind of mildly interesting noise you get at a Belgian beer\nhouse, but one more reminiscent of\nthe dissonant waking call for an early\nmorning hunt in the Paleolithic. The\npeople stop being people and they become one thing only: incredibly powerful and driven eating machines, because it is in the food that the strength\nof this place lies. While it is not refined\nin the slightest, there is a kind of delicacy and frailness to it that makes it\nappealing despite the initially intimidating portion sizes.\nBeginning where the beginning be-gins; drinks. The wine list is seemingly\nunconvincing, but there\u2019s actually a\ngem in there. I am not usually a fan of\nros\u00e9 and have trouble classifying it as a\nreal wine, but their Domaine d\u2019Astros\nMy Old Dutch Chelsea HHHHK\n221 King\u2019s Road, SW3 5EJ\nPrice Per Person: \u00a315\nBest: \u00a35 Pancakes all day\nMonday\nWorst: Long waits on Fridays\nand weekends\nAfonso Campos\nis nothing short of brilliant.

Imagine a pizza. Now, remove\nthe soggy tomato sauce and replace\nthe base with a scrumptuous, massive\npancake. Add bacon, cheese, chicken,\nDelicious calorie bomb puddings\n3/4 cup of butter at room temperature\n1/3 cup of powdered sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\na pinch of salt\n1.5 cups of plain flour\n3/4 cup finely chopped pecans\npowdered sugar for dusting\nPreheat the oven to 170C.

Dust\nthem with the powdered sugar while they\u2019re still warm and let them cool\ncompletely.\nAt this stage, you may want to spice things up.

This\nyear, it will be edited by the very\nvery lovely Ms Rosie Grayburn and\nmyself. I did enjoy writing the business\nsection last year, but I feel it\u2019s time for\nsomething a little bit more sinful. In a\ngood way. Sometimes I\u2019ll do a whole\nissue, sometimes Rosie will; sometime\nwe will collaborate. We want to keep it\nrelatively funny.\nWhile this section is primarily based\naround recipes and reviews of restaurants we believe students will get a kick\nout of, we want to add a bit of a twist\nthis year. We will therefore be organising dinners, cooking parties, drinking evenings, tastings, visits to farmers\u2019 markets and organic farms \u2013 the\nworks. Obviously we don\u2019t want to do\nthis alone and we would absolutely love\nfor our readers to join us; provided you\nare genuinely passionate about food\nand gastronomy and want to be around\npeople who care about this stuff too.\nWe will not only be ranting about\nfood, but also fine drink and the more\ntechnical and nerdy side of food. There\nwill be obscure references to McGee\u2019s\nOn Food and Cooking: known to enthusiasts of merrymaking as The Bible.\nI will also try to give some insight into\nthe incredible world that is molelecu-lar gastronomy made famous (but not\ninvented) by Heston Blumenthal and\nwritten about at length by Dr Charles\nSpence, the experimental psychologist\nand food enthusiast-in-chief at Oxford\nUniversity.\nAnother goal of this section is to instill in you not only a passion, but more\nimportantly the aptitude to become a\nconfident and competent cook. I believe I started out on the wrong foot\ngiven that my first two recipes are not\nthe simplest or the least pretentious\nto prepare. As pointed out to me by\nGilead Amit, things need to be taken\nslowly. As of next week, therefore, that\nis how I will proceed. I will avoid patronising you and as such, will not be\ninstructing you how to boil pasta or\nrice, but perhaps give you slight variations of the basics and hopefully make\nthem less boring and uninteresting.\nIt would be fabulous if you, the read-er, were to chip in with a recipe or a\nrestaurant review once in a while. Just\nemail it to us at food.felix@imperial.\nac.uk. While we will be doing a lot of\nreviewing ourselves, there are just\ntoo many great places in London to\nvisit, and while we\u2019d adore eating at\nall of them, this is most likely not going to happen.

Duncan Casey travelled to Somerset to see what the fuss is about\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\nH\nello, hola, bonjour,\nwillkommen, ni hao,\nhi, you alright? So welcome to (or back to)\nImperial College! I hope\nyou\u2019re as pleased to be here as we are\nto have you here. This here\u2019s the music\npage, and I am one of the music edi-tors, trusted to guide you through the\nadventure playground that is the London music scene, steering you towards\na cooler and more healthy diet of awesome sounds, and away from that fucking Coldplay album. If you do own that\nalbum you are not allowed to read the\nmusic page.\nMusic is a huge part of the London\nstudent lifestyle. We are lucky enough\nto have wound up studying in one of\nthe largest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world, and the music scene\ndefinitely reflects that. In London there\nis a community for practically every\ngenre of music, from jazz to hip-hop to\nclassical, and of course to dubstep. It is\na 24-hour city where you can see/listen\nto/do/eat almost whatever you fancy,\nany time of night or day. A city that\ncultivates eclecticism and eccentricity in its individuals and in its thinkers\n\u2013 the saying: \u2018different strokes for different folks\u2019 extends to all six million\nLondoners. Because of this, getting\nout and getting involved in the music\nscene here is one of the most enrich-ing, gratifying, mind-expanding and\nsoul exploring things you can do while\nyou\u2019re here. It\u2019s a way to find out what\nyou really like and to really pursue it \u2013\nlike a vision quest without the peyote.\nLondon is a mysterious city, only revealing as much as it thinks you should\nknow, and always keeping surprises\nhidden to keep you interested. In my\ntwo years in the smoke I\u2019ve accrued a\nsmall amount of knowledge which I\nfeel I should pass down to the prospective music listener. It\u2019s by no means a\ncomprehensive list \u2013 London has way\ntoo much going on to know every-thing, but here\u2019s four tips to steer you\nin the right direction:\n1) If you\u2019re planning a big night, get a\nTime Out. \u00a32.50 from every newsagent,\nbut definitely worth the investment. It\u2019s\ngot every music and club listing for the\nweek, with information about the kind\nof music you can expect at all the clubs.\nIt\u2019s a great way to find odd little spots\nthat make you know you don\u2019t know\nyour shit when you really don\u2019t.\n2) Shoreditch is a fun place \u2013 check\nit out as soon as is convenient. Supertrendy but cheap because it\u2019s a bit of a\nshit-hole in places. The pubs are nice\nthough.\n3) Union nights are a great way to\nmeet people in the first year, and a\ngood way to get pissed up on the cheap\ntoo. But other than that, they\u2019re just\nNOT COOL. Yeah, I said it!\n4) Never ever ever get a kebab in\nLeicester Square at night, even if it\u2019s\nthe only way they\u2019ll let you use their\ntoilet. It\u2019s just not worth it \u2013 find an\nalleyway.\nThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the list. The fifth hidden tip is to email me (music.felix@\ngmail.com) and I will sort you out with\nfree CDs and press passes to gigs in\nexchange for writing a couple of paragraphs about them. Rly.\nAfter last year\u2019s washout, the omens\nweren\u2019t looking good for Glastonbury\n2008. Slow ticket sales and controversy about Jay-Z\u2019s headline spot had\nkept the festival in the papers, but the\npublicity wasn\u2019t the sort that anyone\nwanted. Oh, and then it started to rain\non the Thursday. Tell me again why I\ndo this to myself every year?\nHaving sat out the obligatory monsoon with only a box of wine and a\nsmall bag of recreational narcotics\nfor company, I emerged, bleary of eye\nand stubbly of face to start the festival\nproper. Breakfast was a rush \u2013 for reasons known only to themselves, the organisers had arranged for talent vacuum Kate Nash to open the billing, with\nher sub-Lily Allen (not something I say\noften) brand of noise, but after that\nthings improved dramatically. While\nGlasto doesn\u2019t have the big-money pull\nof Reading or V, the advantage is that\nthe people who do turn up to play do\nso because they want to, as opposed\nto some contractual obligation. A\nrefreshing set by Hobo Jones and the\nJunkyard Dogs, (complete with silly\noutfits, washboards, percussion played\non a guitar with spoons), banished the\nearlier memories, before the Alabama\n3 brought the Jazz World stage to its\nfeet with a blindingly good selection of\ntheir gospel-infused back-catalogue.\nNot bad for a band famous solely for\nthe Sopranos\u2019 title music.\nSurprise hit of the day, as well as\ncoolest-named act of the festival was\nLupe Fiasco \u2013 imagine Kanye West,\nbut not shit \u2013 whose sample-driven\nhip-hop had a crowd of fifty thousand\nmiddle-class white people who had\nnever heard of him jumping, gurning\nand pulling \u2018west-side\u2019 poses at each\nother. He was, for the record, significantly better than Jay-Z, and the truly\nepic nature of the Glastonbury sound\nsystems meant that you could actually\nhear what he was saying, which was a\nnovelty for a rap gig.\nFun Lovin\u2019 Criminals, The Fratellis\nand The Kings of Leon rounded out the\nscheduled bands for the day, at least for\nme \u2013 the Kings seem to have found a\nBruce Springsteen-esque stadium rock\nsound, which is frankly a dramatic improvement on the four-boring-men-recording-generic-garage-rock-in-a-bucket sound of their first albums.\nSo, then the day really got underway.\nOne really stand-out thing that separates Glasto from, well, almost everything else in the country is the lateJay-Z\u2019s set was mired with controversy, being the first hip-hop act to headline the traditionally indie festival\nKnee deep in human excrement\nnight stuff. A lot of the fun doesn\u2019t\neven start until midnight, and with the\nreplacement of the much-loved cabaret\nof weirdness that was Lost Vagueness\nwith Trash City and the mysterious\nShangri-La, no-one really knew what\nto expect. Shangri-La, as it turned out,\nfelt like a fairground as imagined by\nRob Zombie, only with marginally less\neating of brains; Trash City was, how-ever, easily the best thing at the festival.\nImagine a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas,\nwith barren, wrought-iron trees spewing smoke into a red-lit main strip,\ncomplete with lasers, screaming break-beat, flaming lanterns and dancers on\nstilts, surrounded by the ruined remains of casinos and strip joints. And\nthen go and have a sit down for a while\nand try to work out what it is you must\nhave just taken.\nOf course, the only trouble with all\n\u201cThen my\nhousemate set\nhimself on fire,\nso we decided to\ncall it a night...\u201d\n\u201cShangri-La felt\nlike a fairground\nas imagined by\nRob Zombie,\nonly with\nmarginally less\neating of brains\u201d\nthis fantastic late-night show is that\nno-one gets to bed until 6am, so the\nnext day was a little slower\u2026 Fortunately, the good Mr Eavis knows that\ntoo, so we started the day with an ev-er-so-faintly surreal set from Shakin\u2019\nStevens. Yes, really. It was a day built\nfor sprawling in the sunshine (yes, actual sunshine! At Glastonbury!) to the\npleasant but not desperately challenging sounds of Martha Wainwright and\nCrowded House, with the blues guitar\ngenius of Seasick Steve thrown in for\ngood measure.\nWhat can I say about Amy Winehouse? A testament to the power of\nthe human liver, her show was superb\nuntil she tried to talk, at which point\nit became painfully apparent that she\nwas only still upright due to some El\nCid-style stick up her arse. She fell\nover, swore, spat and punched a fan or\ntwo, and in between occasionally belted out some of the hits that have made\nher the animated car crash she is today.\nJay-Z started well, poking fun at such\nluminaries as the Pope, George Bush\nand Noel Gallagher, but to be honest\nwe got bored halfway through. Then\nmy house-mate set himself on fire, so\nwe decided to call it a night and go put\nhim out. 3 litres of wine + 1 large garden candle = a whole bunch of pain.\nLet that be a lesson to you, kids.\nSunday was a bit truncated, as my\ngang were all off direct to Roskilde\nfestival, which is very much a story\nfor another day \u2013 the things we do for\nyou! In any case, ignore the doom and\ngloom in the papers \u2013 Glasto tickets\ncome out on October 5th this year, and\nyou can register now at www.glaston-buryfestivals.com. It\u2019s what your student loan is for!\nDuncan Casey\nIt was sunny! Which for any event held\nin Scotland is cause for celebration. It\nonly rained lightly once, at 3am. The\nline-up was being tipped as the best\nout of all the festivals this summer\nand it certainly racked up the famous\nnames. Arriving fashionably late on\nFriday after some local decided it\nwould be a laugh to move a signpost,\nwe successfully managed to park the\nfurthest away and dragged our supplies\nalong the mud track to Ryanair\u2019s idea of\na campsite that was so distant it never\nfilled. Listening to the faint warble of\nThe Verve drifting over from the main\nstage we set about watching a clued up\nfriend erect the tent.\nThe line up may have been excellent\nbut it was badly planned. It left us with\nan empty Saturday, and a Sunday that\nwas so packed with jam that it made\na mess of our tops. Trying to get my\nvery English friends to Ceilidh Dance\nand absentmindedly watching people\nfight over free t-shirts filled up the\ndead time between interesting sets\nthough. We made the mistake of going\nto see Lightspeed Champion as The\nPet Sounds Arena\u2019s sound quality was\nawful and Devonte Hynes sounded and\nlooked like a silly hat singing slightly\nout of tune. Cajun Dance Party, a little\nbit of a guilty pleasure, had disappoint-edly typical stage personalities but I\nstill really enjoyed The Flies Arrive - I\nlove songs about being late, despite\nAmylase being risible. They certainly\ndid GCSE biology.\nThe food was\na pleasant\nsurprise\nwith\n\u201cHealthy\nT\u201d offering\nlamb,\nbeef,\noys-ters, salmon and wild boar (all locally\nfarmed) as well as about three stands\nselling risotto pitched at about the\nsame prices as everywhere else selling\nthe standard-shaped grease. Shame\nthey didn\u2019t offer better beer. The climax of Saturday night for the rest of\nthe group was Rage Against the Machine but never having been a fourteen\nyear-old boy I wandered off to find my\nfriends who were working at T.\nWe woke up bleary-eyed on Sunday\nto the sight of a row of men pissing on\na chain-link fence 100 yards away. Even\na few girls pissed in the corners, which\nbegan the unresolved argument of why\nScotland\u2019s Glasto:\nT In The Park\nguys can piss wherever they want and\ngirls cannot without the male populace\nreacting with disgust. Surely no one\nshould get to piss where people can\nsee?? Answers on a postcard. Dodging the suspect mud we set off and\nsplit up, squinting at our badly copied\nout programs. The \u2018Pet Sounds arena\u2019s\nsound quality still hadn\u2019t improved but\nBattles managed to raise up against the\nbadly checked tent and play a short but\nsweet set. John Stanier, drummer, was\nawe inspiring to watch. Yeasayer was\none of the best bands of the festival\nwith their hauntingly happy sound hitting me like an Indian summer echoing\nthrough the an abandoned warehouse.\nTime for the big\nheadliners, but with\nR.E.M, Aphex Twin\nand The Prodigy all\nplaying at the same\ntime it\nwas a hard\nchoice for many. R.E.M is my favourite\nband, meaning that despite what people say and some songs being mediocre\nI love them uncontrollably. I cannot\nreview it with any sense of neutrality\nso I\u2019m not going to pretend to try. The\nonly downside of the amazing set was\ntwo girls from a certain city [Glasgow]\nwhopushedtheirwayforwardandthen\nshouted about their nail polish to each\nother for an hour! I mean what was the\npoint? They didn\u2019t look like they were\neven enjoying the conversation. Afterwards we possibly headed towards\nsome campsite entertainment.\nFinally we were woken up at the ungodly hour of 7am but still managed\nto be practically last to leave, squelching through what the end of the world\nmight look like if everyone died in a\nmulti-coloured refugee camp. The\nwind tossed tents like tumbleweed and\nwe felt fine.\nSarah-Emily Mutch\n\u2018T\u2019 stands for Tenants. Sarah-Emily\nMutch does her best to recall the weekend\nNew Album from The Streets\nThe Streets\nEverything Is Borrowed\nVice Recordings\nHHIII\nAmongst other things, Mike Skinner\u2019s\ncareer is on borrowed time with this,\nhis latest and most bewildering release to date, Everything Is Borrowed.\nPerhaps he spent the whole grand on\nfucking up his head, because the whole\nfeel of this strange record is that of a\nnew-age spirtualist cult service.\nThe theme of the album is summed\nup in the title - \u2018Everything is Borrowed\u2019, which refers to how we are\nborn with nothing, die with nothing\n(except love, which Skinner points\nout), and everything in between is \u2018just\nborrowed\u2019. Very deep, very nice, however that\u2019s just not what The Streets are\nabout. This attempt at putting across\na profound message just makes him\nsound like that pissed guy at the pub\nwho sits at the bar and starts talking to\nyou when you go up to get a drink and\nthen won\u2019t leave you alone even when\nyou\u2019re obviously patronising him.\nThere are some brief moments\nthroughoutthisalbumwherethecharm\nof previous releases shines through,\nand without fail it\u2019s always where he\ndrops the sillyness of the amateur phi-losophising and just talks like himself.\nLike on the Dry Your Eyes-esque I Love\nYou More (Than You Like Me) - \u201cI drew\na drawing of you after last time I saw\nyou / I never thought to draw a picture\nlike that before /I learnt a lot about myself drawing all morning / It was absolutely shit, I\u2019m rubbish at drawing\u201d. It\u2019s\nalmost like he realises how ridiculous\nthe rest of it is and just takes the piss.\nThe kind of cutting taking the piss that\nmade his previous albums great. Only\nthe butt of the joke is his own album.\nOuch.\nThe name \u2018The Streets\u2019 alone guaren-tees this release a brief spell towards\nthe top of the billboard charts, and\nsome of the beats are probably good\nenough to make it linger a bit longer,\nbut just as the weekender must eventually emerge from his or her stoned\nstupor and confront the harsh reality\nof Monday morning, so too will Streets\nfans eventually wake up, bleary-eyed,\nto Skinner\u2019s abysmal lyricism this time\naround and say: \u201cMike, what the fuck\nare you talking about?\u201d\nPeter Sinclair\nEverything Is Borrowed is\navailable on 07/10/08\n\n"

Coincidence?\nProbably.\nFISH FINGERS: Emergency food\nthat\u2019s good to go in 10 mintues.\nSandwich between some bread,\nsquirt with ketchup and you\u2019ve\ngot your fill of Omega-3 for the\nweek.\nOYSTER CARD: Don\u2019t bother\ntravelling around London without\none. Take it to a ticket booth at\nthe tube station with your Young\nPerson\u2019s Railcard and they\u2019ll put a\ncap on your day travelcards too.\nLOO ROLL: Never underestimate\nthe usefulness of a spare roll.\nEAR PLUGS: Snoring\nroommate? Neighbour has\na fondness for Linkin Park?\nThese mean you might get\nsome sleep before the riveting\nday of lectures tomorrow.\nREGGAE REGGAE SAUCE:\nNo matter how disastrous\nyour cooking attempts, a\nsplash of this jerk sauce\nwill make your pasta\nedible again. Use to liven\nup chicken, and even\nsandwiches.\nWAITER\u2019S FRIEND: It\u2019s not\nclever to crack bottles open\nwith your teeth- the waiter\u2019s\nfriend has everything you need\nwhilst keeping your enamels\nintact. It can handle wine\nbottles and stubbies. Useful.\nBAG FOR LIFE: Plastic\nbags have bad press for\nall the right reasons.\nPack away a cotton or\nsupermarket bag for life\nin the bottom of your bag\nevery day so you\u2019re not\ncaught off-guard by an\nimpromptu shop in Tesco\nMetro.\nUSB STICK: Indispensable. Don\u2019t\nget one where you can lose the cap,\nthough. The Union shop sells them in\ndifferent sizes.\nA few essential home comforts\nFEBREZE: Some of your rooms\nmight smell a bit funky when you\narrive. Febreze is a god-send for\nstagnant matresses, stinky trainers\nand jackets you can\u2019t be bothered\nto take to the dry cleaners.\nETHERNET CABLE: A must for\nconnecting to the web from the\ncomfort of your own room. Ravi\u2019s\nflogging them for a couple of quid\n(if you can find him).\nEXTENSION LEAD: I know you were\ntold not to bring one. But when the\nonly socket in your room happens to\nbe across the room from where you\nwant to install your TV, there\u2019s no\nother way.\nWARM COAT: Don\u2019t forget London\ncan get bloody cold in the Winter\nMonths. Throw in a scarf, some\ngloves and a woolly hat for the\nwhole look and you\u2019re good to\nWATER BOTTLE:\nEmbrace the inner\ngeek who misses their\nmum. Don\u2019t splash out\non \u00a31 bottles of water\nin college when you\ncan fill up at home for\na fraction of the price.\nNormal bottles leach\nnasty stuff if you fill\nthem up too many\ntimes.\nUMBRELLA: We\u2019ve had\nthe wettest August ever\non record. Unfortunately\nthings aren\u2019t going to get\nany better. Expect some\ntorrential downpours and\nsome annoying drizzle in\nthe upcoming months.\nTheAdvice\nCentre\nThe Advice Centre is your\nfree service for confidential,\nimpartial, independent advice and\ninformation on academic appeals\nand complaints, debt advice,\nhousing rights, employment rights,\nconsumer rights, personal safety\nand international issues.\nFree.

While others thrive\non making jibes about life at Imperial, I\ntend to focus on practicalities and how\nwe can improve your time here. I know\nthat boys outnumber girls 2:1, that the\ngames section will get more readers\nthan the fashion pages and that, come\nEaster, a seat in the library will become\nmore elusive than Bigfoot. The following weeks are going to be a rollercoaster of ups and downs for most of you.\nThe friends you make over the following year may turn out to be the ones\nthat stay with you for all your life, so do\neverything you can to get out there and\nmeet them!\nIf you\u2019re having personal problems\nor are struggling with your workload\nthere\u2019s a number of people you can\nturn to. Let someone know you\u2019re\nstruggling, be it friends, your personal\ntutor, one of the wardens in your halls\nor myself in the Union. We also have\na dedicated Student Adviser, Nigel\nCooke. He works in the Advice Centre\nin the East Wing of the Student Union\nand specialises in the following areas\nof advice:\n\u2022 Academic Appeals and Complaints\n\u2022 Debt Advice\n\u2022 Housing Rights\n\u2022 Employment Rights\n\u2022 Consumer Rights\n\u2022 Personal Safety\n\u2022 International Students Issues\nNigel also has links with all the College welfare services and also legal\nadvice centres in the local community\nso if he can\u2019t help we can find someone who will be able to locally. We are\nalso full members of Advice UK which\nis an agency which encourages good\npractice in advice centres around the\ncountry. The Advice Centre acts as an\nadvocate for students; to College and\nalso to outside organisations when we\nfeel a student needs extra help to solve\nan issue, acting on your behalf with\nyour permission.\nBoth Nigel and myself are in close\ncontact with the College welfare serv-ices, including the Health Centre, Student Counselling Service, Careers Advisory Service and Disability Officer.\nOver the upcoming months there will\nbe a number of articles and picture stories in this welfare section highlighting\nissues that may affect students during\ntheir time at Imperial.\nBoth of us will be at Freshers\u2019 Fair\nhanding out our weight in condoms\nand other goodies, so if you have any\nquestions or want to say hello, pop\nover and see us. I\u2019ll especially be focusing on distributing leaflets advising you\non how to get exemptions from Prescription Charges if you are on a low\nincome. They don\u2019t take your parent\u2019s\nincome into account so that should include most of you...\nOn the left are a few of the items that\nyou might not have packed, so get your\nparents to take you on one last shop to\nfill up your cupboards and then get on\nyour way to the Union!\nHannah Theodorou\nDeputy President\nEducation & Welfare\n\n"

If yes, you\u2019re not\nalone ... Depending on whose report\nyou believe, anywhere between 20 to\n44% of people admit to infidelity. How\ndoes infidelity make you feel, though?\nThe recent Love and Sex series booklet,\nreleased by The Independent, focuses\non infidelity and states \u201c[that] guilt\nplays its damaging part - only a heel or\na fool actually enjoys betraying someone else...\u201d After cheating, feelings of\nguilt ensue. Biologically speaking, guilt\nhas evolved to lubricate the complicated social lives of humans. In the case\nof the guilty pleasure that is infidelity;\ntrue feelings of guilt may act as signals\nto your partner that you are sorry and\nwill not attempt to repeat the offence.\nThis might then help re-build the trust\nand maintain the relationship.\nA lot of research indicates that women are more jealous of their partner\u2019s\nemotional infidelity, and men of sexual\ninfidelity. This makes evolutionary\nsense: a man\u2019s reproductive success\n(genetic interests) can easily be jeopardized by a woman\u2019s sexual infidelity:\na single case of this and he could spend\nthe rest of his life investing resources\nin raising someone else\u2019s offspring.\nThis principle of paternal uncertainty\naffected evolution of much human\nbehaviour, including jealousy. On the\nother hand, women traditionally depended on men for protection and resources and so a woman\u2019s mating strategy involves finding a mate that will\ninvest time and resources into their\nrelationship and children. If her mate\ngets emotionally involved with another\nwoman, this may mean divergence of\nthose investments away from her.\nFollowing this line of reasoning, researchers from St. Mary\u2019s University,\nCanada, hypothesised that man should\nfeel more guilt about their own emotional rather than sexual infidelity and\nthat women should feel more guilt\nabout their sexual rather than emotional infidelity. In both cases, people\nshould feel guiltier about their own\nactions that reduce their partner\u2019s reproductive success more, since one of\nthe functions of guilt is to stop people\nfrom damaging their social relationships by acting in undesirable ways.\nResults based on questionnaires filled\nby 130 men and women and published\nin the journal of Evolutionary Psychology are exactly the opposite of what\nthe researchers expected.\nWhat could be happening in our\nminds? Why do men feel more guilt\nover sexual and women over emotional\ninfidelity? One possibility is that both\nsexes project their own values onto\ntheir partner; i.e. if sexual fidelity is\nreally important to you as a man, you\nthink it must also be important to a\nwoman and so feel guiltier about that\nthan about emotional infidelity, which\nyou don\u2019t perceive as important. It is\nalso possible that since men perceive\ntheir relationships more as sexual and\nwomen more as emotional, their guilt\nis also stronger in the domain which\nthey perceive as important for their re-lationships. Finally, the guilt trip might\nactually be there to smooth out our relationship with the same-sex competi-tors; not our mates. So knowing that\nother men also get upset about sexual\ninfidelity means that the stronger sense\nof guilt is there to minimize retribution\nfrom competing males.\nMico Tatalovic\nScience editor The Naked Scientists\nTally-ho! It\u2019s\nthe Naked Scientists \u2013 in-nuendo-laden\nmetaphors\nahoy \u2013 enlightening us\nwith their take\non the week\u2019s\nscience-related news. Cambridge scientist Chris Smith and team discuss\nwhy voles are monogamous, and humans often aren\u2019t (it\u2019s all down to our\nvasopressin levels, apparently), and we\nlearn how the current trend of human-caused extinctions is nothing new, and\nwhy for bats silence can be golden. Definitely one for the biologists, although\na large part of this week\u2019s programme\nis devoted to the Large Hadron Collider with interviews with several of\nthe scientists involved. The jury\u2019s still\nout on the \u2018kitchen science\u2019 segment\n\u2013 all a bit Blue Peter \u2013 and the rest of\nthe programme left me cold.

However Dr Karl himself, who\nsounds a bit like an Australian Robert\nWinston (and, I like to think, replete\nwith bushy moustache) is a veritable\nmine of facts and witty anecdotes.

Also in the news is\na study on narcissism, water bears in\nspace, getting girls into science, and\n\u2013 surprise \u2013 the LHC.

Unsurprisingly this has a distinct down-under\nfocus, with news of amphibian declines\ncaused by chytrid fungus (did you\nknow 2008 was the \u2018Year of the Frog\u2019?);\nciguatera poisoning in coral reefs and\nwhy you shouldn\u2019t be eating barracuda;\nand the killer Hendra (?) virus in bats,\nhorses and people. As if that wasn\u2019t\nenough, we also hear about the Ebola\nvirus decimating gorilla populations in\nCongo, and the palm-oil boom and its\nrepercussions for orang-utans. It\u2019s not\nall bad news; there is an interview with\na 16-year old girl with a NASA scholarship (although frustratingly we don\u2019t\nfind out why people can\u2019t walk on the\nmoon any more), and a fascinating feature on Henry Ford \u2013 industrial gen-ius, reincarnation-believing mystic,\npeace activist, and anti-Semite \u2013 as the\n100th anniversary of the Model T rolls\naround.

Read fur-ther, however, and it emerges that this\nis the view of Otto R\u00f6ssler, an obscure\nGermanchemist(sorry,\u201cboffin\u201d)trying\nto halt the experiment in the European\nCourt of Human Rights. After the case\nwas thrown out as \u201coverly speculative\nand not credible\u201d, The Sun continued\nwith its apocalyptic claims: \u201cBoffins\nset to cause Big Bang\u201d \u2013 \u201csome experts\nfear\u2026a huge black hole that swallows\nthe planet and wipes out mankind.\u201d\nThe broadsheets weren\u2019t much bet-ter. Here\u2019s a week in the life of a Guardian reader: \u201cIs the end nigh?\u201d (5/09);\n\u201cIs this my last weekend ever?\u201d (7/09);\n\u201cWill the world end?\u201d (8/09); \u201cIs this\nthe way the world ends?\u201d (9/09). Yikes.\nThe Independent and The Telegraph\nalso asked if this was \u201cthe end of the\nworld?\u201d, while Simon Jenkins in The\nTimes was left to grumble about more\nworldly matters, namely the \u00a33bn of\npublic money spent on the project,\nand to compare Cern \u2013 the European\nnuclear organisation in charge of the\nLHC \u2013 to the shadowy autocratic regime running the Olympics (that\u2019s the\nIOC, not China).\nAfter all that, predictably, the great\nday came and went without a hitch,\nleading to a collective about-face (\u201cSuccess! The world hasn\u2019t ended\u201d etc\u2026).\nThe object, intentional or otherwise,\nof much scientific journalism seems\nto be to spread fear and mistruths.\nThis isn\u2019t hyperbole; the results are\nclear to all. Readers of Ben Goldacre\u2019s\nBad Science column in The Guardian\nwill know about the fallout from the\nMMR scandal in the early 2000s. An\nanecdotal piece of research linking the\nMMR vaccine to childhood autism was\npicked up by the media and sensationally reported as fact. In 2002 it was the\nbiggest story in the British press; by\nFelix examines the media reports of the world\u2019s biggest experiment.\n2005 the vaccine uptake was so low\nthat the UK was in a mumps epidemic,\nand by 2008 measles was declared endemic (persistent, continuous presence\nin a population) for the first time in 14\nyears. The truly sensational thing is\nthat less than a third of the newspaper\narticles on MMR mentioned the fact\nthat the scientific evidence was overwhelmingly against such a link and that\nmany more people would doubtless be\nharmed if they did not get the vaccine.\nThis shows the effect irresponsible\nscience reporting can have. It\u2019s almost\nimpossible to know what drives the cy-cle; the public are hungry for bad news,\nand the press is only to happy to oblige\nand shift more copies. Why let the truth\nget in the way of a good story? Much\n\u2018knee-jerk\u2019 reporting of science fails to\naddress the important questions. One\nexample is the campaign against GM\ncrops by The Mail, squeamish about\n\u201cFrankenstein foods\u201d and scientists\n\u201cplaying God\u201d. These objections have\nheld back a potentially vital technology\nFelix Whitton\nScience correspondent\n\u201cThe object of\nmuch scientific\njournalism\nseems to be to\nspread fear and\nmistruths. \u201d\nfor feeding a growing world population faced with rapid environmental\nchange, and more importantly diverted\nattention away from important issues\nconcerning multinational companies\n(Monsanto et al.) who stand to profit\nmost from gene patenting and terminator technology at the expense of the\nworld\u2019s poorest.\nWhat the LHC highlights is the point\nat which many of these issues converge.\nProfessor Brian Cox of Manchester\nUniversity, one of the project\u2019s lead\nphysicists, said that anyone who thinks\nthe world will end \u201cis a twat\u201d \u2013 proof\nthat scientists do not have spin doctors\n\u2013 but brisk language notwithstanding,\nhe was voicing the opinion of an overwhelming majority of experts. And yet\nthis was overshadowed in the mainstream media by apocalyptic language\nfrom a clutch of crackpots. By the same\ntoken, we heard various estimates for\nthe cost of the experiment \u2013 anywhere\nbetween \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn \u2013 along with\nmuch righteous indignation as to the\nimmediate returns of the UK\u2019s \u00a3500m\ncontribution, but almost nowhere\ndid we read about the joys of science\nfor discovery\u2019s sake, unencumbered\nby utilitarian targets and cost-benefit\nanalyses. Professor Stephen Hawking\npointed out that the money spent on\nthe LHC and the space race amounts\nto less than 0.1% of world GDP; \u201cIf the\nhuman race can\u2019t afford that, it doesn\u2019t\ndeserve the epithet \u2018human.\u2019\u201d\nUpdate - since this article\nwas written there has been a\nsetback at CERN. A \u2018quench\u2019\noccurred where one of the\nsuper-conducting magnets used\nto direct the particle beams\nfailed. This caused a sudden\n100\u00b0C rise in temperatures and\na tonne of Helium to leak into\nthe tunnel. Over the next few\nweeks the affected section will\nbe warmed to room temperature\nso the area can be inspected for\ndamage. The result is that the\naccelerator cannot be started\nagain till spring, after the winter\nmaintenance period.\n\n"

After large-scale success in our sports over the past couple\nof years, the College has finally taken\nits rightful place as the best sporting\nuniversity in London. Officially. Last\nyear we moved up 7 places in the BUCS\n(formally BUSA) overall sports points\ntable to take 22nd place, a record. If we\nalso add the significant contribution\nmade by the Medical School\u2019s sports\nclubs, we ascend to 20th place. So you\nguys have a tough act to follow in replacing our recent graduates!\nSport will be bigger and better this\nyear at Imperial. New sports such as\nGaelic Football, Women\u2019s Cricket and\nFutsal are aiming to replicate the recent successes of the Rugby, Tennis,\nFencing, Netball, Rowing, Squash,\nBadminton and Volleyball clubs. There\nare many opportunities to play sport at\nImperial, and all of our clubs are more\nthan happy to allow anyone at any\nstandard to play, so make sure you sign\nyour name up for at least one sport at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair.\nAlong with the BUCS & ULU com-petitions, Varisty is the main inter-col-lege sporting event where the College\ncompete with the Medical School in a\nwide range of sports. felix will be covering this event in style in the weeks\nleading up to this flagship event so join\na sport and keep your eyes peeled.\nFor some of you the prospect of\nhard training sessions and competitive matches every week may be a little\ndaunting, although for some it may just\nbe the start of a week filled of gym and\nrunning sessions! Each to their own,\nand you will soon see that the clubs\nwill cater for all standards.\nThere is, however, another side to\nsporting life at Imperial\u2026 You are enrolling in a university steeped in tradi-tion, fierce rivalries and bars that are\nhome to 50+ sports clubs and hundreds\nof teams. Varsity, Bottle Match, Hyde\nPark Relays, ULU, BUCS and more\nare followed by song, games, tankards\nand celebration back at the home bar.\nA headache may follow but it is worth\nevery painful lecture.\nTo be involved in a community of\nsportsmen and women who have represented the university and taking\nsport at Imperial to an all-time high is\na great honour. We must celebrate in\nthe appropriate manner and if you do\nyou will find yourself with a whole host\nof comrades and a full social calendar.\nThe instant legend that is the Sports\nLeague will be back in felix this year\nonce competitive matches commence\nin a few weeks time. Can you help\npush your sport\u2019s team to the top of the\ntable?\nChoosing a sport can be difficult\nat times, especially for beginners and\nthose who have never played before, so\ncarry on reading these pages for a brief\nintroduction to some of our clubs and\ntheir highlights.\nWe were inundated with entries so\nwe hope you can tolerate the text-heavy\nnature of this week\u2019s section. This will\nDEFINITELY not happen again.\nEnjoy the read, find a club to join and\nwith any luck it will be you making the\nback page next week!\n\n"

You can work that shit out\nfor yourself, because you\u2019re going to be\nso sick of asking people what they do in\nthree days\u2019 time that you\u2019re not going\nto care who I am anyway.\nActually, fuck not mentioning Freshers\u2019, let\u2019s really let off about it. Not the\nfirst years, mind you. Hordes of en-A. Geek\nthusiastic first years aren\u2019t the problem \u2013 and I actively encourage you to\nphysically assault anyone who mutters\nhow awful it is to have first years eve-rywhere, because they\u2019re morons \u2013 the\nreal problem are the elderly bastards\nlike me that seem intent on proving\ntheir youth, despite the fact that a look\nat their unused provisional drivers\u2019 licence would confirm it to the world.\n21 year-old men signing up to Ultimate\nFrisbee because they\u2019re self-conscious\nabout not being teenagers. Pathetic.\nAnd the sheer volume of utterly\npointless toss you end up attending\nbecause you\u2019re too bewildered by the\nfirst week to beat back the arseholes\ntouting them. A boat trip? Sounds like\na recipe for ball-freezingly cold enter-tainment! A party where we dress up\nin school uniform despite having spent\nan entirely non-sexy seven years wearing them and whining about it? Absofucking-lutely. I know! How about an\nethnic food night where we can all\nembarrass ourselves by revealing the\nextent of our slightly racist preconceptions about other cultures?\nI mean, who dreams up this shit?\nWhy does it appear entirely compul-sory? When I arrived at Uni, the first\nthing I wanted to do \u2013 after the mandatory half-hour spent in the fetal position \u2013 was take a look around the city.\nI was going to spend four years staring\ninto the hollow abyss of those mongoloid eyes anyway, I didn\u2019t need a pub\nquiz to ease me into the notion. My\nadvice to all freshers \u2013 spend the week\nexploring King\u2019s Road, Hyde Park and\nQueensway. Plenty of time for head-hunting later in the year, because the\nodds of finding anyone sane in the people mashup you\u2019re about to enter are\nvery small indeed.\nI\u2019ll offer you this, though \u2013 whether\nyou come from a wealthy family, or\narrived in London with nothing more\nthan your loan; whether English is your\nfirst language or your fourth; whether\nskyscrapers are familiar or frightening to you, you are about to embark on\nthe best years of your life so far. You\u2019ve\njust been given carte blanche to reinvent yourself, and then placed in a city\nfull of opportunity. Of course, you can\nchoose to become shallow, predictable\nand selfish, and you\u2019ll find it both simple and rewarding. Or you can think\nhard about who it is you want to be,\nand let the experiences you\u2019re about to\nhave inform, rather than control, who\nyou become.\nMost of you will choose the former.\nMany of you came here with exactly\nthat intention. Over the coming weeks\nI\u2019ll be letting you know exactly what I\nthink of that, along with Simon Cowell,\nstaff at Caffe Nero, Nick Clegg, people\nwho call me \u201cSir\u201d whilst smirking, the\nold woman from Eggheads, and anyone who works in Canary Wharf and\nwears something from The North Face\non their commute every day.\nI am A. Geek. The A stands for a\nlot of things. Let me know how your\nfirst week treats you by emailing anan-grygeek at googlemail dot com.\nStraight into the spirit of things. -ish\nGilead Amit\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nThe Student Hub is your one-stop shop for a variety of student services.

This one.\nThis precise, fleeting instant that will be gone by\nthe time the unswerving\nlaws of grammar compel my reluctant\nfingers to reach the next full stop. Because, you see, these are the five seconds I have in which to hook you into\nreading this article, and that sort of\npressure always gets to me. All I can do\nat this stage is hope that you\u2019ve reached\nthis far already and, if you are still out\nthere, I need to start making your reading time worthwhile. And fast.\nThe problem is that the pressure always arrives so suddenly. Here I am,\ntaking a quiet break in an unobtrusive\npart of the newspaper when your gaze\nsuddenly casts a brilliant spotlight over\nthe page. The beam rushes madly from\nside to side before coming across the\nmassive T typed above, singling me\nout to stand alone and quivering in\nthe glare of your critical searchlight.\n\u2018Dance for me, clown. Make me laugh\u2019.\nThe pressure is stultifying. How would\nyou like it if I only gave you 163 words\nin which to prove your worth?\nDrat. I\u2019ve put my foot in it. Damn,\ndamn, damn. Already. I knew I should\nhave taken more time over this.\nThe fact is that I was trying to break\nsomething to you gently. Because \u2013\nwell, there is no easy way of saying\nthis. You see, this week \u2013 and for this\nweek only \u2013 I\u2019m leading a double life.\nI\u2019m cheating on you behind your back.\nWell, in front of your front, to be hon-est, because I\u2019m being unfaithful right\nnow; by attempting the impossible task\nof pleasing two readers at once. I don\u2019t\nactually mean that there are currently\nonly two people casting their eyes over\nthis page. No, that would be absurd.\nMy readership is vast. Colossal. In fact,\nif all my readers were laid horizontally\nand placed head to toe, then the resulting chain would...er\u2026well\u2026um\u2026look\nfaintly ridiculous. But seriously, what I\nmean to say is that there are two distinct personae casting their eyes over\nthis page. Two archetypes, if you will\nallow me to do to Jung what Oedipus\ndid to his mother for a moment. And\nbeing the lovely physicist that I am I\nwill, in my lovely physicist way, refer to\nyou two as Alice and Bob.\nNow you, Alice, are a fresh-faced,\nrosy-limbed young fresher. Twinkly of\neye, bushy of tail, supple of limb and\nsmooth of skin, you are as attractive a\ncorner of the readership market as one\ncould hope to be writing for.\nBob, on the other hand, is entering\nyet another year at Imperial. The experiences of university life have irrevocably changed him into a sadder, yet\nwiser man. He\u2019s been around the block\na few times, and the view has been\nso mind-numbingly depressing that\nhe insists on returning here. Bob has\nheard it all before and, quite frankly,\nhe\u2019s sick of hearing it again. With the\nmajestic changing of the seasons, he\nhas seen past issues of felix dissolve\ninto compost, words that took weeks\nto put together ripped apart in seconds\nby the unforgiving elements and the\nmost witty, engaging and challenging\nof columnists slowly fade away to be\nreplaced by people like me. With the\nmaturity and cynicism born of years\nspent in this place, Bob has little patience for the frilly idealism and whimsical humour that might send Alice into\ngiddy fits of exhilaration. Bob, in other\nwords, has no Barack Obama sticker\non his (clearly) Microsoft laptop.\nAnd this, dearest Alice and Bob, is\nwhere the horns of the dilemma on\nwhich I am sitting start causing irreparable damage to my fleshy parts. How\ndo I keep Alice entertained without\ncausing Bob to foam at the mouth at\nmy naive and optimistic pandering?\nAnd, no less importantly, how do I\nkeep Alice from closing the paper in\ntears at the sight of the naked, unadulterated cynicism coursing through my\nveins?\nWell, darling Alice and Bob, me ol\u2019\nsweetheart, it looks like I won\u2019t have to\nanswer that particular question today.\nThe coward\u2019s way out, certainly, but\n\u2018he who writes and runs away should\nnever ever end a comment piece on a\npun that abysmally bad.\u2019\nEditor\nHere we go...\nA\nnother year, another fe-lix, another editor. To all\nof you who voted for me,\na big thanks; to all of you\nwho didn\u2019t, you\u2019ve got me\nanyway; and for all of those who don\u2019t\ncare or know who I am, oh well!\nI am the new editor, and things are\ngoing to change. I will actually stick to\nmy manifesto points and ensure that\nyou guys get a fun yet highly informative paper. Yes, it sounds like a whole\nlot of crap, but I thought I might as well\ndo my obligatory start of year editorial\nrant. Fair enough, I did say things are\ngoing to change, and as you may have\nnoticed, I didn\u2019t mean visually.\nSo to all of you out there who are\nwondering what exactly I am going to\nchange, well, here it is. Work is already\nunderway on creating a new felix ar-chive. Come the new year, every issue\nof felix since the first one in 1949 will\nhave been digitised and indexed, making it easier for you guys to search for\nexactly what you\u2019re looking for. Clubs\nand Societies will be able to look up\ntheir history and browse through photos from the past. Alumni will be able\nto read through news articles from\nthe years they were at college, whilst\nthe general population can just have a\nlook at what we students have thought\nabout college life for the past 59 years.\nCoffee Break is back and although\nquite a few of you won\u2019t remember\nwhat that is, you can probably guess\nthat it\u2019s the section you\u2019re likely to read\nwhen having a break or just bored in\nlectures! Competitions will be run, and\nhopefully I\u2019ll be able to sort out some\nprizes. Page 3 will be made fun and\nslightly competitive, with the introduction of Mr and Miss Imperial. Basically,\nevery week there will be a competition\nfor the best-looking male and female\nfrom each department; with students\nthen voting for their favourite and\nthe winner being announced the next\nweek. You can either submit your own\nphoto or you can come in to the office\nand we\u2019ll arrange for one to be taken of\nyou. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll\nbring back all the winners and then\npick the eventual winner. The winners\nwill receive \u00a3250 each!\nI,science and Phoenix will be bigger\nand better than before and we are planning on bringing out two new magazines this year: Another Castle, which\nwill be for all those gaming enthusiasts\n(read: geeks) out there, and a one-off\nsport magazine to come out after varsity for all the sporty types out there.\nLastly, the more serious side of the\npaper will remain. The news will be\nhard-hitting and to the point. I promise that we will not hide away from\nstories, if there is something out there\nthat the student body deserves to hear,\nwe will print it.\nThe cat, my friends, will be free!\n\n"

You\nweren\u2019t actually\ndying this week.\nYou will now spend the rest of your life in\nprison, where it is shank or be shanked... in\nthe ass. Don\u2019t worry though, you\u2019ll only have\nto drop the soap for another week; that is until\nyou also die of internal bleeding. Mr Hands\nanyone??!? 2 guys 1 horse, check it.\nScorpio\nThis week you\nand your partner\nwill decide to take\nyour relationship\nto the next level\nby being more\nopen with other people. Next time you meet\na ridiculously handsome specimen of a man,\nwho works in the Felix office and has a sick\nsense of humour, sleep with him. Take that\nchance. You won\u2019t regret it until the doctor\ntells you you\u2019re pregnant. Honest.\nLibra\nIt will be a rather\nquiet week for you;\nan absence of bad\ninfluences provides\na welcome break\nafter the hectic,\nroller-coaster ride that has been the last 2\ndrug-filled weeks. Make the most of it: Use the\nevenings for some chill-out time in order to\nindulge/pleasure yourself to The Best of Barry\nWhite.\nSagittarius\nThis week you\nwere working for\nImperial College\nresidences, making\nthe Welcome Packs\nthat all freshers find\nin their room upon arrival at their halls. What\nnobody knows is that you used a needle to put\nholes in every single condom handed out to\nfreshers. That\u2019s right, if you sleep with anyone\nyou will become a parent. See, it\u2019s easy to find\nexcuses to why you\u2019re not getting any.\nCapricorn\nThis week you type\nthe final words of\nthe 1st edition of\nFelix 2008/2009.\nYou tell yourself that\nyou\u2019ve done a good\njob and that the Freshers will enjoy it and that\nthey will join the team and continue to read\nFelix throughout the year. You tell yourself that\nif they don\u2019t you will take a knife and cut off\ntheir digits, slowly, one by one.\nCancer\nIn a strange\ncoincidence you\nhave cancer. How\nfunny. The doctors\nwill tell you it had\nsomething to do\nwith spending all of your day in front of the\ncomputer. Jupiter demands you stop this right\naway. It\u2019s wrong to watch german scheize porn\nall day while you danger crank. Stop now and\nyou\u2019ll be granted a swift but still painful death.\nGemini\nBeing a socially\ninept bastard has\nhardened you. This\nweek you\u2019ll make\nmillions by investing\nin the economy (no\nseriously). Looks like being a wanker paid off.\nUnfortunately to get your funds you are forced\nto give your account details to a nigerian man\ncalled Lenard. He steals your money, sleeps\nwith your wife and burns your house down.\nServes you right for being successful.\nLeo\nYou will die this\nweek. I read it in\nmy tea leaves. It was\neither death or lots\nof sex... followed by\ndeath. There\u2019s no\nway out now. I see you doing something more\nmeaningful with your time left. Something\nalong the lines of helping children becoming\nterminally ill. I mean giving STD\u2019s to pristine\nfreshers. I mean... I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t think of\nanything thats not offensive! Help me.\nTaurus\nThis week your\nfriends have\nchanged the language settings on\nFacebook to English\n(pirate). Not to feel\nleft out you promptly do the same. Too bad\nyou don\u2019t have a fucking clue what anything\nmeans. While the other kids played pirate,\nyou were playing merchant banker. Who\u2019s the\nwanker now? You! Thats who! The gods do not\nfavour you. Not at all.\nAries\nThis week the only\npeople turning up\nto your funeral is\nyour mother and\nyour illegitmate\nchild. I would use\nthe word funeral very loosely. A more accurate\ndescription is your body being buried at the\nbottom of a council dumpster. Don\u2019t worry;\nyour after life won\u2019t get any worse. It won\u2019t get\nany better either. Fail.\nPisces\nThis week, a blood\ntest reveals high\namounts of THC in\nyour blood. This just\nconfirms everyone\u2019s\nsuspicions that\nyou\u2019re a drag on the economy and solely to\nblame for the current credit crisis. The former\nCEO of Lehman Brothers phones you up\nand curses to you to hell. Added to this, all\nImperial students hate you because they won\u2019t\nget jobs as bankers anymore... lol\nHoroscopes. Abusive, sick & morbid. The way they should be.\nAquarius\nThis week you arrive at university full\nof life, ambition and\ngood intentons. Too\nbad you\u2019re a CUNT!\nThat\u2019s right, you\nknow it, the heavens know it and everyone else\nat IC knows it. Only one thing left for you to\ndo; and that is to throw yourself from the top\nof the Beit compound. Imagine it now, your\nbody splattered across the quad. Pidgeons\nfeeding off your corpse.\nDon\u2019t ever do badly-dressed girls\nI\nf you are reading this, chances\nare you are a dude. If you are a\ndude, more likely than not, you\nhave trouble getting laid. If you\nare a dude at Imperial, the outlook is even more grim and I highly\ndoubt you will get any action\nwhatsoever this year. This is\nmostly due to the fact that\nyou study something incredibly lame like Geopetroleum\nScience, have long greasy black\nhair and look like more of a tool\nthan your cousin who\u2019s ranked 7th\nin the county for Magic The Gathering. Yes you will hear this a lot but\nthats just because I have lots of sex and\nI like to rub it in.\nIf, for some odd reason, you managed to fall through the sieve and are\nnot absurdly hideous, you may just\nhave some luck with any of the 7 girls\non campus. (I am sleeping with 3 out\nof 7 as I write this... just so you know\nyou\u2019ll be getting sloppy seconds).\nSo as the only man on campus who\nhas other people to jack him off, let me\ngive you some sock-rocking advice.\nDo NOT have sex with girls wearing ordinary clothes. Period. By this, I\nmeanshittyjeansfromTopshop,dread-ful Camden t-shirts and faded brown\noversized pleather boots from \u201cthis really cute vintage place in Shoreditch\u201d.\nYou may be thinking you\u2019ll undress\nthe bitch so fast it won\u2019t matter. Given\nyour lack of expertise in the field, you\nare clearly wrong. Also an idiot. And\nalso a failure at life, but that\u2019s beside\npoint. If you take a girl up to the miniscule box you have christened a room,\nyou will have to watch her take it all\noff, and because her clothes suck, it\u2019ll\ntake forever. She\u2019ll undo her laces, remove her shoes and you will witness\nher ghastly white socks that have seen\nworse days than a Vietnamese hooker\nin central Hanoi. Her badly cut toenails\nwill ensure you will lose any prospect\nof a boner for the next couple of years.\nYou see fashion is a great indication\nof what the girl will be like. Horrible\nsocks, horrible toe-nails. Terrible lip-stick, terrible blow-jobs. Do you get\nwhat I\u2019m saying?\nThe solution to this problem is Slutty\nunderwear. You must at all times keep\nin your room trashy lingerie for potential female visitors (hopefully only\nthose not related to you by blood).\nThe second the subject walks in, you\ndirect her to the bathroom and give\nher exactly 2 minutes to get changed\ninto the corset and stockings. If she\nfails at this, it clearly means she is\nunable to follow directions and\ninstruction from those in positions of authority. At this stage\nyou must remember why the\ndominant alpha male has persistently been better at most\nstuff than XX chromosome\nbeings and promptly kick her\nout of your room. No discus-sion, no moronic questions. By the\nway, all men at Imperial are badly\ndressed.

I am\nthe Coffee Break Editor.\nAt this point I would like\nto mention that I don\u2019t\nnormally look like a pirate, although\nI\u2019m starting to believe otherwise from\nall the comments I receive. I\u2019m even\nthinking of taking off the eye patch after ten months.\nThis year I hope to bring to you a\ndifferent side to felix. Coffee Break has\nbeen given a budget of \u00a31 bajillion so\nyou can expect lots of light humour,\ncompetitions and light reading articles that\u2019ll bring a smile to your face\n(results may vary). For those of you\nwho remember Coffee Break... forget\nit. The only thing I can see returning\nis the FUCWIT league and the com-petitions. Admitedly that is all Coffee\nBreak was before, but it\u2019s different this\ntime. That\u2019s right; no more David Hasslehoff, Chuck Norris or competent\nediting. Come on, did you really think\nthey were good role models for the average Imperial student? No. They were\nway too homoerotic. However, there\nwill be some new charcters that some\nwould say are more student targeted....\nSikh MC comes to mind. Thats right,\nI\u2019m Indian, and the first thing I introduce is an Punjabi gangster rapper.\nAlso look out for Snakey B, the pint\nof snake bite with a pint and a half of\nuncommon sense. This totally had\nnothing to do with being so drunk you\nthink your pint is talking to you. We\u2019ve\nall been there. We\u2019ve all done it.\nWhat am I currently doing for you,\nthe eager, loyal Impeial College wast-ers? Well first off I made this super\npullout with the Hangman Team. It\nwas hard work, but I can already tell\nyou guys \u2018n\u2019 gals will love it. It is with\ngreat modesty I claim that this pullout\nis the greatest thing this newspaper has\never seen. Too bad some editors didn\u2019t\nmake the effort; resulting in the welfare\npage. Well thats enough on boosting\nmy ego. What else will I be doing for\nyou? How about iPods. As mentioned\nbefore we have a budget this year.\nMoney = Prizes. Currently I\u2019m tring to\nhaggle as many iPods as I can for you\nmusic lovin\u2019 peeps to win in the afore-mention FUCKWIT league. Not only\niPods, video games aswell. Courtesy of\nGamestation Hounslow, video games\nshould be on the way. What games?\nWho knows, but it\u2019s free. That\u2019s all we\nstudents care about really. It\u2019s like Yogi\nBear and picnic baskets.\nBTW if you like/dislike anything you\nread on these pages, tough. I have no\ncontrol over Hangman. It\u2019s purely coincidental that we\u2019re in the same section.\nWIN\nT\nhink you got mad skillz?!? Own an Apple Mac? Are you that guy who painted the Mona Lisa in MS Paint?

Email your entry to coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n1. Calculus:\nMention Calculus to any normal guy\nand they\u2019ll shiver as bad as felix cat\nsubmerged in a bucket of ice. Students of Imperial College, however,\nare not normal. It may have something to do with the high percentage of overseas students, but isn\u2019t it\nmore likely due to the hours of fun\none can have integrating spherical\npolar co-ordinates? Don\u2019t kid yourself by saying you don\u2019t know what\nthat means... you do! and you like it.\nI\u2019ve see many an IC student make\nthe log cabin joke, and even more\nstudents laughing back. This merely\nvalidates this week\u2019s entry to the\n\u201cStuff IC Students Like\u201d list. Excuse\nthe clich\u00e9, but \u201cOnly at Imperial\u201d do\nthe words \u201clet\u2019s perform calculus in\nCovent Garden to raise money\u201d get\nspoken.\nLet\u2019s face it, even the chatup lines\ninvolve calculus. Ever heard \u201cI wish I\nwere your differential so I could lay\ntanget to your curves\u201d before? No?\nYeah?.... Yeah you have.\nCoffee Break\n2. pr0n:\nThere is a very sound reason Imperial\nkids are enamored with pornography.\nApart from an unhealthy obsession\nwith all things nerdy, porn is the one\nelement that brings all Imperial guys\ntogether. Bashing the bishop over\nsome rotter being pounded to an inch\nof her life is only bettered by the su-per-fast T1, designed for education,\ninternet connection in your halls.\nYou see, in a College of only 8 girls\nthat aren\u2019t uglier than Ann Widecombe the lonely male student will\nquickly turn to massivehooters.com\nto quell those desires that haunt us all.\nPersonally I like the more camp websites like nakedboysinhats.org and\nnodaddynotthathard.co.uk.\nPlease note, though, that College\nICT may get annoyed if they find\nyou have been downloading enough\nporn to shock Ted Bundy. If this does\nhappen, your internet access may be\nbanned for a short time and you may\nhave to resort to stealing Wi-Fi off the\nChurch next door.

Are you\nready to rock London to\nits foundations? Yeah?\nSorry no.\nUnfortunately you are simply not\ncool enough for London. In terms of\ncoolness, the bar is about 6ft 3 high\nand you\u2019ve barely hit 2. Confused? Let\nme break it down.\nRoss Goldberg\nReally Fat Dead Guy\nThe first thing that makes you un-cool is your choice of university. You\ndid one of two things. You either applied to Oxbridge and got rejected\nand rejects are definitely not cool. Or\nyou actually put Imperial as your first\nchoice\u2026 oh dear.\nThe second thing that makes you un-cool is your face\u2026 sorry that\u2019s imma-ture. The actual second reason is your\nmom. Anyway, if you are anything like\nevery other Imperial student you do\nnot know how to dress. This is not a\ngood thing in London.\nWhether you are in Oxford Street,\nShoreditch, Southbank or on the Kings\nRoad you will notice that people actually make an attempt to co-ordinate,\naccessorise and generally wash. You\nwould do well to take note of this be-haviour; especially the washing. I know\nits hard to keep track of personal hygiene when gaming, but make an ef-fort. To summarise: people can still\nsmell you through your Trackies and\nhoodies (which you shouldn\u2019t be wearing anyway)\nThe third reason that you fail to live\nup to the ridiculously high level of\ncoolness that we Londoners have established is because you don\u2019t own a\nfedora hat. You are literally not allowed\nto register to vote in London until you\npurchase a fedora. Thats right, Ken\nLivingstone lost because lefties are un-cool and the famous \u2018BJ fedora\u2019 picture,\nseen above. If you have never seen this\npicture before it\u2019s because, like the title\nsuggests, you are mega lame.\nSexy chat up lines for Freshers\n\u201cI SWEAR, I\u2019m bigger\nin the metric system\u201d\n\u201cWhat subject\ndo you do? It\ndoesn\u2019t matter,\nget naked and\nlook at my\nlong Int type\u201d\n\"I\u2019ll give you an A for HOT\"\n\"There's a university in\nmy pants, and you\u2019re\naccepted\"\nThey worked on us, now they\u2019ll work for us.\nPlaces to go \u2013 Hangman recommends\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHangman\nLeroy\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Bar \u2013 50s style\ndiner playing funky\njazz and 80\u2019s Brooklyn soul.

Add us and we\npromise to perhaps sometimes entertain you with comical status updates,\nphoto raping and much much (read\nmuch less) more. You might even get\nspammed with lots of invites to awesome Felix Hangman events...\nSome old folks enjoying Saleem\u2019s\nGo-Karting Haven.\nHangman\nReporting from Iraq\nO\nh hai! Do not mistake\nmy friendliness for re-spect. I have nothing\nbut the highest level of\ndisdain for all my peers,\nespecially you filthy freshers.\nNo, I was never a fresher. I started\nuniversity as a final year student because I have an IQ of 205 and a rich\nfather. Needless to say, I am better at\nMaths, Engineering and getting chicks\ninto the 69 position than you.\nMaybe the Hangman section is \u2018silly\u2019\nor \u2018a waste of time\u2019 and just maybe you\nwon\u2019t get half the jokes that I make.\nBut maybe, just maybe I fucked your\nmom. If you didn\u2019t like that little quip,\nyou won\u2019t like many of my humorous\njibes. Every now and again I may offer\nsome useful advice or maybe you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m saying to you. These\nmoments will be few and far between\nso savour them.\nThis issue, worringly enough, contains a number of these moments. If\nyou\u2019re bored you can try checking out\nsome of the places we\u2019ve recommended\n(see left) or if you\u2019re struggling to pull\nmembers of the opposite sex (guaran-teed) try out some of the chat-up lines\nwe\u2019ve proffered for you.\nIt\u2019s very likely that as a female reading the Hangman section, you will\nfeel excluded, insulted and a general\ndistaste in the back of your mouth. I\u2019ll\nlet you figure out what the next joke\nshould be. You can\u2019t figure it out? Idiot, it\u2019s SPERM! To get back to what I\nwas meaning to say, we don\u2019t get much\ndaylight in the felix office or female\ninteraction (sometimes Hannah Theodorou visits but she doesn\u2019t count; if\nyou ever meet the DPEW, you\u2019ll realise\nwhy). So if you are a female Imperial\nstudent, come on down to the Felix\noffice, or look for our stall at Freshers\nFair, and join our team. You can help\nus add some misandry to this misogynistic and misanthropic section of the\nawesome felix.\nI bet you fucking freshers got scared\nby the big words didn\u2019t you?

Open every weekday 10:00am\nto 5:00pm. \u00a320 per person. Not only\nthat, if you book in advance you get a\nfree lollipop and a condom. Now that\u2019s\nwhat we call service.\n\n"
