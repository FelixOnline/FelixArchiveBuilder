    "content": "10 1*^* Film 17 May 1999\nReviews\nForces of Nature * * *\nStarring : Sandra Bullock, Ben Affleck, Steve Zahn, Maura Tierney\nDirector: Bronwen Hughes\nI arrived at the cinema in a less than\nhopeful mood. Posters and trailers\nfor Forces of Nature had led me to believe that this was to beano sur pris es, no laughs, no-thinking-required\nromance, in traditionally generic Sandra\nBullock style. Consequently, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie that flickered up on to the screen in front of me. OK, so it's still far from perfect (the cast-ing's odd, the romance is stilted and the plot twists are predictable) but it's entertaining enough to keep you and your\nplus one amused, nonetheless( like\nmost romantic comedies, this is the territory of early dates and sad romantics).\nIndeed, there' s definite signs of potential here, and Forces of Nature\ncould actually be a really good movie if\nit wasn't for the strange casting decisions clearly made by lazy execs looking for easy bank a bill ty. The script calls for\nour two protagonists to be of the opp o sites-attract variety: she's a wild-child -twice married, teenage mother, exotic\ndancer, lives for kicks, can con her way out of any situation etc etc etc; he' s straight-laced and down-to earth -engaged( and on the way to his we dAh yes - It's the Industry standard run n lng through-the-ral n sequence.\nding), career minded, plays up the odds\nin every situation blah blah blah. And who' s cast in these disparate roles? Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. Huh? Thirt y something girl next door type Bullock\nis mid-t we nl ics rebel, whilst hunk-of-the-moment Affleck is called upon to act\nlike a plank - surely some mistake? Well\nyes, it clearly is, because, apart from their\nreal-life age gap( just shy of ten years),\nthe roles simply don't reflect what they\ndo best, and thus a pair of charismatic\nactors are left treading water around each other on screen.\nThat aside, however, the pro duc tion follows the current trend toward\nthree-minute MTV style segments, with\nsome nice soundtrack picks overlaid with\nSandy-and-Ben running in the rain in\nslow-mo, weaving through traffic, playing on the roof of their train and so-on.\nIt's the kind of directing that's currently\ntaking a lot of flack from critics, but it\nactually makes for a fun( albeit bitty)\nmovie after all, this is hardly supposed to be high-art.\nIf all that sounds too negative, then\ndon't discard Forces of Natureyel - it's a decent movie nonetheless. Whilst not\nparticularly engaging as a romantic cou-ple, Affleck and Bullock's adventures are\ndistracting and diverse enough to pro-v idea break from the usual action/\nromance divide. Ignore the casting,\nenjoy the soundtrack, accept the predictable chee sines s of the whole thing,\nand relax...and don't say I didn't warn\nyou. Q Dave\nThe Idiots * * * *\nStarring : Bordil Jorgenson, Jens Albinus, Anne Louise Hassing\nDirector: Lars Von Trier\nIts grainy; Its weird; It's got lots of nudity - It must be Danish\nFollowing on from Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration\n(released last month), The Idiots is\nthe latest movie to emi nate from the back-to-basics renaissance currently\ndominating Danish cinema. The current\nvogue( much talked about in arty film\ncircles across Europe) is the result of the Dogma95 Collective - a group of four\nprominent Danish directors who have\nsigned what they describe as a'Vow of Chastity' to govern how they produce their work. The agreement bars them from using soundtrack music, lighting,\nexcessive action or bulky cameras - and consequently, all Dogma movies must\nbe entirely shot on location, with hand held cameras. Quite clearly, grainy and low budget is the order of the day.\nSurprisingly (considering the declaration is really just one big gimmick) the\nfilms produced by the directors concerned have been almost universally\npraised - and The Idiots is no exception.\nAlthough it may have attracted more publicity for the trouble surrounding its\nrelease (the BBFC were initially unwilling\nto grant a certificate to a movie containing an uncensored group orgy), Von Trier\nreally deserves massive recognition for his\nability to tell such a compelling story with\nsuch backward technology-just imagine\nSteven Speilberg trying to make his next\nmovie with $20 000 and a Hand i cam. Like the style, the story itself could easily\nbe accused of deliberately seeking pub-li city, as we follow a group of( very\nstrange) middle class Danes who( for no\nreadily apparent reason) entertain them selves by pretending to be mentally hand-i capped. Obviously, it's all a metaphor for\nrelaxing your inhibitions and expressing\nyour real emotions, but whilst it starts\nout as merely amusing, it rapidly becomes\nby turns haunting, frenzied and heartfelt.\nDespite the total in comprehensibility of much of the story (you'll constantly\nbe trying to work out what was going on\nin the previous scene), watching The\nIdiots is a profoundly affecting experience. Dogma95 certainly isn't the future\nof Hollywood( whatever the critics say,\nbudgets and technology will continue to\nspiral until cinema is finally overtaken by\nthe next mass medium), but in certain\nspecific cases - and for certain specific\ndirectors - it's a brilliant way to tell a story in a poignant, incredibly personal,\nmanner, fl\nDave\n\n"

The panel featured Patrick Harverson, a journalist from the Financial Times, as well as Dr Rogan Taylor, Director of the Football Research Unit at Liverpool University.\nDr Stefan S zy man ski and Tim Ku y per s were the other panel members and it\nwas their book,' Winners and Losers:\nthe Business Strategy of Football' which was being promoted that day.\nTony Banks MP, the Minister for Sport,\nwas also due to be present but had to cancel his appearance. Dr S zy man ski, a member of the faculty at the Management School, and Mr Ku y per s, discussed parts of their book which used extensive statistical and documentary evidence to illustrate how football works as a bus i ness, and the techniques of business strategy which explain why some clubs\nare winners and others are not. Dr\nS zy man ski then noted that two basic relations governed football. The first\nwas that the greater the wage expenditure by a club, the higher its league position. The second was that the By Mansoor Choudhury\nhigher the league position the greater\nthe amount of revenue accrued from sponsors, broadcasters and a growing In need of regulation?\nPhoto: Archive\nfanbase. Despite this, football clubs\nshow low profits since the costs of the game in real terms are growing fast.\nMr Ku y per s then took over. He examined the question as to whether football could be classed as an indus try in such away as for it to warrant\nregulation like the water or the tele-com industries. For example, could Live r pool be said to have a monopoly on Liverpool games and thus need regulation, or were they merely one small\nfragment of a much larger entertainment industry? An illustration of this\nwas that if Liverpool put their prices up significantly, would the fans accept the increased costs or would they start\ngoing to Everton games? Mr Kuypers\nsaid that points to be considered on the question of a regulator included what effect it may have on the quality\nof the game, since English clubs now more than ever competed in a worldwide market, and whether any regulator would be worth the cost and the burden. Mr Harverson then brought Dr Taylor into the discussion. Dr Taylor was probably the most eloquent of the speakers present. Dr Taylor holds a PhD in primitive religion, which he remarked was useful for his work in\nfootball. Dr Taylor, like the others, didn't seem to have any concrete views on the form of any football regulator,\nbut appeared to favour a quasi-gov-ern mental body like the one operating in the Netherlands. He said that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission( MM C), in their report which rejected\nBSkyB's bid for Manchester United, implied that there was a need for a football regulator to protect the interests of smaller clubs. Interestingly,\nLabour MP Gerry Sutcliffe has begun preliminary moves in the House of Commons to bring about a public football regulator.\nCandon Wins Comedy Semi-Finals\nFor budding stand-up comedians, the best starting point is undoubtedly open-mic contests. Thus, throughout the year a massive number of people enter the biggest and best such com petition, the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Awards, and the best are invited to perform a short set as support to regular evenings on the comedy network. Those who acquit themselves well are then selected to qualify for regional semi-finals, where they compete for the chance togo to the televised finals\nat the Edinburgh fringe with the chance to win \u00a32000, spots at both the Melbourne and Montreal comedy fes-ti vals, and a place on the National Comedy Network. Consequently, twelve brave contestants gathered in dB'son Friday 12 May for the London play-off,\nlooking for a friendly reception and a chance to become the 'next big thing'. The night was comp ered by Chris\nAddison, who kicked the event off with\nmore of the light-hearted rambling style\nthat went down so well when he By David Roberts\nplayed his full set here last month. Indeed, his dominating approach, which immediately puts would be hecklers in their place, was the ideal opening for such an event after all,\nthe acts are all\n(by definition) amateurs, performing under a great deal of stage-fright and stress already, so the last thing they want to be faced with is a hostile IC audience. The contestants themselves were of a surprisingly high standard, with\nthe vast majority receiving enough laughs to acquit\nthe mse lv es well.\nTheir styles varied dramatically,\nhowever, so whilst one or\ntwo opted for traditional stand up style\ndelivery( in a Frank Skinner-y kind of way), and one of the female contenders based her act on sub-Jo Brand sex gags, most opted for a more contemporary, rambling style.\nNonetheless, we were also treated to\nJonny Can don sports his own name label\nPhoto: Dave\nthe regulation pair of novelty acts - in\nthis case, a poet( with the kind of clever, amusing material that gets\napplause rather than laughs) and a girl\nwho played the recorder with her nose\n(novel, as it's very rare to see variety\nacts on the circuit - however, as her act\nwas pretty dire, it's easy to see why). Knocking out these unlikely contenders narrowed the field down to\nhalf-a dozen good acts, all fairly similar\nin their style and delivery indeed, between them they shared many common subject areas, with supermarkets and shopping popular theme s.How ever, light-hearted Irishman Jonny Can don nudged himself ahead of the field\nthanks to his deceptively confident approach and fresh jokes putting name labels on spiders and serial killers\nto make them less frightening for example and picked up the semi-final\ntrophy and a place in the final. If this\nperformance is anything togo by,\nexpect to see him appearing on a stage\nnear you soon.

In this their second discography the\nlabel have employed stable favourite\nNigel Dawson (Renaissance resident and\nthe man behind Dominion), to mix the\nbest of their recent releases.

Apart\nfrom the ridiculous title, Badder Badder\nSchwlng Is a cracker of a tune, if not surprisingly similar to the Fatboy's current\noffering. The B sides are a Spanish rap-style e tune and a track that's either been\nlifted from a70s cop show or a porno;\nit's still cool though.\nAnother offering from the second\nrate indie boys, Gene. Fill Her Up is\nupbeat for a change but Martin Rossiter\nstill sounds like he wants to be Morrissey\nand he doesn't succeed in my book,\nunless you count depressing me. There's also only the title track on this, which is\npoor. They must have some other tunes\nknocking about that they could have put\non here.\nHe's a strange fish, Moby. He used\nto be all heavy metal, then techno, then\nwas lo-fi-ta stic. Not original, granted,\nthough it has a raw edge that appeals\nand the chorus is melodic and grating at\nthe same time. Weird, huh?\nheavy again, now this. He's got a sample of The Landfordaires who sound like\na barbershop quartet, but it gels\nextremely well with the beat and melody\nof Run On The B sides are a moody-yet-ambient instrumental followed by a moody-yet-slightly-less-ambient in s tru mental. Uplifting nevertheless.\nA distinct west coast USA sound\nerring on the heavy side of things during\nthe verses is the order of the day here.\nBright and breezy vocals on Wiser contribute to an apple-pie chorus akin to\nmusic in that oh-so contrived AOR vein.\nMany guitar bands are using big beat\ndrum sounds to give their music an edge\nand Soundproof are no exception. A thoroughly unexpected release, perfect\nfor the coming summer months.\nStony Sleep throw up a passable single that's a fusion of Placebo meets Bush\nmeets Moist (remember them Beavis\nand Butthead fans?). Using the Seattle\ntradition of soft, quiet verse and angst-ridden, punchy chorus Khartoum treads\nthe well-trodden path. The second track\nhas some Korn-ish drums to lift it above\nthe mediocre, but the whole thing reeks\nof un originality. There's a very homegrown feel to\nthe sleeve of this 7\" and I liked it. These\nPeople has got the whole garage thing\ngoing on but with a soft lilting female\nvoice, distorted guitars and decidedly\nprimitive production. Think indie and\nthen par it down to proper lo-fi quality\nand you've got Spraydog. And that's the\nreal indie music. CI\nChristian\nFirst of the latest releases comes\nfrom Penthouse. Crashing in with a nonstop barrage of noise and testosterone,\nCreeper's Reef eventually settles down\ninto the rhythmic pounding of guitars\nand drums that the latest teenage tear-away in Neighbours will play on the Coffee Shop jukebox, much to the chagrin\nof Harold, no doubt.\nSuper Bowl Sundae is a distinctly\nHispanic concoction of hip-hop, percussive dub and reggae beats, with some\nchilled-out rapping over the top. OzomaIti are about as cool as the Fun Lovin'\nCriminals think they are.\nCarrot Rope signifies that Pavement\nare back from, erm, wherever they've\nbeen and are on good form with this\ntrack of wah-wah infused ball a dry. However, excepting that annoying American\nvocal twang, they're still too much like\nThe Beatles to be classed as original.\nJust some random and very quiet\nnoises really. What Labradford are saying\non E lux o so is unclear. Probably some\npre-mili eni al babble about the futility of\nour own existence, but it really is just\nsome random and very quiet noises.\nAfter all the Nazi, 1960's, Indian and\nposh-kid accusations thrown at Crispian\nMills and his merry band, Kula Shaker\nshould have returned with a classic\nalbum that headed off in a completely\nnew direction to silence all those critics.\nBut they just went and gave us the same\nstuff, only slower and not as good. Which\nis what Shower Your Love is.\nStop the Press! The Llama Farmers\nGet The Keys And Go. Probably not actually llama farmers, unless the foothills of\nthe Andes have changed drastically since\nmy geography A level. Pretty much what\nyou'd expect of late '90's indie/hard rock\nbands that sometimes brings fame but\nusually brings now t. The Soundtrack Of Our Lives? Hmm.\nThat's surprising. I thought Avenger Hill\nStreet Blues was by Ocean Colour Scene\nuntil the voices proved otherwise. As did\na deep and distant influence from The\nMonkees hiding somewhere in there.\nMaybe these are The Monkees.\nThe first taster from the Super Furry\nAnimals' third album comes twelve\nmonths after the release of Ice Hockey\nHair, one of the most ingenious songs of\nlast year. Northern Lltes is clearly not up\nto that high standard but is still highly\nenjoyable with its Latin-American beats\nchugging along throughout.\nObviously given its surrounding context of animation and adult humour,\nthere is much to like about Simultaneous\n- the second slice from the Chef Aid\nalbum. The title refers to the Chef's sexual preference (i.e. everyone at once)\nand the lyrics are full of the expected\ndouble entendres. However, as a song\non its own, it doesn't 'stand up.\nCyclefly are indie punk rockers with\nboth a female and male singer. Although\npotentially really good, there is little to\nseparate Supergod from the rest of the\ngenre.\nThe standard strum my indie fare\nfrom Silverchair with the vocals equal\nparts Damon Albarn and Thorn Yorke.\nAna's Song (Open Fire) is on the verge\nof being good but hasn't quite got what\nit takes.

Deeply distorted bass\nholds sway while Gary (vocals) does the\nbusiness with his extremely gravely and\ndistinctive voice. It all calms down a bit\nafter that without the first single from\nthe album I 've Cot Something to Saydoubtless you have heard this already\nbut suffice to say it's a charmingly crisp\nand sweet song that lifts you up nicely.\nAs for the rest, there arc some\nHey guys, the camera's over here.\nweaker songs. Metro is one - the song\nnever really grabbed me - even with\nrepeated listening it didn't click the way\nmost of Reef's best work does. Sweety\nis another track that doesn't quite hit the\nspot for me. Electronic influences start to\nshow which just seem to have been put\nin for their own sake - and the track suffers for it. And there are too many\nn aaaa as!( Listen and you will under-stand). Love Feeder has no real climax,\nit just meanders along, not really engaging the listener at any point. And some\npointless strings don't help.\nBut don't worry - there are a couple\nof gems in amongst the rest. Reef get\nfunky with Wandering, a homesick song\nwith an addictive main riff weaving its\nway thorough the tune. Hiding reminded\nme of classic Simon and Garfunklc, complete with some hand clapping. It noodles along nicely, building all the time\ninto a great primal display of vocal talent\nfrom Gary. Undone and Sober, a darker\nsong than most of the album - a lot of\nanger is expressed in this song - and a determination to make things better in\nthe future. Who You Arenas a decidedly\npunk y edge - this is a take no prisoners\nsong. Something to get psyched up to.\nIt also includes a great line about fab our that I will leave you to discover. Right at\nthe end of the album Electric Sunday gets\nmixed in - simply an acoustic guitar,\nsome doo from Gary and an organ.\nIt is enough of a change from previous efforts? Probably not. Do they still\nrock? Yep. Does Gary have one of the\nmost incredible voices in the UK scene?\nU huh. Should you buy it? Well, be ready\nfor a brace of weak tracks - but the good\njust about outweighs the bad. EH\nJoel\nDAWN OF THE REPLICANTS\nWrong Town, Wrong Planet, 3 Hours Late\nTHE FALL\nThe Marshall Suite\nShould have checked the\ntimetable lads.\nAhh h the DotR effect. Who can\nsay how this merry 'collective'\nof Scots will change guitar\nmusic in the UK - which seems to have\nbeen taking a bit of a battering of late\nwith the efforts of a certain Mr. Slim and\nthe rest of the beat masters. If nothing\nelse DotR certainly have an incredible\noutput of music- recording 6 EPs and an\nalbum in ten months. Luckily for us the\nquality matches up to the quantity.\nThe picks of the bunch? Any track\nwith the line 'She's a dancer on the\nMarie Celeste, but that's OK I feel like\nEliot Ness' has got to be good. So Rule\nthe Roost gets in by default - it's also got\na rousing, evil chorus that just demands\nattention. A charming little ditty towards\nthe end of the album is Howlin' in the\ndark-a yummy crisp little piece of home\nproduced jamming that works just fine.\nMy final choice is Jack Fanny's Gym\nwhich stats off like Deep Purple classic\nrock, quickly spirals down into a dark\ndeep hole and then leaps out into a psych a deli c funky world right at the end.\nThis is what the 'Replicants are all\nabout, changes. Each track seems to be\nsomething entirely different by its end -so you never know what's round the\ncorner. I hope larger acclaim is just\naround the corner for these boys. E3\nJoel\nIf ever there was an incentive not to\ndrink or do drugs it's Mark E. Smith.\nHave you seen him? Most definitely on a par with Shane McGowan and\nShaun Ryder in the fried stakes. The\nFall can still put out some belt ers, though. To call The Marshall Suite punk\npub rock is slightly misleading but it's the most apt description so call it that I shall, if a lot more polished round the\nedges. The production is very tight and\nclean, cent ring mainly on the distinctively slurred voice of the a fore mentioned front man but still balanced for\nall the other instruments. We've got a real Led Zeppelin style rhythm section\non (Jung Nev's) Antidotes a la Kashmir\nalong with a searing guitar, canny lyrics\non F'old ln' Money and a laid-back feel\nto Birthday Song.\nI was a little surprised at the depth\nof The Marshall Suitebecause I'd never\nheard The Fall before and I didn't quite\nknow what to expect. Maybe that's why\nI was surprised in a good way, and if\nyou've never heard them before try\nhaving a listen to this. But remember\nkids, just say 'No'. CI Christian\nLUNA\nThe Days of Our Nights\nT his is Luna's sixth album. They\nmust have a fan base some-where, otherwise they wouldn't have bothered making six albums. If\nyou arc in this inconspicuous minority,\nthis album will not disappoint. It contains enough songs of substance to\nentertain current fans, but I'm sceptical\nit will bring in new ones - it certainly\ndidn't hook me.\nThere is a distinct lack of originality.\nIhis un thr calc ning indie-folk seems to\ncome from an endless pit at Beggar's Banquet, who churn out this stuff every\nweek. There must be a dozen other\nbands that sound virtually identical,\npouring out their hearts with bittersweet\nangst.\nThe lyrics are good (if a bit surreal),\nbut singer Dean Wareham's voice\n(remember him from Galaxie BOO?\nThought not) is not powerful enough to\ngive them the depth they deserve. I lis\nbreathy muttering lacks substance and,\nwhile giving a mellow character to some\nof the songs, it gets a bit much over all\ntwelve tracks. It seems to have no variation at all. Just the same relentless tone\nagain and again.\nLuna commits many musical crimes.\nDodgy samples crop up all over the\nplace. They are probably intended to\nsound quirky, but end up plain comical,\nthe rhythm in Four Thousand Days\nsounds like someone has just hit the\n'salsa' button on an eighties synthesis er. They've been around for far too\nlong to let them get away with things\nlike that.\nIt's not all bad. SupcrfreakyMemories, released as a single last month, is\na poignant ballad. You can't help being\ncarried away by the soulful cello and\nshu f fly rhythm. It's one song where the\nvocals arc just perfect, and the song\nstands out head and shoulders above\nthe rest of the album.\nBut their worst Crime must be to do\nan appalling cover of Sweet Child O' Mine, reducing a classic rock song to\nempty and pointless dirge. For this they\ncannot be forgiven, and I'm deducting\na whole star for this alone.\nYou need a lot of patience to begin\nto appreciate Luna. Throughout the\nwhole album I wanted them to give me\nthat little bit more, that extra something\nto lift the album off its plateau of mediocrity and to tempt me into wanting\nmore. Disappointingly, they failed. CI\nTom\n\n"

The\nmatch kicked off with chemistry initially\ndominating the play. Most of their attacking op pot unities came from Toni who\nfrequently fed Carlos and Andy the ball.\nThe first goal for chemistry came as\nToni released Carlos, his cross/shot was\nfumbled into the net by the bio chem keeper. In the wake of the goal the\ndefence held tight against a number of\nlofted passes and Biochemistry corners\nas the play became more even. Having\nturned up with only eight players it was\none of the loan signings that set up the\nsecond chemistry goal with a break\ndown the left and cross for Andy to volley the ball in for 2-0. The play continued\nwith Biochem attacks becoming increasingly more difficult to defend as more\nplayers were pushed forward.\nBiochems had two chances to halve\nthe lead; a header from a corner and a long drive which the keeper fumbled.\nThe first half finished 3-0 after a corner\nwas headed in at the near post by Carlos. There were two more chances in the\nhalf. Carlos shot wide after being\nreleased by Toni and a drive by Simon for\nBiochem was blocked by Dave. The\nchemistry defence looked increasingly\nshaky as Jamil lofted balls to Alex and\nSimon on Biochems left. Chemistry finished the half 3-0 up but with a flattering\nlead on balance of play, however, given\nthat they played with ten men against\neleven from the first goal the lead was\nprobably deserved. Defending was\nhelped by the fact that Biochem played\nall corners short and only attacked on\none flank.\nThe second half proved a different\nstory as the rest of Biochems team\nturned up. The situation of ten versus\neleven persisted with Peter and Kelechi\norchestrating most of Biochems attacks,\nthe shooting was wayward as most\nchances went over or wide. Most of the\ngoal kicks taken by Xavier reached the\nopposition defence but came straight\nback. Biochem began to capital is e on\nthe numeric advantage by using the full\nwidth of the pitch dragging Chemistrys\ndefenders out of position. Their first\ngoal finally came as Peter powered\nthrough several tackles to release their\ndesignated goal hanger who easily finished side footing past Xavier.\nBiochem struck again almost at once.\nDave won the ball from Peter and\nspin ted forward but overplayed the ball.\nThe outstanding player of the second\nhalf, Simon, cleared from defence and\nthe ensuing mix up allowed the ball to\nbreak and be volleyed past Xavier.\nBiochem pressed increasingly for the\nequalise r and were rewarded when\nSimon burst forward unmarked to drive\nfrom twenty yards.\nTwo goals were then d is a lowed as\nthe height and width of the goal came\ninto question. A near post header by the\nir repress able Peter and a drive over the\ngoalkeepers hands were claimed but no\nagreement could be reached.\nEventually an eleven all setup was\nestablished but it was too late for Chemistry to grab a winner. In reality Chemistry were let off the hook by the\nBiochem strikers not taking their early\nchances, but felt they deserved the draw\nas they had never played before as a team and were a man down throughout\nthe match.\nThanks to all those who played on\nboth sides.\nDave Robinson (unbiased chemistry\ncaptain)\nFrom the Sidelines\nAbout two weeks ago, this part of SW London was basking in the warmth of what\nlooked to be an early start to the summer.\nBut then something terrible happened\nthat would alter the weather for the rest\nof the year. The cricket season began.\nIt seems un believe able that you can\ngaur en tee that if the weather is nice, as\nsoon as someone suggests cricket, the\nclouds begin to gather in anticipation of\nthe crack of leather on willow. And so it\nwas to prove when England began their\nwarm up campaign taking on the mighty\nKent side at Canterbury. Since the start\nof the World Cup warm up matches, I have yet to see in the results at least one\nmatch not affected by teh weather, and,\nof course, the dreaded Duckworth-Lewis\nsystem. Lor those who don't know, this\nis a complex system of calculating revised\ntargets and over rates designed to make\nit fairer to both teams. There does seem\nto be, however, an alarming ing number\nof games in which the side batting second scores more runs in fewer overs,\nbut still loses. That's just not cricket.\nWhich brings me to my main point.\nWhatever you think of cricket, take some\ntime to stop and watch some of the in\nprogress World Cup. It won't be back in\nEngland for about 30 years, and it is shaping up to become what the or gains ers hope it to be - a carnival of cricket.\nover \u00a310.\njust pop down to tower records on\nkensington high st. and produce\nyour Union card at the counter.\nkensington : 0171 938 3511\nwww.tower records. co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Columns 1 7 May 1999\nSign of the Times\nI am not easily shocked. Aside from\nsnakes and Vanessa Feltz, few things\nunnerve me. But a letter of agreement from Ian Caldwell? Terrifying - the\npoor blok e's in shock. As I have stated In\nthis column over the last four years, here\nisa man of fine judgement, and his note\nin last week's Felix confirms it, but enough\nabout me (boom boom!).\nThis whole sign thing has got completely out of hand, as Ian says. The question is whether we really have to have all\nthese things stuck on the wall. Sadly,\npressures of work prevent me from\nspending the morning wading through\nHealth & Safety Executive regulations,\nbut I have my doubts. Yes, most of this\nrubbish originates from our beloved\nfriends in the European Commission, but\ntheir already crazy directives tend to get\ngold-plated by our civil servants, making\na bad job worse. Not a lot we can do\nabout that, but I have a nasty suspicion\nthat we interpret the rules too broadly,\nresulting in the current farr ago. Personally, I am guided by Darwinism\nin these situations. If someone is too stupid to recognise a fire alarm without the\naid of this signage, let the flames consume them, leaving us with a slightly less\npolluted gene pool. Harsh but fair, I think\nyou'll agree. If we don't, where will it all\nend? Why, we could end up with signs\nindicating the temporary nature of gates...\nProfessional Advice?\nI wasn't being strictly honest. Another\nthing that scares me a bit is female figures of authority at Imperial who are\nfond of the word 'professional.' With that\nin mind, I shall tread carefully over the Private Housing Office incident. Apparently,\nall this talk of \u00a390 per\nweek is cobblers, the\ntrue figure being a suggestion of \u00a375-80\ndependent on room\nsize. So that's all\ncleared up then? I don't think so.\nGiven that the\nabove facts were provided by Mrs John,\nthere can be no further dispute from her\nstandpoint.Therefore Up With S lg n Sill dic at an employee of\nimperial college, ing the temporary charged with assisting students in their\nquest for accommodation, suggested that a landlady intending to rent to our students could get\naway with a rise that far exceeded in fla tion.\nCall me naive, but I am at a loss to\nsee how this fits In with a 'remit...to look\nafter the Imperial students and find them\naffordable accommodation.' When I was\nan undergraduate, I most definitely could\nnot afford \u00a380 per week, so I imagine that\nthose second-Sports Grounds for Halls\nF Voice of Reason\n\"If someone is too stupid to recognise a fire alarm without the aid of signage, let the flames consume them... we could end nature of dates...\nand third-years must be\ndelighted to\nsee their\npurchasing power described so\nfavourably. I cannot understand how\nCatherine John could\nmake such an\nunguarded comment, realising that\nthe only\npossible consequence\nwould be a greater financial burden\nfor our students a.k.a. her clients.\nShe\nstates that she was responding to a request for a 'professional opinion.' This\ntalk of professionalism is misguided. As\nshe says, her remit is the needs of stu-dents, and that is her area of professional expertise. Offering suggestions to\nprivate sector landlords about revenue\nmaxim is ation must surely constitute a professional conflict of interests. I would\nnot seek to tell her how to do her job, but\nthis looks like a pretty obvious demarcation line. The Private Housing Office\nshould not offer rent advice to landlords\nbeyond giving general information, the\nprovision of which would not be prejudicial to the Office's aim of serving our\nstudents. And since,\nas I gleaned from a recent perusal of the\nResidences trading\naccounts, the Private\nHousing Office is\nfunded out of the\nincome from student\nrents, there seems little scope for quibbling\nwith this view.\nIt is unfortunate\nthat time has been\nwasted agreeing on\nthe facts, but it seems\nfair to conclude that\nthe Private Housing\nOffice has behaved\nbadly in this case, the\nstatement of which gives me no pleasure\nsince I and many, many others have been\nsaying for years that we needed such a service.\nSimon Baker\nor those of you eschewing dod gybed sits, preferring the majestic\nsplendour of Halls, there is much\nchange afoot.\nMost of the\nnews about\nbig refurbishment projects\nhas been\ndoing the\nrounds for\nsome time.\nThe Southside\nspruce-up, I'm sorry 'conceptual design of\nHalls of Residence and\nstudent facilities in Princes\nGardens', has\nbeen on the\ndrawing board for\nalmost three\nyears in its\ncurrent form,\nand is obviously badly\nneeded. Sadly, the huge delays in getting it sorted\nout have allowed some morons at English Heritage to list it, despite it being one\nof the ugliest buildings in West London,\nthus precluding the preferred option of\ndemolition.\nWith that limitation, our friends in\nEstates are going to have their work cut\nout trying to make a silk purse out of an\nenormous sow's ear. Anyway, it's good\nto see a bit of progress. In the past,\nthings like this always seemed to fall\nvictim to the 'eyes bigger than your belly'\nsyndrome, as we accountants term it. It\nis all fine and dandy coming up with a great vision, but if it is beyond your\nmeans tenfold, it\nseems a fairly pointless exercise. That\nseems less likely in\nthis case now that\nEstates have unveiled\ntheir secret weapon,\nthe surplus sports-ground.\nThis cunning\ndevice is designed to\nbring a bucketful of\ncash, granting us our\nevery wish. This being\nImperial, it's not quite\nthat simple. Picking\nwhich one(s) to close\nis a purely political\nand economic dec i sion. No group of students will cause the\ngrief necessary to sway Sherfield, so\nthey will probably sell everything bar\nHarlington; that should generate plenty\nof cash, while preserving the College's commitment to sport. Actually, that last\nstatement is rubbish. To preserve the\nCollege, as opposed to Union, commit-ment, we could have a fire sale and\nditch everything bar the Boathouse. No\nproblem so far, unless our medics get\ntheir senior academics to be particularly\nawkward.\nThe real problem is our track record.\nIC is spectacularly unsuccessful at realising maximum value from our assets.\nTake Montpelier Hall in Knightsbridge. It\nis worth a fortune, yet it was almost sold\nfor a mere couple of million. If we were\nserious about making a killing, we\nshould be looking at joint ventures with\nproperty developers. Not a new idea, it\nhas been considered by others at College, but everyone seems to have come\nto the same conclusions. Such is the\nprobability that we would make a dog's breakfast of any such undertaking, no\none dare try it. There's confidence for\nyou.\nStill, let's not be too negative. Any\n'bonus cash' which lessens the chances\nof the whole project being linked to\nwildly optimistic conferencing proposals\nis to be welcomed. Incidentally, what's all this about 'non-academic areas must\nbreak-even'? Has anyone told John fo s ter, our redoubtable Head of Catering?\nfast time I looked, that department,\naside from Southside Bar, was running\nup debts more rapidly than the Duchess\nof York. Surely it's not one rule for some\nand one rule for others? Of course not.\nSimon Baker? Reviewing Films?!\nF: \"that department\n[Catering], aside from\nSouthside Bar, was\nrunning up debts\nmore rapidly than the\nDuchess of York.\nSurely it's not one\nrule for some and\none rule for others?\"\nn ally, regular readers of this humble column will know that I am not\nalways bang up to date with my\nfilm-going. The last man in Britain to\nwatch Pulp fiction and The Sound of\nMusic, I have only\njust seen There's Something About\nMary and Lock, Stock\nand Two Smoking\nBarrels. Not exactly of\nthe same genre, but\nboth stunningly\ngood: the former has\nsome moments of\nexceptional slapstick\ncomedy, the latter is\njust brilliant, taking\nand developing the\nvery best elements of\nBritish crime-related\nfilm-making (The Italian Job and The Long\nGood Friday, to name\nbut two).

Now this in itself isn't such a bad thing to have to do, but what\nit means is that the record may not do\nas well as it deserves to, because of the\nthrow-away radio edit that is put forward\nto receive air play. In this case, the radio\nedit is a tedious groovy dub, which is\npretty unmemorable, whilst the remixes\ntake the sluggish base line and give it a good kick up the arse. This increase in\ntempo then gives us a couple of blind-ing, stomping house tracks, in the form\nof the Johan S Toxic Mix and the Bulletproof Underground Mix. Very much like\nsome of the stuff the Natural Born\nGrooves people may come out with. Try\nit out for size before buying.\nOut now\nMondo Paradiso\nWhale Nation'\n(Opaque Stereo)\nMore great dreamy beats and breaks\nfrom the Mondo Paradiso team.

Sampling the\ntheme tune to a popular show in the\n70's, the single is a trip through epic\nhouse.

The track\nblends Old School Acid sounds with\nsome breakbeat s and a large hard house\nbeat. Both sides are worth a listen, but\nit is the A side that shines through, delivering us a great breakdown and an uplifting bouncy house tune. Guaranteed to\nget any dancefloor going.\nOut May 24th \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDavid Elkabas &Tom Dlnsdale\nThings We Used To Do'\n(Milk 'n'2 Sugars Recordings)\nThe debut release from this recent\nextension of the funky London monthly,\nwhich has just moved venues from The\nCross to Bar Rumba. To be honest having\ngone to M'n'2 S and enjoyed it immensely,\nI'm slightly disappointed with the standard of the Original Mixes on the A side.\nThis is funk-house that simply never gets\noff the ground, and that is precisely what\nyou don't find at the club night itself.\nThere always seems a point to what gets\nplayed at the venue, and this is where\nthese mixes fail to capture the essence of\nthe club. This is surprising because one of\nthe production team mentioned above is\na resident at the night. However, all is not\nlost, because where the M'n'2 S people\nhave done wonders is in getting New\nYork's legendary DJ Disciple to remix the\ntrack. His Slam Jam Remix is, as you would\nexpect, a monumental disco-funk number,\nand does precisely what the original fails\nto do. Just listening to the remix is like\nbeing back at the night, grooving to classy\nhouse music in lush venues. Give this\none a go, and expect lots more groovy\nreleases to flow from this new label.\nOut now\nLectrolux\n'Gimme AK'( Tec F) This track, originally thought up as\npart of the FCUK ad campaign, uses the\nmain sample from the Woodstock festival\nin the year in which it is set to return to\nAmerica (after a thirty-year absence). I'm sure you can guess at what the letters are\nthat the announcer asks the crowd to\nshout - bloody rude, aren't they? But does\na rude word make the record any good?\nWell, not really. The A side mix, is a plodding big-beat affair which probably could\nwangle its way into a very very long Fatboy\nSlim set, but certainly wouldn't be one of\nthe highlights. Ihe AA-side is a tad better,\ngiving a solid hard house remix. However, once again, this would be a song to\npad out a set with, rather than one to\nmake the crowd wet themselves over.\nOut May 31st. Wayne G presents Twisted featuring Stewart Who?\n'Breakdance (Is Back)'\n(It's Fabulous Records)\nA curious little single, available as two different vinyl releases. On one you get the\nhous i cr mixes, the first of which is Grip's Heaven Dub - a funky number, which\nuses an 80s sample that I can't quite put\nmy finger on. Well worth a listen, as is\nTrade DJ Alan Thompson's Disco Dub. But\nthe killer track on this record is Heaven resident Wayne G's imaginatively titled\n5AM@ Heaven Mix. It builds up nicely into\nbeing one of those house tunes that can\nsomehow be bang in1 and groovy at the\nsame time.\nThe second record, however is my\nfavourite. The three tracks on it are completely different to each other - a refreshing change in a time when artists feel as\nif they can get away with sticking carbon-copy, throw-away mixes on the B sides of\nonly half-decent tunes. What you get here\nis a strong AA-side track, 'Debauchery' - a nice stomping, bouncing up-beat house\ntune, which D.A.V.E. the Drummer had a hand in, followed by two mixes of the title\ntrack on the A side. Easily the most fun of\nthese is the Original Mix, which relies\nheavily on 80s samples (including the old\ntheme tune from Grange Hill), and some\namusing spoken lyrics. Doesn't sound too\ngreat from that description, but believe me\nit does work.\nOut now\nPlpl Le Oul\nle Funky Bus/I Dunno'\n(Disques Bleu)\nFreshly cut disco house from the gorgeously green plains of southern France,\ndelivered to us, toll free apparently, in\nPipi's own Citroen bus. Now forget about\nthe AA-side, i Dunno.' On listening to this\ntepid excuse for a house tune, it appears\nthat Pipi really doesn't know very much.\nWell, not about how to make disco house\nanyway. But wait, listen to the A side and\njust stop yourself from dancing. The start\nis pretty standard, but after the first breakdown the sample of De La Soul's Me, Myself, and I' kicks in, and from there the\ntrack goes ballistic. A great example of\ndisco house, sure to be caned to death at\nnights like Carwash. Most funky.\nOut May 31st Roobarb and Gurm\n\n"

Honestly that's it. It\nmight also have the odd punch-up on\nthe ice, the occasional slamming of the\nopponent into the plexiglass so hard\nthat it shatters but ice hockey is one for\nthe big guys and girls.\nGood Graphics:\nThe PSX version goes for a close in,\nblood and guts on sticks rabid ly fast and\nsmooth option. Though it is possible to\nmove to a camera slightly further out of\nthe way the resolution on the PSX means\nthat the puck starts to look a little less disc\nlike - It doesn't slow down though.\nThe PC version with its 3D card acceleration can afford to take the camera further back without losing resolution and\nwith a decent combination of processor\nand graphics card the graphics flow like\nquicksilver - whatever that really looks\nlike.\nSeraphim Sounds:\nBoth versions are liberally sprinkled with\nthe sounds of sticks clashing, body on\nbody crunches, organ music intervals\nand skates swishing when players\nchange direction. The PSX commentary\nstarts to annoy after five minutes but at\nleast it doesn't torture with CD stutter -There is no commentary team ....having\n....problems ....saying ....more ....than\n...one ...word ...at ...a... time.

Undergrads started the match very\nbrightly, and had a golden opportunity\nwith virtually the first kick of the game, but the goalie somehow managed to scramble back to save a certain goal by Daniel Myatt. Postgrads settled down quickly, and the first half was very evenly\ncontested. The post grads took the lead\nwhen Dan Lawton, finding himself with\na bit of room in the centre, unleashed a thunderous long range shot which pow ered past the keeper. The pattern of the match never changed though, and both\nteams continued to press for goal. Undergrads equalise d when Antony Whittle caught the keeper off guard with\na snap shot. Almost immediately how ever, midfielder Richard Page had to come off with a pulled hamstring, and on the stroke of half time, captain Jamil\nBacha was also injured.\nThe second half picked up pretty\nmuch where the first left off, with both\nsides going for it. As time passed though,\nthe undergrads started to mounting consistent pressure on the post grad defence. They finally took the lead, with\nAntony Whittle again catching the keeper\nout with a shot from the edge of the area\n( somewhere around there anyway).\nUndergrads then had their best spell of the game, putting together good moves\nand coming close to increasing their\nlead on a couple of occasions.\nHowever, on one of the post grad attacks, a shot took a deflection of an undergrad defender, completely wrong-footing the keeper and giving the man equalise r. Heads dropped briefly on the\nundergrad side, and the last 10 minutes\nwere of intense pressure by post grads, who went all out for a winner. Undergrads also had a chance of their own to\nsnatch it, but neither side managed to\nscore in the time remaining, and the result stayed as it was. Jamil Bacha\nROWING\nBoat Club fall foul of wind\nBUSA Championships(1 st May1999)( MENS 2 nd VIII)\nAn unusually calm and sunny day greeted us early on Saturday morning, at\nHolme Pierrepont, the National Water\nSports Centre in Nottingham. We were entered in the Championship Event, up against the first eights of some eight een or so other institutions, despite\nonly being Imperial's second boat. (Our\nfirst boat had gone to an International\nRegatta in Cologne for the weekend) The format of the day was to have\ntwo qualifying heats in the afternoon,\nand then a final in the evening for the six fastest crews. All races were six\nabreast, 2000m long, taking about six\nminutes to race. Coming third in the first\nheat, and then a much swifter second in\nthe next round, proved to be more than\nenough to earn us a place in the final.\nOur cox ed four (which had never rowed together as a crew before) also qualified\nfor their final, and came sixth overall.\nThe last event of the day was the eight's final, and unfortunately the traditional\ncross winds associated with the course\nappeared, and we were drawn in choppy\nlane 6. This meant that even Cambridge,\nracing in the stillness of lane 1 beat us\nby a canvas, despite the fact that we had\ngiven them a good seeing to in both the\nprevious heats.\nNevertheless, after an epic row and braving the storm we came fifth, with only\nfour seconds separating us and second place. Still, fifth fastest university eight in\nthe country isn't bad, considering we were Imperial's second boat, and had\nour first row as a crew for a week before\nthe final. It was Oxford Brookes who stormed to victory, winning by over ten seconds, but then they're not exactly\nsecond in the League Tables, are they?\nBy Kev\nCRYPTIC CROSSWORD\nby Sheep\nAnswers to1143 Across: 1 Mushroom,6 Carafe, 9 Lala,\n10 Suggestion, 11 Adolescent, 12 Rand,\n13 Adage, 14 Hotheaded,16 Tactfully,\n19 Start, 21 Span,23 Incomplete,25 Aristocrat, 26 Peat, 27 Asylum,28 Cheesier\nDown:2 Unaided,3 Headlight,4 Oasis, 5 Magnetoelectric, 6 Cheetah,7 Rotor, 8 Flounce,15 Antelopes,17 Amperes,18 Uniform,20 Retrace,\n22 Nasal, 24 Matte\nAcross\nI It's our secret tart!

You must have a lot of new\nexperiences to speak about? Errr, not\nquite your Honor. Lyrically we find\nSuede feel at home in leather.\nSuede on Head Music the same as\never; third-person narratives galore,\nurban soliloquies, veiled drug refer-en ces, etc Brett Anderson has\ndescribed the lyrics as been colder,\nmore clean cut, more precise and concise In context than on previous songs.\nNow there's an excuse for being bone-idle if ever I heard one. Altogether now\nThe cat sat on the mat. Oh wonderful\nChris, so concise, so clear in meaning.\nAnd musically? It's the same old song\nbut with a different beat.... They haven't just ripped off others but themselves as\nwell. She off Coming Up is now called\nCan't Get Enough and the penultimate\ntrack He's Gone is a reinterpretation of\nAsphalt World, the penultimate track off\nDog Man Star. They've even filched\nfrom Suzi Quatro; Elephant Man is, I kid\nyou not, the bastard progeny of Devil\nGate Drive. So the album stinks like a bachelor pad after a night on curry and\nlager? Well no, because the old Suede\nwere just magnificent. Electricity rocks\nlike a, err rm, really rocky thing and the\nballad Down is simply irresistible.\nProduction duties this time around\nhave gone to the Happy Mondays' erstwhile cohort Steve Osborne and Brett\net al have gone and got all funky on yer\nass, boy! She's In Fashion, Savoir Faire\nand Asbestos being particularly slinky\naffairs. However, the final track Crack in\nthe Union Jack provides Brett with an\nopportunity to do a sensitive solo ditty\nand he fails miserably; the song being\neither a woefully inept social observation or possibly a clandestine drug ref-e rence, old habits die hard it seems.0\nChris\nFUZZBIRD\nPulling The Wings Off Small Boys \u2022 *V2\nPractice makes perfect.\nTo start, what a wonderful title!\nExcept if you actually did try and\npull the wings off small boys,\ncos that'd just be sick. And boys, small\nor otherwise, tend not to have wings.\nAnyway, has anyone heard of Fuzzbird?\nI hadn't before this but I did find out\nthat they've released an EP called Mot\nand they've had material played on The\nJon Peel Show.\nOn the fl lp side of the coin every-one's heard of Gomez, haven't they?\nFuzzbird are in that same mould but\nthey're just that little bit less original,\nthe little bit that means practically no one\nknows who they are. That aside, there\nare a couple of tasty numbers on here\nstarting at the very beginning with a very Shed Seven inspired track called\nMy World (they are both from Yorkshire),\nand ending with Hard Like A Girl and\nWings. The rest of the material is Grungelite as is the flavour in these modern\ntimes we live in.\nI get the feeling that some of these\nsongs haven't been properly thought\nout and developed. Some of them\nsound like the guitar riff is an afterthought and Fuzzbird want people to\nlove their quirky, significant lyrics. It's not gonna win any prizes for breaking\nground or musicianship and I think if\nthey concentrate on playing the music\nmore than the (sometimes cringing lyc liche d) lyrics, then they might be onto\na winner. Nice cover on the CD, though.\nm Christian\nJOI\nOne And One Is OneJ\nT he debut album from the, as\nthey claim, original Asian breakbeat fusion is ts. However, there\nappears to be a lot more than just\nbreakbeat s on this album with some\ndrum and bass and a generally confusing mixture of themes and styles, with\nthe Indian themes and instruments\ntotally overwhelming. The album displays a cultural theme that doesn't doesn't really go in hand with these\n'hard' beats.\nOne of the better tracks that you\nmay want to listen to is Massive and is\nabout the only track that represents any\ntrue like lines s to breakbeat. It starts off\nquite well with strong drums and a heavy beat. There's minimal vocals in\nthe form of Joi massive repeated over\nand over, and the semi-opr a tic highs\nbreaking the roughness is nice. The\nalbum is quite diverse in content, with\nthe cultural influence and dabs of breakbeat and even a touch of jungle on ESYSHJ. The production is very good and the\nalbum does get stronger as you listen to\nthe later tracks, but that's only if you can\nbear the first half. CI Asad\n17 May 1999\nRADIATOR\nRemember Generator being the\nEssential Choon a while back?\nNo, well I'm pleased to say that\nthis is more of the same rock-dance\nfusion style e. That's a good thing, by\nthe way. Radiator are three sharply\ndressed guys in ultra-dark glasses,\nexuding attitude by the bucketful and\nseemingly with a crap sleeve designer\nbecause the album cover has the same\ndesign as the single, only in a different\ncolour.\nThe lead singer has that raw singing\nvoice of the likes of Gary Stringer and\nEddie Vedder and the sort that Liam\nGallagher can only hope for. There's energy in the beat and those massive\nguitar licks that has you tapping your\nfoot before you know what's happen-ing. The guitars are distorted, but not too\nmuch in that annoying tinny sort of way.\nThere's a vast amount of synth work in\nthe album that in this case contributes\ngreatly to the whole rough-edged\nsound. And that's what makes the music\nso appealing - the rough around the\nedges, lo-fi production. If Radiator had\nchosen to smooth the CD out and over\nproduced it, then most definitely it\nwould have lost what makes the band's overall sound. Don't get mc wrong, it's not a crap job, quite the opposite in fact,\nbut if you're expecting a glistening and\nsilky sound forget it.\nthe CD is so good that there isn'ta duff track on it. From the alternative\nrock catch in ess of Generator to the\nalmost ambient Untitled Love Song and\nthe acoustic intimacy of Feel to the pure\nenergy of Whole Inside, the entire\nalbum will keep you entertained right up\nto the end. Their style is their own, too.\nSo many bands today fall into the trap\nof familiarity that leads to a dull, lifeless\nsound that all too often is obviously a result of not listening to a range of\nmusic. Radiator haven't done that. They\nknow what styles of music it is that they\nlike the sound of and the direction in\nwhich their music is progressing, which\nis becoming increasingly rare In a market lead by manufactured 'popstars' and\nartists in the music industry simply for\nthe money.

I agree\nwith the accommodation office that last\nComputer Programming\nTuition\nHaving trouble with your computing course?\nFriendly tuition by IC computing graduate\nEmail James at\nJrrl \u00a9doc.ic.ac.uk\nweek's article may have been a little over\nthe top.\nI believe that the prices advised by\nCatherine John are correct. However I believe that the landlady thought 'if I can\nget 80 quid, why not 90?!' and initially\nadvised 90 quid as being the new rent.\nHowever, a meeting between a resident\nand the accommodation office did take\nplace, although I don't know who the student I know saw.\nI believe that our landlady had a seco nd meeting with someone from IC and THAT DAY the rent for next year was advised as being 80 quid.\nPersonally Ido not feel aggrieved at\nwhat the Private Housing Office has done.\nThey exist to provide impartial advice. Had\nthey advised a cheaper rent and the landlady then found that she was renting\ncheaply then she would have the right to\nfeel aggrieved. Certainly one of the reasons that I live there is because I think that we get a very good deal and if I were the\nlandlord then I would charge 80 quid at\nleast.\nName& Address supplied\nRegulating the Internet\nDear Editor,\nI would like to comment on your article To Regulate or Not? [Felix 1143]. I also\ndisagree with the argument that \"it must\nbe the kids who are screwed up\". I agree\nthat \"human are naturally inquisitive, especially when young, and have a tendency\ntowards violence and moral wrong\". Flowever, let's get the perspective right. We have to realise the fact that the mass\nmedia and computer games have great\nimpacts on the society. Advancement in\ncomputer technology enables us to produce more realistic computer graphics,\nwhich is useful for training doctors to practice surgery and in many other applications. However, a coin has two sides.\nWhenever there is a new technology, people tend to abuse it. Lack of regulations\ncould lead to serious problems. Computer\ngames like Doom and Quake2 \"allow\" us\nto \"kill\" people in the cruellest means for\nno reason. After some time, our brains are\n\"brainwashed\" sub-consciously and we \"think\" that there is nothing wrong to hurt\nanother person. Moreover, the nature of Bicycle Hospital\nSecond-hand Bikes for sale on campus.\nBike repairs on campus. Email James at\njr r1@ doc.lc.ac.uk\nfilms is getting more and more violent, and\nhigh-resolution computer graphics\nenhance the effects.\nLet's get back to the point, the Internet. The Internet is getting out of control\nbecause it gets very complex/complicated\ntoo quickly. Due to lack of laws in restricting contents allowed in Internet, people\nabuse the technology and start putting up\npornography and violent materials. The\nproblem is that computer laws are different in different countries. People can use\nthis \"hole\" to put up indecent webpages\nin the servers of another country, if they\nare not allowed to do so in their country.\nThe major concern is that some children\narc reading materials from the Internet\nthey should not be reading, like violent\nand pornographic sites. As you have men-tio ned, programmes like Internet Explorer\n5 aren't effective enough to filter some sites.\nWe were grown up in a computer cul-ture, so it takes shorter time for us to work\nout how to use the computer and the\nInternet. Parents don't spend as much time on the Internet as school kids.\nThose violent video games and films\ncould t tigger the interests of young people to look for violent webpages because\nthey seem \"normal\" to them.\nInternet has to be regulated. It\nrequires international co-operation in setting up standardised laws in regulating certain types of information allowed in the\nInternet. It is also feasible to have a monitoring organisation to monitor the information contained in the Internet. The base\npoint is to protect children from reaching\nthose \"unsuitable\" sites. This can be done\nby setting up laws that require parents to\ninstall software like Net Nanny. On the\nother hand, imposing too much control on\ncertain things in the Net could lead to\nmore negative effects. It will even encourage more people to look for \"holes\" in the\nlaw to carry on their \"good work\". Also, It\nwill cause inconvenience to people who needs certain information for good purpose instead of abusing them. Yours,\nLawrence Tse\nDeadline for letters for\nis 12noon Wednesday.\nPlease Include the words\n'Letter for Publication' in\nthe header of letters.\nLetters maybe edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\n\n"

The AUT claims that its members have not received the pay\nincreases that they are due, with the\nGeneral Secretary, David Fries man, commenting \"vice-chancellors can pay\nthemselves nearly 7% extra this year,\nbut offer their staff only half that\namount, the more we do the less we get.\"\nThe debate on whether to go ahead with the strike was due to be\nhe ld last Thursday, after Felix went to\npress. According to the AUT document \"Action for a fair deal\" the most likely\ndate for a24 hour strike is Tuesday25 May, but the text warns that \"the Executive Committee is instructed to consider calling further strike or strikes in\nthe early part of the next academic year\". If the Council decides that a strike\nis unwarranted, action could include a reduction in University teacher act iv i ties, such as an examination sanction,\na boycott of admission procedures for\nstudents entering higher education next Autumn, or a refusal to take part\nin administration duties.\nThe Association of University Teachers( AUT) has voted to take industrial action, following a ballot of its members held last month. This will most likely manifest itself as a one day strike\nlater this month, which could affect\nlectures and exams for many students. The strike is the result of a failure to\nreach agreement in the current pay\ndispute, which has gone on for several\nmonths. In late March the AUT authorised a ballot of its members after rejecting\nthe 3 % pay increase offered by the\nUniversity and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA). Determined to pursue a10% pay increase, a ballot was announced for April, with a possible strike taking place at the end of May. In early April UCEA put forward their\nfinal offer of 3 . 5 % , which was immediately rejected by the AUT, and a ballot\nof AUT members followed. The results of the ballot were announced at the AUT Council meeting in Scarborough, Yorkshire, last Wed nes day 12 May. 5 8 % of those voting said\nthey were prepared to strike, while68% By Ed Sexton\nw^ mm\nStrikers from1996 similar scenes could hit Britain's universities later this month Photo: Archive\nTransport Discount Matures\nLondon Transport has extended its stud ent discount scheme to include mature students. The new arrangements, which will take effect at the start of the next academic year, were announced after a prolonged period of\nnegotiations between fond on Transport and colleges, headed by the University of London Union( UL U). David\nHellard, ICU President, welcomed the\ndecision, describing it as \"sensible - it's brilliant! It had to be done.\" From next autumn all full-time students will qualify for a30% discount on travelcards, including weekly travel-cards, which were not covered under the agreement reached last September( see ' London Transport Announce Student Discount', Issue 1120). One of the\nmajor criticisms levelled at London Transport was that the scheme was prejudiced against mature students, By Ed Sexton\nand it appears that the resulting bad publicity was an important factor in\nthis month's decision. Another complaint concerned the\nlengthy process students had to go through to obtain the discount cards,\nwith some students waiting several\nweeks for their application to be' processed. Under a scheme to be tested experimentally at Imperial Coll e ge, the new discount cards will be\nhanded out directly by the student union, hopefully eliminating much of\nthe delay.\nIdentifying the reasons for the change in attitude by London Transport, Mr Hellard felt that a combination of \"pressure from student unions in\nLondon, a lot of complaints, and lob-by ing\" were responsible. He also praised Matt Hyde, UL U President, for\nhis leadership during the debate; \"Matt\ncoordinated pretty much everything\". Not all student union s'wishes have been granted however. The new card will only be available to full time students, meaning that those taking masters courses on a part-time basis\nwill not be eligible, and neither will stud ents attending fond on colleges for\none year as part of an exchange program. furthermore, there will be no compensation for those who missed out\non the scheme this year. The price of the card is also rising, from \u00a31 to \u00a33.\nMr Hellard hoped that these problems could be overcome in future negotiations;\" hopefully it will be the start of many more discounts\".

    "content": "17 May 1999 Games 13\nWages of Sin - Sin Mission Pack 1 (PC)\nActivision\nIt's rather tricky reviewing mission packs.\nThey're unlikely to contain any major\nchanges to the basic principles of the\noriginal game, and will be of limited\ninterest to those who haven't played it.\nIn fact, now I come to think of it, I have\na suspicion that our Beloved Games Editor has given it to me because I avoided\nmy forfeit two weeks ago. Swings and\nroundabouts. Anyway, here goes...\nI first got my hands on Sin around\nJanuary, not long after it had been\nreleased, but I wasn't actually able to\nplay it until March. Why? The control system was the most bugged I have ever\ncome across - no matter how I installed\nit, no matter what tweaks to the key\nmapping I set up, every time I tried to\nplay the game, my point of view would\nhead remorselessly to the top of the\nscreen, and stay there. This was fine provided the targets were sitting immediately above\nme, but the first mission is\nbased in a helicopter, and\nall that happened was that\nI ended up shooting my\nrotors out, with predictably\nhilarious results. I was not\na happy bunny. In March,\nActivision issued an 18 Meg\npatch, and hey-presto, normal service was resumed.\nFor those of you who\nhaven't played the original\ngame, It was rather an enjoyable romp\nthrough a large metropolis \"in the near\nfuture\" where some bright spark has\ndevised a highly addictive drug which\nturns its users in giant murderous mutant\nthings which appear from the sewers,\ncause respectable quantities of mayhem\nand then vanish leaving the civil authorities to wonder how it has all gone so\nhorribly wrong. It wasn'ta hugely innovative game, but it had some nice\ntouches (in one section, rather than\nshoot people as per normal, you got to\ndrive over them using a beach buggy -good for relaxing after a hard tube journey incidentally).\nWages of Sin (it's a pun, see) is set\nimmediately after the end of Sin. Despite\ndestroying the world domination plans of\nthe evil Alexis Sinclair and her un feasibly tight thigh-length boots and rather\nskimpy garments (not\nhugely PC this game),\nand having her well and\ntruly behind bars, her\narmies of mutants still\nappear to be causing\nmayhem - killing construction workers, dropping litter and generally\nbeing anti-social and\nemphatically anti-social. Your mission,\nshould you choose to accept it, is to go\nand give them lessons in good citizen-ship, if necessary using your trusty futuristic gun to reinforce the more\ncomplicated paragraphs.\nThe first few levels are rather good\n- they are set in pitch dark tunnels, the\nonly light source being the torch that you\npicked up which is fast running out of\nbatteries. Once they fail,\nthere's a very good\nchance you'll be set upon\nby said mutants, with\nresultant loss of large\nquantities of bodily flu-ids. There are a few puzzles, but none are\nparticularly complex, and\nmostly test your ability to\nrun around pressing the\nright buttons in the right\norder within the right\ntime limit. Other than\nthat, its really just a matter of kill everything you see and collect\neverything you can.\nDon't get me wrong - this isn'ta bad\ngame, and if you have the original Sin\n(plus patch), and enjoyed that, then\nthere's a good argument for adding this\nto it. But it really is purely down to \"more\nof the same\", and I guess that more or\nless sums up any good mission pack.\nDanny\nPreviewVille Revisited\nAge of Empires 2 - The Age of Kings (PC)\nMicrosoft\nLess controversial than Kingpin by far is\nMicrosoft's Age of Empires 2. By now\nmost people would have taken Age of\nEmpires and the Rise of Rome expansion\nset (see competition corner to win a copy) and battled and planned through\nto 500 AD or there about s. Well this\nAutumn Age of Empires 2 is about to take\n\u2022 : . \u2022 .'\nthe story on that little bit further. It's time\nto explore the age of kings, the dark\nage and the time of renaissance and\nexploration. Or as microsoft put it the\nDark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle\nAge and finally the Imperial Age.\nWith new very high resolution graph-ics, cleaned up audio and a range of\nfresh races the battle will\nonce again be on for ter-ri tory, food and resources.\nThe gameplay is still based\naround the building of villages and towns to support a thriving and.\nsurviving community.\nBalancing demands\nof military and civilians will\nbe as difficult (or easy) as\nbefore, on the levels we\ngot to play one one the\nhardest problems was\nkeeping the local sheep\ncommunity from getting\nM0\ntoo frisky and wondering away - your sheep\nhave nice coloured\nbows round their necks\nJust so you know.\nThe military parts\nof the game have also\nbeen built ed up too.\nThere is now the option\nof leading troops to\ntheir death in formations - synchronise d slaying on the scale not\nseen since the two secondary schools nearby\ndecided to face off in\nthe backstreet s. There is even the option\nof gari so ning your base much like the\nscaredy kids who hung back at the school\ngates.\nThere have even been tweaked and\ntuned multiplayer game options. A capture the flag type game has been introduced - a regicide option gives those\n... :\nSlSlSiS\n'\nplayers who abhor collateral damage a simple way out. Kill the king and Queen\nrather than teach the other race the\nmeaning of mass slaughter. Fun and\nmorals for all the republicans in the\nfamiliy.\nOnce again Microsoft look to be ridding on another winner.\n\n"

With such\na,er rrr, 'diverse' set of factors as those\ndescribed above, its not s uprising that\nUtopia parkway is such an interesting\nalbum. Fountains of Wayne are another band from the US not taking the standard ROCK path. Others to precede them\nare acts such as Weezer and Ben Folds\nFive. Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger are the songwriting team behind the band and while the tunes in\nthis album are what hook you in, the\nlyrics are what keep you coming back for\nmore. This album deals with American suburban life in its many forms: all the ambition, jealousy, boredom, hope and regret. A Fine Day lor A Parade talks\nabout an older woman's drinking problems - a hauntingly beautiful track that\nreally moves you to analyse the lyrics.\nProm Theme talks about how A me rican kids get ready for the prom nights ome thing which seems to be a pivotal\nmoment in their lives according to this\nsong. It's quite a sad song, and a sad sit-u ation. That this night of ultimately empty\nmoments is seen as ' a perfect moment' is ironically glorified in this song1 can't help wondering if the average US kid will\nget it, though. Maybe that's the point.\nThere are also some relentlessly\nupbeat sounding tracks on the album too. It Must Be Summer is a good exam ple. From the rocking riffs you would expect it to be quite a positive song but\ndelve a little deeper and you discover the\nlyrics: 'The sun is beating me senseless,\nI feel defenceless, like a dying lamb.' You\ncan really feel the anger at the excepted\nnorm in the US.\nThis is an easy album to listen to. All\nthe music is very American college rock.\nNice safe beats and riffs, a bit of hand\nclapping, the occasional bit of distortion\nwhen they really want to 'rock out' and a few slow ones for dancing to. But if you\nscrape away the veneer of nice, you get\ndown to the real stuff. This is an indictment of the life of an 'average' American\nyoung person (this could be extended to\nthe average European's life too as we are\nso influenced by US trends). Hopefully\nthis will give ' em all a kick up the proverbial s. All in all, it slides very nicely into\nyour eardrums and makes you think!\nWhat more could you ask for? H Joel\nBEN FOLDS FIVE\nThe Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Mess ner \u00a3\nPop stars In suits. Whatever\nwill they think of next?\nFirst of all, BFF are a three and not\na five. They comprise of a piano,\na bass guitar and some drums -along with some people to play them. It's not a standard 3-piece set-up and as\nsuch provides a refreshing break from\nthe norm. As well as this, BEF do not\nrefrain from bringing in some string\nand brass sections if they feel they\nneed a larger sound as this album shows. We kick off the album with a bit of Narcolepsy A suitably rocking tune to\nbegin on. Towards the end some more electronic influences start to permeate.\nI don't know why bands feel they have\nto introduce these kind of elements it\njust seems to be the fashion right now. They just about get away with it but you can't help feeling it wasn't in the original song. Best tunes of the album? Magic\ndescribes a close friend passing away\nand how the writer is strangely happy\nthat they've 'traded places with an angel\nnow.' You can feel the pain in this track\n- particularly in Ben Fold's emotive voice.\nArmyls the first single to be used in the\nUK from the album. It really swings.\nRelentlessly upbeat and looking to the future with only a few concerns for the past. The big band sound permeating this track really works -1 think they should\nexplore it more. Your Most Valuable Possession is a jazzy, stoned piece of chilled\nout speech. As far as I can tell, the lyrics\nare a cautionary phone piece from a relation of some kind. It's kind of sweet\nin an innocent way.\nWeaker ones? Your Redneck Past is\na bit of a mixed bag. It starts sounding very Beach Boys-Pet Sounds-ish but then\ncrashes about not really sorting itself\nout. It lapses into French and then stutters into a bit of rap, ending up with\nsome303 beat action. Regrets is about,\nwell, regrets: 'All the days wasted watch\nTV, drinking beer', i never visited my\nGrandma even when she was sick' and T thought I'd do some travelling,' arc typical of the song. It just feels a bit too bal-lady for my tastes, though. Lullabye floats\nalong with some hand clapping and James Earl Jones name checks. It just\ndoesn't grab me along the way.\nSymptomatic of the whole album really - while BFF's musical skills are never\nin question, most of the tunes just did-n't swing me, apart from Army. Whereas previous BFF albums didn't give you a chance to grab breath, this gives you too much time to think about everything\nelse - apart from the song. That's not\nwhat I have come to expect from the five\n- it's a change that's all, which Iam not\nsure is the right direction for them. Previous fans might be in for a little surprise\n- they have moved from a more punk y raw sound perfectly demonstrated in\ntheir first album( the self titled Ben Folds\nFive) to an altogether more ballad based\ntheme. The question remains can Ben Folds Five ever regain the freshness and brilliance of their first offering? I hope so\n- though it's not going to happen with\nthis album, d "

The\nvariation includes deep hard house and\na more energetic hard house track and\nthe whole EP lasts over thirty minutes.\nAvailable on vinyl and CD.\nOut now\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBig Bud\n'State Of Mind'\n(Good Looking)\nA good double A side single from\none of Good Looking's finest artists. The\nfirst side features a breakbeat single\ncalled 'State Of Mind' with its gentle\npads, bouncing 808, beautiful breakdowns and very soulful, almost dreamy\nvocals. The flip side is called 'Transmis-sion' and is deeper than SOM. Hypnotic\nbeats and a morn ful flute give this track\na very ominous flavour - you could almost\nsay it's a modern Mike Oldfield track.\nOut May 17th \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nForce and Paul\n'Chocolate Bar'\n(Compost)\nBavarian breakbeat producers Force\nand Paul's latest drum and bass offering.\nThe single is a double A side, with\n'Chocolate Bar' being a funk fuelled D&B track, whilst the second single, 'Blue\nMovie', features the spooky sample of a German film composer. The track starts\noff very dark before kicking in with a no-nonsense bass line. The flip side gives a Jazzier/funkier mix but without losing\nthe original vibe.\nOut In June\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSteve Morley\n'Reincarnations'\n(Neo)\nExcellent single on the Neo label\nwhich is currently doing the business in\nthe nation's clubs. The original mix is a combination of uplifting synths with a very hard bass line, whilst the flip side mix\nis an epic version akin to Sasha, i.e. very\ndeep, moody and mysterious. Having\nbeen included on both Oakenfold's and\nScott Bond's Essential Mixes this is a very\neagerly awaited tune.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKamaya Painters\n'Endless Wave'\n(Data)\nMinistry of Sound's off-shoot label\ncomes up with this monster epic trance\ntune. Produced by Gatecrasher's new\nresident, DJ Tiesto, it is a track in the\nmould of Ibizan house featuring deep\nbass lines with a simple but effective\npiano tune. There are two mixes on the\n12\". The Albion mix is a favourite of\nOakenfold, Digweed and Nick Warren,\nwhilst the Original mix is a favourite of\nTong, Jules and Graham Gold. I think\nthat says it all.\nOut now\n* \u2022 * \u2022 \u2022\nAutechre\nEP7\n(Warp)\nThe eclectic maestros produce the\ngoods in this very weird but very wonderful EP. EP7 is fucking strange but has\nthe magic to keep you listening to it the\nwhole time. A mixture of Aphex Twin,\nJohn Avery and The Future Sound of\nLondon it's very eclectic and hypnotic.\nOut May 31st \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPauline Taylor\n'Come Down'\n(Cheeky)\nExcellent new single from the Diva.\nThe single is taken from the new album\nand the music is eclectic in both style and\nlyrical content. It comes with a host of\nremixes giving it house/garage, funk and\ndub interpretations. Great lyrics on an\nexcellent tune and plenty of choice. Why\ncan't everything be this good?\nOut May 17th \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDouble Six\n'Breakdown'\n(Multiply)\nGood breakbeat single but is let\ndown by the fact that all the mixes sound\nexactly the same. The track uses an indie\nsound comparable to Blur on top of\nsome lively breaks, but sadly the mixes\naren't good enough.\nOut May 24th Mike Koglin\n' On My Way\"\n(Multiply)\nBrilliant epic euro-house with the\nsuperb dreamy vocals of the beautiful\nFrench singer Beatrice. A pumping bass\nline with a catchy tune and those lucio us vocals have turned this track into a massive anthem not only here, but in the rest\nof Europe too. The remixes are brilliant\nwith the Vocal Mix taking us through a funky acidic journey, the Ruff Driverz\ngiving the track their fast energy club\nbeats work over and Tilt producing an\nepic mix of huge quality.\nOut now\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKektex\n'Inner City Junkies'\n(Tec H) Apparently a \"genre defining epic for\nthe 'av in it generation,\" but more like a pile of bollocks to me. Dance music at its\nmost simple, there is nothing to keep\nyou interested in this tune, whether you\nare just listening to it or jumping around\non the sort of dancefloor where they\nmay play this nonsense. Endless repetition of indecipherable raps and constant\nsiren noises are not really a recipe for\nsuccess these days, even if that may\nhave been the case in the distant, naive\npast of club culture.

    "content": "8 Arts 17 May 1999\nTHE ARTS OF THE SIKH KINGDOM\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nThree hundred years after the inauguration of the Khalsa - fellowship\nof the pure - this exhibition celebrates both the history of Sikhism and the rich culture of the land in which Guru Nanak founded the religion, the Punjab.\nThe Khalsa represents a turning-point in the development of Sikhism.\nSucceeding the first spiritual teacher was\na lineage of ten Gurus who advocated equality and peace between men. Guru Gobind Singh concluded this chain, passing authority on to the holy book of Sikhism, the Guru Granth, which was stored in a temple called Harmandir at\nAmritsar.\nOver a century later, the Sikhs had metamorphosed into skilful fighters desperately striving to retain their identity\nunder the vicious onslaught of religious\npersecution. Invasions were common place as the Punjab was a centre of prosperity. Some of the stolen jewels from this period are On display In the exhibition, as are military costumes, armour and weapons which illustrate\nthe wealth of the province in their detail\nand decadence. The Sikhs\nregained absolute\nrule through the coordination of a young man named\nRanjit Singh. In\n1801 he became the maharaja of the Punjab in the capital, Lahore.\nThrough the efforts\nof the maharaja,\nreligious differences began to be\naccepted and art\nflourished. The results of his\nrestoration of the\nHarmandir are shown in photographs and paint-in gs. The appreciation of fine ries is also shown in\nthe magnificent\nshawls and silks\nproduced by the people of Lahore which\nhave retained their beauty and vibrancy to\nthis day.\nThe paintings\nlargely consist of portraits of the most\nimportant characters\nof Sikh history, and many are intricate in\ndetail. Individual\nflowers in the back-ground of a painting of Maharaja Ranjit Singh have\nstill been bestowed with earnest at ten tion. We are also\noffered a small\ninsight into the prevailing lifestyle\nthrough a series of19 th century paint-in gs. The discriminations of creed are\nlost in the artwork.\nHindus, Muslims and Sikhs were all\ncommissioned by the court of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh and this resulted in\nthe elaboration of styles passed through\ngenerations of artists whose fathers had\nhad very different inspirations. Many Europeans visited Lahore and, stimulated by\nthe exotic court which they encountered,\nproduced artwork that contrasts distinctly\nwith that of the native artists.\nAfter Maharaja Ranjit Singh there\nwas a period of brief successions ending with the appointment of Dalip Singh, a boy aged only seven. The feelings of unrest grew out of control and the British intervened, annexing the Punjab\nin 1849. In the exhibition this era is dominated by portraits with a strong Europ e an influence.\nSlowly peace returned to the Punjab\nand with it came the rekindling of traditional crafts, some of which are still practised today. We are left with examples of\nthese modern pieces which continue to exude the mysteries of this fascinating society.\nDemelza\nUntil 25th July\nAdmission: FREE to students\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.45 pm( Mondays from12) MAYDAY\nThe Photographers' Gallery\nS he is talking loudly in a darkened\nroom. Some people stop to listen for\na few seconds before consulting\ntheir watches impatiently. Only one man seems deeply interested, and he no doubt\nmakes a mental note to tell his wife when he visits her in jail. Elsewhere, an elderly\nman is slumped in front of a TV, watching\na film about the end of the World. And in\nthe corner, three students are surfing the\nNet while their friends examine a photo graph of a public execution.\nAll this in MayDay, the current exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery in\nGreat Newport Street. This is an exciting exhibition because its central theme is transmitted so effectively through multimedia. And appropriately enough, the theme is media communication how we use it and how they use it\nagainst us.\nThe Photographers' Gallery would probably say that all this captures the Zeitgeist (to you and me, the spirit of the\nage). I guess it does, given our current\nand past fixation with media intrusion\ninto the lives of the rich and famous. But how does the media use us, the\nordinary people? films of students rioting\nin Paris in 1968 are juxtaposed with films\nof modern riots. All riots look much the\nsame and the media have always loved\nreporting them. Massive monochrome mug shots of Gulag survivors break up the flow. And postcards depicting executions and coffins sit uncomfortably with pictures of Gap bags - we are controlled by Government and by Corporations and they both use the mass media against us. five-year plans versus buy,\nbuy, buy.\nThe obvious but well expressed message is: apocalypse now, and tomorrow,\nand forever and ever. But don't think a pall\nof gloom hangs over the entire exhibition.\nThe walls are painted in bright yellows,\nreds and oranges. One side of the room is given over to an arts project which has\nencouraged kids from Brixton, Nairobi,\nCape Town and Dhaka to take photos of\ntheir (often extraordinary) everyday lives.\nAll the photos are accompanied by touching captions, written, often in broken English, by the kids themselves. Even if the\ncynical media is destroying our lives today,\nmaybe these amazing children will have\nthe strength to make the World better\ntomorrow. Tragically, maybe they won't. This is less a photography exhibition\nand more an 'infotainment' experience\nwhere you can sit on a comfy chair, read\na book, surf the Internet, or even have\na cup of mediocre espresso in the oh so\ntrying hard to be trendy cafe attached to\nthe Gallery.\nBut what of the girl talking loudly in\na darkened room? In reality, she is standing on a soap box at Speaker's Corner.\nShe has been captured on film, and we are watching her on TV. And what is she\nspeaking in public about? How to speak\nwell in public, of course. Isn't it all so ironic?\nWilliam Bums\nUntil 29th May Admission: FREE\nNearest tube: Leicester Square\nOpening hours: Monday Saturday,\n11am6 pm "

By far the most important\nissue, which I expect Felix has already run\nwith, is the London Transport Discount\nScheme. After much scepticism, London\nTransport has proven that common sense prevails. During the year the\nextension of the scheme to mature students seemed near impossible, but sta-tis tics, a lot of work and the letters that\nyou wrote have helped sway their\nunfounded opinion of mature students.\nFor LT to also extend the scheme to\nweekly travel cards and to allow Imperial to issue the cards through the Union\nas a trial is unbelievable.

The crisis in Kosovo has been been running on\nor near the front pages for the past SO days\nor so, since NATO started bombing in Serbia. Of course the crisis in Kosovo has\nbeen simmering away for the past few\nhundred years, and has roots in old religious divides and imperialist ambitions in\neastern Europe. Residents of the British\nIsles, islands on the north-west extremity of\nEurope, have previously had little cause to\nworry about the politics and murder of\nthe Balkans, as it has rarely affected us.\nThis view is a long way from the truth.\nYou may remember from history lessons\nthat it was a Bosnian Serb, the student\nGavrilo Princip, who shot the Archduke\nFerdinand of Austria, the immediate aftermath of which was the First World War. If\none were to draw out the logic, and\nassume the rise of the the Nazi Party in Germany resulted from the unsuccessful postwar Weimar Republic, and that the Nazis\nprecipitated the Second World War, then\nthis unknown student sits at the root of the\nmost momentous - and evil - events in\nrecent world history.\nThe centre of gravity of Europe has and\nwill continue to move steadily east as the\nvarious countries behind the fallen Iron Curtain make their bids to join the EU and\nNATO. Poland, Hungary and the Czech\nRepublic have now joined the command\nstructure and the all-important Article 5\nstates that an attack on these countries is\nan attack on all the others. Germany's move of its capital from Bonn to Berlin\npushes the centre of attention in Europe's most important country (sorry, but it is) hundreds of miles to the east. Perhaps it is no\nwonder that the UK and France, left out at\nthe western end, have made attempts to\nset up a stronger European military capac-it y. Yet most of us struggle to name many\neastern countries, let alone describe their\ngeography and politics.\nThe present Kosovo crisis is simply the\nlatest manifestation of the centuries old\nproblem. The Balkans sit on a temperamental and violent part of Europe, only a few short miles away from centres of\nIslamic and Judaic power. A little nearer lies\nRome, whose influence over Europe in\nprevious centuries was not much less than\nin the days of the Roman Empire. Add to\nthat the Orthodox faith, and its Russian, Serbian and Greek denominations, and you\nhave the recipe for prolonged and bloody\nconfrontation. The Russians, plus many\nother countries in the neighbourhood, feel\na Slavic unity with the Serbs, and nationalist politicians have not been slow on the\nuptake. Islamic countries have kept quiet,\nnot knowing whether to criticise NATO for\ngoing on the rampage, or to support it for\ndoing it on Muslims' behalf. Italy has only\nthe Adriatic separating it from the conflict,\nand Italians are wary of the war, not least\nwith the American protagonists' popularity\nin the doldrums after a US Marine fighter,\npilot killed 20 people in the ski-lift tragedy.\nThe original Yugoslav break-up saw our\nmodern, dynamic European nations fall\ninto ancient trenches, with Germany plugging for recognition of Croatia, and the UK\nand France supporting Serbia for a while.\nThe original peace-keeping mission, run by\nthe United Nations, failed disastrously in its\nattempt to stop more killing, sending a powerful reminder as to what the UN was\nand was not capable of. It took an uncompromising message from NATO to force\nthem to the negotiating table. Slobodan\nMilosovic. who many credit the whole\nresponsibility for the break-up of Yugoslavia,\nwas a required negotiator and NATO knew\nthey had to have his support to get a deal.\nKosovo was left off the cards.\nMilosovic's wish to re-integrate Kosovo\ninto a 'Greater Serbia' has its routes in the\nmythical tales of Prince Lazar, who heroically died on the fields of Kosovo protecting the Serbian peoples (unfortunately he\nlost and Serbia was dominated by the Turks\nfor a few centuries, but it is a testament to\nthe skill of Serbian politicians that they\nhave made a defeat into such a nationalist celebration). Milosovic removed the\nautonomy granted to Kosovo by Tito, who\nwas skillful in balancing nationalist pressures while keeping Yugoslavia united. Serbians argue that Kosovo was previously\ntheirs, and that the 'recent' influx of Muslims of Albanian descent is no fault of\ntheirs. It is with these arguments that\nMilosovic has been able to force his way\ninto Kosovo and 're-align' the ethnic bal-ance. There is something ironic in the\nSerbs' comparison of the NATO bombing\nto the Nazis when a clearer comparison\ncould be found in their ethnic cleansing\nand extermination. There is little doubt\nthat this latest surge in ethnic cleansing had\nbeen planned for months, and Serbia's negotiating tactics in Rambouillet stood\nas a testament to it. The bombing provided\nthem with the opportunity to blame NATO\nfor it.\nThe NATO countries have had their\nshare of troubles in the bombing too. In\nthe United States, their constitution effectively prohibits war without Congress's approval, with its members looking to the\nmedia and their constituents first, and military thinking second. The success of the\nGulf War is still considered to have been\nattributed to the air supremacy secured by\nthe Allies, when it was the ground war \u2022\n(made considerably easier by being fought\non a large flat desert) that won it. Clinton\nis further ensnared by the political fallout\nfrom any American deaths, and consequently orders US planes to fly high, so as\nnot to get shot down - which means they\ncan't see their targets properly. So they\noccasionally miss and shoot up tractors or\nembassies. Rivalries between the services\nand a distrust of 'foreign' intelligence -even when obtained from allied countries\nlike ours - create communication breakdowns which lead to disasters. Apparently\nwhen the USAF F117 came down over Serbia, the loudest laughs came from the US\nNavy and Army, who thought the USAF\nwere far too arrogant anyway. A ground\ninvasion is easily possible: It would take several divisions - perhaps 100,000 men and\nlosses up to 20% - NATO sources suggest.\nThis is the only way Serbia could be\ncrushed. An independent or autonomous\nKosovo against Serbian wishes would\nrequire similar military manpower and\nlosses, statistics the military provided before\nthe bombing began. Otherwise it's a humiliating climb down, agreement with a Russian-sponsored peace plan, possibly\ninvolving the UN, which was originally\nsnubbed.\nWhat a pity they didn't think about that\nin the first place.\n\n"
