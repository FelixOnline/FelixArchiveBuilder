Simpson\nAnurag Deshpande\nWriter\nWhat makes an Adaptation?\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Editor\nT\nhe year of 1994 was a\nwildly different time.\nInstitutional racism in\nAmerica was under the\nlimelight following the release of\nfootage of police brutality against\nan unarmed black man. The public\nimagination was infatuated with a\nmurder trial that didn\u2019t quite make\nsense and seemed to unfairly target\none man. Also, the Kardashians\nwere big in the news. How the\nworld changes, eh?\nAmerican Crime Story\ndocuments and dramatizes, though\nonly slightly, the tumultuous and\nfrantic events surrounding the\nmurder of American football star\nOJ Simpson\u2019s ex-wife,Nicole Brown\nSimpson, and OJ\u2019s subsequent\ntrial for the crime. The show, as is\nbecoming something of a trend as\nof late, has an all-star cast; with\nthe likes of Cuba Gooding Jr. and\nDavid Schwimmer taking on the\nroles of O.J. and Rob Kardashian,\nrespectively.\nIn general, the acting is very\ngood, and one of the series\u2019 great\nstrengths is that it chooses not\nto focus particularly on Simpson\nhimself, but rather on the plethora\nof unique personalities drawn into\nthe whole sordid saga. If ever a\npiece was fitting of the descriptor\n\u2018ensemble cast\u2019, this would be it.The\nclosest thing to a protagonist lies in\nprosecutor Marcia Clark; though\nthe show takes pains to ensure\nneither side is outright vilified.\nSarah Paulson shines as Clark;\nbringing just the right amount of\nferocity and self-assuredness to the\nviewers. If there\u2019s one fault to be\nfound in the piece\u2019s characterisation,\nit\u2019s that it plays on some of the\n\u2018popular\u2019ideas of what certain people\nwere like, rather than representing\nthem entirely accurately. But hey, it\nmakes for good TV.\nOne of the other pillars of the\nshow is its pacing. Every episode\nfeels tightly plotted; right from\nthe start. The opening sequence,\ncontextualising the era by showing\nus the Rodney King beating and\nsubsequent riots, followed by\nthe fast-moving breakdown of\nthe discovery of the crime and\nits evidence, are instantly and\npowerfully gripping. This trend is\nthe fusion of the \u2018White Bronco\u2019\nchase with the Beastie Boys\u2019\n\u2018Sabotage\u2019. In fact, the soundtrack\nchoice throughout is pretty great.\nOccasionally, however, the cheese\ngets a bit much and overpowers the\nmeat of the story. Moments like the\nvoicemails from O.J\u2019s kids to their\ndead mother are a bit much and\ndespite being historically probable,\nstretch credulity slightly and take\nyou out of the story a bit. There\nare also certain points where we\nare treated to some well written,\nwonderfully subtle subtext, only to\nhave it be immediately explained by\nthe characters. There\u2019s also way too\nmuch of a focus on the Kardashian\nkids, for seemingly no other reason\nthan to cash in on their popularity.\nThere\u2019s also a random,really obvious\nand heavy handed, and, in my\nopinion, unnecessary shot thrown at\nthem in the third episode. But then,\nI\u2019m a fan of Yeezy and by extension,\nKim, so maybe I\u2019m a little biased\nthere.\nOverall, the show feels like an\nanti-\u2018Making a Murderer\u2019. Here,\nwe follow a charismatic team of\nlawyers as they get off a (let\u2019s face\nit) probably guilty double murderer,\nwhile a battered district attorney\ntries desperately to stop them. I\nhighly recommend this to any\nTrue Crime fans, and anyone who\u2019s\nlooking for something good to\nfollow. I\u2019m definitely hooked, and in\nthis till the end.\nAmerican Crime Story is available\non Amazon Prime\nrole. She is expertly framed as a\ntragic hero; giving her the audience\nsupport and goodwill despite the\nforegone conclusion.\nAnother standout performance\ncomes from Courtney B. Vance;\nplaying what quickly became\nmy favourite character, Johnnie\nCochran. Vance\u2019s energy and\nsuave demeanour are downright\ncontagious. He\u2019s the salesman\nwho you know is trying to sell\nyou something, but you can\u2019t\nhelp be charmed. At the end of\nthe day, you\u2019re going home with\nthat extended warranty. There\u2019s a\ncharacter for everyone, and some\ngreat \u2018magnificent bastard\u2019moments\nthat\u2019ll be sure to get smirks out of\ncontinued in the second episode; the\nentirety of which is dedicated to the\nnow infamous \u2018White Bronco\u2019 car\nchase. The writing always keeps the\naudience\u2019s pulse high, and ensures\nthat momentum is not lost, even in\nmellower moments. No scene feels\nwasted or outstays its welcome;\nthough this is often the luxury of\na mini-series that knows exactly\nhow long it has to cover something.\nThey even manage to sneak in some\nreally great, if sometimes subtle,\nhumorous moments (\u2018who the hell\nbrings a lawyer to a funeral?\u2019 asks\nthe paparazzo while trying to take\npictures of it).\nThere is a tendency to be a bit\ncheesy here and there. At times,\nthis pays off brilliantly; the most\nprominent example so far being\nIf ever a piece\nwas fitting of\nthe descriptor\n\u2018ensemble\ncast\u2019, this\nwould be it\nThe writing\nalways\nkeeps the\naudience\u2019s\npulse\nhigh, and\nensures that\nmomentum is\nnot lost\nThe Dream Team. Photo Credit: Fox\nThe Juice is loose. Photo Credit: Fox\nT\nhese days it seems\nlike the most popular\nmedium for TV shows\nto take inspiration\nfrom is the literary one. With\nseveral books, graphic novels and\ncomics, sometimes with decades\nof mythology, it\u2019s hard to see why\nnot. When something works in a\nmedium where scenes are static or\nleft to the imagination, then seeing\nthem in action should be something\nspecial. These days, there are a large\nnumber of successful shows and\nseries which are, in some shape or\nform, adaptations. So in this piece,\nI\u2019ll be examining, what makes a\ngood adaptation and what are the\nkey areas TV show creators end up\neither nailing or ruining.\nThe very first thing which comes\nto mind is source material. If it\u2019s\nworked once, why fix what isn\u2019t\nbroken? For the most part this is\ntrue; however, if the show is too\nclose to its source, it adds nothing\nsubstantial. The key thing here is to\nrespect and understand the source\nmaterial, but also not bog things\ndown. Novel and comic book series\nshould set the overall atmosphere\nand blueprint, but shows should try\nto be fresh and do something which\nmakes them unique.\nFor an obvious example, we can\nlook at the CW\u2019s adaptations\nof various DC Comics heroes\nand stories. While they get some\nelements right, they are different\nand special in their own right. As an\nextension of my point, these shows\nneed to make sure to not just cater\nto the fans. Shows like Arrow and\nFlash bring in a lot of mythology\nfrom the over 50-year history of\nthe characters, but they\u2019re able to\ndo it in a way that someone who\nisn\u2019t comic-literate can appreciate\nthem. Its nice to have Easter eggs\nand little nods to fans, but the basic\nelements of these shows needs to be\nunderstandable without having to\ncheck Wikipedia.\nWhile originality is good,there are\ncertain limits shows need to stick to\nor work around. Game of Thrones\nis known for being excellent at\nadapting The Song of Ice and Fire.\nHowever, when it comes to putting\nits own spin on things and trying\nout a new direction, there\u2019s usually\nmixed reactions at best. Shows\nwhich are more loosely adapted like\nSherlock can also work really well,\nthough sometimes they go the way\nof Dexter or Vampire Diaries where\nboth the book and TV medium\nhave diverged greatly, and not for\nthe better.Being original and telling\nyour own story is all well and good,\nbut it should never be forgotten why\nthe original works were so successful\nin the first place. For example, while\nthe Walking Dead is a good enough\nTV show on its own, it\u2019s only a\nshadow of its comic book self and\nis a rather weak representation as a\nwhole.\nA bad move to make on the part\nof the executives would be to get\nthe characters wrong. Unless they\nare very, very clever, the worst thing\ncreators could do would be to just\nslap in a character and not deliver\non their potential, or just get them\nplain wrong. Honestly, as long\nas you can really understand the\ncharacters and the root of the story,\nit\u2019s hard to mess up.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold\nfeatures Batman at his most light-hearted, fighting telepathic gorillas,\ngoing into space and teaming up\nwith a large variety of colorful and\nostentatious characters. However,\nit never forgets who Batman is and\nwhat his origins are; he\u2019s always\ngrounded and behaves exactly as you\nwould expect Batman to behave. By\ncomparison, the Dresden Files TV\nseries was known for changing its\ncharacters and being a more watered\ndown version of the beloved book\nseries. It would probably explain\nwhy the show was axed after one\nseason.\nBringing a series to life and\nmaking it fit the TV medium is\nalso a challenge in its own right.\nComic books rely on bright and\ncolourful but essentially static\npictures to tell the story. Stories\nfrom books are completely crafted\nby your imagination. Care needs to\nbe taken to visualise and recreate\niconic scenes and characters in a\nway which everyone can appreciate.\nThere are also several subtle touches\nand mechanisms which need to be\naccounted for.In books,exposition is\njust given but in TV shows, it needs\nto be woven into the action in some\nway. It has to be revealed as things\nare happening \u2013 the same being true\nfor any backstory elements.\nMost shows are able to grasp\nthis and make good work with it.\nGame of Thrones does well with\nits depictions of various locations\nas well as big climactic moments\nlike the Battle of Blackwater, or\nseeing the dragons in action. TV\nshows are also the best medium\nfor comic books as they are able\nto adopt the nature of serialized\nstorytelling extremely well. This\ncan be validated by all the great live\naction and animated series that have\nbeen produced.\nWith more and more successful\nshows, even more stories and\nadventures get adapted. To name a\nfew, Neil Gaiman\u2019s American Gods\nand Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of\nUnfortunate Events are coming up\nand in production. Adaptations just\naren\u2019t going away and every time a\nshowrunner nails all the sweet spots,\nit\u2019s one more great show for all of us\nto watch and enjoy.\nShows\nshould try to\nbe fresh and\ndo something\nwhich makes\nthem unique\nCare needs\nto be taken\nto visualise\nand recreate\niconic\nscenes and\ncharacters\nThe CW \u2018Arrowverse\u2019 is an open and fun world of its own.

Now I'm a\nPG I sat down to watch Meet The\nCandidates (they're all so young!\nWhat cuties!) before I cast my vote,\nand was unpleasantly surprised.

It is about the extent to\nwhich the influence of that singular\ncraftsman, Sandro Botticelli \u2013\nfather of Venus and Primavera \u2013\npermeated the art world through\nthe centuries.\nThe exhibits are eclectic \u2013 they\u2019re\nfrom film, photography, drawing,\nsculpture, and even the fashion\nworld. We are treated to a truly\nimpressive melange of Botticelli fan-art, including works by Magritte,\nWarhol, Rossetti, each bringing to\nBotticelli their own personal style\nand flair in their various tributes, as\nwell as over fifty original works by\nthe master himself.\nThe exhibit is designed anti-Botticelli Reimagined\nAbhinav Varma\nWriter\nA compelling but contrariwise journey through Botticelli\u2019s artistic influence\ncelebrated icon of human culture.\nWhy not start now, when Botticelli\nis at the apex of relevancy and\nfashion, and proceed backwards?\nItcertainlymakesforaninteresting\nexperience. Assaulting the eye upon\nentry is a piece by Dolce & Gabbana\n\u2013 which is, I believe, a company that\ndeals with fashionable things in the\npresent day, shoes and perfumes and\nwhatnot. It\u2019s the \u2018Venus Dress\u2019, a\nflowering garment that is patterned\nwith prints of the face and body of\nBotticelli\u2019s Venus.A plethora of chic\nmodel shoots line the wall, where\nbeautiful women of today strike the\nVenus pose, wearing pretty dresses,\ngowns, and sometimes only a\ncarefully-placed object, much in the\nvein of the FELIX centrefolds. The\nessence of 15th\ncentury aesthetics\nmay have fallen out of fad through\nthe ages,but the iconic pose remains.\nAs we move further down the\nroom, we see a Warhol piece \u2013\nthe artist, as the caption tells us,\n\u2018Rebirth of Venus\u2019 by David LaChapelle, 2009. Photo Credit: Studio LaChapelle\nalso \u201creduced [Botticelli] to the\npainter of a single, iconic image:\nthe Venus\u201d. Indeed, he is not alone;\nthis exhibition could well be called\n\u201cVenus in the Uffizi: Reimagined\u201d.\nAccompanying Warhol is Jacquet,\ntitan of Nouveau Realism \u2013\nessentially the European version of\nAmerican Pop Art \u2013 who plasters\nthe goddess with iconography from\nthe oil company, Shell (I see what\nyou did there, Jacquet). Magritte\nhas his own take on the subject a\nfew metres away, with a work he\ndescribed as \u2018Primavera by Botticelli\non a man with a bowler hat as seen\nfrom behind\u2019. Naturally, if Magritte\nis inspired by something, he puts it\non a man with a bowler hat as seen\nfrom behind! It\u2019s an interesting\npiece, and really juxtaposes two very\ndifferent sensibilities in a decidedly\ncurious way.\nTwooftheartiststhatreallycaught\nmy eye were both contemporary\nones, so contemporary, in fact, that\nthey were actually present at the\npress launch. It is fair to say that\nthe artists caught my eye as much\nas their works did. The first was\nYin Xin, a Parisian artist whose\n\u2018Venus after Botticelli\u2019 is essentially\nBotticelli\u2019s Venus, in all its oil\nand tempera glory, with one little\nfrom the Victorian times. The\nman behind the costume is equally\nstriking \u2013 an intelligent, resolute\nfigure who is among the most\nenigmatic people I have ever had the\npleasure of interviewing. I chat with\nhim awhile about cross-cultural\nstandards of beauty, and eventually\nour conversation turns to the more\ninteresting topic of surviving as\nan oil-and-canvas artist in today\u2019s\nParisian art climate. He believes in\nsticking to the traditional ways, he\ntells me,which I think is remarkable.\nMany of the artists on display have\nmerely reproduced Botticelli, with\nthe modern instruments of pop\u2018Mars and Venus\u2019 by Sandro Botticelli, c. 1483.

Yin\nXin, I feel, has truly reimagined the\nmaster, and felt no need to resort\nto wild changes in medium and\nstyle for gimmicky effect. It\u2019s worth\nseeing this exhibition just to see his\nwork.\nTheotherisacolourfulFrenchlady\nby the name of ORLAN, who has\nbeen pushing the boundaries of Art\never since the 60s. Her contribution\nto the exhibition includes\n\u2018Hybridization of Botticelli\u2019s Venus\u2019,\nwhere she morphs her own face\n(purposefully frozen in something of\na macabre and intentionally horrific\nexpression) on to that of Venus.\nUpon questioning, she tells me that\nthis was her attempt to \u2018deconstruct\u2019\nthe ideal of beauty, much in the\nFrench Continental style of Derrida\nand de Man. Another work is the\n\u2018Occasional Strip-tease\u2019, her final\npose a direct allusion to the Venus,\nand yet another is \u2018Operation\nOpera\u2019, where she is photographed\nin the surgeon\u2019s room while\nundergoing various plastic surgery\nprocedures \u2013 the surgeons dressed\non her behest in fancy dress, the\nbed surrounded by props ranging\nfrom fruits to lobsters, and a book\nof Lacanian philosophy in her hand.\nchange \u2013 Yin Xin\u2019s Venus is Asian.\nHe maintains all the other formal\nelements of Botticelli\u2019s work, but\ntweaks the features ever so slightly\nso that she is now a symbol not\nof European but Chinese beauty.\nWearing an old fashioned trench\ncoat and flat cap, he looks like your\narchetypical private investigator\nBotticelli is at\nthe apex of\nrelevancy and\nfashion\nchronologically, starting with the\nmodern times and winding its way\nback to the Old Masters. A curious\nchoice, made because \u201c[Botticelli\u2019s]\nwork has been the subject of a\ncomplex process of reappraisal\nwhich mirrors the changing\nvalues of prosperity\u201d, so they say.\nEssentially, I think it means to say\nthat the master has been getting\nmore popular as time goes by \u2013 his\nwork was forgotten in its own day,\nprogressively rediscovered in the 19th\ncentury, and gained popularity over\nthe 20th\nand until now his work is a\nThe essence\nof 15th\ncentury\naesthetics\nmay have\nfallen out of\nfad through\nthe ages, but\nthe iconic\npose remains\nThe first\nsection\nremains the\nhighlight and\nis certainly\nworth the\nprice of entry!\nYin Xin\nhas truly\nreimagined\nthe master,\nwithout\nresorting to\nwild changes\nin medium\nand style for\ngimmicky\neffect.\nMy interview with her reveals that\nshe considers herself more of a\nphilosopher than an artist \u2013 she is\nalso something of an exhibit, I feel,\nas a horde of photographers casually,\nsilently, take flash pictures of her\nwith their camera inches from her\nface. I wonder if she is more popular\nthan her art, as is the sad affliction\nof many \u2018modern\u2019 artists these days.\nThe rest of the exhibition is a\nconventional romp through art\nfrom the previous centuries, each\nof the pieces either by Botticelli or\na contemporary, or of those that\nfollowed him and were inspired\nby him. However, the first section\n\u2013 with the ORLAN and Yin Xin\nworks \u2013 remains the highlight and\ncould really carry the exhibition by\nitself. It\u2019s certainly worth the price\nof entry!\nBotticelli Reimagined is on at the\nV&A until July 3rd\nTickets from \u00a310.\n\n"

Indeed, last year my life\nreached such a dramatic height\nthat I was led to believe joining the\nImperial Dramatic Society would\nbe a good way to meet like-minded\nindividuals.\nHowever, shortly after signing\nup, I discovered to my great dismay\nthat I had been selected to play a\n\u2018role\u2019 in a \u2018stage production,\u2019 and\nthat DramSoc did not in any way\nresemble a group-therapy society of\nthe Alcoholics-Anonymous type.\nNot wanting to lose face, I quietly\nfeigned acceptance of this turn of\nevents and applied myself to reading\nthe prescribed text.\nThankfully the character I had\nbeen cast as, Michael Doyle, is a\nsimple-minded fireman from New\nYork with considerable skills in the\nwoman department. As an Imperial\nAeronautics student from Australia,\nI clearly found this character highly\nrelatable and have had much joy\ndepicting him and his questionable\nintellect in rehearsals to date. It isn\u2019t\nall fun and games though!\nBeing a part of this \u2018stage\nproduction\u2019 (which I hear is called\n\u2018The Big Fellah\u2019) has meant a lot\nof learning too. In my experiences\nthus far I have learned the answers\nto many questions that have\ndeeply troubled me throughout my\nchildhood and adolescence. For\nexample; Who is Sinn Fein? Where,\nand what actually is Ireland? How\ndo you pronounce Sinn Fein? What\ndoes it feel like to actually kiss a girl\nin real life? Where is MR4 in Beit?\nWhy are people so racist? IRA?\nThankfully we have a resident\nNorthern Irishman on hand in the\ncast to answer the cultural questions\nThe Large Male\nImperial College Gospel ChoirTurns 10\nT\nenth birthday\ncelebrations are always\nthe most memorable,\nparticularly if you\u2019re a\n90s baby. Back then, the Spice Girls\nwere immortal divas and singing\nzealously to Sisqo\u2019s \u2018Thong Song\u2019\nwas a social onus. Who can forget\nthe numbing hours spent designing\npaper invitations in Microsoft\nPublisher? Who can forget that\ninexplicable glee at finding a tube\nof Smarties in your party bag?\nGifts then were incredibly humble.\nUnwrapping a Tamagotchi could\nelicit wild amounts of excitement,\nvented through endless puffs into\nelaborately coloured party blowers.\nImperial College Gospel Choir\u2019s\n(ICGC) 10th\nbirthday celebration\nwon\u2019t be quite the same but it will\ncertainly be unforgettable.\nOn March 17th\n, ICGC will\nbe marking its 10th\nyear with its\nbiggest Easter concert to date.\nGospel choirs from Queen Mary\nUniversity, UCL and Kings will be\njoining in with the celebrations too.\nA collaboration of this size is very\nrare. So what has kept ICGC going\nall these years? Not many societies\nat Imperial live to see ten. Three\ningredients have preserved the\ngroup\u2019s vivaciousness. Firstly, it is\nunbelievably open; ICGC members\nare one of the most diverse groups\nyou come across on campus. You\u2019ll\nfind a professor singing next to a\nfresher, and a film student dancing\nICGC at their Christmas concert December 2015 Photo Credit: Imperial Gospel Choir\n(no spoilers - come and see the\nplay to figure out who it is) and the\ndirectors do their part handling the\nother ones. I must admit, however,\nkissing Hasan in the audition was\na little strange, especially seeing as\nhe insisted on wearing lipstick (he\nclaimed he was \u201cmethod acting\u201d).\nPerhaps the best part of being in\nIt isn\u2019t all\nfun and\ngames\nthough\nDramSoc\u2019s second play of the Spring Term is The Big Fellah\nalongside an engineer. Another\nthing that keeps the choir going are\ntheir interesting gigs. These have\nincluded the standard wedding\nbut also an appearance as back-up\nsingers on the X-factor. Plus, not\nmany students get to perform on\nthe London underground or get\ninvited to sing at the illustrious Ideal\nHome show. The final ingredient\nis fun and lots of it. As cheesy\nas that may sound, being part of\nICGC comes with immensely\namusing experiences. It\u2019s no wonder\ngenerations of students continue to\njoin the family.\nIn ten years, ICGC has achieved\namazing things. For instance,\nthey were finalists four times at\nUniversity Gospel Choir of the Year,\nthe UK\u2019s biggest inter-university\ncompetition. To add to this, they\nrecently had their first broadcasting\ndebut on Premier Gospel radio.\nMost importantly, the choir now\nowns a special set of robes that\nbeautifully complete their gospel\nimage and theatrics.\nJoin the birthday celebrations\non March 17th\nat St Paul\u2019s\nHammersmith, with a drinks\nreception from 6pm and the\nshow from 7pm, We will also be\nsupporting the children\u2019s hospice\ncharity, Havenhouse as part of our\ncelebration!

It has proven\nto be an ideal venue for the vibrant\nexpression of my personal dramas.\nWell, either the Caf\u00e9 Forum or\nthe fact that I can now go around\ntelling people that I play the\n\u2018protagonist\u2019 in the DramSoc play\n(no, not Birdland), despite the fact\nthat Michael mostly sits around in\nscenes being stupid and the majority\nof his lines are the word \u201cno.\u201d\nAll in all, it\u2019s been a jolly good\ntime for me.

Photo Credit: Ninja Tune\nT\nhrowing Shade, AKA\nNabihah Iqbal, is an\nartist who educates. Her\nbackground in history\nand ethnomusicology (in which\nshe holds a degree from SOAS)\nheavily influences her bi-weekly\nHouse of Silk, with iridescent\nartwork that reflects the aesthetic\nqualities of her music \u2013 a hazy\nblur of sharp light and colour, like\nlooking into soap bubbles. Her\nmusic is often described as \u201ccosmic\nR&B\u201dand \u201celectro dream-pop\u201d, and\nthis collection of five tracks with\nmetaphor-inducing titles stay true\nto those labels.\nThe opening track, \u2018hashtag\nIRL\u2019, is very PC Music-esque \u2013 a\nconnection which makes sense\nconsidering she was revealed as the\nvoice of SOPHIE\u2019s \u2018Lemonade\u2019\nearlier this year. Layers of bored\nsaccharine vocals spell out internet\nacronyms like OMG, LOL, WTF\nthat have become so ingrained in\nour language today. Iqbal describes\nthis track as a commentary on the\n\u201canti-social reality of social media\u201d,\nand the isolated \u201c#please follow me\u201d\nat the end perfectly encapsulates the\ndesperate undertones of internet\nculture. However, it feels somewhat\nout of place, with the rest of the EP\nhaving a more coherent and gentle\ntheme.\n\u2018Marble Air\u2019 is a wavy piece with\nrippling synths and claps, evoking\nimages of those iridescent soap\nbubbles taking flight. The lack\nof a concrete ending gives the\nimpression of floating aimlessly, and\nthe track generally has a celestial\nquality. \u2018Ecco Echo\u2019 features lilting\nacid-tinged synths that fade in\nand out of each other to create a\ndreamy trance-like rhythm, with\nclear Eastern influences. \u2018Fear of\nSilence\u2019 is the perfect continuation\nof \u2018Ecco Echo\u2019, as we sink deeper\n\u2018Underneath My Eyelids\u2019, where\nyou feel as though you are gliding\nthrough an other-worldly house\nof silk. Like \u2018Marble Air\u2019, the track\nfades into the void \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel\ncomplete, but then maybe that\u2019s the\npoint. The listener is left out in the\ndepths, in a state of calm perplexity.\nAlthough it may not be as\ncomplex as some of her other work,\nsuch as the Fate Xclusive EP from\n2015, House of Silk is still a beautiful\nembodiment of dreamy synth-pop\nfrom an artist who shows great\npromise and versatility.\nHouse of Silk is out now on Ninja\nTune\nNTS Radio show, where she\nweaves sounds from all over the\nworld into a culturally rich sonic\ntapestry, exploding with colour and\nexposing listeners to the \u201cweird and\nwonderful\u201d. As well as this, she\u2019s a\nproducer whose wealth of musical\nknowledge shines through in each\nof her glittering compositions.\nHer new EP released just last\nweek on Ninja Tune is entitled\ninto the hypnagogic state. The title\nalso reminded me of the sentiments\nexpressed in \u2018hashtag IRL\u2019, where\nwe need to be drowned in social\nmedia noise to avoid the silence of\nour supposedly insipid lives. Finally,\nthe EP closes with the reverbed\nchimes and silky humming of\n#HotTakes of the Week\nNever to be one out of the\nheadlines, this week Kanye West\ndescribed the minimalist, clear\njewel box packaging to his last\nalbum Yeezus as an \u201can open casket\nto CDs r.i.p\u201d.

The Ichthyosaur,\notherwise known as the \u2018fish lizard\u2019,\nbewildered scientists with its\nsudden disappearance some 34-35\nmillion years before the cretaceous-paleocene extinction event. Novel\nresearch has put some ease to\nscientists deliberations, finding that\nclimate change could have been the\nguilty culprit to the Ichthyosaur\u2019s\nextinction.\nThe famous fossil fanatic, Mary\nAnning, discovered Ichthyosaur\nfossilised remains in 1810, near\nLyme Regis, Dorset. Since,\nscientists have strived to understand\nthe Ichthyosaur species further,\nfinding that it was a very diversified\norganism especially towards the end\nof its reign. Thus it is surprising to\nlearn that it was in fact a very slow\nadapting species. When you couple\nslow adaptation with environmental\nvolatility, extinction usually soon\nfollows. Ichthyosaurs were exposed\nto rising sea levels and temperatures,\nwhich rapidly reorganised marine\necosystems some 100 million years\nago. Lead researchers, Dr Valentine\nFischer of the University of Liege\nand the University of Oxford, said\nthat the fish\u2019s ability to adapt was\njust \u201ctoo slow\u201d.

For the first time, scientists\nhave illustrated the biomechanics\nof this process. The Hydra hangs\naround, literally adhered to a rock\nor other surface, and waits until\nthe unknowing prey falls victim\nto Hydra\u2019s prevailing tentacles. A\nbrush against it leads to the release\nof a poisoned barb stinging the prey\ninto paralysis. Specialised cells then\nstretch apart as radially orientated\nfibres contract. This allows the\nHydra to then swallow its prey\nwhole. Investigating this feeding\nprocess at a cellular level has lead the\nway for further investigations. Lead\nresearcher,Jason Carter,biophysicist\nat the University of California, and\nher research team, are now looking\nat the physiological consequences of\nthis shape changing for the Hydra\u2019s\ncells.\nCarter et al 2016 @ Biophysical\nJournal\nponder over this theory along with\npreviously proposed alternatives;\nsuch as the rise of the bony fish, like\nsharks, and their competitive edge,\nchipping away at the Ichthyosaur\u2019s\nfood supply.\nThis proposed theory gives an\nessence to the past that breaths a\nsharp chilling thought towards the\nfuture of many of today\u2019s species.\nToday\u2019s warming oceans and\nmelting ice caps evoke a feeling\nof of \u2018deja-vu\u2019 threatening those\nspecies, which like the Ichthyosaur,\nmight not be able adapt fast enough.\nMadeleine Webb\nWriter\nCoffee makes the brain go round\nWhat is the link between excessive coffee consumption and\nmultiple sclerosis?\nScience\n& the City\nI\nn our occidental institutions\nof learning, the hallways\nhear the daily echoes of\nour scientific history being\ntaught in classrooms. \u201cWe stand\non the shoulders of giants\u201d was a\n12th\ncentury quote, though more\ncommonly attributed to Sir Isaac\nNewton. It\u2019s an acknowledgment\nof our predecessors, the trials and\nerrors, insights and ideas, lessons\nand losses, all that we have built our\nfoundation of knowledge on.\nBut do we truly acknowledge\nthe entire foundation? Or are our\ninstitutions culturally biased? I\u2019m\nthinking of the 4000 year old Hindu\nrecords that describe an elegant\nconcept of matter so small it would\nbe indestructible \u2013 what we now\ncall an atom. Or recent research\nthat showed how Babylonians were\nusing geometry to calculate the\nmovements of Jupiter 14 centuries\nbefore Europeans figured it out .\nAlongside Mayans and Indians,\nBabylonians independently came\nup with the idea of the number zero\nthousands of years ago. We take\nit for granted now, but for much\nof humanity, this emptiness had\nno mathematical or placeholder\nrepresentation - and it was not\nborne out of our occidental history.\nYet, we are not taught these\nhistories in our schools, not\nuntil our hallowed flowering of\nenlightened consciousness, wholly\nand conveniently concentrated\nin Europe. Unfortunately, it is\nincredibly limiting to reinforce\nsuch a historically linear European\nnarrative of science that ignores the\nmassive compendium of knowledge\nthat we have all actually been\ndrawing from (and lost much of) for\nthousands of years from a complex\ntapestry of different cultures and\nhistories worldwide - many of which\nwere often far more advanced than\nus in their knowledge, innovation,\nand science.\nGiven our access to almost all of\nthat information digitally, it\u2019s time\nfor the occidental consciousness to\nstep back from our self-aggrandizing\nand be humbled.I imagine we\u2019ll find\nmore than a few lost lessons along\nthe way, as we walk our hallways\nanew and begin to hear the echoes\nof a more accurate scientific history\n- one that sees all of the giants\nwhose shoulders we stand on.\nNAOMI STEWART\nLef Apostolakis, Jane Courtnell\nSciece Editors\nConfidence and\nintelligence\nAvoidable\nerrors in NHS\nOpen wide\nTwo reports published on Tuesday\nfrom Imperial College suggest\nthat there are too many avoidable\nerrors in NHS patient care. The\nfirst report criticises the National\nReporting and Learning System\n(NRLS) which is used by staff\nto report patient safety incidents,\nspecifically pointing out a worrying\noccurrence of under-reporting.\nHowever it also criticises the mindset of medical practitioners. Erik\nMayer, lead author, pointed out\nthat the \u201cevidence suggests that as\nlittle as five percent of patient safety\nincidents are reported. This is often\nrelated to the culture of institutions\nand the culture of medicine.\u201d\nThe second report offers\nsuggestions to improve patient\nsafety, and strongly pushes for\nadoption of more digital solutions.\nHowever, one has to ask: how\nunavoidable are these errors when\nmedical practitioners across the UK\nare overworked and underpayed?\nYu et al 2016 - Patient Safety\nDarzi et al 2016 - National\nReporting and Learning System\nResearch Development\nL\nosing a limb does not\nmean you have lost your\ntouch.

Yet new research\nsuggests that drinking coffee may\nhave other benefits besides waking\nyour brain up for that 9am lecture.\nSpecifically, evidence suggests\nthat six cups of coffee a day can\nsignificantly decrease chance of\ndeveloping multiple sclerosis (MS).\nIn a collaborative effort,\nresearchers from the Karolinska\nInstitute in Stockholm, Johns\nHopkins University in Maryland\nand the University of California\nconducted studies in both the US\nand Sweden, looking at when coffee\nlovers had picked up their habit\nas well as how much coffee they\nindulged in. Results showed that\nthose who drank around 900 ml\nof coffee a day (the equivalent of\nsix small cups or two Grande cups,\nStarbucks style),were up to 30% less\nlikely to develop MS than people\nnot drinking coffee. Dr Emma\nGray, head of clinical trials at the\nMS Society, argues: \u201cThis study\nprovides new evidence that the link\nbetween the risk of developing MS\nand coffee consumption is worth\nexploring.\u201d\nThis news is especially important\nwhen taking into account that\ndespite having 100,000 people in\nthe UK alone suffering from MS,\nrelatively little is known about\nwhat causes the disease. Symptoms\nsuch as loss of motor function and\nchronic pain to name but a couple,\nare due to the destruction of the\nmyelin sheath around neurons, i.e.\ndemyelination. This slows down\nthe conduction of electronic signals\nbetween the brain and the rest of\nbody, which causes physical and\nsometimes even psychological\nproblems.\nA wide range of factors, both\nenvironmental and genetic, have\nbeen suggested as underlying causes\nbut there is still no consensus\nabout what triggers demyelination.\nSo the apparent link between\ncoffee consumption and MS may\ngive researchers a new angle to\nThis latest media coffee\nendorsement is part of a wider\ntrend in mainstream reporting. The\nDaily Mail runs stories about the\nmiraculous effects of coffee almost\nas regularly as it claims something\nhas been proven to cause cancer\n(there\u2019s a list of 116 factors last\ntime I checked). Only recently, it\nwas claimed that coffee reduces\nchances of liver cirrhosis, helps\nprevent early onset Alzheimer\u2019s,\nand even helps with the burning of\nfat. However, these claims are not\nfully substantiated and are often\ncontradicted by other data. While\nit doesn\u2019t necessarily discount the\nresearch, much of the reporting on\nhealth is highly simplified and prone\nto exaggeration. Not to mention\nthat a lot of the health benefits fall\naway when looking at people who\nadd high levels of milk and sugar\ninto their coffee.\nSo, before you run off to the\nSAF caf\u00e9 for a double shot of\nespresso,keep in mind that as with\nall observational studies, the results\nare far from conclusive. And even\nthough researchers controlled their\nstudies to take into account other\npotentially influencing factors, the\ngolden rule of science still remains\ncorrelation does not necessarily\nimply causation. So don\u2019t use these\nSix cups\nof coffee\na day can\nsignificantly\ndecrease\nchance of\ndeveloping\nmultiple\nsclerosis\nDon\u2019t use\nthese\nfindings as\nan excuse\nfor that\nextra cup\nof coffee,\nat least not\nyet\nfindings as an excuse for that extra\ncappuccino, at least not yet. Not\nuntil more research is conducted\ninvestigate pathogenesis as well\nas develop new treatments for the\ndisease.\nand the link between caffeinating up\nbefore uni and neurodegenerative\ndiseases is fully understood.\nRegardless of what coffee does or does not do, we love it and can\u2019t live without it.

No one\nlikes those horrible 40% grades.\nHowever, new research suggests\nthat to be overconfident in tasks is\nto have a closed mindset, thinking\nthat intelligence is fixed and\nunchangeable. People who are\noverconfident are such because\nthey choose tasks which are easy,\nand spend little amount of time\non hard parts and tasks. People\nwho risk failure, diving in at the\ndeep end to challenge themselves\nwith more difficult tasks, tend to\nhave the view that intelligence is\nsomething which can grow. As said\nby Ainsley Mitchum of the Florida\nState University and Carol Dweck\nof Stanford University, \u2018having a bit\nof overconfidence is a good thing,\nbut large amounts can lead people\nto make bad decisions and miss out\non opportunities to learn\u2019.\nEhrlingeret al 2016 @ Jounral of\nExperimental Social Psychology\n\n"

Photo Credit: ICTV\nL\nast week, Theresa Davey\nwrote an interesting article\nabout the nature of union\nelections and how they\nare, essentially, a popularity contest.\nThis is a real danger associated\nwith student elections when, due\nto the short election period, it is\ndifficult for the candidates with well\nthought-out policies to be separated\nfrom those looking for a cushy job.\nIt therefore falls to media to assist\nthe electorate in deciding who the\nfakes are.\nMeet The Candidates was\nsupposed to take on this role,but was\ninterrupted by technical difficulties,\nleaving candidates a disappointing\n2 minutes to talk about why they\nshould be elected. It was therefore\nplanned for an ICradio show\n(yes, Imperial has a radio station)\nto interview these presidential\ncandidates in an extended format,\nallowing them time to expand on\ntheir views. This would have been\na great step towards giving the\ncandidates the accountability they\nall claim to want.\nWhen the prospect of the show\nwas broached to candidates they\nrightly expressed concerns about the\npotential bias and the supposedly\npoor tone taken by the show\u2019s hosts.\nThe union was rightly involved and\nagreed that as long as the hosts\nshowed no bias the show would go\nahead.The show was then given the\nunion\u2019s blessing, with advertising\nfeatured on the twitter pages of the\ncurrent Union President and the\nunion itself.\nWhether the host would have\nprovided bias or not we will\nnever know, as around half of the\ncandidates dropped out with 57\nminutes\u2019 notice, resulting in the\nshow\u2019s cancellation and unsavoury\ninternet bickering from both sides.\nThe way the whole thing turned\nout was rather disappointing.\nIn my mind it was unprofessional\nfor the candidates to drop out of a\ncommitment so late, and it quashed\na great opportunity for them to\nshow their substance.\nThe social media feeds of the\npresenters has hardly helped\ntheir claims of impartiality, with\nmessages before and after justifying\nand confirming the fears of the\ncandidates who later withdrew.\nIt is annoying that what could\nhave been an interesting show\nproviding a great insight into who\ndoes and doesn\u2019t have what it takes\nfell into a silly high school-esque\nflame war that just made everyone\nlook foolish.

The meme is\ndead. 22 years\nafter his first\nnomination, good old Leo has\nfinally nabbed his long-awaited\nOscar for his leading role in\nAlejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s epic The\nRevenant. Whilst this is good\nnews, let\u2019s not get carried away in\nour celebrations. Why not have a\nlook at some of the other winners\nof the night. Hint: Sam Smith\ndoes not feature.\nEnnio Morricone \u2013 Best\nOriginal Score\nA lot of people on social media\nhave been raving about this win,\nand I just thought I\u2019d add to the\ncelebrations. For those of you\nwho don\u2019t know, Morricone is\nan Italian composer of over 500\nscores, most notably for his work\non Sergio Leone\u2019s Dollars Trilogy.\nI think we can all be glad that\nrecognition has finally come for\nhis score of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s\nphenomenal The Hateful Eight.\nInside Out \u2013 Best Animated\nFeature\nMark Kermode called this his\nfavourite film of the year, and for\nonce I am close to agreeing. This\nnew instant-classic from Pixar in\nmany ways revived a company\nsome people were scared was\nlosing its way. Following the\nrelease of their first critically\npanned film Cars 2, Pixar seemed\nto be going down a dangerous\nroad. Let\u2019s hope the inventive,\nemotive power, and downright\ncharm of Inside Out will usher in\na second Pixar-renaissance\nEx Machina \u2013 Best Visual\nEffects\nThe one technical category Mad\nMax: Fury Road couldn\u2019t win, the\nVFX nominations were stuffed\nwith big-budget blockbusters.\nBut I am really pleased to see that\nthe simple, unintrusive yet near-perfect realism of Ex Machina\nwon out \u2013 details over flashy stuff\nany day.\nBEN COLLIER\nA rough guide to the Coen brothers\nM\ny favourite film\nindustry anecdote is\nthat Bill Murray only\nsigned on to be the\nvoice of porcine feline Garfield in\nthe 2004 flop because he thought it\nwas written by Joel Coen, of Barton\nFink, Fargo, and The Big Lebowski\nfame. Unfortunately for him, it was\nwritten by another Joel Coen, the\nman behind Cheaper by the Dozen.\nNow, such a tale may just be a\nway for Murray to distance himself\nfrom the film (he did, after all, voice\nGarfield in the sequel), but it also\nhighlights the allure and gravitas\nof the Coen brothers. Since their\nfirst feature film, more than thirty\nyears ago, they have developed\ninto a brand; a byword for deadpan\nhumour, genre-busting sensibilities,\nand incredibly high-quality\nproductions.\nJoel and Ethan Coen were born\nthree years apart, in the mid-1950s,\ninto an academic family from\nMinnesota. While Joel went into\nfilm school at New York University,\nEthan earned a philosophy degree\nfrom Princeton; they reunited in\n1984 to write\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Zoe\nSaldana\nT\nelling the story of\nturbulent genius Nina\nSimone on film was\nnever going to be easy;\nSimone\u2019s life was complex, and\nher music beloved by so many that\nany casting choice would be liable\nto ignite tensions. However, the\ncontroversy upcoming biopic Nina\nhas stirred up would be enough to\nmake hardened producers question\ntheir career choices. The issue?\nCasting Zoe Saldana, of Avatar\nfame, as Simone, which has led\nsome commentators to argue that\nthe racism and colourism that\ndogged Simone for her whole life\nhave raised their ugly heads again.\nBut let\u2019s back up a little here: the\nfilm was first announced in 2010,\nwith legendary R&B musician\nMary J. Blige stepping into the title\nrole. Fast-forward to 2012, however,\nand Blige drops out \u2013 citing financial\nreasons \u2013 to be replaced by Saldana.\nThis move was immediately greeted\nwith anger at the fact that Saldana\u2019s\nskin tone was several shades lighter\nthan Simone\u2019s, and her features\nfar more European. The release of\nphotographs a few months later,\nwhich showed Saldana in dark make\n-up,only served to deepen the anger.\nSince then the controversy has been\nquietly bubbling away, but came to\nthe surface last week, when a new\ntrailer was released \u2013 in the trailer,\nSaldana\u2019s skin has been darkened,\nand a prosthetic nose attached, in\norder to achieve a more realistic\nportrayal of the singer. Simone\u2019s\nestate hit out at Saldana on Twitter,\ntelling her to \u2018take Nina\u2019s name out\nof your mouth. For the rest of your\nlife.\u2019\nSo, what\u2019s the issue here? Well,\nthose criticising the casting choice\nclaim that the appointment of\nSaldana just reflects and reinforces\nthe colourism present in mainstream\nHollywood, and \u2013 indeed \u2013 the\nwhole world. For those among us\nwho are less woke: colourism,coined\nby writer Alice Walker, refers to the\ndiscrimination of people based on\nthe shade of their skin; it is not the\nsame as racism, since it does not\nrely on the intersection of multiple\nfactors, such as cultural heritage and\nancestry. Instead, it is the system\nthat (typically) affords privileges to\nthose whose skin colour most closely\nresembles that of Caucasians.\nThe effects of the system can\nbe seen all over the world, from\nadverts for skin-lightening creams\nin India, to the \u2018brown paper bag\u2019\ntest practiced by certain AfricanAmerican fraternities, who would\nnot let in any individuals whose skin\nwas darker than a paper bag.\nIt can be argued that the choice\nof Saldana reflects the greater value\nsociety places on light skin. Emma\nDabiri, writing in The Telegraph,\nargues that \u2018dark skinned women\nare so disregarded that they don\u2019t\neven deserve to play themselves!\u2019\n\u2013 a sentiment that is echoed by\nSimone\u2019s daughter, who said that\n\u2018appearance-wise, this is not the\nbest choice\u2019. The problem with the\ncasting is exacerbated by the details\nof Simone\u2019s life: a child prodigy,\nshe was denied a scholarship to the\nCurtis Institute of Music based on\nher race; aspiring to be a concert\npianist, she instead had to play in\njazz bars, where she developed her\nsinging talents; throughout her\ncareer she faced down racism and\ncolourism, singing songs like \u2018To\nBe Young, Gifted, and Black\u2019, and\n\u2018Backlash Blues\u2019. Her daughter says\nthat \u2018my mother was raised at a time\nwhen she was told her nose was too\nwide, her skin was too dark\u2019 \u2013 her\nappearance was central to the events\nof her life, and many feel the choice\nof Saldana does an injustice to her\nmemory.\nJudd Apatow then waded into\nthe debate, writing \u2018I think all\nactors should only be allowed to\nplay themselves. It is offensive to\npretend to be other people\u2019 in a\ntweet dripping with sarcasm.Queen\nLatifah echoed this sentiment,\nsaying \u2018I don\u2019t see why [Saldana]\nshouldn\u2019t play the role\u2019. They reflect\nan oft-used counterargument to the\nclaims above: that acting always\ninvolves pretending to be other\npeople, and that the appearance\nof the actor shouldn\u2019t relate to the\nindividual they are playing: thus\nwe have straight actors playing gay\ncharacters, cis actors playing trans\ncharacters, and Emma Stone can\nplay a Chinese-Hawaiian woman.\nHowever, the details of Simone\u2019s\nlife make it difficult to allay the\nconcerns raised by Saldana\u2019s casting.\nWith her skin colours, and African\nfeatures defining others\u2019 attitudes to\nher music,shaping the current of her\nlife, the producers could have made\na better choice \u2013 an actor who better\nresembles Simone, such as Viola\nDavis, or Uzo Aduba, for example.\nLupita Nyong\u2019o has spoken about\nher insecurities with her skin tone,\nwhich were shattered when she\nsaw model Alek Wek: \u2018I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve that people were embracing\na woman who looked so much like\nme,as beautiful.\u2019Choosing to black-up a light skinned actor, giving her\na prosthetic nose, just reinforces the\nmessage Hollywood sends out to\ndark skinned individuals: that they\nare not allowed to tell the narrative,\nnot even their own.\nFRED FYLES\nThe choice of Zoe Saldana (left) to play musical genius Nina Simone (right), in a new biopic, has caused controversy. Photo Credit: David Becker/Getty/Wikimedia\nand direct Blood Simple, their first\nfeature film, a low budget neo-noir\nflick that garnered them critical\npraise, catapulting them onto\nthe world stage. It marked the\nfilm debut of Joel\u2019s wife, Frances\nMcDormand, as well as one of\nthe first roles for Holly Hunter, a\nformer roommate of McDormand;\nBlood Simple was the beginning\nof a lengthy career in the industry\nfor both the brothers, one that\nwould be marked by a frequently\nrotating cast of collaborators, many\nof whom went onto become big\nnames themselves. McDormand\nand Hunter have both since won\nAcademy Awards, and Blood Simple\nwas also the debut score of musician\nCarter Burwell,who was nominated\nthis year for his soundtrack to Carol.\nThe brothers followed this up\nwith Raising Arizona (1987), a\nblack comedy starring Hunter\nand Nicholas Cage, and Miller\u2019s\nCrossing (1990), a gangster drama\nset during prohibition. However,\nit was their fourth film, Barton\nFink (1991), that really saw their\ncareers take off. Telling the tale of\na young Hollywood screenwriter\nin the 1940s, Barton Fink takes a\nsharp look at the \u2018golden age\u2019 of\nthe film industry; combining\naspects of horror,\nnoir, and comedy, Barton Fink\nis completely unclassifiable, and\ncemented the directors\u2019 reputations\nas genre-busters. A commercial\nfailure, Barton Fink swept the board\nat Cannes, netting the Palme d\u2019Or,\nBest Director, and Best Actor\nprizes; the festival since adopted a\nrule limiting the number of possible\nawards to two per film. It was also\nnominated for three Academy\nAwards.\nTheir next film, The Hudsucker\nProxy (1994), received mixed\nreviews, but they bounced back\nwith their 1997 masterpiece Fargo.\nA comedy laced with bitterly dark\nelements, Fargo tells the story of\nMarge Gunderson (McDormand),\na heavily pregnant police chief from\nNorth Dakota who investigates a\nnumber of homicides. Fargo marked\nthe first Academy Award wins for\nthe brothers, who took home a Best\nScreenplay, and the Best Actress\naward for McDormand. It also\nmarked the second Cannes win\nfor Best Director. Since then, the\nfilm, and particularly it\u2019s use of the\n\u2018Minnesota nice\u2019 stereotype, have\ngone down in cult cinema history.\nThe brothers followed it up next\nyear with The Big Lebowski\n(1998), which many consider\nto be their greatest film; a\nsurreal stoner comedy, The Big\nLebowski features Jeff Bridges\non top form as Jeff \u2018the Dude\u2019\nLebowski, who gets embroiled in\na crime caper against his will.While\nit received good reviews when\nreleased, The Big Lebowski touched\na nerve with many people, who\nconsider it to be their favourite Coen\nbrothers\u2019film; it has since spawned a\nfestival in its honour,had two spider\nspecies named after it,and led to the\nfoundation of a religion \u2013 Dudeism\n\u2013 that has a quarter of a million\nordained priests.\nThe brothers then took on a\nnumber of projects, including O\nBrother, Where Art Thou? (2000),\nThe Man who Wasn\u2019t There (2001),\nIntolerable Cruelty (2003), and The\nLadykillers (2004). However, it was\n2007, after a three year break from\nthe screen, that saw the brothers\non top form again, with the release\nof No Country for Old Men. A\nstraight up neo-Western, this tense\nthriller had audiences at the edge\nof their seats, following the story of\nLlewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who\nends up on the wrong side of cattle-gun wielding killer Anton Chigurh,\nplayed to icy perfection by Javier\nBardem. A critical and commercial\nsuccess, the film picked up four\nAcademy Awards: Best\nPicture, Best\nDirector, Best\nA d a p t e d\nScreenplay,\nand Best\nSupporting\nActor \u2013 which made Bardem\nthe first Spanish actor to win the\naccolade.\nSince this success, the brothers\nhave taken a shot at CIA spy\nfilms (Burn After Reading \u2013\n2008), suburban black comedy\n(A Serious Man \u2013 2009, featuring\nthe astonishing and criminally\nunderrated Michael Stuhlbarg),\nclassic Western (True Grit \u2013 2010),\nand folk-revival drama (Inside\nLlewyn Davis \u2013 2013).\nWhile other major international\ndirectors, such as Michael Haneke,\nmay take one mood, and repeatedly\nmodulate it through their careers,\nthe Coen brothers show the\nimportance of never standing still.\nBouncing around from genre to\ngenre, they have never settled on a\nsingle one, and yet have made their\nindelible mark on modern cinema;\ncombining an ADHD-esque\ninterest in all things cinematic\nwith a dead seriousness about their\nwork, the world of film is better off\nthanks to this masterful duo. We\ncan definitely sympathise with Bill\nMurray.\n\n"

However, changes\nto the bye-laws or constitution of\nthe union need a so-called \u2018supermajority\u2019 of 66%, so it did not pass.\nHad it passed, the bye-law-changing paper would have had\nto be okayed by the union\u2019s trustee\nboard (where voting is by \u2018consensus\u2019\nrather than actual voting and\nincludes union management as\nwell as officer trustees). It would\nthen have to be sanctioned by\nthe Imperial College Council to\nbecome \u2018union law\u2019.\nAlthough the paper did not\npass, the majority of those present\ndid agree with the sentiment, so a\nworking group will be set up to work\ntowards improving the situation.\nCouncil is the first port of call for\nanyone who thinks the union should\ntake a stand on a particular subject,\nwhether that be pro-Junior Doctors\nor anti-Prevent.

The halls are not in good\nshape.\nHall seniors were initially poached\nby the accommodation department\nfrom their preferred halls without\ntheir consent to join the wardening\nteam in Fisher, before being\nreturned after protest.\nThis will be the first time halls\nsolely for the returning non-fresher\nundergraduates will be available.\nThe Imperial accommodation\nwebsite says the new halls will offer\na \u201csense of familiarity but with more\nindependence than the first year\nexperience\u201d.\nApplications for the new halls are\nexpected to open later this month.\nB\ny the time you\u2019re reading\nthis, unless you\u2019re uber\nkeen on Friday morning,\nit\u2019s likely that the\nImperial College Union Leadership\nElections booths have closed for\nanother year.\nAt noon today, two weeks of\ncampaigning, lecture shout-outs\nand most importantly, free food,\nwill come to a close, with the final\nresults for the main positions being\nannounced in a swanky event at\nMetric (possibly an oxymoron) later\nthis evening.\nOver the course of the last 7\ndays, as FELIX went to press, over\n113,000 votes had been cast by over\n6500 voters on positions within\nclubs and societies,departments and\nmost importantly on the Sabbatical\npositions within the Union (except\nDPFS, which had no nominees this\nyear).\nThis equates to a 37% turnout, a\nnumber lower than most UK general\nelections (2001 was the lowest at\n59.4%) but this meant that Imperial\nhas the fourth highest participation\nof university elections.\nNotable voting stats included the\n18 and under age group taking the\nhighest turnout so far (66%), with\nevery subsequent age group having\na smaller percentage of voters than\nthe one younger than it.

A\nZoology graduate with the kind\nof accent romcom producers\nditch their fianc\u00e9es and invest in\nfisherman jumpers to be with. He\u2019s\nalso HIV Positive. That shouldn\u2019t\nmatter. Except it does.\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed I didn\u2019t\nknow anyone with HIV in Ireland. I\ndidn\u2019t even know Ireland had HIV\u201d.\nBrian knows only too well the\nconsequences of living with HIV.\nAfter his parents died he went to\nlive in an orphanage from the age of\nsix. Not long after his skin started\npeeling, he started getting too sick\nto go to school but when the doctors\ntold him he was HIV positive he\njumped around the room with joy.\n\u201cI heard \u2018positive\u2019. I thought that\nhas to be good!\u201d\nBrian didn\u2019t take his medication\nfor a year but one day he walked into\nschool to find all his classmates eyes\non him. Lined above the blackboard\nwas his whole supply of unopened\nmedication, when asked why he\nhad them Brian openly revealed\nhis status. The school asked him to\nleave.\nNow, Brian is 22 and lives in\nUganda and, despite everything,\ncampaigns actively for an end to\nHIV. These two brave speakers,\nstanding in front of me right now,\nlaying all the most intimate details\nof their personal lives bare to a room\nfull of strangers, are only too aware\nthat if their lives were reversed\nRobbie would be dead.\nThe reason for this is the\nmedication. In Uganda, there are\nonly two lines of HIV medication,\natripla and prezista, for those that\ncan afford it. Atripla is known for\ncausing such crippling side effects\nincluding mental delusions that it\nis recommended only to be taken\nat night. For Robbie it was the high\nof LSD followed by being hit by a\ntruck the next morning and it was\ndeadening.\n\u201cIt was a family meal two weeks\nafter starting atripla and I was so\nexhausted I couldn\u2019t even physically\nlift my arm. I told my mum that if\nSpeaking against Stigma\nit was this versus living two years\nmore I\u2019d take the two years. She\nrushed me to the clinic.\u201d\nLuckily in Ireland Robbie had the\noption of Prezista and for a while\neverything seemed great. That is,\nuntil his kidneys started to fail.\n\u201cThey told me on Prezista I\u2019d have\nsix months to two years\u201d\nBut there was a new drug just out\nthat sounded perfect, one pill a day.\nThe only trouble was for less than\n10% of the population it was fatal.\n\u201cOf course I fell into that percent\nbecause it\u2019s me\u201d .\nRobbie is now on his fourth line\nof medication. Brian takes atripla.\nThe reason these two and others\nhave travelled the breadth of the\ncountry speaking out about HIV\nis the hope to change all of this.\nThey are part of YouthSTOP\nAIDS and this tour hopes to break\ndown the stigma surrounding\nHIV and highlight the charity\u2019s\n#MissingMedicines Campaign.\nJosie, 24, one of the speakers, not\nthere that evening,has drug resistant\nTB. In the last 50 years there have\nonly been two new drugs to treat\nTuberculosis but 15 developed to\ntarget Hay Fever. 1.5 million die of\nTB each year but when the majority\naffected are in poor or middle\nincome countries the incentive to\ndevelop new drugs is just not there.\nIn response to this,MSF launched\nits Access Campaign in 1999 after\nfinding the medicines they needed\nin humanitarian crises overpriced\nor out dated. Their target for now\nis the pneumonia vaccine. The kind\nof disease we tend to associate with\nthe infirm or very old, pneumonia\nis the leading cause of infectious\nchildhood death worldwide and at\nthe moment only two companies\nproduce the vaccine.\nToday it costs 68x more to\nImperial atThe Notting Hill Dinner Club\nT\nwo weeks ago, the Union\nput on a whole load of\nstudent volunteering\nopportunities as part of\nthe national campaign of Student\nVolunteering\nThe Student Development team\nfrom Imperial College Union\nworked closely with the Notting\nHill Community Church to get\nstudents involved in the evening as\npart of Student Volunteering Week.\nSVW is a nationwide campaign\ndesigned to get more students\ninvolved in volunteering in the\nUK. It also involves celebrating\nthe impact of student volunteers\nin their communities, which the\nUnion took part in via the Great\nVolunteer Thank You scheme. I got\na postcard, it was great.\nThe Notting Hill Dinner Club\ninvolves opening Notting Hill\nCommunity Church up for anyone\nwho may be in need of food,\nfriendship or just a helping hand\nin life. Much more than simply a\nfree three course meal, the Diner\nClub exists to offer hope, light and\nlove to the people of Notting Hill\nand London. The church is always\nhappy to have food donations for\nthe evening.\nAs part of SVW, 34 Imperial\nstudents headed over, with both\n\u2018Take Note\u2019 A Cappella Group and\nImperial College Gospel Choir\nmaking an appearance to sing for\nthe attendees., creating a friedly\nrelaxed atmosphere. The Imperial\nstudents helped out and chatted\nwith the guests. Everyone was able\nto talk about a huge variety of topics\nbecause of the range of students and\npeople there.\n\u201cImperial College students made\na huge difference attending the\nDinner Club; their welcoming and\nengaging attitude with the guests\nwas fantastic and really helped\nbreak down social barriers.We hope\nto continue working closely with\nthe Dinner Club in the future.\u201d said\nLucinda Sandon-Allum, Imperial\nCollege Union President.\nOverall it was a really lovely\nopportunity to get more involved\nin the local community. Student\nVolunteering Week seems to\nhave gone as well as ever this year,\nexcellent news for a campaign in its\nfifteenth year.\nABIGAIL DE BRUIN\nvaccinate a child in developing\ncountries than it did in 2001 and\nalmost half of that cost is due to\nthe high price of the pneumonia\nvaccine. In 2015, 60 countries spoke\nout against the high prices at the\nWorld Health Assembly but the\ncurrent lowest global price is still\n$10 per vaccine.\nMSF are calling for that to be\nhalved and with the Indian Serum\nInstitute bringing out the vaccine\nfor $6 next year we know this is\ndoable. A key aim of the Access and\n#MissingMedicines campaign is\ntransparent pricing. Currently drug\ncompanies have no obligation to\nreveal what is charged for vaccines\nin each country which leads to\nsituations where Morocco is charged\nmore than France or MSF is offered\nthe pneumonia vaccine for $26 and\n$46 during South Sudan\u2019s global\nhealth crisis in 2013 despite it being\nknown that the lowest global price\nis $10.\nRobbie and Brian know they are\nonly two voices in a complex world\nbut already things are starting\nto change. Robbie has found the\n7000 other people living with HIV\nin Ireland and they now have a\nsupport network and campaign for\ngovernment accountability with\nregards to HIV. \u201cWhen the doctor\nsaid to me, \u2018Do you think you can\nturn HIV into an opportunity?\u2019 I\nturned to him and said \u2018What?!\nYou\u2019re crazy!\u2019\u201d\nBut Brian has done just that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve toured the whole of the UK\nand in every room there are the\nyoung people of the UK who are\nbright and have so much energy.\nThey have the power to change\nthings\u201d.

ICMUN seized\nthe opportunity to send its own\nmembers to participate in this\nconference: London International\nModel United Nations conference\n(LIMUN).\nIf you find yourself confused;\nModel United Nations is a forum\nwithin which delegates represent\na country in a United Nations\ncommittee and work with other\ndelegates to address an international\nissue.

Yetis\nfought back skew-tooth and yellow-nail in 2014, but in the end couldn\u2019t\nhold on as the game went 4-4\nthrough overtime to a three-round\nshootout; culminating in a shot top-shelf into the Yeti net, and a lunging\npoke check from Devils\u2019 netminder\nfor a 5-4 win. The undefeated reign\ncame to an end last year, though, in\nanother close game that swung to\nthe Yetis\u2019 favour in the third period.\nJoin us on the evening of Friday\n18th\nMarch for the fourth London\nIce Varsity \u2013 and support the\nImperial Devils in recovering the\ntitle from UCL!\nTickets are available on the\nUnion website: http://j.mp/\nLondonIceVarsity.\nWhat\u2019smore,we\u2019vealsonegotiated\nan awesome deal for all Imperial\nstudents at Queens Ice & Bowl (just\nNorth of Hyde Park, by Queensway\nstation) \u2013 any weekday you can bag\nover 40% off skating, at just \u00a36! If\nyou prefer, you can bowl for \u00a36 too,\nor on a Tuesday grab a pint, or a\nglass of wine for just \u00a32.50! All you\nneed to do is take along you College\nID card. See you there!\nO\nn Saturday 27th\nFebruary Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Synchronised\nSwimming Team swam\nin the Middlesex Synchronised\nSwimming championships,winning\nthe silver medal in the \u201cMasters\n20+\u201d age category.\nThe team arrived to a slightly\nchaotic atmosphere with the entire\nleisure centre having just been\nevacuated due to a fire alarm. The\nsight of swimmers huddled outside\ninsilverfoilblanketsdidlittletocalm\nthe nerves but we were determined\nto enjoy ourselves regardless.\nDespite no hot water or heating,\nwe had a fantastic time, proudly\ndisplaying our Batman routine to\ncoach Ambre\u2019s appreciative cheers\nfrom the stands. Given that half of\nthe team only started the sport in\nOctober of last year,it was a brilliant\nresult with all swimmers happy with\ntheir performances.\nImperial were the only UK\nuniversity competing at this\ncompetition and are actually one\nof only two university synchronised\nswimming teams in the whole\nof the UK (the other being\nAberdeen). This means we often\nhave to travel abroad to compete.\nWe have 3 European competitions\ncoming up - the Open Masters\nChampionships in Brussels on\n20th\nMarch, the French University\nChampionships in Bordeaux on 31st\nMarch and the Paris International\nTournament on 14th\nMay. The rarity\nof the sport in the UK also means\nthat we have a very international\nteam \u2013 we currently have swimmers\nfrom France, Portugal, Italy, Spain,\nGreece and Taiwan.\nSynchronised swimming is\nan incredible sport \u2013 endurance,\ndynamism, grace, and an ability to\nCaped crusaders swim to victory\nA Batman theme won the syncronised swimmers a silver medal\nhold your breath underwater are\njust some of the qualities needed.\nSwimmers are unable to use the\nbottom of the pool, so sculling\nand treading water techniques\nare essential to avoid sinking. You\nonly need to watch \u2018synchronised\nswimming lifts\u2019 on YouTube to\nunderstand the complexity involved\nwith lifting a swimmer clean into\nthe air using just leg power against\nwater. It\u2019s definitely a calorie-burner!\nImperial is a wonderfully friendly,\nsociable and welcoming club.

FELIX decided\nto put two of the more similarly\npriced places head to head; the more\nrustic and traditional Rocca,and the\nmodern, do-it-yourself, Loves Fresh\nPasta.\nFirst, we headed to Loves Fresh\nPasta who claim to serve an \u2018artisan\ncountry food at a pace that the city\nlife demands\u2019. Sounds perfect for\nbudget conscious students, right?\nLoves Fresh Pasta is owned by\nmulti-millionaire David Gold, also\nbehind the hair extension business\nGreat Lengths, and his daughter\nJessica Gold. They opened up their\nfirst restaurant in 2013.While it did\nlook like they were going to become\na chain as they once had two\nrestaurants in London, the South\nKensington restaurant is currently\nthe only one.\nLet\u2019s face it, no one ever chose the kid\u2019s size and was happy with it. Photo Credit: Georgina Morrison & Ashni Malhotra\nThe restaurant, located directly\nopposite South Kensington station,\ngives you a glimpse of the future\nwith the idea to make servers\nvirtually obsolete. On each table\nthere is a tablet where you place\nyour order. Alternatively, you can\norder with a waiter in which case a\nservice charge applies. The ordering\nsystem is very much a \u201cpersonal\nexperience\u201d \u2013 you get to pick your\npasta and sauce separately from an\nextensive but slightly overwhelming\nlist of options.\nWe chose the abbracci sauce\n(tomato based with cured pork)\nand a simple basil pesto. We also\nthough we might give their pizzas\na try. The pizza menu was slightly\nless inspiring, and we opted for half\nHawaiian and half pepperoni.\nWhile you are waiting, you are\ngiven tomato and basil bruschetta\n\u2013 this was fresh and warm, perfect\nto snack on while you wait for your\nmain course to arrive.\nThere are three size options for\npasta and we opted for the smallest,\nwhich was kids\u2019 size \u2013 a good\nlunch option but not priced much\nlower than the regular. The pasta\nwas cooked well in both cases. The\nvibrant and fresh tomato sauce\ncoated the pasta perfectly and\nmade for a very enjoyable dish. The\npesto sauce on the other hand was\ndisappointing: too much of it and\nswimming in oil.\nThere\u2019s not much you can say\nabout bad pizza, and there is even\nless you can say about this pizza. It\nwas in short,unremarkable \u2013 copious\namounts of bland stringy cheese,\nwatery ham and oily pepperoni sat\non top of a too thin, crust-less base.\nIf you do go to Loves Fresh Pasta,\ndon\u2019t get the pizza.The servers, who\nwe saw much more than usual due\nto the tablets not working, were\nattentive but a little subdued. In a\nfew words, they were unexceptional.\nNext we headed to Rocca, which\non the outside seems like your\nbog standard Italian eatery. We\nwalked in expecting a typical,\nnothing to-write-home-about meal,\nsomething we could find on any\nhigh street. In some cases it was,\nbut from the get go we realised\nthe homey, traditional restaurant\nhad something quite distinct. The\nhardwood floors and low lighting\ngave a cosy and comfortable feel.\nThe seating was cramped, which we\nquickly discovered was due to the\npopularity of the restaurant.Despite\nthis, we managed to procure a table\nwithout reservation. For large\nparties at peak hours we definitely\nrecommend booking in advance, to\navoid disappointment.\nRoccaisasmallchain,withanother\nrestaurant in Dulwich Village. The\nrestaurant in South Kensington\nhad a great buzzy atmosphere. The\nwaiters were friendly, attentive and\nquick with suggestions.\nRocca is a fully rounded restaurant,\nserving the expected pasta and pizza\nas well as having meat and fish\noptions, though they were slightly\nmore expensive.\nWe chose their basil pesto pasta,\nmainly to make a direct comparison\nbetween the restaurants. We were\nglad we did. A rich, flavourful sauce,\nstrong with basil, complemented by\ncrunchy pine nuts, coated perfect,\nal dente pasta which left a smile on\nour faces.\nWe ordered the regina pizza which\nwas topped with mushrooms, olives\nand ham. After tasting the pasta,\nwe certainly had high expectations\nand were not disappointed. A thin,\ncrispy base with a delicious fluffy\ncrust, was garnished abundantly\nwith the highest-quality toppings,\nall in perfect balance.\nThere is a comprehensive\nselection of typical Italian desserts\nat reasonable prices. On a prior visit\none of the writers had tiramisu. It\nwas a decently large portion,creamy,\nbut was otherwise unremarkable. In\nSouth Kensington there are many\ngreat dessert places with similar\nprices, so if you\u2019re looking for\nsomething a bit more interesting it\nmight be best to skip dessert here.\nBoth restaurants had their pros\nand cons, the namesake in Loves\nFresh Pasta was mainly good and\nkudos to them for their futuristic\ntheme \u2013 however, we left feeling\nquite disappointed, especially with\nthe pizza. However, with the 20%\nstudent discount and the very tasty\nabbracci pasta we would definitely\nsuggest you give it a try. Rocca\non the other hand, is perfect for\na comfortable sit down meal. It\nhas fantastic food, albeit mediocre\ndessert. While they do not offer a\nstudent discount, their prices are\nvery competitive for the area. We\ncertainly recommend you go there\nfor a nice catch up with some mates\nor a place to go when the family\ncomes to visit.\nPersonally, I can\u2019t tell if this has been eaten once before or not.

It\u2019s easy to see why,\u2018Self-Portrait\u2019\n(pictured left) brilliantly shows what a virtuoso and throughly modern painter she was.The composition is a break from\nthe rigidity and formality of portraiture of the past, the scene could almost be a photograph of her caught just as she\nturns to greet the viewer. Her brushwork is loose and fluid, with an innate mastery of light, which exemplifies so much\nof what revolutionised Dutch and indeed European painting during the period. Unfortunately, Leyster had a\nshort career and despite garnering fame and respect during her life, her work was largely forgotten after\nher death, and attributed wrongly to her much more famous male contemporary Frans Hals whose\nstyle was similar to her own. She was to remain in obscurity until she was \u2018rediscovered\u2019more than\ntwo hundred years after her death. IM\nAmrita Sher-Gil is one of the most prominent Indian artists of the 20th\ncentury,born to a Sikh father and a Hungarian mother,\nin 1913 she spent most of her childhood in Budapest and went on to study at the famous \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.There,\nshe was influenced by Gauguin and Cezanne, however it was her family\u2019s return to India which set her career on the path of\ngreatness. She portrayed the people and the culture of India is all it\u2019s colour and vibrancy in the Impressionist style\nwhich she married with the traditional Mughal and Pahari movements in an astonishing body of work.\nShe is the youngest ever and the only Asian to be elected an Associate of the Grand Salon in Paris. IM\nMargaret Atwood\nI can\u2019t say I am a big fan of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which was the first Atwood I had ever read. I found it contrived and\nbelonged to the category of books that were written expressly to bring a point across. I preferred stories that were more\norganic, that were works of art on their own but incidentally also made poignant points. Which is exactly what\nAtwood\u2019s poetry does. She is one of my favourite modern poets \u2013 her poems take everyday images from\nboth mythology and daily life, and use them to bring complex emotions and ideas across. Variations\non the Word Sleep is possibly my favourite as much for the gentle longing as the clever wordplay. \u201cI\nwould like to be the air/that inhabits you for a moment/only. I would like to be that unnoticed/&\nthat necessary.\u201d JC\nHannah H\u00f6ch\nHannah H\u00f6ch was a German Dadaist credited with being \u2018art\u2019s original punk\u2019. She created the photomontage, creating\nsurreal yet cutting indictments of the injustice she saw around her. Her artwork focused social justice issues which are still\nrelevant today; political revolution, women\u2019s rights, same sex relationships and racial discrimination. H\u00f6ch\u2019s\nlong term relationship with a woman and her confrontational work which pulled no punches earned her\nno favours with her contemporaries who tried to muscle her out of the Berlin Dada community, but\nher bold feminism in a time where Europe was being engulfed by facism is inspiring to this day.\nJeanette Winterson\nIf I hadn\u2019t read Oranges are Not the Only Fruit, I think I would have a far narrower view of what novels can be. Winterson\nhas a gift for peppering her works with comments that are not just witty but, if you pause to think about it, very profound\nas well. She is unafraid to tackle prickly, complex issues in a humourous but assertive way \u2013 what is it like growing up\na lesbian girl in an overwhelmingly conservative community? With an impeccable grasp of magical realism techniques,\nWinterson has my vote as one of the most significant and entertaining modern writers.There isn\u2019t a situation that can\u2019t be\ndescribed aptly with a Winterson quote. If you haven\u2019t read her you really need to start now. JC\nFrida Kahlo\nFrida Kahlo\u2019s enduring appeal lies in the astonishing honesty in her work. She started painting after a near fatal bus accident\nin her youth left one leg crushed, and with chronic life long pain. Pain and suffering pervade her work, as does beauty\ndespite this, she is perhaps the first and only painter since Vincent Van Gogh to be able to marry the conflicting emotion\nquite so vividly. Her use of colour and surrealist imagery (though she never considered herself a surrealist), coupled with her\nunfliniching portrayal of herself in her self portraits,one of which depicts her body split down the middle revealing a shattered\ncolumn as a spine speak to her willingness to portray herself with vulnerability, and despite this strength, and to some degree,\nhumour. Women have always been portrayed in art, but by turning the so readily on herself she cast aside the idea\nof women seen through the male gaze, instead celebrated feminity is all its tragedy and complexity as well\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t as joy and beauty. IM\nTracey Emin\nEmin is perhaps most well known for her installation \u2018My Bed\u2019, which brought both critical acclaim and controversy\nfor its depiction of her state of mind as she lived through suicidal depression. Despite the notoriety of that\ninstallation, her strongest work is that with neon, especially the I Promise I Love You collection. In it, neon lights in\na simulacra of her handwriting light up confessional, lyrical phrases, dealing with loss, heartbreak, lust and\nfrustation. \u2018I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW\u2019 declares one, the second I know is scratched out. This mix\nof initimacy with the medium more commonly seen outside kebab shops or sleazy clubs is an\nexcellent reflection of the social media age, in which people use blogs as very public diaries. IM\nFaith Ringgold\nRinggold uses every medium available to tell her stories; sculpture, painting, sewing quilts and staging performance art. Her\nart in all it\u2019s varied, and inventive glory has charted over decades the experience of black women in 20th\ncentury America.\nIt is not all autobiographical, however. Invented characters or public figures populate her narrative quilts, telling stories\nwhich deal with slavery, cultural ideals of beauty, and life in her native Harlem.The figures, drawn in deceptively simple line\nwork are suffused with warmth and character and empathy.This, coupled with the sometimes surreal scenes have translated\nwonderfully into over 17 children\u2019s books. Ringgold\u2019s tells stories, too, with her performance art in which she\nuses masks which are both \u2018spiritual and sculptural\u2019 in a traditional inspired by African tribal culture. As\nwell as being a prolific artist Ringgold is also an activist and was a passionate supporter of the Civil\nRights movement. Her art continues to play an important role in the telling of North America\u2019s\ncultural story. IM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nYishay Garbasz\nYishay Garbasz is a photographer and film artist who captures devastatingly matter of fact images of conflict zones and\nother areas of disaster., her work also deals with gender, identity and human rights. Much of her work is processing the\nemotional burden left by her mother\u2019s experience of fleeing Nazi Germany, In In My Mother\u2019s Footsteps Garbasz retraced\nher mother\u2019s journey across Europe in a solitary project. She says of the work \u2018\u201cMy mother lost parts of her soul in those\nplaces and I had to go back to collect them... As I am a photographer, the camera was going to be my tool\nto help me see\u201d. In another landmark work she created a series of photographs taken weekly during her\nsex reassignment surgery, presented in a flipbook. Garbasz\u2019s work is personal, moving, and sometimes\nbrutally informed but never wholly defined by her identity.

In an ultimate\ntriumph of substance over form they use photomontages and clear typeface on solid colourful backgrounds to call out\nthe lack of representation of female artists in New York galleries, the misogny of music videos, and the racial and gender\ninqualities in the Oscars, referring to their vast canvases as \u2018actions\u2019. Indeed, their persistent activism has led galleries to\nrethink the artists they display. The gorilla masks came about from a desire to protect the members from reprisals when\nthey first started out in 1985 but their look has reached somewhat of a cult status; even when two were outed by New\nYorker writer Peter Toobin, the unmasking did not gain much traction because as one member says \u201c[people] don\u2019t want\nto know who we are...They\u2019d like us to just keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d IM\nPhoto Credit: Richard Young/Rex Shutterstock\nPhoto Credit: courtesy of faithringgold.blogpost.co.uk\nPhoto Credit: Yishay Garbasz\nPhoto Credit: George Lange\n\n"

In an\nage of social media\nsaturation and online\nengagement, we long for the\nhalcyon days of the glamourous\nstar, as perfect and distant as a\nfar-flung constellation. No matter\nhow much dirt is unearthed on the\nhorror of the old studio system \u2013\nwhich includes forced marriages,\narranged murders, and dodgy mob\nconnections \u2013 there\u2019s still an aching\nfor a time long past; a willingness\nto swap enlightened debates about\ngender and race for just one more\nRita Hayworth flick. Hail, Caesar!,\nthe latest from the Coen brothers,\ntakes aim at our love for nostalgia,\nthrowing us into the wheelings and\ndealings of the chaotic world of\nHollywood, communist tap dancers\nand all.\nOur guide in this world is Eddie\nMannix (Josh Brolin), the head\nof production at Capitol Pictures,\nwho works as a \u2018fixer\u2019, ensuring that\nthe gossip columns are kept free\nof damaging details of stars\u2019 sexual\ntrysts, or unlicensed pictures. Set\nin 1951, the film takes place at a\npoint when the studio system was\nbeginning to decline, following the\n1948 anti-trust rulings, but you\nwouldn\u2019t know it based on how\nthings are going. The studio is just\nabout to finish production on their\nprestige picture 'Hail, Caesar!' (the\nfirstinaseriesofsub-filmscontained\nin this meta-movie), which features\none of the biggest stars of the age,\nBaird Whitlock (George Clooney,\nchallenging Kirk Douglas): it's\nstirring speeches, lounging around\nin togas, and perma-tan.\nUnfortunately for Mannix,\nWhitlock is drugged and kidnapped\nby a shadowy cabal of communist\nscreenwriters, direct from the\nnightmares of Joseph McCarthy.\nWith the studio bleeding cash, and\nthe picture unfinished, Mannix\nneeds to get Whitlock back as\nsoon as possible, while ensuring\nthe story stays out of the papers,\nrun by Thora and Thessaly Thacker\n(Tilda Swinton), a pair of warring\ncolumnist sisters. Along the way,\nhowever, Mannix faces a number\nof other problems, each of which\nallows the audience a small glimpse\nof the films being worked on.\nGeorge Clooney as Baird Whitlock, in the Coen brothers' latest comedy outing, Hail, Caesar!. Photo Credit: Universal Pictures/EPA\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nHail, Caesar!\nshould be\na comedic\nballoon, but\nsomeone\nhas let the\nair out\nNot all roads lead to Rome\nThe latest from the Coen brothers is solid filmmaking, but lacks a sense of energy\nThere\u2019s DeeAnne Moran (Scarlett\nJohannson), a swimming starlet\nwhose orchestra-led synchronised\nroutine is being derailed by her\nburgeoning pregnancy making it\ndifficult to fit into her fish-tail;\nHobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich),\na cowboy actor whose image needs\nchanging, landing him in the lap\nof acclaimed director Lawrence\nLaurentz (Ralph Fiennes) currently\nmaking a classic period drama;\nand Burt Gurney (Channing\nTatum) who is hiding a political\nsecret, which is only revealed to\nus after we sit through a sailor-led dance routine \u2013 reminding\nus that Hollywood managed to\nsimultaneously discriminate against\ngay people,and unironically enthuse\nabout singing sea-men.\nThe film may have been reported\nas a \u2018love letter to Hollywood\u2019, but\nreally the opposite is the truth: the\nfilms on display are all dire; they\nseem like campy schlock, and serve\nto remind us that for every Streetcar\nNamed Desire there were countless\nother works deservedly consigned\nto the trashcan of history. At these\nmoments, the film is at its acerbic\nbest, the script imbued with a\ncutting, razor-sharp wit.\nAnd yet,there was a nagging sense\nthroughout that, as hard as I wanted\nto love the film, things just weren't\nworking. There\u2019s a lack of energy,\nand while individual scenes are\nfantastic, they are stitched together\nall higgledy-piggledy, revealing a\nlack of craftsmanship on the part\nof the Coens. Hail, Ceasar! should\nbe a light comedic balloon, one that\nzips along like the best of screwball\ncomedies, but it feels like someone\nhas let all the air out, and the film\nplods instead.\nPart of this is down to the plot:\nnormally a high-point of the\nbrothers\u2019 films, in Hail, Ceasar!\nthe different strands never come\ntogether, instead spinning out in all\ndirections. Whitlock\u2019s kidnapping,\nthe central plot,stands alone,and the\nother characters never really seem to\nhave anything to do with it \u2013 scenes\nhang there, only linked through\nMichael Gambon\u2019s unnecessary\nnarration. Furthermore, while the\ncasting and acting is all excellent,\nthere is a serious underuse of certain\nactors: Johannson, for instance, who\nspits out her lines with aplomb after\nchewing them through a New Jersey\naccent, is only really present for a\ncouple of scenes, and we only get\nexposed to the magnificent Frances\nMcDormand \u2013 who brings a spirit\nof physical comedy to the screen \u2013\nin a single scene. It\u2019s a real shame.\nHowever, it is worth pointing\nout one great thing about the film,\nand that is the casting of Alden\nEhrenreich, who up to this point\nhas only had a handful of roles.\nThe Coen brothers have a habit\nof picking excellent actors out of\nthe pile of unknowns \u2013 think their\nchoice of Michael Stuhlbarg in\nA Serious Man \u2013 and Ehrenreich\nis no exception. A doe-eyed ball\nof cinematic energy, Ehrenreich\nsteals all scenes he\u2019s in, whether it\u2019s\ncrooning at the moon in a pastiche\nWestern, or performing lasso tricks\nwith a piece of spaghetti to impress\na Carmen Miranda-type, it is\nimpossible to take your eyes off him.\nWith an exceptional cast, a\npunchy script, and a setting ripe for\npoking fun at, it seems that Hail,\nCaesar! had all the pins lined up\nfor a barnstormer of a film, it just\nneeded to knock them down. But\nsomething has gone wrong along\nthe way, and \u2013 while amusing \u2013\nthe way the film drags means that\nHail, Caesar! is destined to be one\nof the brothers\u2019 lesser works, one\nthey needed to put more effort into:\nRome, as it turns out, wasn\u2019t built in\na day.\nHail, Caesar!\nDir: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen. Script:\nJoel Coen, Ethan Coen. Starring:\nJosh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden\nEhrenreich, Ralph Fiennes. 106\nminutes.\nDocumentary corner: 20 Feet From Stardom\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nD\narlene Love, Merry\nClayton, Lisa Fischer\u2026\nyou probably don\u2019t\nknow these names but\nI guarantee you know the voices.\n20 Feet from Stardom is a talking-heads documentary that tells of the\nrelatively unknown world of such\nbackup vocalists. Prior to making\nthis film, its director, Morgan\nNeville, spent much of his career\ndocumenting various musician\u2019s\ncareers, from Jack Clement to\nJohnny Cash to Iggy Pop; with this\nfeature however,he gives us his most\nambitious project, as well as his first\nOscar winner. Going into this film I\nhad a lot of expectations about what\nI was going to see; I anticipated a\ndepressing tale of talent-gone-unnoticed, and failure to achieve\none\u2019s dreams.This isn\u2019t what I got.\nIn actuality the message of this\nfilm is rather uplifting: Darlene\nLove, for example, despite many\nhardships, is shown being inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of\nFame, touring with Sting and The\nRolling Stones, and performing\non David Letterman come the\nend. In fact, my favourite anecdote\nfrom the entire feature is when\nLove talks about how she cleaned\nhouses during a lull in her career\nbefore she heard \u2018Christmas (Baby\nPlease Come Home)\u2019 play on the\nradio, a hit song for which she had\nprovided ghost vocals,an experience\nthat spurred her to return to music\nand find success. By the end of the\nfilm we are treated to a plethora\nof uplifting philosophies held by\nthese women, who love singing and\nsimply want to share their passion.\nMany are happy to stay out of\nthe limelight and share their gift\nwithout the hardships of fame \u2013 as\nLisa Fisher says, had she made it\nbig she probably would have OD\u2019d\nwithin a year.\nA specific focus is given to the\nfact that many backup vocalists\nwere \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 black\nwomen with a background in gospel\nsinging, and many of issues around\ndiscrimination and institutionalised\nracism are explored. Whilst this\nis a very interesting topic, it is one\nthat could well warrant its very own\ndocumentary, and these parts of the\nfilm represent its overall weaknesses,\nwhere the director seems to have\nspread himself too thin. I would\nhave much preferred a more focused\nlook at fewer of these women, or\na more nuanced view on the race\nissues, or the evolution of rock and\nroll. Having all of these topics in\none film is a simply cramming, and\nwhile we get a bit of information\nabout a lot of things, we never get to\nspend enough time with any of the\nwomen to really form a connection.\nAll the best documentaries have an\nemotional element we can become\ninvested in, along with a clear\nnarrative, but it is this element 20\nFeet lacks. Had I seen it as a TV\ndocumentary (or better yet 5-part\nseries), I would have loved it. But as\na feature however? It doesn\u2019t really\nhold up.\nDarlene Love, one of the behind-the-scenes stars in 20 Feet From Stardom.

Starring: Lukas Schwarz,\nElias Schwarz, Susanne Wuest. 99\nminutes.\nI\nf you\u2019re in two minds about\nwhether or not to have\nchildren, watching Goodnight\nMommy should put you\nright off. An Austrian horror\ncentring around the relationship\nbetween a mother and her children,\nGoodnight Mommy is a dark, cold\nexploration of identity and power.\nIts Shyamalan-esque twist might\nnot be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but it\ncan\u2019t ruin the carefully constructed\nsense of unease that runs through\nthe film like a dark undercurrent.\nSet in a austere modernist house\nin the isolated Austrian countryside,\nGoodnight Mommy sees a mother\n(Susanne Wuest) return home to\nher twin sons (Elias and Lukas\nSchwarz), after having drastic facial\nsurgery, which has left her covered\nin bandages. With her behaviour\nstrangely altered, the boys begin\nto suspect that she might not be\ntheir mother after all; what follows\nis a dizzying power struggle,\nas characters compete for the\naudience\u2019s attention, culminating in\nan orgiastic display of violence.\nDirectors Veronika Franz and\nSeverin Fiala approach the subject\nlike an exercise in film-making,\nand there are some stunning shots;\nscenes that feature the twins acting\nas ghostly mirrors of each other and\nvisual constructions that obscure\nthe face crop up again and again.\nReferences to modern art \u2013 Gerhard\nRichter paintings on the walls, links\nto the work of Damien Hirst, and\nperhaps Marina Abramovic \u2013 give\nus the first hint that this is more\nnuanced than standard horror fare.\nWhat Franz and Fiala manage to\ndo exceptionally well is construct\na believable sense of ambiguity\naround the characters \u2013 we really\naren\u2019t sure what is going on, and\nwho we are supposed to support.\nThe twist that comes towards the\nend of the film is predictable (at\nleast, my companion found this to\nbe the case, I was too busy focussing\non the visuals),but it doesn\u2019t manage\nto disturb the carefully-crafted\nequilibrium of the film. Really the\ntwist is a secondary consideration,\nand doesn\u2019t manage to neatly tie up\nthe plot, leaving the audience with\nmore questions than answers.\nThe film\u2019s themes, of how we\nconstruct our identity around\nvisibility, are fascinating, and draw\nimmediate comparison to George\nFranju\u2019s Eyes Without a Face,\nalthough I think the exploration\nof behavioural changes associated\nwith a lack of identity are more\nreminiscent of HiroshiTeshigahara\u2019s\nThe Face of Another, a tale of a\nman whose face is burnt off in an\nindustrial accident. The adjectives\n\u2018Austrian\u2019 and \u2018chilly\u2019 evoke a link\nto the work of Michael Haneke,\nbut Goodnight Mommy is more\nclosely related to Ulrich Seidl (who\nserves as the project\u2019s producer),\nparticularly the ambiguity of his\ndocumentary In the Basement.\nThe debut feature film from Franz\nand Fiala, I cannot wait to see what\nthey get up to next. A measured,\nsuperbly controlled film, Goodnight\nMommy will leave you with an\nindelible distrust of children, and\na feeling of creeping disquiet that\npersists long after you leave the\ncinema.\nFRED FYLES\nWhat lies behind the bandages?

It\u2019s an oft-referred trope\nof Imperial: on open days, we\u2019re\nwarned that there\u2019s no shortage of\ndudes, and forced conversations\nduring freshers\u2019week often resort to,\n\u201cWow, there are loads of guys here!\u201d\nWe\u2019re always talking about the male\nexperience, or lack thereof in terms\nof sexual opportunity, but what of\nthe women of Imperial?\nWe didn\u2019t perch on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn lions with a DSLR, waiting\nto pounce on people Humans of\nNew York-style, but rather asked\nsome women to talk about their\nfemale specific experiences at\nImperial, whether they were good\nor bad, and how small, dismissable\nthings effected their existence as a\nwoman at a university where 64% of\nus are guys.\nThe whitewashed Women@\nImperial exhibit by the revolving\ndoors of the Business School\nonly tells part of the story. Much\nlike brands\u2019 obnoxious use of\nInternational Women\u2019s Day to\npromote their wares on social media,\nefforts like this can feel contrived.\nWe all know that workplaces have\na problem with diversity at their\nhighest level, and Imperial is no\ndifferent.\nAfter \u2018Misogyny at Varsity\u2019\nlast year, when a Sport Imperial\nemployee said he \u201cdidn\u2019t care how\nthose fat girls got home\u201d, Imperial\ncommissioned an investigation\ninto the culture of gender, which\nis currently being conducted by\nexternal academics.But then we had\nthe very Provost who commissioned\nit, Debra Humphris, leave us for\nBrighton.\nThe Angry Grad makes a\ntriumphant return below. Despite\ninitial speculation that the FELIX\ncomment\u2019s outspoken columnist\nwas a man, she ain\u2019t. Angry Grad\nis a job-having graduate who\u2019s been\nthrough the Imperial system, and\nexperienced the medical school\nwith all its foibles.\nFELIX: What kind of attitudes\ndid you encounter from students\nor teaching staff on the subject of\ngender?\nAngry Grad: Staff thankfully\ntreated me equal to my male\ncounterparts. However, my student\nexperience was quite different. In\nfact, it\u2019s kind of made me aware that\nsome of my mates are downright\nsexist \u2013 I\u2019m possibly having such a\nbloody epiphany right now that I\nmay need re-think my friend circle\nas a SIW (strong independent\nwoman).\nFor example, from good ideas in\na tutorial to a friendly conversation\nwith a lecturer, I\u2019ve been made\naware that some of the affirmation\nI may have gotten is likely is due to\nmy gender, as \u201cprofessors are nicer\nto girls.\u201d\nThis passing comment didn\u2019t\nbother me much at the time, and\nI\u2019m sure many of you have heard this\ntoo. Hell, if anything, one up for the\ngirls, right? Yet on second thought,\nthe connotations associated with\nsuch remarks are downright\ndisheartening. They imply that any\nachievements I may have made are,\nperhaps, not worthy of the merit\nthey received. They imply that,\nbecause I\u2019m a woman, academics\nwho are aware of my soft nature,\ninability to deal with critique, and\nlow self-esteem, have given me\ncredit where it isn\u2019t due.\nSome mates of mine have gone\nas far as to say that members\nof their year probably got into\nImperial because of their boobs,\nnot their brains. This cynicism is\nSquint and let the white faces wash over you. Photo Credit: FELIX\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\u2019m not\ntrying to be\nentertaining\nand my\nopinions are\nnot a joke.\nIs it time to\nshut up?\nThe women of Imperial\nWe take an uncensored look at female staff, graduate, and fresher experiences\naround college\npretty disgusting, and if anything,\ntransparently shows the insecurity\nof my peers who feel threatened.\nWhile yes, all of these remarks have\ncome from men, women shouldn\u2019t\nbe so blas\u00e9 and simply accept them.\nThe idea \u201cbat your eyelashes and\nyou\u2019ll get your way\u201d implies we have\nit easy, in whatever we endeavour\nto do, which couldn\u2019t be any more\nopposite of our reality.\nRemember the suffragette\nmovement, kids? Hardly glamorous\nwas it. So, what I\u2019m trying to say\nhere is it\u2019s not the attitude of just\nmen that needs to change. Rather,\nit\u2019s society\u2019s attitude towards\nwomen. Sounds obvious I know,\nbut it\u2019s the subtle things that make\nall the difference, like these niggly\ncomments here and there. Our\nIt\u2019s the\nsubtle\nthings that\nmake all the\ndifference\nachievements should be celebrated,\nmen and women and alike, and\nshouldn\u2019t be scrutinised because of\ngender differences.\nFELIX: How did the gender ratio\naffect you, if at all?\nAG: Not at all to be honest. My\ncourse was a bit of a fanny fest, so\nI never really experienced isolation\nas a female, which Imperial is\nnotorious for.\nFELIX: Did you feel like one of\nthe lads whilst you were doing your\ndegree?\nAG: I\u2019ve never been a \u201cgirly girl,\u201d\nwhich is a description that is sexist\nin itself, but alas the stereotype\nfits the point I\u2019m trying to make\n(#doublestandards).\nIn short, whilst I never have felt\nlike one of the lads, the comment\nhas been passed numerous times.\nAm I offended by it? It\u2019s a difficult\none. If it implies that I\u2019m not a\nRegina George, then no. But if it\nalso means that I am not feminine,\nthen 100% yes. Being feminine\nin my opinion, has become\nsynonymous for being quiet and\nsoft. Yes, I\u2019m boisterous, bossy and\nsome people have even called me\nintimidating. But it upsets me that\nthese take away from my femininity,\nand are more associated with a male\nstereotype.The worst thing is, when\nI have been called a lad before, I\u2019ve\ntaken it as a compliment; people\nare saying that I\u2019m not a gossiping,\nmake-up obsessed, shallow girl.\nBut the fact that I myself\nhave leapt on\nfirst thought to such conclusions, is\npretty worrying. I consider myself\na feminist after all, and if I myself\nassociate femininity with such\nvalues, how do I expect others not\nto?\nAngry Grad felt conflicted\nbetween proudly wearing her\nbadge of being \u2018one of the lads\u2019 to\nher own discount of femininity as a\nweakness.\nShould you call out your mates\nwhen they\u2019re problematic and run\nthe risk of pissing them off? Simran,\na fresher from the RSM, had this to\nsay.\nFELIX: What issues do you think\nyou deal with as a woman of colour\nat Imperial?\nSimran: I feel like I have to\nwork to prove myself to my peers.\nSometimes I feel like people expect\nme to represent everyone from\nmy background, which is a lot of\npressure. During first term, I\u2019d get\nasked a lot about my background\n(and then my parents\u2019 background,\nwhen I\u2019d say I\u2019m from London)\nand often I\u2019d get a response like\n\u201cAfghan girl from state school to\ndo engineering? You must have\nbeen an admissions statistic dream!\u201d\nOr even worse \u201cYour parents were\nREFUGEES?! WELL DONE!\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a sort of motivation,when it isn\u2019t\ntotally depressing.\nFELIX: Are you\never made aware of\nyour gender in your\ndepartment?\nS: As with any\ne n g i n e e r i n g\nd e p a r t m e n t ,\nMaterials is quite\nmale-dominated,\nso I\u2019m definitely\naware of\nthe gender\ndynamic.\nPeople\ndon\u2019t like to\nbe criticised,\noften I am\naccused of\nattacking\ntheir\nfreedom of\nspeech\nWhen I\nhave been\ncalled a lad\nbefore, I\u2019ve\ntaken it as a\ncompliment\nISSUE 1625\nPAGE 30 GAMES\nOur name is colonial \u2013 we\nshould change it\nTaking a dive into\nvirtual reality\nPAGE 8 COMMENT\nFRIDAY 5th FEBRUARY 2016\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College London\nY\nesterday the union told\nRAG its magazine of\nadverts and satire was\n\u201cbeyond the acceptable\nbounds of satire or mockery\u201d.

In an email to the\nmedical student body this week,\nthe ICSMSU president said: \u201cThe\nhistory of events has now led to the\nheads of College questioning why\nthe faculty of medicine should have\nits own Students\u2019Union\u201d.\ncontinued on page 4\nThe cover of the o\ufb00ending leaflet.\nThere\nhave\nbeen\nseveral\nstories this\nyear on both\nmisogyny\nfrom Sport\nImperial\nand\nalleged sexism\nfrom the RAG mag\nwriters. Photo Credit: FELIX\nThe atmosphere, and the sorts\nof comments people make are\ninfluenced by it. I often find\nmyself having to explain why rape\nshouldn\u2019t be a punchline. People\nknow this already, but I feel there\u2019s a\ncompetition to say the most twisted\nlaaaaaad banter joke, because that\u2019s\nsomehow manly and deserving of\nrespect.\nFELIX: Is having female lecturers\nimportant to you?\nSimran: In the materials\ndepartment, there are quite a few\nfemale lecturers. I love seeing\nthem, partly because it helps me\nsee a place for myself in academia.\nI think they\u2019re criticised more, and\nin a different way to their male\ncounterparts. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she\npanopto? What a hoe,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s in\na bad mood cos she\u2019s put on even\nmore weight over the weekend\u201d or\n\u201cmaybe she\u2019s on her period\u201d .\nFELIX: What impact do \u2018small\u2019\ncomments have on your experience\nas a woman?\nS: It\u2019s difficult. Mostly I find them\nfrustrating \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the\nbest way to react to them is.For the\nmost part, I don\u2019t think sexism is\nthought about before they are made.\nI don\u2019t think people are immediately\naware of their biases and why they\nwant to use slut as an insult when\nthey refer to a woman. Instances\nlike this are so common that I start\nto feel like a broken record.\nPeople don\u2019t like to be criticised,\noften I am accused of attacking\ntheir freedom of speech. My\nnew nickname is \u2018PC Simran of\nthe thought police\u2019. People don\u2019t\nunderstand that small comments\nJanet Vida Watson was the first female graduate from the Geology department\nand later went on to become Imperial\u2019s third female professor. Photo Credit:\nImperial College London\nshow attitudes which breed actions,\nand their TOP BANTS is fuelling\ndiscrimination. They say that they\nwould \u201cnever actually DO anything\ndiscriminatory.\u201d I don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s good enough. It\u2019s become\nsomething of a joke \u2013 someone will\nsay something horrible in a group\nchat and wait till Simran reads it.\nI\u2019m not trying to be entertaining\nand my opinions are not a joke. Is it\ntime to shut up?\nFELIX: Are they any other\nincidents that stand out?\nS: I was talking to one of my\nfriends about this. In a tutorial\nshe was told by one of her peers\nto write on the board because\n\u201ceveryone wants to look at the\npretty girl\u201d. When we spoke about\nit, I found that many of our friends\nsaw this as \u201cjust a compliment\u201d\nand not a horribly sexist example\nof objectification. Another time, I\nwas drinking juice from a straw in\na lecture and a comment was made\nabout how it looked like I was\nfellating the straw. I made a snarky\ncomment in response, but haven\u2019t\nhad an innocent carton since.\nCeleste van den Bosch is a PhD\nin materials, and is the postgraduate\nrepresentative for the Athena Swan\ncommittee for the department.\nFELIX: Are there any challenges\nyou face in the department that your\nmale counterparts do not?\nCeleste: In my experience\nworking as first an Undergraduate\nin the Chemistry Department and\nnow a PhD student in the Materials\nDepartment at Imperial I haven\u2019t\nfelt as though there is a difference\nin the challenges faced by students\nof different genders. On the news\nand through social media, a number\nof issues which can affect women\nin the workplace are often touted,\nnotably gender based harassment,\nunequal pay and lack of family\nsupport. To address these, I am\nfunded by EPSRC which provides\na set stipend for PhD students and\nwhile it hasn\u2019t been important in\nmy life yet, talking to postdocs in\nthe department I understand that\nthe Department of Materials is\nsupportive of expecting mothers.\nFELIX:Is being a man at Imperial\nthe default?\nC: It is a fact that there are more\nmen at Imperial, however, I think\nthat being a man is by no means\nthe default. In my experience,\nall students are given an equal\nopportunity at Imperial. I think\nthere should be more women in\nscience. This is something that\nneeds to be addressed by society\nas a whole, rather than Imperial\nspecifically, so that more girls are\nencouraged to follow a Science,\nEngineering, Technology career\npath.\nFELIX: Are women at Imperial\nsupporting each other as much as\nthey could be?\nC: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of\nwomen supporting other women, I\nthink it should be people supporting\npeople.I do have a female supervisor\nand there are a number of other\nfemale PhDs, as well as women on\nthe academic and technical staff\nwithin the department that I talk to.\nBut equally I also count on fellow\nmale PhD students, academics\nand technical staff for support and\nstimulating conversation. I trust\nthat they feel the same way about\nmy contributions.\nThere are\nmore men\nat Imperial,\nhowever, I\nthink that\nbeing a man\nis by no\nmeans the\ndefault\nBeccy Land was the first female Editor\nof FELIX.

I know a fair few people at\nIC who are LGBT+ and have an\nAsian background. Normally, the\nfirst response I got was \u201cDon\u2019t put\nmy name on that!\u201dWhat would you\nabout this?\nAnjeli Patel: As a community we\nneed to be a lot more visible. There\nare some situations where we just\nhave to be able to talk about this\npublicly. Unless we do that, we\naren\u2019t going to progress society any\nfurther.\nOne of the root causes of Indian\nculture still having such a stigma\ntowards LGBT+ people is due to\nthe way that a lot of families bring\nup their children. You\u2019re told you\u2019re\nmeant to go to university, get a great\njob, end up getting married \u2013 that\u2019s\nthe template life, and everyone\nshould fit into that template life. It\u2019s\nalmost a situation where you fit the\nmodel, or you don\u2019t fit in at all.\nFELIX: Does coming from a\nBritish-Asian family make that\nharder?\nAJ: Definitely. Much of the\nIndian community struggled when\nthey first came over to the UK.They\nworked hard. They worked really\nhard to emerge and be successful\n\u2013 and they want to continue that\nsuccess. I think there\u2019s an imbalance\nbetween wanting your children\nto be successful, but at the same\ntime, not really allowing them to\ndevelop and be their own person.\nThat\u2019s even in a marriage situation\n\u2013 whereby if an Indian person\nmarries outside of their community,\noutside of a specific caste, or even a\nspecific religion, a situation arises\nwhere they almost need to seek the\npermission of those around them.\nRather than appreciating it as two\npeople being in love, it can initially\nbe seen as a challenge by certain\nmembers of Indian society.\nFELIX: On the other hand,\npeople say: \u201cRight \u2013 we\u2019ve got gay\nmarriage. We\u2019ve got equal rights in\nlaw. Why are we still talking about\nthis?\u201d\nAJ: I think, to be honest with you\nthat the idea of being reluctant to\ndiscuss issues stems from shame.\nThat whole idea of brushing it under\nthe carpet stems from shame. You\ndon\u2019t want to talk about the issue:\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen in our backyard\n\u2013 it happens elsewhere\u201d. People still\nthink it doesn\u2019t happen in Asian\nsociety. They think it has to do\nwith upbringing, that it\u2019s a \u2018western\nthing\u2019. A lot of Asian people say\n\u201cwe haven\u2019t brought our children up\nto do that, so it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d There\u2019s\nthis wall of ignorance around the\nwhole topic. Being LGBT+ has\nnothing to do with upbringing or\nbackground or social status or class\n\u2013 it\u2019s got everything to do with the\nindividual. Until people understand\nthat, we have to keep going.\nFELIX: But you\u2019d still identify\nstrongly as Indian?\nAJ: I do. I think, overall, our\nculture is great and I am proud to be\nIndian. We have great literature, we\nhave great cinema, great food. We\nhave a lot to be proud of, and I very\nstrongly identify as Hindu.\nFELIX: Sure, the Rigveda\nsays \u201cVikruti Evam Prakriti\u201d \u2013\n\u201dPerversity/diversity is what nature\nis all about; what seems un-natural\nis also natural\u201d. Why was that\nattitude lost?\nAJ: Personally, I\u2019m just not sure\nif Indian society was ever widely\naccepting of LGBT+ people.\nMany very modern texts are also\nsupportive, but they just aren\u2019t lived\nup to. A lot of the stereotypical\nideas about what it means to be an\nIndian person aren\u2019t linked with\nour faith, they\u2019re not linked with\nour history \u2013 they\u2019re behaviours\nthat have been developed since\nwe arrived here in the UK. It\u2019s our\nreligion that preaches tolerance,\nacceptance and love. It\u2019s our culture\nthat has distorted itself, through\ngreed, continually seeking material\ngain and being overly concerned\nabout what others think of us.\nFELIX: What does it mean to be\nfemale to you?\nAJ: It bears no relation with\nsexuality and is so difficult to\narticulate. It\u2019s the way I feel in\nterms of the things that I associate\nthat are feminine. It\u2019s being the one\nwho nurtures relationships slightly\nmore...The traditional stereotypes of\nwhat it is to be female are something\nthat I\u2019ve always found attractive.\nEven if it\u2019s just enjoying certain\naspects of makeup, fashion, hair,\nI\u2019ve always had interests that align\nme more to what is \u2018stereotypically\u2019\nfemale. I\u2019ve always felt, intrinsically,\ninside, that I\u2019m female, even prior to\nany surgery.\nFELIX: But, say I know guys who\nwear makeup or are into fashion \u2013\ndoes that make them, necessarily,\nfeminine?\nAJ: It\u2019s so,so much more than that,\nthough I completely understand\nthat men can be into fashion\nor wear make-up. I was never\ncomfortable... I could never walk\ninto a room dressed as a male before\nI transitioned and feel comfortable.\nI would always just want to be in the\nside of the room, not being noticed,\nhope no-one would even speak to\nme.If I reverse the question and ask,\nother than the fact that you were\nassigned male at birth, how do you\nknow you\u2019re male? ; It\u2019s a feeling so\nmentally present but so difficult to\ncapture into words.\nFELIX: A number of LGBT+\ninternational students have told\nFELIX they fear that if they come\nout, their family will cut them off\nfinancially, and they will lose their\neducation. What\u2019s your view on\nthis?\nAJ: We have to break this cycle\nwhereby a large proportion of\nLGBT+ people end up not being\nable to have a great education for\nfinancial reasons. Ideally, Imperial\nshould have some kind of system\nwhere they have grants for people\nwho are in this situation (Though,\nyou would need to be careful that\nthose aren\u2019t abused).\nYou need\nto change\nthe culture,\nnot just the\nrules or the\npeople\nFELIX: But should trans people\nstay as part of LGBT community?\nStonewall has only just agreed that\nit will campaign for trans rights. If\nsomeone says \u201cI\u2019m a straight woman\nnow, I don\u2019t need this\u201d, is that right?\nAJ: I completely accept that\nopinon.I understand that Stonewall\nonly recently decided to work with\ntrans people, to help trans people,\nbut for me it\u2019s a sign of progression.\nThe timing is unfortunate \u2013 and yes,\nit is late in the day. But we are very\nslim on options, to be honest, and\nI feel that isolating overselves in an\nalready isolated environment isn\u2019t\nsensible. Stonewall is doing great\nwork right now, and going at it\nalone with so few public, visible role\nmodels \u2013 we\u2019d be doing ourselves a\nhuge disservice to do that. Also, for\nme personally, the gay community\nhas always been incredibly\nsupportive.\nFELIX: Imperial College\nHealthcare Trust is a world leader\nin gender reassignment surgery.\nHowever, it seems that the ICSM\ndoesn\u2019t provide much (if any)\ntraining to its students in the field.\nWhat would you say about this?\nFELIX interviews 29 year-old Anjeli Patel, who works at Ernst & Young, on being\ntrans, being Indian and the equality in the workplace\nBen Williams\nWriter\nI\u2019ve always\nfelt,\nintrinsically,\ninside, that\nI\u2019m female,\neven prior\nto any\nsurgery\nAJ: Treating a transgender person\nis more than learning about how\nto complete gender reassignment\nsurgery. You are quite often giving\nthat person their life back. It\u2019s vital\nthat ICSM members are taught the\nimportance and the duty of care they\nhave when dealing with transgender\npatients. The emotional aspect of\nsupport is just as important as the\nsurgical.\nFELIX: Was there ever a point\nwhere you questioned the transition?\nAJ: Yes, there was. Not that I\nquestioned who I was, I questioned\nthe methods that I\u2019d chosen. There\nwere times when I look back and\nthink \u2013 I wish I had got a job first, I\nwish I had secured myself financially\nbefore transitioning.\nIn terms of friends or family, I\u2019d\nsay I lost 90% of my friends circle\nwhen I said that I was going to\ntransition. That really made me\nthink, \u201cam I doing the right thing?\nThis is going to continue getting\nworse.\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t really ever question\nthe transition itself because I\u2019d\nknown from a young age that, in my\nheart, it was the right thing to do.\nThere were points where I\nquestioned other people, I\u2019d say\n\u2013 about why they would want to\ntreat me so differently when I was\nstill the same person inside. But not\nreally the transition itself, no.\nFELIX: So you talked about EY\n\u2013 are there still barriers to LBGT+\npeople in the workplace?\nAJ: People in an interview setting\nwant to hire people that almost\nmirror their own way of thinking.\nIt\u2019s normal human nature to align\nwith people that you have an affinity\nwith.I find that a massive stumbling\nblock in itself. To be honest, I was\ndoing myself a huge disservice. I\nwould prepare for a week, 2 weeks,\nand then apply to the kind of places\nwhere I wasn\u2019t valued. It almost got\nto the point where I thought, well,\nI\u2019m not going to continue looking\nfor work. Luckily, I found EY, and\nthey have been fantastic.\nFELIX: What\u2019s your general view\non positive discrimination?\nAJ: I wouldn\u2019t want to be selected\nto do something just because I\nwas the token trans person or to\nfill a quota. On the other hand,\npositive discrimination is needed;\nthe workforce right now is just not\nrepresentative of society.\nFELIX: For example, what\u2019s your\nposition on trans people in sport?\nOne high profile trans woman is Caitlyn Jenner, who transitioned last year and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair after\ndoing so. Photo Credit: Vanity Fair\nAJ: My opinion is a little\ncontroversial. It\u2019s just a personal\none, I know there are arguments\non both sides. For me, for\nsomeone who is born a\nmale to compete alongside\nother biological females...\nI completely understand\nthe fact that internally you\nfeel female \u2013 obviously\nI\u2019m going through it\nmyself. However, I\nalso wonder if you\nare at a physical\nadvantage...and\nI worry it could,\nperhaps, make\nthe competition\nunfair. Obviously,\nif you can ensure\nthe competition is\nequal, trans people\nshould absolutely\ncompete alongside\ntheir chosen gender.\nFELIX: I guess\nthe dream has\nalways been that\none day things\nlike Stonewall\ndon\u2019t exist.\nThat this\ni n t e r v i e w isn\u2019t\nn e w s , t h a t\nsomeone can say \u201cI\u2019m a woman\u201d\nor \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d and no one cares.\nWill that day come?\nAJ: I hope so. Whether it will\nactually happen or not, I don\u2019t\nknow. I\u2019m not sure, because of what\nI\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s not an easy\ncall.\nFELIX: Are we getting there?\nAJ: I think we\u2019re moving in the\nright direction, yes. There\u2019s been\nhuge movement in the last year or\ntwo. What I fear for trans people at\nthe minute is that it almost seems\nlike you\u2019re acceptable, and you\u2019re\nfine, so long as visually you fit\ninto what is conventionally male\nor female. There\u2019s a pressure to\nbe \u2018the perfect woman\u2019. My big\nhope that we start to see more\nvisible trans people outside of\nentertainment, actually working\nin government, the corporate sector\nand within other industries.\nFELIX: Imperial says it wants to\nget more women into STEM. At\nthe moment, we\u2019ve got a ratio of\n60:40. How do we make those steps\nto stop people taking one look and\nturning away?\nAJ: I get what you\u2019re saying about\nthe ratio... but for me, it wasn\u2019t just\nabout the numbers. It was about\nthe way that people treated me.\nThese places felt very oppressively\ncorportate \u2013 more like an old boy\u2019s\nclub than anything else. There was\nvery little passion there, very little\nunderstanding. You need to change\nthe culture, not just the rules or the\npeople.\nLaverne\nCox,\nqueen\nof\nthe\nworld.\nPhoto\nCredit:\nTime\nMagazine\nAnjeli is an Assurance Associate at\nEY.
