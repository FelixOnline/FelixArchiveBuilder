    "content": "HI\nin.\nEarthquakes\nEarthquakes are one of\nthe most destructive\nnatural hazards, both in\nterms of loss of life and\ndamage to man-made\nstructures. The recent\nearthquakes in Mexico\nhave demonstrated this\nfact only too clearly, with\na death toll in the\nthousands and large areas\nof Mexico City left in\nruins. In the aftermath of\nthis catastrophe it is clear\nthat much or the\ndestruction could have\nbeen avoided if buildings\nhad been more efficiently\ndesigned and\nconstructed.\nSince the turn of the\ncentury more than 1.5\nmillion people have been\nkilled as a result of\nearthquakes, and the\ndamage has amounted to\nmore than \u00a3300,000\nmillion. With the spread of\nurban settlements and the\nincreased financial\ninvestment in earthquake\nregions of the world, the\ntoll has been steadily\nrising. In recent years the\nuse of improved structural\ndesign to try and\nminimise this damage has\nbecome one of the more\nrapidly expanding\ntechnologies.\nEngineering Seismology\nis an interdisciplinary\ntechnology, that\ncombines our knowledge\nof earthquakes, with\nengineering in an attempt\nto design new structures\nmore safely, and improve\nthe resistance of older\nones. Here at Imperial\nCollege, in the Civil\nEngineering Department,\nthere is an Engineering\nSeismology Section\nheaded by Professor N Ambraseys. The section\nhas around fifteen\npostgraduate students of\nwhich a high proportion\ncome from overseas, in\nparticular from countries\naffected by earthquakes.\nEarthquates are caused\nwhen energy stored in the\nearth's crust is suddenly\nreleased. This energy\ntravels through the earth\nin the form or seismic\nwaves, which are greatly\naffected by the earth's interior and the superficial\ngeology of an area. Local\ntopography, soil\nconditions, and bedrock\nformation can vary\nconsiderably from one\narea to another, and so\naccurate predictions of\nthe form earth m ov ment s might take is very\ndifficult. If purely\ntheoretical models are\nused to assess the way\nbu idling materials and\nfoundations may respond\nto future earth quakes,\nthen the results may not\nbe reliable. It is really\nonly through the field\nstudy of earthquakes that\nour understanding of their\ncomplexity increases.\nThe Engineering\nSeismology group base\ntheir work on field\nexperience and send\nrepresentatives to visit the\nsite of major earthquakes,\ndamaged as a result of\nearthquake activity they\nneed to be restored to\ntheir original strength, not\njust 'patched up'. Building\nin areas that are known to\nhave poor foundations\nshould be avoided, and\nhigh population densities\nin danger areas can cause\nproblems. By visiting the\nsite of a destructive\nearthquake it is possible\nto see how all the\ndifferent factors influence\nthe extent of the damage.\nThe assessment of\nEarthquake risk coupled\nwith attempts to mimi mse it is central to the group's work. When determining\nthe risk, many factors\nlike the recent ones in\nMexico. The study of\nearthquake damaged-structures, such as those\nshown in the\nphotographs, can give a valuable insight into ways\nof improving design and\nconstruction. Although it\nis virtually impossible to\ndesign for zero damage,\nthe total collapse of\nbuildings can be avoided.\nIn the event of an\nearthquake the large\na monts of energy that are\nreleased have to be\nabsorbed somewhere. In a badly designed build ling, the weak points of a structure will be identified\nand total collapse of the\nbuilding can follow. The\ngroup at Imperial College\ntake advantage of this fact\nand use a 'Failsafe'\ntechnique in their building\ndesign in such a way that\nif there is an earthquake\nparts may fail, but the\nmain structure will remain\nintact.\nInefficient design of\nstructures is only part of\nthe problem. The findings\nof the group showed that\nthere are many other\nsteps that can be taken to\nminimise risk. It is\nimportant that\nconstruction work is\ncarefully supervised to\nensure that finished\nstructures keep to the\noriginal design\nspecifications. When\nbuildings become\nhave to be taken into\naccount; the natural\nhazard of an area, the\nvulnerability of a structure, danger to life\nand possible financial\nloss, are all important.\nThe importance of each\nfactor varies considerably\ndepending on the area\nyou are looking at. For\ninstance, here in the\nUnited Kingdom there is a very low na tru al hazard\nand yet many structures,\nbecause of their high\nvulnerability, have a high\nrisk. In some areas of the\nworld, like Pakistan, the\nfinancial factor is much\nless sign i cant because the\ncost of rebuilding\ndamaged structures is\nquite Tow. Being able to\nassess earthquake risk\naccurately is particularly\nimportant for insurance\ncompanies.\nResearch carried out by\nthe Engineering\nSeismology group is\nproviding a valuable\ncontribution in the search\nfor a fuller understanding\nof the worldwide\nearthquake problem.\nTheir findings are of ge at value. Here in the United\nKindgdom, which has\nmany hazardous\nstructures such as\nbridges, dams and\nchemical plants that must\nbe able to withstand\nminor 'quakes'. Although\nEarthquakes cannot be\nprevented technological\ndevelopments give us the\npower to minimise their\ndestructive potential.\nCONTROL & ELECTRICAL\nCOME ON DOWN!/\nfor\nCAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN\nCONTROL/ELECTRICAL ENG'G. with\nFREE BEER & SANDWICHES.\nBY JULIAN AMEY & CHRIS.

    "content": "happened to another\nsociety the President spoke\nsharply and anger i ly to a UGM about the need to\nrespect the posters of\nsocieties in College. If\npeople continue to take\ndown our posters it will get\nout of hand and I would\nlike you to do something\nabout it now.\nThank you\nyours sincerely\nMichael Newman\nNewman Protest\nDear Sir,\nThank you for publishing\nthat delightful piece of\nprose from Michael\nNewman last week. I'm glad\nto see that Michael's eloquence and intelligence\nhave not been dimmed by\nhis recent 'absence' from\nthe College scene.\nI am sure that all this years\nFreshmen will have been\nimpressed by Michael\nNewmans concern over\nHuman Rights, Nuclear and\nBiological Warfare and\nsexism which is no doubt\nthe first offensive in his\n'Winter Campaign' for\nmorality which those of us\nwho have been at IC for\nsome time have been\nsubjected to several times\nbefore. I wonder how long\nafter the publication of his\narticle it will be before the\nfirst U GM motion on these\nissues appears?\nI would just like to point\nout to all the people who\nare not familiar with such\n'classic IC debates' that\nthey consider and Analyse\nvery carefully what Michael\nNewman has to say before\ncoming to any conclusion\nabout just how righteous\nhe really is. As an example,\nMister Newman is on\nwritten record in a past\nissue of FELIX that he\ncounts himself as one of\nthose members of the\npopulation who\nmasturbates over\npornographic magazines.\nWhen I read that sort of\nhypocrisy I wonder how\nsincere he is about the\nother issues he raises.\nI am looking forward to\nsome entertaining UGM's. Yours sincerely\nMichael Jones\nMining Geology PG\nA Joke\nDear Editor,\nHow may Imperial College\nUnion Executive\nSabbaticals does it take to\nchange a lightbulb?\nFour.\nRobert MacRae\nBeit Hall\nIS\nLife Sci Dies?\nDear Sir,\nThe Life Science Party has\nbecome a traditional part of\nfresher s week. It is always\nwidely attended by a large\nnumber of students in the\nhope that they will be able\nto benefit from a party with\na better mix of the sexes.\nOn Tuesday evening\naround 11.30pm whilst\nwalking along the walkway\nI came across a number of\npeople coming away from\nthe party obviously rather\nunhappy with the evenings\nentertainment.\nI went along to see what\nwas happening. I was\nhorrified to find out what\nthe Life Science party\nconsisted of. The amount\nof organisation that had\ngone into the party was\nminimal. The disco was the\nworst, I 've ever seen. Poor\nsound quality and\ncontinuous 'alternative'\nmusic without much variety\ndidn't make dancing very\neasy. Some effort had been\nmade to create some\natmosphere by having four\nspot lights on the ceiling.\nThis was beautifully\ncomplemented by eight\nflashing coloured lights to\nreally finish off the affect.\nNo expense spared!\nThen of course a cash\nbar which closed prom ply at 11.00pm without anyone\nrealising it. All this\nprovided for \u00a32 a head.\nOn a very rough\ncalculation these were\nprobably 300 people\nattending bringing in \u00a3600.\nIf the disco and lights had\ncost \u00a350 it would have been\nextortionate. This still gives\na clear profit of \u00a3500\nallowing for another \u00a350 for\nmisc expenses.\nIt cannot be right for a group of students to make\nso much money from an\nevent that they do not take\ntrouble to organise\nproperly.\nI suggest that in future\nyears, the Life Science\nparty is not promoted as a fresher s week events.\nRoger Preece\nPresident C&G FSLN vs FCS\nSir,\nForgive me for returning\nonce more to a subject\nupon which I am already a notorious bore; that of\nNicaragua. Many students\nwill have seen at Freshers'\nFair a poster on the\nConservative Society stall\nreading 'Support the\nContras with FCS', a poster\nwhich popular objections\nlater induced them to\ncover. Lest the support of a major political party should\nlend respectability to their\ncause, let's be clear about\nthe contra s: These guerrilla\norganisations are\nattempting the armed\noverthrow of a popular and\ndemocratically-elected\ngovernment. The elections\nof November 1984 which\nreturned the Sandinista\nFront to power were the\nmost freely-conducted ever\nseen in Nicaragua, and\nwere approved by an all-party group of British MP'S and Lords, including the\nConservative David Ashby.\nThe Tory government,\nhowever, which chose not\nto send its own official\nobservers, have decided in\nadvance that the elections\nwould be a 'Soviet-style\nsham' (Reagan's words),\nnow claims to know\nenough about those\nelections to support\nviolence overthrow of th\nresulting authorities in\nPoster Protest\nDear Carl,\nThis is an official , written\ncomplaint. Firstly I wish to\ncomplain about the\ntasteless, insulting and\noffending posters IC\nConservative Society\ndes played at their Fresher's Fair stall. Thses included\none that said 'Hiroshima\nwas a nuclear free zone',\nanother supported the\nContras, others de pre c ted Arthur Scargill as a fascist,\nKen Livingstone as a terrorist and compared\nsocialism with fascism. As\na socialist and peace\ncampaigner I find these\ngrossly insulting, and\nappear to be aimed simply\nto incite anger and\nviolence. They do not put\nover Consoc's political\naims or views, then simply\ninsult and smear their\nopponents. If these posters\nwere against a particular\nreligion, or race, or sex I am sure you and your\nfavour of a return of the\nlate dictator Somoza's private army.\nBearing in mind the\nbrave words of Mrs\nThatcher regarding\nterrorists, which the\nContras are, and her\nreluctance even to deny\ntrade to the murderous\nregime in South Africa,\nhow can Conservative\nsupport for the Contras be\nconsistent with government\npolicy, let alone justified?.\nSuffice it to say that even\nthe Tories are somewhat\nshamefaced about the\nmatters: knowing that it\nwould be publicly\nunacceptable openly to\nblock aid to Nicaragua,\nthey sought to 'delay' it on\ntechnicalities, as a leak to\nthe Guardian revealed.\nEven the FCS Death-and\nGlory boys at Freshers' Fair\nquibbled when challenged,\nsaying that IC Consoc has\nno policy of its own\nregarding Nicaragua..\nYours (in full flow)\nPeter Hobbis\nChair, IC Soc Soc\nExec would act. I am\nasking you to treat this\nmatter the same . To\nreprimand Consoc and not\nto allow them to put any of\nthe offending posters up\naround College. If you\nrequire to be 'picketed'\ninto action I can collect\ntwenty signatures of\nprotest. I might add that no\nother political stall,\nincluding CND displayed\nany insulting or tasteless\nposters.\nMy second complaint is\nthat during the Tuesday of\nFresher Fair someone took\ndown all ICCND's posters\nalong the walkway, by\nMech Eng and in Sherfield.\nThese were not offensive,\nsimply advertising our stall\nand had a picture of a skeleton reading 'protest\nand survive', the slogan\nbeing 'don't you wish you\nwere better informed'. Our\nposters were selectively\ntaken down, others being\nleft. This is a very serious\nmatter to us, as we depend\nupon our publicity posters\nand pay for them, apart\nfrom the effort to put them\nup. Last year when this\n2 Friday 11 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The metaphor of food in 'Dim\nSum\u2014a little Piece of Heart'\n(Screen on the Hill) extends\nnot only throughout the film,\nbut seemingly into the\nnames of people involved in\nthe mak ng of it too, with two\nChews (acting) and a Seltzer\n(Screenplay).\nThe story concerns the\nrelationship between three\nChinese Americans,\nmother, daughter and uncle\nand also between the two\ncultures. The uncle are\ndaughter are 'similar\ncasualties' of this culture\nclash and are far more\nwesternised then the\nmother, who wishes for\nlittle more then to see the\nmarriage of her daughter.\nHer haste in this desire is\nprompted by a fortune\nteller's prediction of her\nimminent death at the age\nof 62.\nThe use of appr ori at ely static camera work and\nnice little ironies, such as\nthe 'potato chip' in amongst\nthe mah jong set and the\nbaseball commentary over\nshots of Chinese\nornaments, adequately\ndemonstrate the director,\nWayne Wang's skill in story\ntelling. All in all it's a very\nrefreshing change from the\nusual Hollywood\nMcDonalds.\nIf further incentive were\nrequired there is an\ninteresting entree in the\nform of 'Koclo: Heartbeat\nDummers of Japan' which\naffords the rare opportunity\nto see a group of people\ndetermined ly attempting to\nbludgeon the crap out of\nbarrels with the aid of\nIndian clubs. Remarkable.\nNightmare on Elm Street,\non the other hand, is\nneither delightful, amusing\nor highly recommended. It\nis written and directed by\nphilosophy lecturer Wes\nreviews\nto the front in the\nOdeon/Empire etc and\nyou'll get a real pain in the\nneck.\nThe Barbican is showing\nInsignificance (a film which\nshould really mean\nsomething to IC Students\nsince its main characters\nare Marilyn Monroe and\nAlbert Einstein) until 10th October and then Pale\nRider from the 11th to 17th, after which it switches to a Dim Sum: Chinese for soap. Joe Claydon goes to Chinatown.\nJon Coupe on the pros and cons of alcohol-free cinema.\nCraven and tells the tale of\na group of kids attacked,\nusually fatally, in their\ndreams. The idea itself is\nclever enough, but\nunfortunately is so badly\nhandled that the suspense\nis diffuse, adding a certain\nirony to the heroine's advice 'don't fall asleep'.\nStick to the day job, Wes.\nA forty pence tube ride on\nthe Circle Line can take\nyou to a very different sort\nof cinema at the Barbican\nCentre. Very different in the\ntype of film it shows, no;\ndifferent in price and\ncomfort, yes.\nThe Barbican is one of\nLondon's biggest\nindependant cinemas.\nMost of its rivals run an\naggressive programme of\nart movies and cult films\nbut the Barbican seems to\nhave lost its nerve and has\nswitched to showing more\npopular films, albeit only\nthose with some claim to\nintellectual respectability.\nRecent films have included\nWetherby and The\nShooting Party. Pale Rider\nis coming later this month.\nWith such an\nunexceptional choice of\nfilms, normally showing\nafter they have finished at\nLeicester Square, the\nBarbican sounds like a very\ngood place to avoid \u2014 and\nwould be, if not for its\nstudents discount scheme\n(operating about ten to\nfifteen minutes before the\nstart of a film and reducing\nthe cost of a ticket from \u00a33\nto \u00a32) and the cinema's comparative luxury.\nInside the theatre there is\nair conditioning, thick\ncarpet and enormous\narmchairs, instead of tatty\nfolding seats. Sound and\nvision quality are superb\nand the screen is\ncomfortably watch able from any seat (sit too close\nbewildering succession of\nWalt Disney movies and\n'five versions of Carmen by\nfive noted directors'.\nSo long as the Barbican is\nshowing a film you want to\nsee then its the place to\nsee it.\n>\n5\nTaking liberties with literature. John Burgess looks at the last of the Fringe.\nOne of the largest tragedies\nof this year's Edinburgh\nFestival was the failure of\nThe Scotsman to award\nScream Blue Murder a well\ndeserved Fringe First.\nInstead, these three foot\nsuccess symbols were\nawarded to the usual gamut\nof large professional\ncompanies with only the\nodd notable exception,\n(such as Red Rose\nTheatre's extraordinary\nBeatrix and Sigmund).\nForunately this did little to\ndeter their more discerning\naudiences, much to their\ndelight and the doubtless\nconsternation of the\nAssembly Rooms,\nEdinburgh's most\nsuccessful venture since\nGreyfriars Bobby.\nNow The Shadow\nSyndicate have taken their\nnon-award winning play to\nthe Gate Theatre, Notting\nHill. A radical adaptation of\nEmile Zola's Therese\nRacquin, the play traces\nthe events surrounding the\nmurder of her husband, by\nher lover and he/se if, and\nhow her guilt leads to the\ndestruction of everything in\nher limited world.\nThe script and the\nproduction are quite\nfantastic. Using quite\nremarkable theatrical\ntechniques, the play moves\nwith almost cinematic\nprecision, using the\ncombination of cabaret and\npowerful choreography to\nenhance its effect.These\nsuperb experiments do not\nmarr the production in any\nway, but complements the\nac to in perfectly, flowing in\na way rarely seen in most\n'modern adaptations' today.\nAlthough not, in my view.\na comparable candidate for\nThe Scotsman's coveted\naward, John Tordoff's production of Reynard The\nFox at The Young Vic\ncaptures the crisp\natmosphere of Masefield's epic poem with similar\naptitude. The poem is so\nneatly cleft into two parts\nthat is seems almost tailor-made for adaptation.\nHowever, despite their\nburning per server ance, the\ncast of five have some\ndifficulty in proving their\ndedication convincing until\nwell into the second act.\nOften lack of action and\nideas threaten to bring the\ntension, brilliantly built up,\nto an anti-climatic end.\nDespite this, John\nTordoff gives an energetic\nperformance as Reynard,\nholding the suspense of the\ntale (tail?) to the very end.\nFELIX Friday 11 October 11\n\n"

Also, the wings might\nhave to be hollow to take\nbreak cables and con-rods\nand attaching the wings to\nthe main body will take\ngreat thought, since they\nhave to take large bending\nmoments from turning.\nFurthermore, internal\naluminium torsion boxes\nwill have to be designed\nbecause the monocoque\ncannot close over the rider\nwhere he needs a clear\ncanopy.\n3) Aerodynamics of the\nvehicle. As I have just\nalluded, the monocoque\ndoes not constitute the\nentire exterior.

    "content": "2\nUrn\nThe Belt\nProfessor Eric Ash, the new\nRector, is proving to be\nsomewhat enigmatic.\nMembers of the academic\nstaff are particularly\nconcerned. One elderly\nacademic, who has seen\nmany a Rector come and\ngo in his time, reported that\nAsh was 'earnest and\nsincere \u2014 and we're all\nvery worried about if.\nJohn Smith, Turf\nAccountant\nPerhaps College Secretary,\nJohn Smith, should also be\nworried. Mr Smith's reputation is that of a devious administrator,\nquietly getting his own way\nwith no visible sign of\nblood except when the odd\nEstates offical gets exiled\nto Silwood Park. He may\nfind it rather more difficult\nto cope with earnestness\nand sincerity and return to\nthe Foreign Office, where\nsuch qualities are not\nfound in abundance.\nJohn Smith's qualifications for a job in\nthe FO spring from as\nGovernor of the Gilbert and\nEllis Islands. He had the\ndifficult task of ensuring\nthe economic success of\nthe Colony but proved up\nto the task, ensuring that\nincome from one-armed\nbandits kept the place\nafloat. Perhaps a job as a 'turf accountant' lies ahead;\nwith people like the Union's administrator, Jen HardySmith, losing some of their\nhard-earned pennies on the\ngee-gees every Wednesday\nhe would have no difficulty\nin living in the style to\nwhich he has become\naccustom med. John Smith will, no\ndoubt, be here for\nconsiderably longer than\nICU Prseident, Carl\nBurgess. The most\nconvincing sign of his\nimpending demise is the\nfact that a motion of\ncensure can be passed\ndespite being proposed by\nmega bore J Martin Taylor.\nMr Taylor is a failed\npresidential candidate\nhimself (he received fewer\nvotes than the joke\ncandidate, who won the\nelection in this instance)\nway back in 1982. Martin's monotonous Lancastrian\ndrawl and extreme rightwing views are normally\nquite enough to lose him\nany vote but Carl's blundering s were just too\nmuch for even Martin to\nmanage to disguise. Can\nCarl save himself with a last charge on the Sherfield\nbuilding and kill the\nsnorting dragon, in the\nform of Refectory Manager\nRob Northey? I suspect\nthat there are a few trip-wires awaiting Carl before\nhe can get his hands on the\nUnion Bar and improve his\nchances of survival.\nParking\nPermits\nPermits can be collected\nfrom ICU Hon Sec, Quentin\nFontana in the IC Union\nOffice any time after\nMonday lunchtimes\nName/Organisation Reg Number\nICU HLO\nICU KLO\nICU OLE\nICU AHU\nTony Churchill\nSC COS CRS MUC& GU Luke Walker B438 YUR\nR CSU Guilds Motor Club\nGuilds Motor Club\nGuilds Motor Club\nGuilds Motor Club\nGuilds Motor Club\nM Chryssanthopoulos CBY 745YB Cox PPA 759W BA Clarke CGT 542KC Divine JBK 701P TS Daltaban WGJ 731RZ Doulgeri RLE 373RP Fiannigan NVK 733RS Gouvras A433 XOX\nD Gritsis LJO 246SG Galeros MCW 396X RC J Hallewell A658 SNO\nPT Healy ETR 249WM Husain A656 GGV\nS Jeropoulos XLD 276XS Kellas DTW 51XP Kelkanis YYN 5477\nFA Kalhor YPM 502S SJ Lane DYB 7867\nWK Liu DLC 435T PS Lee B806 WYF\nHM Lakhani A649 FAP\nS Little CUP 380 TP Monson ENW 983KM Maccarini RRT922M\nL Oliva YLW 305S IM Pettifor WEG 825 7\nP Idundun WLY 502S RDR Motta NAR 622V KG Smith OMD 386X JV1N Sodha SEX 417V BF Shahgaldi KGO 761Y F Sternfeld\nA Suleman RCP 607PJ Whiteman RDD 309RA AM C450 BND\nK Ahmed SLL 945RAL Breeze PYN 740LC Pollock UIA 157ZP Bevan PEM 107T \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb I \u00bb ' T you jc\u00bb\u00bbwP S Ow\nMJ Naylor\nD Morten\nS Mortezaie\nS McHale\nR Marsden\nSD Moore\nP Lambert\nB Gerginov\nP Lansiaux\nD luts an J Hackney\nM Hunter\nSA Hussain\nAC Greenfield\nC Frail\nNG Folland\nPD Evans\nA Epstein\nM Deakin\nM Carman\nD Paraskevopoulous\nG Prout\nKuan Yew Pang\nM Priestley\nF Mutamedi\nN Kapur\nSW Kim\nE Hadjiconstantinou\nE Hosseini\nA Howard\nZ Gray\nG Germanopoulos\nV GembalaJ P Felix\nA Folefac\nC Deeney\nS Brock\nM Chung H Chhatwal\nW Cole\nNightline General\nJ Chapman A J Cholfwinski\nER Ariyanaykam\nJ Bromley\nA Alshaikh\nFE Yazdy\nM Zalaf\nH Todokuru\nS S Sian\nS A Shah\nDM Peterson\nME Ozlat\nCYR Murthy\nGH J Rea\nM Sedgwick\nP Stewart\nP Sekhon\nMC Sheahan\nTS Sheriff\nK Sotirchos\nJJ Stedman\nJ MM Sturleon\nM Saberi-Movahed\nS Tarzi\nTC Tan\nCL M Tiana\nBS Tan\nD Vaswani\nH Wilson\nCW Wong\nJ Watt\nAP Williams\nP Whitmore\nJ CE Wright\nSC Yiangou\nP Fiannigan\n8977 MOY\nETY 660L KUW 601X BLP 317Y UVL 68X AUP 655L BRW 393T NRX 499R KRO 146P PPL 949R ORC 196W PKJ 785M LMX 564P REB 336S ULW 998M SLK 440R MFJ 540P JJC 993P CGN 832S WWP 237S ABT491K\nJGP310N\nA453 XJM\nSHB 969 Y LLA 312K SSG 268 Y TLR 963W SYE 843R ENJ 47V TME 659 Y B333 NLM\nFGK 5777\nJME 606N UGP 128R RPF 511X RHS 892R8776 EEV\nRPF 362X OPL 302R CG Y764 X AOP 957\nHBM 3357\nSJT 677X WAH 686H2325 FLO\nJAL 680N TKM 97\nGTM 86T URO 823 W DLE 453W WFO 7757\nHGU 458V B544 UUR\nBYD 956S YKK 312S KFS 951X TYF\nA51 KLR\nGKK 400Y THN 915S SRO 203D DFS 697L HAV 22Y XMK 8687\nKYR 972X KYH 562X PVM 448R LYM 19S LHU 539P YYP 443T XSO 892Y PYP 169R ECP54S\nFGH 997T LCT 75X88Y88 S ti Friday 11 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rob Northey: The Interview\nFELIX: How do you think\nyour first six months as\nRefectory Manager have\ngone?\nRob Northey: Not too badly\n\u2014 could have been worse.\nF: How do you think you\nhave developed the bars?\nN: Well...that's a leading\nquestion isn't it?\nF: You've been accused of\nignoring the Union Bar. Do\nyou think you have\nimproved that bar?\nN: It's my understanding\nthat the Union Bar had a lot of money spent on it\nrecently and was very set in\nits ways.\nF: Brian and Doug have\ncomplained that a lot of the\nodd jobs that needed to be\ndone have been ignored?\nN:I 've taken Estates over\nthere to show them all the\njobs that needed doing\nover there, not that long\nago.\nF: Is it true that you weren't happy with the\nperformance of the Brian\nand Doug at the New Years\nParty?\nN:I felt that we needed\nextra bar facilities to cut\ndown some of the queues.\nF: Does that mean you felt\nthat the Union should have\nrun a can bar?.\nN:A mobile bar or a can\nbar or some other bar of\nsome description. Can bars\nwere run there in the past,\nso the concept has already\nbeen used over there, so I was thinking of improving\nfacilities by breaking\nqueues down so that\npeople weren't all\ncondensed into one small\narea.\nF: Do you feel that given\nthe almost record takings\nof the Union Bar during the\nNew Year's Party, that the\ncrit c isms were unfair?\nN: No, because we put on a separate bar on the Friday,\nand took a very similar\namount of money, despite\nthe boycott on the Union\nBar. The subs i du ary bar,\nserving just beer and cans\ntook over \u00a3750. Obviously\nthat sort of amount\nindicates that it took the\npressure off the main bars.\nF: Why did you ask Brian\nand Doug to leave the\nUnion Bar on Tuesday after\nthey resigned.\nN: It's fairly standard in the\ntrade that when people are\nleaving very often you don't expect them to work out\ntheir notice. Not any\naccusation against them its\njust standard in the trade.\nF: How succesful do you\nfeel the boycott has been?\nN:I had no real doubt that\nit would have a certain\nimpact. We will not see\nwhether it will have any\nlasting impact because its\nnot been on for long\nenough. It is counterproductive as one hopes\nthat the bars will produce\ngood surpluses in the\nfuture so that more work\ncan be done to improve\nthem. The money lost\nduring this week, and the\nprofit lost is going into\nother pubs which will\nobviously be deter i mental to the bars themselves. We\nhave large schemes for\nSouthside which we hope\nto do out of the surpluses.\nObviously if we don't make\nthe surpluses we anticipate,\nthese will be curtailed.\nQuite a lot of work has\nalready been started over\nthere.\nF:A lot of people at the\nUGM last Thursday felt that\nbeer was over-priced. You\nhave also been accused of\ntaking \u00a320,000 from the\nbars to support the\nrefectories. How much\nmoney do you feel the bars\nshould make.\nN: Policy decisions over the\nfinancing of the bars and\nrefectories are not down to\nme. They are down to the\nGovernors and the Rector\nand the administration. I obviously have not set the\ntrends. Any surpluses are\nploughed back into student\nfacilities, and I would like\nto see a reasonable surplus\nproduced in the future, so\ntherefore the facilities can\nbe improved and possibly\nbe made into the finest\nones in London.\nF: You mentioned\nSouthside. How would you\nlike to see Southside\nimproved.\nN:I'd like to expand the\nfacilities offer better ranges\nof food, perhaps better\nwines, and then increase\ncomfort. A certain amount\nof work needs doing over\nthere in the near future like\nre flooring. I'd like to see a more entertainment being\nprovided there. There are\nmany more\u2014there's much\nscope to provide better\nfacilities\u2014not purely to\nmake more money,\nbecause as I said I'd like to\nanticipate that all the\nsurpluses are ploughed\nback into student facilities;\nnot into College, which\nnever has been done, so,\nyou know, the scope is\nunending. Obviously the\nstudents will tell us in time\nwhat they would like us to\ndo, and that's what we're\nhere to do; provide a service for all the students.\nF: Have you spoken to IC\nPresident, Carl Burgess\nabout this recently?\nN: All the improvements\nhave gone through the Bar\nCommittee and the Bar\nCommittee Chairman, like\nall major policy decisions.\nF: How do you feel about\nMr Burgess' conduct. Have\nyou any comments on the\nway Mr Burgess is leading\nthe students...\n(silence)\nN:... Oh as far as Bar\nCommittees, the Vice\nPresident is the Chairman\nof our Committee, but Mr\nBurgess has acted very\nwell, and he has ensured\nthat the protest has been\ncarried off peacefully, and\nacted under his members'\nwishes.\nF: Would you oppose any\nmovement for the Union to\ntake over the bar?\nN: That is not a decision\nthat I would make; that is\nan administration decision.\nI 've been employed to run\nthe Union bar; if the\nadministration wishes to\nhand it over to the\nstudents, then it's up to\nthem.\nF: How have you and your\nstaff reacted to the\nsituation in particular a lot\nof abuse seems to have\nbeen hurled in your\ndirection.\nN:I think most of the abuse\nis not a cut u ally meant\u2014the\nmajority of the people\nmean it in a non-malicious\nway, although there are\none or two people who\nperhaps mean it in a malicious way, and\nbasically we take it in the\nspirit that very often it's meant.\nF: You said here..you said\nthat if you didn't improve\nthe situation in eighteen\nmonths you'd leave. Is\nthere any temptation to\nleave, given all the stick\nyou're having over the\ncurrent situ tion? N:l was warned about it\nbefore I came, so therefore\nthe general trend is acting\ntrue to form.\nF: One of the rumours\ngoing around about you is\nthat a near relative of yours\nis about to be appointed\nUnion Bar manager. Would\nyour like to comment on\nthis?\nN: Not a hope: I wouldn't employ a relative.\nF: Another accusation\nthat's going round is that-l think we must have a person a day dropping in at\nthe FELIX Office to ask us\nthis ques iona different\nperson a day to tell us this\nexclusive story-is that \u00a3200\nwas borrowed from petty\ncash. Have you got any\ncomment on this story?\nWithout a receipt.\nN:A load of cods wallop. F: Going on to the bar\nprices increases. Why were\nthe increases put on, and\ndo you feel that they are\ntoo large?\nN: We're only following the\nagreements with the Union\nin February 1984. Infact the\nmargins are slightly less\nthan was proposed by the\nUnion at that stage. Some\nof the drinks have actually\ngone down since then,\ndespite two budget\nincreases. For instance, a pint of Blackthorn,is now\n62p and it was proposed to\nbe 62p in February '84.\nPrior to February '84 it was\n66 pence a pint. Fosters'\nwhich was 72p prior to the\nagreement, is now 66p and\nit was 62p on the proposed\nscheme, meaning that in\nfact it hasn't increased in\ncost apart from the budget\nincreases. Guinness has\nrisen, due to the cost of it,\nbut in two years its gone\nfrom 66p to 74p, but prior\nto the agreement it was\n69p. Anymore?\nF: Is Roger Pownell going\nto be the new sort of 'super\nbar manager' for the whole\ncollege.\nN: Super bar mangers have\nbeen talked about for many\nyears here, no decision has\nbeen reached at this time.\nWhether Imperial College\nhas a bar manager over all\ntheir bars will depend upon\nthe outcome of\nnegotiations with the Union\nand many other areas.\nF: Finally yourself, how do\nyou feel you've performed\nover the first 6 months.\nN:I said it would take 2\nyears to decide that.\nF: Thank you.\nc \u20221\nA FELIX Friday 11 October\n\n"

    "content": "V Guilds\nLast Saturday was a great\nday for Guilds; over 150\npeople turned up to tid d ly wink for Rag. The\nenthusiasm and energy that\neveryone put in resulted in\nus raising more money\nthan ever before and being\nthe top C CU. Thank you\nfor everyone who helped.\nMy only slight regret is\nrealizing how many\nGuildsmen and women who\nwanted to come and would\nhave loved it, couldn't quite\nmake the effort to get out\nof bed. Don't worry, there\nwill be plenty of other\nopportunity to contribute.\nThe next big event is\nMonopoly Rag on Saturday\n19 October. When we play\nmonopoly in London and\nactually visit Old kent Road\nand Angel Islington, and\neverywhere else, though we\nhope that 'Go directly to\nJail' will not feature in our\npart u cula r version. Rag is a good opportunity to do\nsomething for people\noutside the College who\nneed help whilst having fun\nourselves and giving the\npublic something to\nbrighten up their day.\nThe pub crawl on the\nSaturday night also went\nvery well. A number of\nguests from RSMU and\nRCSU joined in along with\ntwo girls from an American\nCollege consisting of 80%\nfemale. They had a lot of\nnice things to say about the\nway they had been looked\nafter and want to bring\ntheir friends to the next\nGuilds events. This only\nproves that a successful,\nfun night out without\neveryone having to vomit,\nto prove what a good\ndrinkers they are, results in\na much more social\nenvironment that attracts\nothers both in and outside\nGuilds.\nIn the mean time we look\nforward to seeing you all,\nwith members of staff, at\nyour departmental dinners,\nwhich shouldn't be missed\nby anyone, undergraduates\nand post graduates alike.\nQT\nOur political correspond ant writes after the fiascos of\nthe SDP and Labour party\nconferences it was a welcome relief last night to\nbe present at the big\none\u2014the QT conference\nheld in the prestigious\nUnion Lounge (apparently\nwanted very badly by\nanother group, but they\nhad to settle for the Winter\nGardens, Blackpool).\nIn the jovial atmosphere\nof the conference hall the\nspeeches were kept short\nand decisive, mainly due to\nthe quant y of Jelly and\nCustard present.\nThe policies decided\nupon, and referred to the\nNational Executive, should\nensure that QT builds on\nlast year's success and\nbecomes a powerful force\nin..in whatever it's supposed to be a powerful\nforce in.\nThe shock decision to\nannounce a candidate for\nICU President come as\nquite a surprise. Normal\npolicy dictates an\nannouncement in the\nSpring term, but the grassroots membership of QT,\nthe rank and file, felt that\ntheir man would benefit\nfrom prolonged publicity\nthroughout the year. An\namendment to the motion\nwhich was subsequently\npassed, ensured that for\nsecurity reasons the name\nof the candidate would be\nwithheld from the press.\nThis constant fear of\npolitical assassination\ncould possibly harm QT's chances of forming the\nmajority party at the next\nelection.\nThe conference was\nbrought to its feet when\nsomebody removed the\nchairs during the rousing\nclosing speech by the Party\nLeader: 'And I tell you\nbrothers and sisters, that as\nthe democratically elected\nleader of their society, I have been given a clear\nmandate by the majority of\nmy members to wish you a very good night!'.\nSo the conference\nseason ends for another\nyear with QT promoted to\nthe first division, hopefully\nqualifying for Europe next\nyear.\nOrienteering\nImperial college\nOrienteering Club had a tremendous start to the\nseason, dominating the\nGLC championships, the\nladies tipped the men with\na win in W19 by Nora\nTanner, and a third in W21\nby Sally McLean. Best\nplaced of the men were\nTom Foster and Andy\nShoreman second and third\nin M19.\nClub meetings are in\nSouthside Bar Thursday\nevenings and Fridays 12.30\nin the Union Upper\nLounge.\nTHE NORFOLK\nAVENGER SAYS..\n...REAL ALE JN\nTHE TAVERN...\nHI CITIZENS, THIS\nIS YOUR GREEN\nCROSS CODE IF\nYOU DON'T CHECK\nTHIS PLACE OUT,\nM GONNA GO\nGREEN, AND I'M GONNA GET CROSS\nSTOP!\nLOOK!!\nLISTEN!!!\nFlowers\n80p Friday 11 October FELIX\n\n"

Best know for The Goon\nShow and his television series Potty Time, Mr\nBentine displayed a broad knowledge of science\nand a great appreciation of the creative abilities\nof the human brain.\nThe central theme of Mr\nBentine's talk was that the\nmind must be allowed to be\ncreative in order to\nadvanced the frontiers of\nknowledge. He said that it\nwas too easy to allow one's imagination and creativity\nto be shifted by\nrational is ion. Men who had\nmade great advancements\nin sc:\nen ce, he said, had\nbeen able to raise their\nlevel of thinking to the\nsupra-conscious' and so\nfind the inspiration to make\n'Quantum leap'\nadvancements. He\ncompared this mode of\nthought to that of a child\nwhere imagination was not\nhindered by the\naccumulation of 'rational'\nknowledge.\nMr Bentine also\ndiscussed what factors\ninfluenced the state of\nmind and the ability to\nthink imaginatively. Herzian\nfrequencies, such as in\npieces of music, he said,\ncould be both helpful and\ndetrimental to creative\nthought. He cited the\nsinister example of the\nNuremberg Rally as a core\nof a 'creative destructive\nforce' which had\nmanipulated people to hate.\nMr Bentine said that very\nlittle was known about the\nworkings of the human\nmind, and spoke of his\nexperiences of the\nparanormal (or, as the\nstressed, the 'normal'). In a similar way, few people\nappreciated the full extent\nof their imaginative powers,\nhe conducted by\nencouraging his listeners to\npursue a creative course\nthroughout their careers; to\n'dream the impossible\ndream'.\nThe talk was followed by\na raffle of which raised\n\u00a3143 for Save the Children.\nMr Bentine was thanked by\nProfessor Eric Laithwaite\nand Wellsoc committee\nmember Michael Newman.\nImperial College students raised around \u00a33000 for\nchildren's charities when they took part In the traditional\nTlddlywlnklng Rag event on Saturday.\nGuilds raised \u00a31385 and were the most successful of the\nCCU teams.

    "content": "Whose Bar is\nit Anyway?\nCollege Secretary John Smith\nhas agreed to discuss plans for\nthe Union to take control of the\nUnion Bar, following a meeting\nwith Union President Carl\nBurgess on Monday. Mr Smith\nand Mr Burgess will each be\ninvestigating the feasibility of a takeover and will report to\nHouse Committee on November\n6.\nFeelings have been running\nhigh all week as a result of the\nseven day bar boycott which\nwas imposed at the last U GM. Mr Smith commented to FELIX\nthat the issue had become\nrather im motive. Conflicting\nstories have been circulating\nabout the prospects of the\nUnion Bar coming under the\nUnion's control. On Monday\nevening Mr Burgess was\nconfident that the Union would\nsoon be taking over the bar.By\nTuesday afternoon he was more\ncautious and was only prepared\nto say that plans were 'in hand'.\nMr Burgess told FELIX that\nthe boycott was not intended as\na move to bring the bar under\nUnion control. The boycott, he\nsaid, was simply a demonstration of dissatisfaction\nwith the way the bars were\nbeing run by refectory manager\nRob Northey. Mr Burgess\nstressed that he had made this\npoint clear to Mr Smith.\nMr Smith wrote a letter to Mr\nBurgess on Tuesday outlining\nthe position for possible\nnegotiations. He told FELIX on\nFriday that the control of the\nUnion Bar should be discussed\nin a 'wider context', and that\nthere was a considerable\namount of preliminary work to\nbe done. He said that there\nwere several matters of\nsignificance which had been\n'left unresolved' and referred to\nhis discussions with last year's Union Executive about the\ncontrol of rooms in the Union\nBuilding. He denied that the\nUnion would necessarily face a substantial cut in its sub vent ion from College if control of the\nbar was transferred. He added,\nhowever, that matters such as\nthe maintenance and upkeep of\nthe Union building would also\nenter into any discussions of\nplans for the whole of the Union\nBuilding. He said that he was\nkeen to clear up the very vague\nposition of who had control of\nthe building. He was particularly\nThe Union Bar on Wednesday\nkeen to see that better use was\nmade of some rooms, such as\nthe kitchens behind the Union\nLounge.\nMr Burgess was also keen to\npoint out that there was a large\namount of investigation work to\nbe done before proposals could\nbe submitted. He said that he\nwould like to see the whole of\nthe north side of the Union\nBuilding under Union control.\nThe bar boycott appears to\nhave been very succesful with\nonly a very small number of\nstudents choosing to drink in\nCollege bars. Southside bar has\nhad no more than twenty\ncustomers on any evening, most\nof whom have been non-students or workmen. The\nUnion bar was entirely empty\nfor most of Wednesday night,\nusually one of the busiest\nevenings of the week. Refectory\nmanger Rob Northey and\nSouthside Bar manager Roger\nPownell both complimented\nCarl Burgess and the students\non a very effective boycott. Mr\nBurgess said that there was no\nneed for further action after the\nend of the week, as the students\nhad successfully made their\nfeelings known.\nSouthside Shuffle\nSouthside residents are\ncomplaining about\nmodifications to the kitchen\nfacilities. Work is already in\nprogress to convert one\nbedroom on each staircase into\na kitchen, and the present\nkitchen and laundry room on\nthe gallery level of each hall\ninto bedrooms.\nThe current plan is opposed\nby both the Tizard and Selkirk\nHall Committees; at present\nboth are made up entirely of\nsecond and third year re-apps.\nThey feel that the changes\nwould 'considerably\ninconvenience' students with\nbedrooms on the gallery level,\nwho would have to put up with\nnoise from the frequent social\ngatherings there. The\ncommittees feel also that\nstaircase kitchens would prove\n'smelly' and 'noisy' serving only\nto shift the social focus away\nfrom the gallery and into the\nstaircase. Furthermore\ndisruption would be caused by\nthe construction work involved.\nAn alternative has been\nsuggested by the Selkirk\ncommittee. This is to expand\nthe existing kitchen facilities,\nreplacing the lockers and tables\nwith extra cookers. The lockers\nand tables would be placed in\nthe now ex-laundry room, along\nwith the staircase fridges. It is\nintended by the committee that\nthe drying room in the ex-laundry be retained, and they\nwill be pressing for the central\nlaundry to be expanded.\nIC Union and the Student\nResidence Committee are in\nfavour of staircase kitchens. J Martin Taylor, one of last year's student representatives on the\nSRC pointed out that the\nproblems were discussed by the\nSRC in May and it was decided\nthat the advantages of the\nproposals now being\nimp li men ted out weighted any\ndisadvantages.\nFree!

While\nI must agree with your\ncritic that any film with the\nstar of Tess in it is worth\ngoing to see, I must point\nout that the young lady's name is Nastassja Kinski\nand not Natasha, Nastassia\nor any other such similar\napproximation, I can assure\nyou that I have this\ninformation on the very\nbest possible authority!\nYours etc\nPA Fernandex\nPhysics 3\nRowing Retail\nDear Sir,\nWith regard to the article\nentitled 'Boat Bonanza' in\nthe Frshers edition, I noticed an error of some\nfive thousand pounds, the\narticle stated that the ne\neight for the Boat Club\nwould cost the union abou i eight thousand pounds. In\nfact, after the Boat Club\nwon the Visitors' Challenge\nCup at Henley Royal\nRegatta, an event open to\nany academic institution in\nthe world, produced the\nfastest novice eight in the\ncountry, and finished the\nseason with a record fifty\nvictories (three times that\nof any other university or\ncollege boat club), College\noffered to buy a much\nneeded eight in\nconjunction with the Union.\nThe sum paid by the Union\nwas three thousand\n^nds, not eight, and\ncollege settled the rest of\nme five and a half thousand\npound bill.\nHaving set the record\nstraight, I would like to add\nthat this year Imperial\nCollege's reputation in the\nrowing world has attracted\nthe sort of oarsmen which\ncould make the club the\nmost sucessful rowing club\nin the Country. This would\nnot be possible without this\nnew eight, which we at the\nBoat Club are very grateful\nfor.\nYours faithfully\nGuy Pooley\nCaptain IC Rowing Club\nA3 fa Ed it aria Union Bar\nFirstly let me congratulate\nCarl Burgess on apparently\ngetting College in a position where they are\nprepared to ne go it i ate about giving students\ncontrol of The Union Bar.\nOne has to ask, though,\nwhether this is the time for\nthe Union to take control of\nthe bar. Apparently the\nUnion are being offered the\nbar in exchange for the\nLounge. The Lounge is\nargue ably the best venue\nfor parties in College. The\nonly problem with it is that\nit is rather small. In\naddition the Union has\nbeen arguing for years that\nthe north side of Beit\nshould be Union controlled.\nTo give up part of the north\nside would be a bad\nmistakes. The Life Sciences\nDivision has been keen to\ntake over parts of the\nUnion for years. If they\nwere given the Lounge they\nwould try to claim other\nparts of the Union.\nIf College eventually offer\nthe Union the Union Bar\nwithout any conditions\nattached, it must think\ncarefully before deciding to\nrun the Bar. Nobody in the\nUnion has given much\nthought to how the Union\nwould then manage its\ntrading outlets. The Union\nwould almost certainly\nneed a full time Trading\nManager. This would cost\nthe Union \u00a310,000 a year.\nThis would be in addition\nto a Bar Manager and a Catering Manager. The\nmanagement structure\nwould need to be changed\nin other ways. Basically we\nwould have to become\nmore professional. The\nUnion is capable of running\na bar. It just needs to think\nabout it how it should run\nthe Bar.\nStudent and Graduate\nFinancial Planning Division\nThis company are\nwandering around the\nplace trying to rip you off\nselling you cowboy\ninsurance policies.

For competitive\ncom parisi on, I concede, a necessary evil, but for the\ncommuter keeping up with\nthe age of the track-suit\nand Sony Walkman,\nrequiring of his trusty\nve loci pe de a modicum of\nspeed and safety keeping\nhim and his baggage dry\nand warm, not so good.\nProgress, desert us not in\nour time of need! Beware,\noh stalwart Bike, your days\nare numbered for, lo, the\nadvent of the Human\npowered Veicle (HPV) is\nnigh!\nHPV? Almost anything\nwith a MacDonald's fueled\nengine, in the air, on land\nand water, but which\nendeavours to use modern\ntechniques and\nunderstanding to the\nmachines utmost\nadvantage, on land such\nvehicles capital is e on vastly\nsuperior aerodynamics; first\nplace your\nrider/pilot/engine/mug so\nas to present the minimal\nfrontal area, usually well\nreclined or occasionally flat\non his chest (recumbent or\nprone to the\njargon mongering co gnis centi), then mix in\npainfully coloured fairing to\ntaste, et voila\u2014HPV.\nWe have one such loyal\ni steed\u2014the Windcheetah. I had best rattle off a brief\nspec':-Windcheetah MklllA s1; Recumbent tricycle, two\n\" front wheels, main\nbreaking power in paired\nhub-breaks; low -slung\nbucket seat and joystick\ncontrol, chain-rings and\ncranks out front; 24 \" rear\ndriven wheel with 46 \" to\n120 \" gearing.\nI might say that the\nabove is by no means the\nundisputed, ideal solution\nand that diversity seems to\nbe the designers prevailing\nwatch-word. To site a few\nclassics:-Recumbent b icy les \u2014the\nBean and Bluebell, the\nlatter and recent world\nrecord holder at about 56\nmph; variants on our own\ntheme, notably, the aquiline\nVector and its\ndo pp leg angers; Jouta's powered front wheel and\nsteered rear wheels which\nlean the rider into the\ncorners; recumbent,\ntandem tricycles, the\nsleekest exponent of three\nbeing Dark Horse\u2014the\nvariants are practically\nlimitless.\nC&G HPV club, itself, is\njust in its formative stages\nhaving only recently sprung\nfrom the might ly loins of\nthe Oddysian charity\nventure Pedal GB '83,\nwherein our Herculean\nadventurers pedaled the\nWindcheetah around the\n3,675 miles of the entire\nBritish cost line in 10 and a half days amassing \u00a34,600\nfor the RNLI. In those\nheady days the\nWindcheetah inhabited a less than graceful, Kevlar\nbodyshell carrying the\nuninspiring handle of the\n'Animated Bathtub', so\nchristened in\nacknowledgement of its,\nfrankly ungainly\ncountenance, still it did the\njob; countless inquisitive\ncoppers stopped us to be\nstruck dumb by its total\nlack of an engine and its\nquite a sight to see it\npulling away from a Transit\ndoing 65.\nAfter this, in a bid to\nnurture the s app ling club,\nwe affiliated to the British\nHuman Powered Club\n(BHPC). This\nagglomeration of backstreet b of fins and budding\nenthusiasts sets out to foist\nthe word of the human\npowered activist (well aren't we all) on the\nunenlightened ear of Joe H Public, to seek out\nem pathi c sponsors and to\nunite other like-minded\nvisionaries of human power\nin all the disciplines. They\nalso organise comp etat ive events which we frequently\nattend, the most recent of\nthese being the Festival of\nHuman Power at Milton\nKeynes. This gathering of\nthe clans had a distinctly\ninternational flavour\nboasting nearly 200\nentrants and we\nmaterialise d sporting our\nnew, vicious violet\nbodyshell. In predictably\nlousy weather, on an uphill\nsprint section, we clocked\nan awesome 39.2mph, a meager 4mph be in d Bluebell, auge ring well for\na top speed of around\n50mph on the flat with less\nh arras s ment from the\nelements. Thus we, up until\nnow a self-confessed joke\nteam in our 'Whale', now\nhave a well deserved\nrespect on the circuit,\nespecially since our team\nis, at present, cons pi cio usl yuna the let ic.A similarly\nome nous result was\nachieved in the open circuit\nrace.\nOne further product of\nthis prestigious oc as sion is\nthat we have, apparently,\nbeen presented with the\nchance to diversify into the\nwater, having been given\nthe hull, propeller, drive\nsy tem and foil moulds to\nmake our own tandem\nhydrofoil. Anyone willing to\nstick these together will\nhave the undoubted\npleasure of burning off\nboat club at a least 15\nknots.\nAfter this potted and\ncontest ably over-florid\nintroduction to our history\nand achievements, which I hope has caught your\nmental eye, now down to\nthe heavy stuff.\nSo far our club has e eked out its existence upon the\nbroad and bounteous back\nof our best of burden, the\nWindcheetah. As I pointed\nout previously, in HPV\nperformance the name of\nthe game is frontal area,\nalthough mass is also a weighty factor; in both\nrespects the Windcheetah\nis cramping ly restrictive.\nBody shell design is\n.ultimately limited by the\ndictates of the vehicle\nbeneath it, and our present\none has possibly the\nlargest frontal area on the\ncircuit (although its drag,\nas rated by performance ,\nis comparatively low). The\nwhole contraption,\nincluding the bodyshell,\nweighs a crippling 70lbs, at\nleast, of which the\nbodyshell's own support\nframe contributes a wasteful 15lbs. To progress\nwe must build a new\nmachine and, to this end,\nfour undergraduate\nresearch projects have\nbeen proposed, lias ed together, to engineer a new\nmachine.\nThe bones of the new\nHPV have already been\nsketch i ly mapped out\nthrough practical and\ncomp etat ive experience, as\nwell as some theory, giving\nan elegant and novel\napproach to the problem of\nHPV design. It will be a tricycle of the same\nconfiguration as the\nWindcheetah but that is\nwhere all parity ends.\nFirsly, the new design uses\nentirely full size wheels and\nhigh pressure tyres. The\nelongated, tear drop\nshaped na celle of the rider\ncompartment is elevated at\nleast a foot off the ground\nto avoid wasting the limited\npower for forward motion\non ground effects and has\nthe rider as recumbent as\npossible. It will be made as\na fiber-glass honeycomb\ns and which monocoque\nwhich , coupled with the\nthe aero foil section fin\nhousing trhe rear wheel\n(the fin doubling as aT girder at the weakest point\nin the riders pallet, under\nhis bottom.) , provides the\nstructural rigidity of the\nvehicle. The steered front\nwheels are housed\noutboard in their own\nna celles, at the end of\n'wings', to keep the frontal\narea as low as possible.\nThe projects split up as\nfollows:-1) Determine the lowest\nfrontal area rider orient a ion with most efficient muscle\nuse; design seat to avoid\nback injury, for maximum\nadjust ability( club members\ncome in many marvellous\nshapes and sizes) and for\neasy access to chain and\ngearing beneath it.\n2) Design the\n4 Friday 11 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Brixton\nOver the past months, street riots have become a frequent occur en ce in this country. But few people\nhave yet to be caught in one. For those uninitiated,\nAndrew Vickers describes the scene in Brixton two\nweeks ago.\nPicture the scene\u2014a fourth\nyear classroom, the teacher\nstanding behind a desk,\nfrantically calling for the\nreturn of order to the\ncrowd of unruly school\nchildren. Picture the\nproblems she has been\nfaced with, the child who\ntook offence at being\nticked off for not doing his\nhomework, the friends who\nsupport their classmate by\nyelling at their tutor and\nthen the rest of the kids\nwho can sense the\ningredients of disorder\nbeing poured into the\nmelting pot. Picture the\nlout who lights the fire by\nflicking the first elastic\nband and watch the whole\nmess erupt in a frenzied\nboil\u2014a riot.\nRemember school riots?\nRemember the\napprehensive ex c it ment you felt as everyone around\nyou was pushing a normally well ordered\nenvironment into chaos?\n(Of course you didn't participate). Weren't these\nevents part of the spice of\nschool life? Part of your\nEducation and a warning\nfor your future?\nNow expand the\nscenario. As a venue, take\nthe streets, replace the\nteacher with an even more\nauthoritarian body\u2014the Old\nBill. The aggrieved school\nchild becomes an enraged\nmember of the community.\nThe friends are her friends\nand relatives, and the rest\nof the class becomes the\nrest of the community.\nThrow in a Smith and\nWesson 38 revolver and\nwhat have your got? You\nguessed it\u2014a riot\u2014 but\nnow you're in Brixton and\nin grave danger.\nYou've heard it on the\nradio, you've seen it on\ntelevision, you might even\nhave read it in the\nnewspapers, but for most\nLondoners Brixton and the\ndisturbances of the 28th September are unreal. They\ndid not experience it\nthemselves. And they do\nnot know what it was really\nlike to be caught in the\nworst example of violence\non the streets of London\nsince April 1981.\nFour friends and I had\nplanned to meet at Brixton\ntube station at 6.30 that\nevening before venturing\ninto the glittering streets of\nStreatham for a night of\nfun. Imagine the shock the\ntwo of us felt as we walked\nright into the\nmugging\u2014eight West\nIndian men were attacking\nan Asian shopkeeper. After\nseveral rowdy seconds of\nintimidation they hurried\naway, leaving their victims\nclothes tattered and blood\nstained. He was lucky, he\nwas not seriously hurt. Still\nreeling from this encounter,\nwe walked on to Brixton\nRoad to see a squad of riot\npolice keeping their\ndistance from a raging\ncrowd. The main road was\nteeming with people trying\nto see what was happening.\nI caught a glimpse of a half\nbrick streaking though the\nair before spotting Steve,\none of my other friends,\noutside the tube station.\nas we waik eat nei u u yar as stretch, 2 or of about 10\nwhite faces amongst\nhundreds of black ones, we\nfelt fear in every step, the\ntrick was to look\nunconcerned and\npurposeful. One damning\nstare, one wrong word or\nsimply just the look of fear\ncould make the next gang\nset upon us. It took three\nmini tue s to cover the\ndistance and in that the\ntime we saw shops looted,\npetrol bombs thrown, and\none man stabbed.\nOur next encounter was\nRailton Road, the 'frontline'\nof the '81 riots, now flowing\nwith escaping looters\neager to get home with the\nspoils of their rampage.\nAfter minutes of nervous\ndebate, we decided to head\nfor Coldharbour Lane and\nlikely trouble spots rather\nthan delay our return to the\nflat and refuge. There we\nwitnessed more arson. Half\nway down this road we had\nOnce inside the foyer, we\nheard that all incoming\ntrains were terminating at\nStockwell. Steve left us to\ntry and find his girlfriend\nthere and the doors were\nlocked to the keep the\nlooters out. The\napprehension in this place\nwas almost physical. How\nsafe were we? How safe\nwas our flat-mate? She had\nstayed behind and was all\non her own in the flat.We\n'phoned her to say we\nwould try to get back.\nThere is a stretch of\nBrixton Road between the\ntube station and the Town\nHall that is normally alive\nwith shoppers and people\nenjoying the sunny, friendly\nat mop here. That evening,\nto stop as countless West\nIndians ran across the road\n, pulled down a metal grille,\nsmashed a window and\nmade off with entire\ncontents of an electrical\nshop before a van load of\nriot police drove around the\ncorner. A corner on which\na furniture shop and four\nflats stood. Hours later that\ncorner was a smouldering\nheap of rubble.\nBarrington Road meant\nrelative safety, entering our\nflat was a blessed relief.\nThe same relief was felt\nby my other flat mate. He\ngot off the tube at\nStockwell station and\nwalked straight into the\nbattle. He then took great\ncare to avoid anymore\ntrouble by walking to our\nflat via Streatham, Tulse\nHill and Heme Hill. He\neventually arrived at\nLoughborough Junction to\nfind riot police on one side\nof him and the mob on the\nother, Legging if came\nvery easily to him as the\npetrol bombs started to fall.\nIn the tenth floor\nsanctuary that is number 49\nwe were able to look on the\ndisaster strewn streets of\nBrixton in stunned\ndisbelief, a disbelief\neclipsed by the horrifying\nreality of what we had\nseen.\nft\nill What drives the minds of\nthe people involved in the\nunrepentant criminality that\nwas evident that night, and\nto a lesser degree on the\nfollowing nights? Who\ncaused it? Michael Grooce,\nInspector Douglas\nLovecock, the Do Gooders\nof the local community, the\nwhole community, Margaret\nThatcher or the\ncommunists. And why the\nhell do store keepers and\ninnocent bystanders need\nto suffer for the mistakes\nand failings of people with\nwhom they have no\nconcern?\nLet us see Brixton as a thriving inner city area\nonce again and soon!\nPS Poor old Ernie Harris has\nhad several offers of a new\npiano to replace the one\nburnt in his gutted flat.\nFELIX Friday 11 October 7\n\n"
