The Preto phat of office fo cross between Archie surveys the Union. Me\n\" Till any geologists ne says. The House\nsolitary man rises, ai.a and smiles.\" I he says. J in Anderson comes from Tyneside, where\nmen are footballers and where every married woman is the centre of a loyal family. The\ncountry near his home is strong and inhospitable, and t ne people make up for it by being the most\nfriendly and patriotic in the world. Anyone\nwho has seen the extraordinarily personal way\nin which Newcastle worships its football team\nwill understand Jim Anderson' s attitude to football. He is I.C. Soccer Captain, and he\nwould rather die than fail to turn up for a game, or be unsportsmanlike. Tyneside lingers in his speech, though the seductive ease of the Southern tongue has\nmade its mark on him. Nevertheless, it is related that, on his visit to Finland for the\nOlympic Games (and $ ox some vacation work on a timber camp), he was once regaling a crowd of Finnish students with\" Blay don Races\" when a Londoner, recognising the tune, asked his Finnish interpreter to ask Jim what the words\nmeant in English. Jim Anderson is very modest: he once\ntook three days to hitchhike from Newcastle to Edinburgh, because he was too shy to stop any cars. He is not without academic talent; he is a poet graduate in Spectroscopy, having i obtained a second in Physics. For most of last year he was Sports Editor of FELIX, It, was an a tter of pride with him that he_ should that he should always fill his page, and\nreaders may remember the fragment of a sonnet which he once wrote to fill the last inch of; a column.\n'dim tastes are catholic\", Kenton and\nSchubert, Housman and Wordsworth ( Watt A. not William), Tan Gogh and Rembrandt, Card us and\nShakespeare( selections) being among his heroes. Jackie Milburn can also raise a sigh of ecstasy from him.\nWhenever the chance arises Jim Anderson likes to wander over Europe. Such an event happened last year, when he went on the I.C.A. F.C tour to Germany. His cast iron constitution withstood the rig ours of soccer played on cinder shock, lager, and a team of not always sober companions. Perhaps his most noteworthy characteristic is his ability to mix with people. Few\npeople in I.e. are so widely known. One's natural reaction, on seeing him, is not to think\" This is Mr. Anderson, who holds the exalted, position of President of R.C.S.\", but rather \"Here is Jim Anderson, who will be\nfriendly if I speak to him.\" In the Council Room, or \" g annina long the Scotswood Road\", he\nis the same; no airs, not much polish, but capable, reliable, and imperturbable. Are you com to the\nIC! Saturday21 st November8 GO-i130 FIREBREAKS OUT*\nBonfire night this year saw I.C. breaking off into two main groups: one supporting the\nofficial Hop a tH arlington and the other going \u2022\noff with a portable bonfire to another destination. H arlington was ready to receive the five double decker loads with a fully decorated hall, fireworks thrown by local kids and a very loud loudspeaker playing music. Manya r rive d by cars, motorcycles and bus, making a crowd of300 plus. Just as the crowd inside was getting to be too much, the bonfire was\nannounced and started. It had the I. C.W. A.<5 Guy on top and our ned merrily for along time, while the crowd gathered round it, threw and\ndodged fireworks. Then the fireworks display began just as the fog started to come down.\n''It might be fog now,\" said someone, \"but by\nthe time we leave it' ll be smog.\" The display was extremely good, entertained and suffocated the crowd and gave many a free hair singe. Then ba ok to the pavilion for more dancing, drinks and coffee. Why the music should have been turned on full blast in the other room beat me. It made speech quite impossible there, leaving the drinkers speechless. Thank\ngoodness it wasn't the same in the bar Itself. Many b angers went off on the floor, some of them being thrown in by the people outside. At one stage a battle of rockets raged between two rival groups, but it was soon abandoned as\ntoo wasteful and too dangerous. were to start coming back at10.30, Out took along time to fill up. The transport this year was fully adequate, though we shudder to think what would have happened if the other rag had been cancelled. The Other Half \u2022\nThe celebrations at I.C. began at mid-day with the\nconclusion of the rag meeting. Members of the R.C.S Inter planetary society invaded the tennis courts in full regalia\nand with full equipment to leave this world - in one way or\nanother. After several small rockets had been sent up to\nwarn the moon of its intended arrival, a large rocket was\nset off. Unfortunately (or fortunately for the moon) there\nwas a difference of opinion inside the rocket as to which\nway it was going with the result that flaming missiles came\nout in all directions.\nDue to the poor organisation of the rag oo i mitte e, about.\n100 of I.C. gathered at Bedford College, which had been\nchosen,by the rag committee, as worthy of attention. But the\nrag committee altered its mind at the last minute and went\nto Q. B.C. About 300 had gathered outside Mines and set out\nvia Kensington High Street. Their progress was marked by\nnumerous explosions and by a rain of flour bags from one of\nthe buses carrying the ' good boys' to Harlington.\nIn the High Street the mobile bon-fire took light and\nthe procession continued under a pall of smoke. By the time\nQ.E. C. was reached, the fire was burring merrily and it was\ntaken to the front entrance to the accompaniment of minor\nand major explosions. After having left notice of the visit, the fire was pulled back to the gates where the arrival of'\nthe police discouraged further efforts, and the fire came\nto a stop at the gates.\nAfter some diversion had been created inside Q.E. C and\nwhich resulted in the gates being closed on the gentlemen in blue, the fixe restarted its travels. But not for long. With\na oar reversing furiously out of the way of the approaching\nfire and with the polio e released, the truck chose to run\ninto the ker b. The police 'arrested' the truck, and prevented\nfurther motion by tying it to a lamp-post. After a few more\nskirmishes it was decided to join forces with the rest of the\nuniversity.\nProgress to High Street (Ken.) was delayed by having to\npay some attention to a fire engine that had come along to\nenjoy the I.C. fire i Whereas I.C. Union provided free trans poT to Harlington, London Transport provided free transport i to Charing Cross where difficulty was found in getting the\ntrain to restart. This c cuL d not possibly have been due to\nI.C. because by this time the crowd were on their way out of\nthe station - over the top of the railings./ By this time the numbers had grown and about 400 were\nin the procession which marched up Villiers Street and on to\nTrafalgar Square. Due to the activities of certain minor\ncolleges of the university, the police already had a: \u2022\nre caption committee - and I.C. marched straight into it.,\nThe activities of the gentlemen in blue resulted in a scattering of the I.C. forces which reformed in two main\ngroups. One waged battle from Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly and back and ended with a chase underground at Piccadilly Station. The other group closed the gates at the bottom of\nThe Kai l and then marched around Trafalgar Square until about\n300 were in the march and then set - out for Leicester Square\nAfter a very noisy passage through Cockspur Street a bus load\nof police arrived. I.C. declined the offer of the police to\nhelp with the procession and dispersed.\nSeveral members of I.C. continued with the celebrations\nby joining in the fun at Bow Street next morning. Here\nBritish justice was done in all its fairness by dealing with\n50 of the 183 charges in45 minutes - 0.9 minutes per charge.\n\n"

Many members of the winning teams of last year are still shooting with us, and the\" A\" Six and \"A\" E ign t areas strong on paper as before. In1953, however, all the teams got off. to a poor start: it took far too long for most mar.Vsmen to find their form and settle down to consistent good shooting. The early matches produced;. succession of surprising score sheets, in which the consequences of bloomers by the pillars of the team were averted by shoots of unwarranted excellence from the others. It is tempting Providence to hope the se me system will win us the Leagues for a second year, and various stratagems have he en employed to trick the better shots into firing num ler s of car3s under competition. conditions.' It will soon be seen how effective these methods have been, for the first round of the\u2022\nInter Uni v=rs it y League, in which I.C.\"A\" is drawn\nagainst Birmingham University, will be fired off this week.\nU.L.

Powe'r; looks like becoming a regular player at rightwing. The\nresults so far this season( Won 4 - Lost5) are disappointing, especially after last season's record. The trouble seems to be that the side has not yet settled down as a team, and until the players can combine and play together, better results cannot be expected. SPORTING PROFILE\nH. W.

REFRESHMENTS\nThe College XV played well below form in this match, and could only win by the unconvincing margin of a try and a penalty goal to a try. Although conditions were ideal for open play there were few constructive handling movements,\nand most of the tactics were of the opportunistic kio k and rush variety. The absence of Hy kin through injury enforced a rearrangement of the three quarter line iji y hi ch was not a success, and two strong wings received little chance. After a ragged beginning play was taken to Q.M. C.'25 and Pontin began a movement which led to a try by Bell, wide on the left. I.C. failed to establish superiority when they missed a second scoring chance, and, worse still, Q.M. C. were allowed an equal ising try when a loose ball was seized from under the noses of two defenders. The second half was a similarly disorganised struggle. I.C. eventually took the lead through a fine penalty goal by\" Lewis, and hung on to their advantage, with some difficulty, to the end.\nThe forwards worked hard, Brown being outstanding in t ne line out s, but faster backing up and more intent ive covering would have made a huge difference to the course of the game..\ni.e. W,S.C. \"Once again the Womens SportsClub is embarking upon a very ambitious programme,\nfielding teams in Hockey, Netball, Table Tennis, Badminton and Squash during the Winter Season.

These eccentricities having been accomodate d, the Motor Club were quietly confident and\nexpected anything to happen.\nAccordingly an entourage of five tender cars\nand .a mobile workshop arrived at the Guilds early on Sunday morning, in rain wh i oh had obviously set in for the day. Some of the party set to work\ngiving Bo a final polish, whilst the hier achy of the Motor Club tinkered mysteriously with the\ninterior. At last all was ready, Bo was started and with Mike Day at the wheel, aided and abet-. ted by Alan Woolaston, with the Motor dub Pros\n-i deir t,N. P.W. Moore Bsq. and the President of Guild*, Tony Gill in full regalia on board, Bo\nset majestically off for Brighton..\nAll went well until Brixton Hill was reached,\nwhen signs of overheating led to an investigation of the cooling system, which seemed at that\nmoment to be characterised by the complete\nabsence of water. Your correspondent arrived in time to see a blackened hand appear from beneath\nBo and to hear a disembodied vo i eec all for the\nat s Tong est string available. A local inhabitant having been roused from his bed to provide for Bo's thirst, the party proceeded on its way. The\nrest of the outward trip proved un event fiu l, although in spite of the inordinate amount of rain, occasional stops for water were necessary!\nBo'sere w also appeared to be thirsty, though it is doubted whether the flask from which they fort if led themselves contained anything as tame as\nwater!\nThe route was lined all the way with cheering\nero wds, who had turned out, to see Guild's answer\nto the new Pord. At Brighton, where Bo arrived at 1.00pa winning another medal, the tornado had\nswept away most of the spectators. With Mr.\nMoore in the chair, the party had em enjoyable\nlunch in an hotel and Bo was suitably feted. After lunch some of the dryer members of the\nparty ventured forth for the parade. This was\nhowever canceled, a fortunate occur en ce sine* Bo\nhad already decided not; to go on it. The return journey began soon after4.00 pm with Nigel Trotman at the wheel. Bo really got\ninto its stride end it was remarked that it was\ngoing lite a bomb. Unfortunately at Streatham the\nboa b want o*f Bo had de el ded to take the easy\nway hone and refused to respond in its usual way\nto a tickle in the ribe with the starting handle.\nSo Bo finished the journey 'on tow* and the party) \u00abYS&ved back at Guilds at 10.15pm very tired a \u00a3d but in good spirits. Another epic run wee\naver. Buwblcgutii\nSTOP PRESS We are gla fi to announce that the Refectory\nCommittee at their last meeting decided to remove ALL RESTRICTIONS now win force re gar \u00bb|\nding breakfast to nonresidents. It is hoped\ntha* maw will take advantage of this facility. The teo is ion ie to take immediate effect.1 C. UNION MEETING\nThe meeting was held in a crowded and smog-ridden Gym.\nTwo interesting points arose out of the early routine discussion with regard to the books tall; one that the Books tall should buy and sell second-hand books, and also that its premises\nshould be considerably expanded.\nAn official proposal seeking to automatically return ex-members of the Executive to Council was soundly de fe a 'ted, probably because of the\nthought of what was to follow. The last and most controversial item was the\narrangements for Nov. 5th. The usual annual\nappeal was made by the President for all loyal I.C. students to be good children and avoid\ngetting themselves arrested. The official arrangements for H arlington were given out with\ntwo days notice only, which fact was regarded\nwith dissatisfaction by several speakers. The\nannouncement that the official U.L. Rag had\nbeen cancelled by the Police was greeted by a strange calm, due probably to lack of information resulting in a lack of interest.( Our rag committee was not represented at a meeting of\nall rag committees within U.L. held on Nov. 4th.) The situation was left in the unsatisfactory position that things would be different next\nyear, and that discussion would take place with\nample time in hand. We seem to have heard this all before, in fact it happens every year.\nThe general atmosphere of the meeting was\ngood humour ed, although many people insisted on\nanticipating Guy Fawkes' Night; Most speakers\nmanaged to make themselves heard, but were unable\nto see each other through the cloud of smoke.\nOfficials of Council could not be held responsible for the cloud of smoke, but they\ncould be held responsible for the general\ninefficiency of the arrangements.\nThe lack of the usual chairs and the resultant placing of tables half way down the Gym must\nhave resulted in countless lost votes. ROCKET TRIALS AT R.C.S. The R.C.S. Union Meeting last week wa&\nthe noisiest and most successful, in a way,\nfor a long time.\nWhile Hon. Sec. Johnny Sherwood was standing reading the Minutes, a gentleman stood upon\nthe floor and in a voice like Jove indicated that, while Mr. Sherwood was speaking wonderful\nprose and lucid, flashing poetry, it was time\nfor something else. Pulling out a oo who rn, the gentleman (who said his name wa B George,\nbut whether this was Christian, maiden or sur\nwe do not know) blew two sharp blasts, and\ncalled \"Ho, my merry men.\" Immediately there\nburst in from the back of the hall several students carrying a large crown, several feet in diameter and of elliptical section, which\nthey held above Mr. Sherwood's head. Mr. George\nexplained that the crown had been taken at\nconsiderable risk from the Mall by the 29 Club.\nIt now rests among the other trophies. The new Vice President, Mr. Guthrie, took\nhis place among loud, cheering. The second\nreading of a Bill to change the Constitution of\nR.C.S. was then heard, and carried. Only a third of the total R.C.S. vote is now necessary\nfor a presidential election to be legal. Previously, one half was necessary, a total so\nlarge that there has not been a legally elected President in living memory.\nA strangely dressed gentleman then stood\nup, and said that he was a member of the R.C.S. Interplanetary Society, and would like to ask\npermission for one of the members to address\nthe meeting. This was readily given, and\nMr. Lemin, sporting a space-helmet which looked\nrather like a motor cycling hat with a baby T.V aerial on top, spoke.\nMr. Lemin asked the Union for a grant of\nten million pounds in order that re sea roh might\nbe continued inline with the governments of\nthree well known powers. To give point to\nhis argument, Mr. Lemitt demonstrated the R.C.S. Mark I space rocket, which appeared to be haphazard in its direction, for it exploded\nviolently and hit the Vice President. The\nappeal for further funds for re sea roh into direction o on tro l was well received by the\nUnion, and the Hon. Sec. Tress. Dr. Lloyd, was,\n,t?un served to be looking worried.\n\n"

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR30 th October, 1953.\nDear Sir,\nIn the editorial of the last \"FELIX\", you\nrefer to a letter f rota Mr. Baty printed in the\nprevious issue, relating to the arrangements for\nbreakfast in the Refectory, and to a reply from\n\"somebody who Is connected with the running of\nthe Refectory\".\nI was the writer of the reply, and since ths\nChairman of the Catering Sub-Committee, Mr. J. F. Levy, had not returned, to the College at the time,\nl too ul d hardly take the form of an official letter from the Bub-Committee to the Editor of\nFelix. Furthermore, it did not take any of the\nforms suggested in your editorial; it was merely\na statement of facts wh i oh every well-informed\nmember of the Union should know. Publication in Felix would therefore be quite superfluous. It\nsaid that the Refectory Committee consisted of\nrepresentatives of the Staff, I.C. Union and the\nconstituent College Unions, that it was always\nwilling to consider reasonable suggestions, and\nshould Mr. Baty wish to submit such a suggestion\nlt could be considered at the next meeting.\nHad Mr. Baty or you, Sir, been of the opinion\nthat this was worthy of publication In your s columns, it would have been a simple matter to\nhave asked ray permission to do so. In fact, X reo eiv ed no acknowledgment whatsoever, and it Is\ntherefore with some surprise that I observed that\nFells felt that it had been more or less insulted.\nIt ie surely X, and the Catering Sub-Committee who\nshould feel insulted, since your editorial would\nseem merely to be offensive and irresponsible,\nwithout making a genuine effort to resolve this\nutter.

Since the letter to Mr. Baty was not\nan \u2022 official letter from the sub-Committee' we\nfail to see why the sub-Committee should feel\ninsulted.

Regarding the problem itself, we will gladly print any suggestions reo eiv ed. Bd.\nSir,\nLast year, FELIX boasted to be the only\nU. If.

The ma tter of size is, of course, largely one \u2022\nof personal opinion, but, com par it iv ely speak-ing, Herbert is well within the range of mascot\nsises displayed by other colleges, and I do not\nthink that the biggest is necessarily the best.\nAs to his procurement - \"extremely tame\"\nMr. Guthrie says. I am sure he has no idea\nof\" the amount of trouble which both directly\nand indirectly, went into the obtaining of\nHerbert. '\nOn top of all this, he seems to forget\nthat Herbert was unanimously and enthusiastically adopted by the Union last year, as their\nmascot, and so hie remarks are an insult to\nthe Union as -much as to the people who put in so much time and work- on Herbert.\nAs to the other remarks I will only deal\nwith the formation of the Rag Committee.\nThere was great demand for such a body about,\nthis time last year and so it was appointed\nby Council, then under Ron Macfie, from those\nwho gave evidence of being actively interested\n( in the matter.\nYours faithfully,\nRag Committee Chairman.\nBear Sir, ,\nYour correspondent.

Then followed\nthe mag nlf io ent gowns and o aps, moving solemnly\nand graciously.\nparticularly touchy about any t ning purely techno-']\nlogical, the general feeling being tha$ lt does 1\nnot have the makings of a full University (Aoeord-ing to him, tea oh ing modern languages to first year science students is not exactly popular in the teaching circles; in fact, it is rumoured\nthat even the Maths lecturers in Engineering\nfaculties are not completely happy about their\njobs.). So, a new technological University was\nout. After this, the e ho ioe of I.C. was almost\ninevitable. The plans are now almost completely\ndrawn up, and rapid expansion on and near the\nexisting site is due. Dr. Logan then expressed\nhis satisfaction at seeing the oo-Operation\nBoreen Goodway presenting a bouquet to the\n\" visitor's lady.\nAn excellent R.C.M. orchestra and a fan-fare\nwelcomed the guests into the Great Hall. The new\nfellows. Diplomat** and Associates were presented\nla the traditional manner, and then the guest of\nhonour, Dr. B. W. Logan, Prinoipal of the University\nof London, was Introduced.\nDr. Logan\ners l ty reviewed the relations the University over the years.\nof I.C. and\nFor several years\nafter 1907, when I.C. became a Sohool of the\nUniversity, they remained, Dr, Logan, said, strained\nWhen the University migrated to Bloomsbury and we\nwere no longer neighbours, they began to improve,\ntill now they are almost o or dial. One clear sign\nis the fa et that our Reotor is also the TioeChaneellor of the University. Dr. Logan then\ndwelled on the proposed large-scale expansion gt\nI.C. The expansion, with emphasis on the technological side, was decided upon after great deliberation. Ho other technical College in the\"*\"*\ncountry was so well suited and well equipped for\nthat purpose as I.C. To start a completely new\nUniversity devoted exclusively to technology presents many difficulties: the cities have no suitable spaces left; the countryside means going to\ngreat expense in new buildings, starting from\nscratch. Also, a well established institution\nnaturally attracts better talent - both students\nand staff - than aura nu u ew one, however good the\nlatter -night be. Staff, Dr. Logan said, was\nCOM ME MOM TION BALL The Commemoration Ball was held this year at the Royal\nFestival Hall. Only 746 members of I.G. and their friends\nattended, to the disappointment of the \"nter tain ment s Committee)\nwho had estimated the presence of 750. This deficiency of4 resulted in the floor being comfortably full instead of overcrowded. That there were always so many people dancing\nsturt in part be attributed to the excellent music of Geraldos\nath\u00bbs \u00aby orchestra but also to the fantastically high charges\nfor drinks - and the even more fantastic charges for cork age' \u2014 which discouraged people from just sitting and drinking,\n*a# drinking and talking .\n. less expansive diversion\nfrom d soo ing wea eating and enjoying the view over the river \u2022 fT or a\" 'Insiae ( the Festival Hall),\nDr. Logan and C. Kirk patri c, the Student\nOrator, making their speeches.\nbetween I.C. and other London Colleges - L.S.E. in particular concerned mainly with Arts. It is the only method by which the few shortcomings of a scattered University can be overcome, and he hoped\nthat this idea will be pursued fur then. He\nfinished his speech by expressing his good wishes\nfor \"I.C. and promising it full support on behalf\nof the University. Dr. Logan's speech was short,\nclear and-to the point. It was punctuated by\nseveral excellent and appropriate quotations from\nt the Classics, on which he is an authority.\nThe Rector, Sir Roderio Hill, thanked\nDr. Logan for coming h tre and giving Us an\n\u2022excellent address. He also thanked the Heads\nof other Colleges and members of the Guilds of 'London that were present. The procession then\nmoved out to the con vers azione in the main R.C.S. building.. Exhibits were also arranged in the\nHuxley building; the tea for students that was\nsupposed to be there was suddenly transferred to the Upper Dining Hall, to the great dismay and\no on stem ation of many a hopeful student.\nIn the evening, the Union was full, and it was great to see so many old faces turning up\nagain in the good old building.

Several items of news that normally make the\nfrontpage headlines have been pushed away\nthis time. All due to the fact that I.C. has\nbeen very active, and has really done a lot of things worth reporting. The normal state of affairs is that on the day before make-up we\nare still uncertain about what, if anything, should occupy the front page.\nMost of you have no doubt heard our\nlaments about the shortage of news and the shortage of contributions. We would like to stress again the fact that FELIX is not merely something which feeds you with news, but some-thing which y pu build up, directly or indirectly. It is too much to ask of the FELIX board that they should fill up all space each fortnight. It is unfair to you as well, for it means that you get only the views of one group of people we try to make the group consist of as large a variety of people as possible, but we remain a group just the same. Sending Letters to the Editor is the easiest form of, expressing your thoughts. But surely there are many thoughts and ideas that can be expanded\ninto an article; many incidents that, can be\ntold humourous ly1 Goodbye the Sun\" in our\nlast issue was an instance; \u00ab:\nmany bits of terse, verse that are knocking about in your head; why not send them to FB LIX? You benefit by making the full use of your forum; others benefit by reading something with afresh approach.; and we benefit by our task being lightened.> FELIX is your newspaper. You pay for it and it is up to you. to see that full use \u2022 is made of it. News is always in short supply in this blessed place( this fortnight, we have\nalready said, has been remarkable), and what\nthere is we try to cover fairly well. But\nthe news hounds are not infallible. Club Secretaries; are requested to make a special note of this and keep us posted on their activities, also criticise us if we miss some-thing. But apart from news, there are thousands of things you would want to see in FELIX. Surely the best way to assure it is to write something yourself? 'The Rag Committee has already come under\" heavy fire in our columns. One thing that has\nparticularly annoyed many people is the fao t that we \" visited\" two girls' Colleges on\nNovember 5 th. It is even more regrettable that girls from both Colleges had been Invited to our own Hop a tH arlington. It is one thing to march in force on a big College say U.C. and have a battle Royal, and another to march\non & small worsens' College when half their population is, at our invitation, present at our Hop. It is poor form whichever way we\nlook at it. We hope that in future I.C. will exercise more <o are w nen they select a destin a \u2014 \u2022\ntion. After all, we are one of the biggest Colleges here, and^ repeating our last perform ance is not likely to bring usa particularly good name.\nA combined Christmas Birthday issue of FELIX will appear on 11th December.

Hip SEERS' BALL dfL,\nVIEWPOINT\nDamps qUIR S The. handling of this year's Guy Fawkes\ncelebrations went off with the sort of bang we have come to expect in the last three years a very damp s qui bb ish affair. As\nusual the Union turned it's thumbs down to a'rag', giving that hardy annual of an\nexcuse, Police Disapproval? it was also ment i one d that the Union did not wish the University Grant Committee to have a nasty taste in their mouths on the morning after Guy Fawkes night. Again as usual, the Rag\nCommittee came up with a New, Novel and\nPreviously Untried idea for arag( viz, that I.C. would go to Bedford College with a portable bonfire); this was the second in the line of Bright Ideas Fostered By The Rag Committee, the first having fallen through when U.C. found that they could not have a procession. Thus once again I.e. was split into two\ncamps - those for H arlington, those against H arlington. The blame for this rests somewhere between the Union and the Rag Committee. The Union is to blame because, as far as I know, after the H arlington fiasco last year, they made no attempt to find a bonfire site somewhere in London for this years celebrations; it must be said, however, that even if a site had been found, it is most probable that the police would not have given permission for I.C. to use it. It was known that the feeling in I.C. this year was for arag in London and yet no attempt was made to arrange it. Thus it was left to the Rag Committee to arrange an unofficial procession; most of the student body behind them and were ready to back them up in arranging arag in London; all the Rag Committee had to do was to supply the idea. And so it was that on the morning of Guy Fawkes Day, the Rag Committee announced\n\u2022to awaiting world that( a) I.C. would go to Bedford College, and that( b)I.C. would attempt to gain entrance tn ere with a portable bonfire If this is atypical product of t ne Hag\n\"Committee's feverish imagination, then I suggest that the sooner the present committee resign the better it will be for I.C.I know several people who were ' per sua a ea not to take part, just because of this stupid idea for a Rag. I have always thought tn at when\none College raided a not ner, t ne idea was to pick a College where atleast a little op posit i or. was expected. Although? ed ford and q.S. C. may have held certain attractions to the males eot ion of I.e., it was hardly likely that anything approaching opposition could be\nexp eot ed. Samuel ?e er>S.' OVERSEAS STl\nOverseas fresher swee e given a reception on\nFriday(6th),i evening by t ne Overseas Students'\nsub-Committee. They filled the lon nge and talked while the speakers we ee getting ready. An impossible proportion of post-graduates lent a peculiar atmosphere to the place. Mark Abbott, the Chairman, opened the proceedings and introduced the speakers. Prof. Read\ngave one of his choice chats, concentrating on\nthe theme: 'London isn't England- or Tales, or\nIreland.'( We wonder why!) Miss Travelyan, the\nUniversity Adviser to Overseas Students had been\ncollecting data: I.C. hajj t, students from Austra\u2014'\nlia, Canada, Ceylon, .Chijia, Columbia, \" Hgypt,\nHolland, Hong Kong, India, Iraq., Latvia, S ige \u2014\niria, Pakistan, Persia, Poland, Rhodesia, South\nAfrica, and Yugoslavia. The first thing to do,\nshe said, was to get away from your own country-men. The English, according to her, have as rt= range form of shyness: \"They don't like to do\nanything that well, that isn't done\". John\nHarding made the shortest speech of tee evening,\nproducing this gem: \"A speech, like a baby, is easy to conceive but hard to deliver\". Mark\nAbbott made a stop\u2014gap speech, and the company'\nmigrated to the buffet upstairs. This consisted of an amount of food quite disproportionate( for. the better, that is,) \"to\nthe number of people,., and all the Club and Soc ie ty bigwigs ( not r for consumption) .Dissuasion\nranged owe r wide t&pi os, wandering now into formalities and now into arguments, till after an hour or so there fce re no fresher s left, as\nis too often the case with fresher s' receptions. Still, Doug Collins, the Seoretary tt the sub-committee, must be feeling satisfied with an\nevening that was far more enjoyable, than it might have been and wh i oh undoubtedly served\ntin purpose of putting the overseas fresher at\ni a is ease.\n\n"
