The egg-and-spoon race to succeed him is\nnow drawing to a close. The\ndecision will be made by a subcommittee of the Governing Body,\nwith the result due on the 26th June.\nThe committee normally contains\nall Deans of the constituent colleges\nof Imperial. Interesting to note that\none PR man and notorious self-publicist has asked not to be\nincluded on the panel. Whatever\nreason could be given for refusing\nsuch an influential position?\nProfessor Peter Richards has\nbeen making a name for himself\nrecently, with a controversial\nstatement on how Junior Doctors\nshould be treated, and a rejection\nfrom the Junior Doctors'\nCommittee of the British Medical\nAssociation (BMA). Professor\nRichards is also launching a survey\nto coincide with the Patients'\nBritain had\nbecome\nEurope's only\none party state\nCharter, and a proposal to save\nCharing Cross Medical School, if\nnot the entirety of London\nUniversity, by merging it with\nImperial College. He also has a formidable reputation for his crime-beating rugby tackle.\nOne merger that will definitely\ntake place this summer is the joining\nof the Science Museum Library\nwith the Imperial College Central\nlibraries. The joint building should\nonly be closed for a few days over\nthe long vacation, but because of the\nnature of the necessary excavation,\nthe Haldane Library will not be\nmoved to the ground floor until\nduring the Christmas vacation.\n1992 was also the year of the long\nawaited General Election, which\nsuccessfully avoided student issues\naltogether, by holding the election\nduring the vacation. This played\nabsolute havoc with the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) Target\n70' campaign, an ill disguised scam\nfor the election of Labour\ncandidates. April 9th brought IC\nRadio's most ambitious venture:\nlive results and analysis, music, and\ncoverage of reaction in live reports\nfrom all the major party\nheadquarters, and the local count.\nAlthough the programme was a runaway success the result did not\nplease the producer of the Election\nextravaganza, who claimed that\nBritain had become Europe's only\none party state.\nStudent issues, though wilfully\nneglected in the General Election,\nhave made a strong showing in the\nnews output of Felix and IC Radio.\nArcher. Professor Archer is the\npro-Rector responsible for\nindustrial contacts, and in an earlier\nlife was the scientific advisor to the\ncommittee.\nAfter lunch with the Governing'\nBody, the committee granted an\naudience to an ICU delegation. The\ncommittee members were presented\nwith a 'financial hardship' poll\nrepresenting about 5 % of Imperial\nCollege students, and Zoe Hellinger\nmade clear that the committee 'had\ncome to the wrong college'. The\nreport from the committee was due\nIn January, the House of Commons\nSelect Committee into Education,\nScience, and Arts came on tour to\nImperial, to help them draw up their\nreport into levels of student\nhardship. This was their idea of\nmeeting the students of the country,\nand assessing the situation on the\nground. Surely not? After all.\nImperial was the only higher\neducation establishment that the\ncommittee visited, though it is just\nup the road from Westminster, and\nthe committee does have excellent\ncontacts with Professor John\nto be published in April, but the\nelection disturbed things a bit. This\nhas caused a ripple of protest, with\nLorna Fitzsimons, NUS Presidentelect, calling for its immediate\npublication, to avoid another\n'summer of discontent'.\nThe other strong student story\nwas the idea of a students' charter.\nThe idea was first leaked last\nFebruary by the Cabinet Office to\nDavid Henke, The Guardian's Westminster Correspondent. The\nstory has caused more than a little\ninterest in / CNN, and never has so\nmuch been written about so little so\nfrequently. Hypothetical conjecture\nis ail very well, but a major part of\nthe scheme could be voluntary\nmembership to college Student\nUnions. Indeed, the matter has shot\nup the political agenda, being the\nsubject of an adjournment debate in\nthe Commons, and featuring in\nPrime Minister's Questions last\nweek.\nWhat does voluntary membership\nmean? Effectively, the money from\ncollege that pays for student unions\nwill instead go to students directly,\nand they will then be billed for\naffiliation to the union should they\nso wish. The catch? Given the\nchoice between roughly one\nhundred quid or the odd bar\nextension, which would you\nchoose? This has raised the blood\npressure of many ICU Officers, so\nexpect some campaigns next year to\npromote 'how wonderful your\nUnion really is'. This will make the\nstudent feel that it really should\ninvest in a Students' Union.\n'Students may\nthink they're\npoor'\nCrime has been on the increase\nall year at Imperial. As one well-placed Security source put it,\n'Students may think they're poor,\nbut every thug from Paddington to\nBrixton knows that mummy and\ndaddy gave you a stereo as a going\naway present'. The amount of\ncrime, both reported and\nun reported, in the College is huge.\nThe Dramatic Society lost \u00a310,000\nworth of equipment in the first week\nof the first term. An ex-student got\nsecurity men to help him load a van\nwith computer equipment. \u00a3950 in\ncash was stolen from a room in a Hall of Residence. These are just\nthe major thefts this year. There are\nmany others. To try and reduce\nthese.losses, security was revamped\n(above), and a swipe card system\nwas introduced to the College over\nEaster. It required all students to\ncarry an identity card with them at\nall times. After initial problems, the\nsystem is now reported to be\nworking smoothly.

Through\nyour letters column, may we clarify\nour position regarding some of the\nrelevant points Declan has raised.\nConservative Students have a membership of over 10,000 making\nus the largest voluntary student\npolitical organisation in the country;\ndespite this, Declan's opinion that\nwe are setting the pace in student\nreforms, rather overstates our\ninfluence.\nOur efforts to date have been\nlargely to press for liberation of\nstudents from compulsory\nmembership of the NUS and\nStudent Unions; it is not our policy\nto destroy the college unions and the\nservices they provide.\nAs for the Students' Charter,\nwhich at time of writing, has not yet\nbeen launched, we eagerly await its\nDear Adam,\nLast week's front page story,\nwith its shock horror headline,\n'Furse Row as Southside faces\nDemolition', will have misled those\nof your readers who still believe\nthat what is printed must be true.\nLet me tell you how I see it:\nSouthside is a massive concrete\nstructure. Love it or hate it\u2014it is\nhere to stay. The foundations are\nnot crumbling. It was not designed\nfor a25 year life. I would be ever\nso surprised if it were not still\nstanding, equally solidly, at the turn\nof the next century\u2014though neither\nof us might then find it entirely easy\nto communicate our feelings on the\nsubject.\nFurse House would be a marvellous addition to Imperial\nCollege. There are not many\nopportunities to acquire a major\nbuilding quite so close to the\nCollege. I know of no one who\ndisagrees with that judgement. How\nmuch can we afford to pay for it?\nWell, now you are entering an area\nwhere the number of opinions will\nbe precisely equal to the number of\nthose looking at the problem. That\nleads to debate. There has not been,\nis not and will not be a 'row'.\nThe Residence Strategy\nDiscussion document was just\nthat\u2014a document for discussion. It\nhas been widely disseminated. It\npresents the clearest appraisal of the\nCollege residences that we have\nassembled so far. It received\naccolades (\u2014some from me); it\nreceived criticisms (\u2014some from\narrival; however, the party that\nproduces a commitment promising\nchoice for students as to which\nbodies they wish to join will be the\nparty to legitimately claim to be\nboth the defender of freedom and\nthe voice of students. We as\nConservative Students expect the\nGovernment to rise to that\nchallenge.\nI am pleased Declan has a strong\nsense of realism, his regarding of\nthe '92 election as 'One to lose'.\nClearly the '79, '87 and '96/7\nelections may be held in similar\nregard.\nFinally may I offer personal\ncongratulations on the general\nstandard of Felix under your\ncontrol, I am told that its quality\nexceeds that of previous years.\nI remain the 'Enemy Within'.\nYours,\nJames Baker,\nSecretary ICU ConSoc.\nme) partially on what was in it and\npartially on what was omitted. That\nwas the purpose of the exercise1. No, I was not 'cold with fury' on\nreading the letter written by the\nwardens. I noted a tendency to view\nglasses half empty, rather than half\nfull\u2014but that does not affect the\nobjective nature of the comments\nreceived.\nThe Working Party will produce\na revised version which will seek to\nmake amendments\u2014additions,\ndeletions and corrections. Far from\nseeking to 'cancel the publication of\nthe report' I recommend that we\nbring out the revised edition, in the\nlight of all the comments received,\nas soon as humanly possible.\nHow soon is that? Well here that\nis a problem and it goes under the\nname of Universities Funding\nCouncil (UFC). The research\nassessment documentation has to be\nsubmitted to them by 30 June. It is\na monstrous task which has burnt\nup a great deal of academic staff\ntime as well as that of some key\npeople in the administration. There\nhave been other loads, again\nimposed by the UFC, on, amongst\nothers, the Planning Department.\nThere simply has not been time to\ndevote to the revised version of the\nResidence report this month, with\nluck it will happen before people go\non vacation. As soon as it is to\nhand, I will be glad to send you a copy.\nYours sincerely,\nSir Eric Ash.\nDear Adam.\nThere has been much written\nabout the lack of attendance\" at\nUGMs in past issues. The blame\nhas been almost exclusively laid on\nthe lack of student interest. I would\nlike to suggest that there lies only\nhalf of the problem.\nThe other half lies in the fact that\nmost of us are completely ignorant\nof when and where these meetings\nare happening.\nAs a fairly serious 'Raggie' and\nas regular visitor to the Felix office\nI consider myself well acquainted\nwith the Union. I have been to 2\nUGMs this year, both of which I was directly involved with. I probably would have attended more\nbut I only found out about them\nafter they were Tong finished. Last\nterm I proposed Rachel Mountford\nfor the post of Rag Chair, and as\nsuch assumed that I might be\nrequired to attend her election.\nWhen I tried to find out when the\nrelevant U GM was it took me the\nbest part of a week. Even the\nusually well-informed Felix staff\ncouldn't tell me when or where it\nwas. Eventually I found the HonSec who was full of useful\ninformation.\nIt is a rather sad state of affairs\nwhen people have to actively go out\nof their way to put forward a vote\nDear Adam,\nAs an observer I must comment\non the infantile reply you made to\nMr Proctor's letter in Felix 938 (12\nJune 1992). Mr Proctor's attention\nwill obviously be brought to the\nanno ny mit y issue if the letter in\nquestion attacks 'his parish' and, in\nsome cases, him personally, but is\nthis a reason to disregard the\nprinciple? I think not. If the\nindividual told the president that he\nhad written the letter, why withhold\nhis name anyway? Is it a cheap trick\nby the author to gain attention in\nthese days of his waning popularity?\nAs for finding fault in the letter, no\none who knows the author would\ntake his opinion seriously enough to\nwaste their time doing so. If,\nindeed, C& GU is so terrible, why\nis he so keen to be popular?\nThe comments in your letter have\nthe overtones of a spoilt brat who\nis exploiting his control of the paper\nto humiliate a person who has\nactually got off his backside to try\nand do something for the hoards of\napathetic students at Imperial. He\nis not doing it for personal gain\nbecause there is no gain from the\nhapless task of President. Maybe he\nthat generally will hardly affect\ntheir lives.\nIs it not part of the Hon-Sec's job\nde scrip ion to let the student body\nknow that there are decisions to be\nmade?\nAs things stand, the majority of\nthe people that know about and\nattend UGMs are friends of the\npeople that are trying to pass\nmotions. During the last meeting\nthat I went to, almost half of the\nstudents there were involved with\nThird World First who were, once\nagain, trying to pass a rather\ncontroversial motion. This, I am\nsure, is not representative of student\nopinion.\nI hope that next year the HonSec's job will be better fulfilled.\nChris Pease, Phys 1\nIncredible\nDear Adam,\nRe: editorial Felix 938\nconcerning Felix receiving\ncoverage in the national press.\nWho would have believed that a small group of students delaying the\ndistribution of a students newspaper\nby three days could be newsworthy\nenough to reach the pages of the\nIndependent?\nRichard Harrison, ME3.\nhas made mistakes, he is human\nafter all, but we all know how easy\nit is to criticise other's performance\nfrom afar. Maybe his biggest\nmistake was believing he could\nimprove C& GU, it can only be as\nactive as the students it caters for.\nOne thing I do agree with you on\nis that the President could do far\nmore damage than you ever could.\nThose of us who attend Guild's events regularly can see, at a glance, that you have little idea of\nwhat you are talking about. The\npower has certainly gone to your\nhead. As for snide ness, I am sure\nit is nothing to be proud of. Maybe\nyou should spend as much time\nperfecting Felix as you have\npracticing your juvenile behaviour.\nAfter four years at Imperial College\nI can honestly say that this year's Felix has been worse than other\nyears. I hope that next year's editor\nis capable fo taking criticism of all\nkinds in a more mature manner. In\nthis case it will not be necessary for\nthe students to resort to your tactics\nin order to retail li ate. Yours sincerely,\nRachel D.R.

This\nis the annual event in which naive\nnew students came along in their\nmasses, wondering what the hell\ncollege life was all about. However,\nthey only found slightly older and\nwiser students ready to take their\nNonetheless, you tried you best\nBen. which is a darn sight more\nthan what other people mustered\nduring the rest of the time.\nThroughout the year, Film Soc\nand ICSF provided us with regular\nbits of news concerning their latest\nshowings. So a round of applause\nto them for being so well organised,\nand for fully utilising the advertising\npower of FELIX for their members.\nHowever, these plaudits are not\nmeant for Alex McLintock, who in\nrather mitigating circumstances,\nSporting Review 1991-1992\nProbably the best photograph ever taken by our intrepid photographer, Simon Govier.\nKhurrum Sair,\nthe Felix Clubs\nSocieties and\nSports editor\nreflects on\nthis year's achi ev ment s hard earned money (in the name of\nmemberships) in exchange for\npromises of activities and events as\nsuitable alternatives to the\nmonotony of lectures and practicals.\nOn reflection, it may be said that\nsome of these promises may have\nbeen fulfilled, but it is a sad fact that\nvery few clubs actually met the high\nexpectations placed in the minds of\nmembers whilst enlisting. I bet\nmany of you are still wondering\nwhy the hell you joined a particular\nsociety, especially one that hasn't even bothered to contact you\nthroughout the year. Well now\nyou're all a bit wiser and will know\nbetter next year.\nOnce the hustle and bustle of the\nfirst week died away, clubs started\nto use FELIX as a medium in which\nto lure more unsuspecting students\ninto their grasp. A good example of\nthis was a series of articles by Ben\nQuant on behalf of ICU Christian\nOutreach. . These were by all\naccounts very long and well\nreasoned arguments, but to the\nmajority of us they were, and lets\nbe frank about this, rather pointless.\nwas appointed Typographical Error\nEditor by Adam (we've made up\nnow - Ed). Since he failed\nmiserably in fulfilling this post, the\neditor is still accepting applications\nfor this vacancy. So if anyone is\ninterested, please come into the\nFELIX office for an application\nform.\nAs the novelty of being at IC\nwore off. November saw the first\nphotos of one of the IC's clubs in\naction. Yes, our intrepid FELIX\nphotographer had taken on mission\nimpossible, and travelled with the\nRCS Mens 1st XV rugby team to\nChiswick. (Not bad, since I had sent\nhim to Harlington!). The team,\nsomewhat c huffed at having its\npicture taken, produced a performance which was sufficient\nto beat Goldsmith College 7-6, and\nfor them to appear on the front page\nof issue 915.\nWith this apparent willingness of\nFELIX to provide a photographer,\nother clubs decided to get in on the\nact. And thus the Hockey Club, the\nMens Basketball team and even the\nDribblers wanted to have their\nphotos taken. What will all this\nvanity come to!\nTogether with this increased\nawareness amongst the cl.ub s, the\nresults table (a regular feature in the\n\"good old days) made a jubilant\ncome-back. This enabled clubs to\nlet the rest of IC know about the\nprogress in their respective\nactivities rather than having to write\ntedious reports, which as we all\nknow, are very hard to come by,\nespecially those that actually tell us\nwhat really happened during a game.\nThe less well known clubs also\nhad their moments in the year. The\nTH Huxley (come Humanist)\nSociety mourned the death of Gene\nRodenbury, the creator of Star\nTrek, (yes, he's dead Jim), while\nthe Chess Club organised The\nMestel Challenge: 16 simultaneous\ngames of chess against the former\nBritish champion, of which he lost\nonly one. IC SEDS also played their\npart by inviting leading names in the\nspace world to gives talks on the\nspace shuttle and the ap polo missions. And what about the canoe\nwater-polo is ts who gamely\nconceded a match against Bath, all\nin the name of sport! However,\nlater on in January, they did manage\na win or two, but as with all good\nthings, this is when I lost touch with\nthem and can't honestly say what\nbecame of them.\nSo, what major award winning\nachievements did IC clubs attain\nduring the year? Well, the Dance\nClub won the annual Intervarsity\nDancing Competition, held in the\nSheffield Octagon, by beating their\nold rivals Cambridge in the final.\nThis was a tense affair, with both\ncolleges producing fine\nperformances, but the exceptional\ndancing of the Waltz and Quickstep\npairs, in the final, managed to edge\nthe result in IC's favour. Further\nafield, the IC First Eight Boat Crew\ntravelled to Japan to compete in\ntheir version of the Henley Regatta.\nHaving won their heat, by beating\na very strong American crew (five\nof the oarsmen being\ninternationals), they faced Bristol\nUniversity in the final together with\ntwo Japanese teams. The final took\nplace in terrible conditions, but with\ntrue gritty determination, the IC\ncrew beat the opposition to clinch\nvictory and retain their title. With\nthe entire race screened live on\nJapanese television, the Boat Club\nmust truly now have an\ninternational reputation!\nIn our domestic scene, St Mary's Rugby XV emphatically won the\nHospitals Cup (the oldest rugby\ncompetition in the world) by beating\nUniversity College 49-0 in the final.\nIn the process Mary's created three\n-20\u2014\n\n"

The poll tax will\nfinally die in 1993, sometime,\nallowing the re-enfranchisement of\ndoing a day's work (with BT?), and\nJonathan and Steve become students\nagain.

He will be sorely missed\nby Whiskers, the new Felix mouse,\nwhich will probably die next year\nanyway. When he does, we're\nbuying a cat.\nThe possibility of a staff protocol\nlooms ominously, as does the threat\nof voluntary membership. Reform\nof college unions looks like causing\nfurther major reforms in the\nNational Union of Students. They\nare seriously considering an opt out\nclause for students of affiliated\ncolleges.\nResearch into Alzheimers\ncontinues under the direction of the\nnew, post-Hardy team, as does\nthe disenfranchised. Tube fares will\nprobably go up. Alan Bailey\nthreatens to come back to do a PhD.\nThe Management School will\nprobably continue to give away\nscholarships to the chosen few. FBI\nbecomes the Finance Society. Our\nvery own one parent family, the\nduck, will return to Beit Quad and\nproduce yet another brood.\nFinally, in October, the new\nfellows and associates of the college\nwill be inaugurated. Step forward,\nSir Roger Bannister, Professor Sir\nJohn Cadogan, Doctor Anthony\nKing, John Smith (not the next\nLabour leader, but the former\nCollege Secretary), and Robert\nWilkins. The inauguration will be\nin the Royal Albert Hall on\nCommemoration Day, and they will\nbe beside those lucky graduates.\n\n"

The report shows a30% increase in the number of\nImperial College students taking\npart in the scheme, which involves\nthem acting as volunteer tutors in\nlocal primary and secondary\nschools. John Hughes, BP Fellow\nfor Student Tutoring, has expressed\nhis thanks to the 130 Imperial\nstudents 'who have given up nearly\nsix thousand hours during the\ncourse of this year to assist local\nteachers and pupils'.\nThe scheme has been widely\nhailed by education a lists and the\neducational press. Imperial's tutors\nhave been called 'pioneers in the\nappliance of science' by the\nGuardian, and 'role model\nstudents' by the Times Educational\nSupplement. After an afternoon's training, students volunteer to go\nout on a Wednesday afternoon to\ntutor in maths, science or\ntechnology. The tutors work\nindividually or in small teams under\nthe direction of the teacher. The\ntutors mainly help with practical\nwork, where an extra set of hands\nand a fresh approach proves useful.\nThe work involves a partnership not\nonly with the teacher, but also with\nthe pupils.\nPupils say that the tutors are\n'easier to relate to'. 'They were not\nlike teachers, they were like\nfriends,' said one. Teachers are also\nappreciative of the tutors' work.\nStephanie Pojak, a link teacher at\nSt Clements and St James Primary\nSchool said, 'Wednesday\nafternoons with the students are a gift. You have an intelligent,\nscientifically minded young adult\nable to help. The greatest reward is\nknowing that the children are\ngetting immediate and constant\ncontact and supervision.'\nOf the Imperial students, 95% felt\nthey were getting practice in simple\nscientific communication skills;\n85% felt their self confidence\nincreased; and 95% felt that they\nwere doing something useful with\nwhat they had learned. Only 3%\nthought the tutoring scheme greatly\ninterfered with their college studies.\nOne tutor said, 'tutoring has given\nme some of my happiest moments\nat Imperial. The children told me\norganised several dinners in\nChinese and Indian restaurants, to\ncelebrate Christmas and half term\nand such like. Tutors from across\nLondon were invited to a free\nCarvery Pre-Christmas dinner at the\nCumberland Hotel. The society\norganised an Open Day for Pimlico\nchildren in March. Nearly 150\nchildren came to Imperial College,\nThe Pimlico Connection\nand showed me how much they\nenjoy us being there. We, as well\nas the kids, benefitted from each\nother.'\nThe tutoring is complemented by\nsocial activities, organised by the\nPimlico Connection Student\nSociety, part of the Social Clubs\nCommittee (SCC) of Imperial\nCollege Union. The society has\nCareers Information\n\u2022 WHAT next after the Milkround:\nFurther seminars will be held in the\nSummer vacation if there is\nsufficient demand.\nPenultimate years: Start thinking\nabout your future now, especially\nif you have no idea what you want\nto do.

The\nworkshop, which is jointly\nsponsored by BP and Imperial\nCollege, will study the development\nof tutoring schemes, with a view to\nfurther expansion. This expansion\nis being aided by Community\nService Volunteers (CSV), whose\n'Learning Together' programme is\nbeing funded by the City of\nLondon's Lord Mayor's National\nAppeal. CSV' s Education\nManager, John Potter, aims to\ndevelop the scheme in Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland, and there are\nplans to extend tutoring into arts and\nlanguages.

    "content": "24 June 1992 Felix 939 News Review\nproduction of 'Grease', began a war\nof words (short and unintelligible -mostly grunts) with Felix, and\nparticularly the Felix editor, Adam\nHarrington.\nThe CCUs had a bit more to\nworry them when it became clear\nthat the College Union Office was\nabout to start investigating ultra\nvire s( literally, out of rules)\npayments, otherwise known as the\nillegal use of union (taxpayers)\nmoney. It was revealed that C CU balls had between them spent a total\nof a few thousand pounds on\ncomplementary tickets. In a separate incident, the Royal College\nof Science Union found that its\nfinances were in such disarray that\nits senior treasurer considered not\nsigning any more cheques. The\nupset this caused among the CCUs\nwas nothing compared to the chaos\nand confusion in other places. Ultra\nvire s payments are defined by a letter from the Attorney General's office, issued in 1983, with the only\nproblem being that even the\nAttorney General's office has\ndifficulty interpret a ting the rules.\nThe losers in the whole affair are\nthe Imperial College Day Nursery,\nwhich had its ICU payments\nstopped several years ago, and the\nSilwood Park Day Nursery, which\nwas threatened with similar\nfinancial starvation. The payments\nwere stopped because it was felt\nJonathan\nGriffiths, then a sprightly 29\nthey were ultra vire s. As it turns\nout, they may not be. To raise their\nprofile, the Imperial College Day\nNursery held a 'Nursery Awareness\nDay', involving stalls, fun, and lots\nof little children striking terror in\nthe hearts of those timid Southside\nresidents.\nICU Rugby Club members have\nalso been showing us all they've got\nthis year, in some cases far too\nliterally. Their dinner was the scene\nof 'outrageous and obscene\nbehaviour' (an ICU sabbatical). 'It\ngot a bit out of hand' (ICU Rugby\nClub Captain). Indeed. The affair\nprovoked a certain element of navel\ngazing in ICU, the end result being\na new draft policy on sexual\nharassment. The policy was\ndiscussed at Tuesday's Annual\nGeneral Meeting (AGM), and a copy of the document can be\ninspected at the ICU office. The\npolicy will become official policy\nif it is ratified at a further general\nunion meeting.\nOther peculiar practices (apart\nfrom rugby) this year include\nmascot ry, which was described as\n'the sport of Gentlemen' in a letter\nto Felix by Paul Kendall, putting it\nalong side Bear-Baiting, Dog\nFighting and Fox Hunting.\nConstructive things mascot ry has\nachieved this year include breaking\nthe leg of Stephen Dorman, a first\nyear chemistry student; destroying\nthe door of the Mines' Union office;\nand encouraging tired, long\ndeparted, old hacks who should\nhave more sense, to play 'James\nBond' across the College in pursuit\nof large chunks of metal. Gold?\nNothing so useful.\nMoney was dealt with in better\nways by Imperial College Rag,\ndespite having several internal\nwrangles. Rag Chair Penguin,\noccasionally known as Marc Ellis,\nthreatened to resign more times than\nhe has flippers. When Mr Ellis\nactually did resign he was almost\nimmediately re-elected with only a weak challenge from Aled Fenner,\nwho was also to mount a weak\ncontest for the Hon Sec elections,\nbut more later. How many millions\nRag has collected has yet to be\ndiscovered, but contributions to the\nMaxwell pension fund are not being\nruled out.\nSt Mary's also had a successful\nRag week this year. Unfortunately\nthis coincided with the hustings for\nSabbatical Elections. This brought\nback memories of last year's hustings in which Jonathan Griffiths\n(then a sprightly 29) had his shirt\nburned. Apart from the exchange of\nlarge quantities of shaving foam and\nbribery by one\nof the Felix\neditor\ncandidates\nbribery by one of the Felix editor\ncandidates (/ wonder which one -Ed), the Hustings came to a peaceful conclusion. All the\ncandidates emerged alive but\nmauled. The IC (South Kensington)\nHustings were a more sedate affair.\nZzzzz.\nSabbatical Elections are usually\nharshly fought because candidates\nreally have something to lose at the\nballot box, apart from some face.\n.1992 was no exception and with a large media coverage (Felix,\nSTOIC and IC Radio) the stakes\nwere raised even higher. Publicity\nrules for election were ignored by\nmany candidates and one managed\nto get elected after going over\nbudget. This flaunting of the rules\nwas matched by the contempt with\nwhich the media regarded them.\nIndeed, the novel step was taken of\ncovering the elections according to\nnews values. This proved to be too\nmuch for some. Nick Allen\ncomplained strongly about bias after\nhe was interviewed on IC Radio,\nand Aled Fenner was not much\nhappier. Chris Davidson,\napparently, thrived on his\ninterview, while Angelo Gardini\noverslept, and so missed his 8pm slot. Phil Sharpe went one better.\nWhile he couldn't make his\ninterview, he did know one St\nMary's student who could fill in for\nhim, even though he was\nconsiderably under the influence. In\nfact, not only was he 'on the piss',\nhe decided to take it as well, live\nand on air.\nChris Davidson was elected as\nPresident, defeating Anthony\nBaldwin, New Election and Angelo\nGardini. Rick Bilby was elected as\nDeputy President, in preference to\nNew Election and Phil Sharpe.\nJonty Beavan was. elected Felix\nEditor, defeating New Election and\nToby Jones. After a win by New\nElection over Nick Allen and Aled\nFenner, and the subsequent re-election, Dominic Wilkinson was\nelected Honorary Secretary\n(Events), over Toby Jones and New\nElection.\n\n"

    "content": "News Review Felix 939 24 June 1992\nThis summer will see the departure\nof yet another group of lucky\ngraduates, \"with souls intact and\nbank balances in tatters. To add\npenury to poverty, they will\nprobably be sent a leaflet\nadvertising the wonders of Imperial\nCollege Alumni, entitled 'Imperial\nCollege and you'. A copy of this\nuseful document has reached Felix\nwith the title altered by some wit to\nread 'Imperial College and your\nMoney'. One could be forgiven for\nthinking that this comment sums up\nthe way Imperial has been run this\npast year.\nManager, called the Halls\n'generally shabby'. One resident\ncalled it 'living like squatters'; Mr\nDaniels responded with 'faults\ncannot be rectified overnight'. Or\nindeed annually. Read next year's Felix for news of sudden\ndevelopments.\nMore sinister events occurred\nlater in the first term in Southside\nHall, home to 374 students and\ncommonly called a 'fire hazard' by\npolite members of the College, a 'death trap' by those that live there.\nA lift in the Hall was set alight by\na 'socially challenged' (moronic)\nNews Review of the Year\nJonty Beavan\nand Declan\nCurry of the\nImperial College\nNews Network\n(/CNN), review\nthis year's news\nThe new intake arrived at the end\nof September to take their places in\nHall. First years who had not\nbrought any linen with them found\nthat they had to pay for bed covers\nand pillow cases that, in the past,\nhad been provided free. Paying for\nusing College Linen seems\nreasonable, until you discover that\nnew first years had been assured by\ntheir departments that bedclothes\nwould be provided free. As ever,\nthe departments found that they\nwere one of the last groups in\ncollege to be informed of anything.\nThis was one of the repetitive\nthemes of the year.\nIt was not long after that the\noverall state of College\naccommodation was also being\ncalled into question. Letters of\nprotest were received in Felix about\nSouthwell and Holbein halls in\nEvelyn Gardens. Leaks in roofs,\nlack of stable desks and cupboards\nand inadequate cooking facilities\namong the more minor complaints.\nGraham Daniels, Residence Area\nmember of the student body.\nLuckily, the blaze did not spread,\nbut due to the frequency of false\nalarms in Southside no one bothered\nto answer the alert. The Police\nverdict was 'lucky to escape without\nsome people dead'. This was\nfollowed by a false alarm in the\nMechanical Engineering building,\nwhere the departmental\nsuperintendent only found out about\nthe emergency when the Fire\nEngines arrived. You could be\nforgiven for asking what would\nhappen if there was a real fire at\nImperial. Answers on the back of\na fire lighter. The state of University buildings\nall over the country was condemned\nin a working party report of the\nUniversity Funding Council in mid-November. In a unique and never\nto be repeated interview with\nstudent media, Gordon Marshall,\nDirector of Imperial College\nEstates, said that buildings in the\nCollege were 'getting tired'. As is\nhe. Another source of student\nirritation was the increase in food\ncharges in Linstead Hall. The cost\nof living there is so great that the\nrent of a single room would leave\nyou with \u00a3100 change from your\ngrant cheque. Our advice is to eat\nthe cheque. It's cheaper and more\nnutritious.\nStudents were stung into action in\nthe Spring Term after Felix\nreported that students staying in\nSouthside Halls could have to pay\n\u00a318 a night to stay over the Easter\nVacation. A petition circulating\naround Southside gathered over 100\nsignatures in a few hours. The\ncontents of the petition was a description of the state of\naccommodation at Imperial. This\ndescription did not worry those in\nhigh places at Imperial. What\nworried our Lords and Masters was\nthe threat to send the letter to all\nschools and Sixth-Form colleges\nwhich may send students here.\nAngus Fraser, Managing Director,\nand the elusive Gordon Marshall\ngot onto the case immediately;\nmeeting the students who had\ngathered the petition. They listened,\nspoke, but said nothing. The\ndelegation of students left, satisfied\nonly by winding up the Director of\nEstates until he had to be pacified\nby the Managing Director. How\nsoothing.\nThings improved for some.\nThose students who had exams in\nthe first week of the summer term\nwere to be allowed to return to a room in Hall so long as it wasn't being used for those all-important\nconferences. There was a warm\nwelcome back for the residents in\nTizard Hall. Some found that their\nroom had been flooded by sewage,\ncompliments of the Estates division.\nThe advice from the College was 'to\nkeep an eye on your health',\npresumably after signing a little\nform absolving Imperial from any\nresponsibility if harm were to\nresult.\nThe news that Gardens restaurant\nis to close came as a surprise to\nmany, if only because very few\npeople actually know where it is.\nThat Southside Bar is to go on tour\nproved an altogether greater shock.\nSouthside's very own den of\niniquity will now move to the\nSherfield building. What would\nhappen if the whole of Southside\nwas to c lps e became a very real\nquestion, as it was reported that the\nHall was near the end of its\nexpected lifetime. Replacing the\nstudent beds with rooms in Furse\nHouse on Queen's Gate Terrace has\nbeen on the Rector's agenda for\nsome time. Whether the Imperial\nCollege Residence account could\nafford this \u00a35 million purchase was\nto be contained in Report of the\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

However, the\nwhich allowed NOLS to overturn a Union of Jewish Students felt that\nvote they had earlier lost. they were the only people who were\nWith the discussion on six affected by this, to the exclusion of\namendments taking close to two all other white and black students.\nMark Samuels, next year's ULU President.\nAfrican Studies (SOAS) and the\nUniversity of London Library, as\nwell as proposals for a new staff\nprotocol at UL U. The University\nFunding Council's announcement\nof a3% cut in the SOAS budget led\nto fears that their Phonetics and\nLinguistics Department would be\nclosed. Although this did not\nhappen, there was less success in\nresisting the cuts at the University\nof London Library. All that could\nbe reported was that UL U had done\nwhat it could and there was still a real danger that there could be a cap\non registration. Ms Win said that\nthe staff protocol was necessary to\n'safeguard sound industrial\nrelations.'\nAfter this and other reports, the\nmeeting lurched towards the anti-fascism motion. The original\n(substantive) motion was proposed\nOh, the futility\nof it all\nby Tarn Lamb, UL U's Vice\nPresident of Welfare, and proposed\nthe setting up of caucuses - or\ntalking shops - for groups or\nindividuals that are prone to racial\nharassment. In an ugly and\nunseemly attempt to hijack the\ncaucuses, this motion was heavily\namended by the Union of Jewish\nStudents (UJS), with 14 separate\namendments tabled. Seven of these\nwere accepted by the proposer, so\nthat the original motion now\nsupported political lobbying which\nurged the suppression of 'holocaust\nrevisionist' (effectively pro-Nazi)\nmaterial. This together with the\nopposition to the Asylum Bill leaves\nall expenditure on the motion open\nto question on the grounds of\nlegality.\nAmendments recognising the UJS\nas the representative body of Jewish\nstudents were defeated after a revote called in controversial\ncircumstances. The cause of the\nUJS was dealt a blow by a speech\nfrom Mark Samuels, next year'sULU President. Mr Samuels, who\npointed out that he was Jewish, said\nthat the UJS was not representative;\nhe was not a member of UJS. He\nalso made a veiled allegation that\nthe UJS was blatantly sectarian in\nits approach to the motion by\nclaiming a monopoly on racial\nhours, the council was getting\nrestless and quorum was called -and defeated - several times. At this\npoint, a procedural motion was\nmoved to end the meeting, with all\npassed amendments being written\ninto the motion. This included a motion calling on council to support\nthe work of Searchlight magazine.\nThe IC delegation's suggestion that\nthis could be construed as an illegal\n(ultra vire s) payment'because there\nwas no direct educational benefit to\nstudents was rejected by Tarn\nLamb, UL U Vice President\n(Welfare). Jeremy Neumark of UJS\nthen dug the grave further by\nrevealing that Searchlight also ran\na monitoring programme, the\nresults of which were used for party\npolitical purposes, and that\nSearchlight had refused to condemn\nacts of violence against fascists.\nThis clause will now be discussed\nalong with the rest of the motion at\na later date.\nViqar Ahmad, Publication\nSabbatical at King's College\nLondon, adds:\nI attended the last General Union\nI praise their vociferous and\nactive fight against those who feel\na necessity to deny the citizens of\nour community and equal\nopportunity in society today -all our parents and grandparents\nremember only too well the\natrocities committed against their\npeople. But this must be one of\nunity and those that oppose the UJS\nin turning this fight into a zionist\ncrusade may be wrongly branded as\neither anti-semitic, or worse still as\nfascist. We are neither anti-semitic\nnor are we fascist.\nThe targets of fascism are of all\ncolours, creeds and races, and not\nJews alone. May I point out that\nFrance has the strongest support for\nfascism in Europe today and it is the\nseverely impoverished black\nAlgerian population that is the\ntarget of their hatred. In this\ncountry, the four million people of\nAsian descent have been, for years,\ntargets for such abuse.\nI live in fear of our own future\nif we are unable to unite here, to\ntreat each other with adequate\nrespect.\nThe targets of\nfascism are of\nall colours,\ncreeds and\nraces and not\njust jews alone.\n\u2014 1 9 \u2014\n\n"

Rumour has it that the\nneanderthal team have attempted\nregressing back to dinosaurs. Is\nthere much truth to this Rumour?'\nThe camera swivelled to where\nRumour Monger sat in a helpfully\nexpansive chair.\n'Well, Frenzied, you can see the\nbenefits they would have if they\nsucceeded. A team always hopes to\nbe able to walk over their opponents\nbut if they could physically do it!\nWell, they'd win the league for\nsure.'\n'So will we be seeing thirty foot\nhigh lizards on the pitch then this\nevening?'\n'Well, I don't think so. You see,\nFrenzied, meat eating dinosaurs\nhave vestigial arms so even though\nthey'd be able to eat the entire\nopposing team they wouldn't be\nable to move the ball off the centre\nspot. Senior tacticians in the\nneanderthal camp, known as the\nshame n in the big tent, put forward\nseveral ways of overcoming this but\nthen realised that their team\nwouldn't be able to get through the\nplayer's tunnel and so gave up.'\n'And the werewolves, any\ninteresting news?'\n'Yes, the sector one werewolves\nare known as the thinking man's thunder ball team. One of the\nreasons for this being their\nintroduction of the then unknown\ntactic of protecting the man with the\nball and staying with him when he's running. This was unheard of in a game where coaches spent most of\ntheir time training the team not to\nfight over the ball. But the tactic\nworked and the pack system is a major in today's game.'\n'And the news?'\n'Well, Frenzied, this use of\ntactics was a major strain on the\nminds of the team and the news is\nthat the recent attempt by their\ncoach to get them to pass the ball\nresulted in him being slowly eaten\nby the front row.'\n' A MAY ZING!

At the other\nend the captain of the werewolves,\nBloodfang, has been thrown a piece\nof Sirloin steak by a very attractive\nfemale fan. The rest of the team are\nhowling and whistling while their\ncaptain eats the token of admiration.\nAnd the horn has gone signalling\nthe fifteen second countdown to\nfence raise.'\nPulling his helmet on over his\nwolf mask Stress positioned himself\nat the back of the pack.\nThe Inner System\nmetabolism antibodies were fighting\na losing battle ty ring to evict\nmolecule squatters from a drug\nridden flat.

Who will succeed him? The Governing Body\nis currently considering a short list of candidates ... in\ntotal secrecy.\nFelix has investigated the procedure whereby a new\nRector is selected. Tenacious investigations show that the\nentire process begins with the current Rector retiring.\nAfter the role of the Rector is reviewed, and the\nconclusions ignored, the post is then advertised in places\nof academic patronage. A list of candidates is then\ndrawn up by greater minds, or in our case the\nGoverning Body. In rare cases, some candidates decide\nto raise their profile, especially if from St Mary's. Interviews may be conducted in a rarefied atmosphere\n(The Holland Club). Following the consideration of all\nthe relevant factors such as fundraising ability, bank\nbalance, fundraising ability, political affiliations,\nfundraising ability, spouse, wealth of spouse,\nfundraising ability of spouse, country of origin of\nspouse, width of spouse, beauty of spouse, lack of\nacademic standing, talent for sleep, resistance to\ncharisma except for fundraising, etcetera, the least likely\ncandidate is selected. Arise the new Rector, OB N. Should the new Rector wish, an entirely new\nmanagement team can be imposed, selected, patronised\nor shagged. As the last one did this, it is entirely\npossible the new one will. In fact, considering the calibre\nof the imposters, it is entirely likely they will get,the\nheave. So we tack the new team on to the end, a fate\nentirely fitting.\nSome held their heads, maintained their pride,\nAnd would not stoop to lashing hides.\nEven in this place, some maintained their standards,\neven if they did come from Middlesex. And while there\nwas a vacancy at the top, as opposed to a vacuum, all\nauthority passed to the real power brokers, and not the\nSherfield pawn brokers.\nOnce so popular, now reviled,\n'Are you out too?' she sadly smiled.\nOnce in the midst s of time, and in the mists from the\ntoxic waste centre, a group of parasites clustered. It was\nthen that Sir Eric knew his time was up. 'Neff orff,' said\nAnne.\nAdverts clean and adverts tacky\nTry to sell us a government lackey.\nThe first wave of advertising was not a complete\nsuccess, though this never stopped them before. The\nagency, anxious to earn their stipend, decided to exploit\nthe foreign travel element, even without the BT subsidy.\nThey promised miracles, and they would need to get\nthem. Where else would the money come from?\n\u2014 12\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "News Felix 939 24 June 1992\nStudent Debt NUS Closed Shop\nOver a quarter of students in Great\nBritain have taken out a student\nloan, according to recent statistics\nfrom the Department of Education\nand Science.\nMore than one hundred and\neighty thousand students have\napplied for a total of \u00a369.9 million\nworth of credit. Earlier this year\nTony Cullen, who co-ordinates\nloans applications at the College,\nsaid demand was 'greater than\nexpected' and 1,300 IC students\napplied for access funds this year.\nThese funds are available to those\nin financial difficulty.\nThe Department of Education and\nScience has revealed that the\nnumbers of students in Higher\nEducation has increased by 47%\nfrom 1980 to 1990. In 1990 there\nwere 318,000 full time students in\nBritain, the total number of students\nin Higher Education being quoted\nas 1.3 million.\nCommenting on the figures in a press release, Nigel Forman,\nHigher Education Minister,\nemphasised the Government's aim\nto put 1 in 3 young people into some\nform of Higher Education.\nPostGrad Initiative\nImperial College is to participate in\nan initiative launched by the\nGovernment, in which postgraduate research assistants can\ngain their higher degrees through a partnership with an industrial\ncompany. The 'Postgraduate\nTraining Scheme' has been\nestablished in a collaboration\nbetween the Department of Trade\nand Industry (DTI), the Office of\nScience and Technology, and five\nmajor higher education institutions.\nEach of the five partnerships will\ntake on 20 researchers, 10 in 1992\nand 10 in 1993. Universities taking\npart in the scheme, including IC,\nare assigned to an industrial partner,\nwhich will provide research projects\nand a possible bursar y for each\nstudent taken on. The scheme will\nlead to MSc and PhD qualifications\nin industrial disciplines, such as\nmaterials science, information\ntechnology and process\nengineering. The Science and\nEngineering Research Council has\nallocated a \u00a37000 grant per student\nper year. The DTI has allocated\nfunds of \u00a32 million to cover the cost\nof the project.\nThe Higher Education minister,\nNigel Forman, has postponed a meeting planned for later today with\nthe executive of the National Union\nof Students (NUS). The minister\nand the NUS were to discuss the\nprospect of introducing voluntary\nmembership for student union\nmembers. The proposal to remove\nfunding from student unions and to\nend compulsory student\nmembership of student unions has\nbeen on the educational agenda\nsince the minister met Conservative\nStudents early in May.\nThe matter was discussed in the\nCommons last week during a late\nnight adjournment debate.\nConservative back bench MP, Graham Riddick, told the minister\nthat he had urged the Government\nto abolish the 'student union closed\nshop' in March 1988, and was\ndismayed that this still had not been\ndone.\nMr Riddick said that it was\n'indefensible' for students not to\nhave choice in membership of\nstudent unions. Welcoming\nnewspaper reports that the\nGovernment was to make\nmembership of the NUS voluntary,\nhe said that the NUS and student\nunions were a 'double closed shop.'\nHe called sabbatical officers 'a taxpayer funded army of political\nactivists, predominantly of the left,'\nand condemned the policy of many\nunions in banning Nestle products.\nMr Forman said that there were\nsome ways 'in which campus\n(individual) unions are a form of\nclosed shop.' adding that 'there are\ndifferences as well. Campus unions\nare not pre-entry closed shops.\nUnlike a trade union closed shop,\na campus union exercises no control\nover which students may join the\neducational institution.' He further\nsaid that the NUS 'differs from a closed shop arrangement in that\ncampus unions vote on whether or\nnot to affiliate.' The most surprising\ncomment from the minister was 'the\nprinciple of freedom of association\nwould suggest that students should\nhave the right to join an\norganisation to meet their legitimate\nneeds.'\nMr Forman's response to the\ndebate has elated the NUS, with the\nexecutive claiming that the minister\ndid not accept that the NUS is a closed shop. They add that the\ncharter issued last week by the right\nwing Adam Smith Institute\nconceded the 'right of student\nrepresentation.'\nElection rules and Sexual Harassment\nSexual harassment was made an\nImperial College Union (ICU)\ndisciplinary offence following\nyesterday's ICU Annual General\nMeeting (AGM). The policy, which\nwas drawn up by Zoe Hellinger,\nUnion President, was passed\nwithout objection. The existing\nCollege policy on sexual\nharassment only applies to assaults\nby staff on students. Until\nyesterday, there was no mechanism\nto deal with assaults by students on\nstudents.\nThe AGM also passed alterations\nto the rules governing Sabbatical\nElections. The revised rules were\ndrawn up by ICU Elections\nCommittee after consultations with\nwhat Steve Farrant, ICU Returning\nOfficer, described as 'interested\nparties.' The new rules are\nconsiderably looser than those\npreviously in force, though some\nformer rules remain in place. Poster\nsize is still restricted to Al, and\nonly 'Blu-Tac' may be used to affix\nposters to notice boards. Gum\nbacked material may now be used\nfor lapel stickers. The removal or\nsabotage of posters remains an\noffence, and all campaigns must be\nconducted within the publicity\nbudget set by the Elections\nCommittee.\nA new emphasis has been placed\non the reporting of elections by\nUnion media, and College and\nConstituent College Union media\nwill fall under election rules for the\nfirst time. Union media must\nremain freely available to all\ncandidates, and candidates must be\ninformed in writing of Union media\ninterviews or discussions three days\nbefore deadline or transmission.\nSeveral appointments were made\nto Union posts. Simon Govier and\nJames Grinter were ratified as Felix\nBusiness Managers, and David\nGoddard was elected Haldane\nRecord Buyer after promising to\nbuy 'more Kylie.' Marc Ellis was\nreturned as, one of the ordinary\nmembers of House Committee. The\nsecond ordinary member was\nopened to nominations from the\nfloor, and Gina Mortley was elected\nover Jonathon Griffiths. The posts\nof Postgraduate Affairs officer,\nHaldane Book Buyer and Transport\nOfficer will be filled in the next\nacademic year.\nBusiness and financial affairs\nwere detailed by the Deputy\nPresident, Jonathan Griffiths. His\nyear saw the early payoff of the\nBookstore loan and a reduction in\nthe operating losses of the Snack\nBar. Mr Griffith's report did not\nrefer to plans for the refurbishment\nof the Union lounge bar and snack\nbar, which will take place over the\nsummer. These plans were\ndiscussed by Union House\nCommittee and Union Bar and\nCatering Committee. Detailed\ntenders from four companies are\nnow being discussed by a seven\nperson working party, with a member of College administrative\nstaff on the working party. The\nCollege has been informed of the\nplans, which are being considered\nby Angus Fraser, Managing\nDirector, and Gordon Marshall,\nDirector of Estates. Both men are\nexpected to approve the plans\nbefore the end of the week.\nMr Griffith's was criticised for\nnot informing an earlier general\nmeeting of his change of telephone\nnumber. Next year's Union\nPresident and Felix editor informed\nthe meeting that they would be\nliving out of Halls of Residences\nnext year. Chris Davidson and\nJonty Beavan asked the AGM to\napprove the payment of their\nexpected hall bills towards the cost\nof their outside accommodation.\nAfter both stating that phone\nnumbers and addresses of their\noutside residences would be made\npublic knowledge, their request was\nallowed by the meeting.\nMr Griffiths' final comment was\nstudent unions did not need\nsabbaticals, and that they should be\nrun by professional Managers. He\ndid add that if he was asked to be\na Sabbatical again, he would\nprobably do it.\nReports were also presented by\nSteve Farrant, Honorary Secretary\n(Events); Gina Mortley, Union\nHouse Committee Chairman; and\nSteve Newhouse, Social Clubs and\nCommittees Chairman. These\nreports were ratified. The award of\nUnion Social Colours was also\nratified. The conferring of Union\nGeneral Awards will be confirmed\nat Thursday's ICU Council\nmeeting. Joe Fernley, AGM Chair,\nsaid that all students cou'ld attend the\nCouncil meeting at 2.00pm.

Such\na waste of an\neducation...\nStreet\u2014tough on the hands and\nknees, not to mention the poor\nshoppers. Consolation for the 220\nstill enthusiastic students involved\ncame in the form of the even more\ninfamous Drink-A Pub-Dry, a small, sober pat-on-the-back for\nthose that helped raise over \u00a32,800\nfor Action aid in just one morning.\nTiddlywinking and tid d ly drinking were closely followed by Rag's second event of the year, the hugely\nsuccessful Live Monopoly, which\nincorporated a crazy 18-hour, non-stop, overnight collection. Fancy\ndress was the order of the day with\noutfits ranging from plain silly to\nthe downright absurd\u2014and moods\nto match.\nHaving rampaged through\nLondon collecting bits of Old Kent\nRoad and desperately trying to\navoid the roving jail van, the\nsurviving, and as yet undaunted,\ncollectors passed on to the next\nevent\u2014The Great Sightseeing\nChallenge.

(OK,\nOK, so they were actually wearing\nbow ties around their necks.)\nAnd as for the RCS Beer\nFestival\u2014what more an excuse do\n1,200 people need to spend 11\nhours celebrating the ancient art of\ndrinking than that of raising over\n\u00a33,000 for charity at the same time?\nThe second term began with a bang...or a stabbing...or the\ninventive use of a blunt piece of\npiping and a piece of candle wax(?!), as an atmosphere of murder,\nmystery and suspense pervaded\nCollege in the run-up to the second\noutsize boardgame of the year,\nCluedo.\nAccusations and hypotheses filled\nthe air as teams tried to discover\nwho killed Penguin, by visiting the\nboard locations and bribing the\nmarshall s to tell them the identity\nof the murderer. Many people were\nnone the wiser when the dirty deed\nturned out to have been done by\nMrs Peacock, a sabbatical at Keele\nUniversity, but this did not detract\nfrom the general fun and frolics at\nthe massive party afterwards.\nShock, horror, oh my God! No\none quite realised how far Rag was\n(still is) prepared to go in the name\nof charity...jumping off a180 foot\ncrane with only a piece of elastic\nattached and actually enjoying it?\nBut then, the experience has been\ncompared favourably to sex, and at\nfour seconds is reputed to last\nlonger! No comment, but if there's enough public demand, Rag could\nbe persuaded to try it again...!\nMay 16th saw the long-awaited\nRag Fete, complete with coconut\nshy, balloon race and the major\nattraction, Gunge Wrestling.

For\ninstance, a group of dedicated\ncollectors turned up to six nights of\nSinatra concerts at the Royal Albert\nHall. Not only did everyone amass\nloads of do sh for Leukaemia\nResearch, but they also got the\nchance to see Cleo Lane and\nJohnnie Dankworth (na ff jazz\nsinger and better saxophonist), not\nto mention the great, the amazing\n'Frankie Boy' himself singing My\nWay and New York New York.\nJust goes to show that collecting has\nits perks.\nWell, so much for the quick rundown to this year's events.\nHopefully those of you that were\n'Mad, Silly and Part of It' have had\na laugh remembering some of the\nstupid things you got involved in,\nand those that didn't now have more\nidea of what to expect next year.\nLast year Rag was discreet, but next\nyear we're gonna be unavoidable.\n\u201424\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial Felix 939 24 June 1992\nI do not relish causing irritation,\nsurprising as it may sound. But this\nhas never stopped me from doing\nso if there is even so much as a smidgen of a reason to, real or\nimagined. Hence the oft-flung\nvitriol contained within these pages.\nI hope it was of some use.\nMany apologies are extended to\nthose who have!\nwho looks exactly\nextremely rude ani\ntends to come out o: stalk the Union,\nFelix Office, like a bear in pain. It's that Napoleon complex again.\nThe Union\nIt would be an over flK ment to,\nthat this has been ad paster, has run far from smoothly. It\nby four students w j|||| io pre\"\nexperience in finance, management\nor diplomacy, whose only\nqualification is the t fM t tOfu It action of the College'sst t xi laura_ It is expected that trs hfl H of about twenty ip le^^ lt\nhighly trained in their respective\nfields, all older and more\nexperienced and all held together by\nthree or four managers who have\nhad a lifetime's experience of\ngetting their own way. These\nadministrators have been given a brief to make the College more\ncost-effective, to commercial is e it,\nin effect. No doubt a caveat has\nbeen given that damage to student\nlife should be minimise d, but I suspect this comes quite low on the\nlist of priorities.\nThe purpose of the Union should\nbe defined, and once defined,\nadhered to. Is it to educate four\nstudents a year in the ways of\npolitics, or is it to forward student\nwelfare? The ability to decide this\nis yours; is the good fortune of one\nsabbatical candidate all you demand\nof your vote? Felix is here to inform\nyou of the machinations of bodies\nsuch as the Union, but we have, on\noccasion, met with intransigents.\nFor instance Dr Schroter, who is a fine Union Senior Treasurer, has\ntold me that he does not\ncommunicate with Felix 'on\nprinciple.' Dr Schroter is not alone\nin this reticence, but since he does\na good job, I find his view\nconfusing.\nIn much the same vein, it seems\nlikely that Mandy Hurford, the\nUnion Manager, will attempt Jo\nbring in a staff protocol next year,\nwhich will prohibit any Union\nmeeting or publication from\nmentioning Union staff. Seems\ninnocuous? It would effectively\nstifle all comment on the Union.\nThe reason given for this protocol\nis that staff complaints should 'go\nthrough the correct channels,'\nnamely the sabbaticals or the Union\nManager. The former will do\nnothing as they are unlikely to be\nau fait with man-management and\nthe latter will try to smooth the\nwaves and calm things down (a much-needed talent in a student\nunion), ie the whole issue would be\nfogged out. Even worse, the issue\nraised at a Union\nand lost forever in ak of forgiveness. I thought. As do most\nsaul ted Union Duty\nOfficers. This is the sort of thing the\nGovernment can point to as an\nof bad student\nwh i' example\nPi\nfir slid in i improved the standard oi\nimmeasurably. I hope\nenjoys the rest^n^h^ nme here.^\n^ rn^re^^f^n^ and more sensibly\nbecause quite soon it may have the\nfinancial rug removed from under\nit. All these faults and many more\nare only there because you let them\nbe. It is your responsibility, and you\nwill be responsible when you are\ndisenfranchised and bemoaning\nyour miserable lot because you\nwere a miserable lot.\nThe College\nI am afraid you cannot dismiss the\nCollege administrators as satanic\nhell-spawn and by so doing waive\nall responsibility. You can affect\nthem - it is just that it takes more\ntime and effort. They have a job to\ndo and they generally appear to do\nit well. It is unfortunate that in most\ncases their job descriptions run\ncounter to the needs of student\nwelfare, particularly accommodation. Why anybody would\nwant to run a department which\ncontrols the single most\nproblematic, expensive and vital\npiece of student life I cannot\nunderstand. I consider it obvious\nthat to do this job would inevitably\nresult in the reception of more than\nusual attention and insults. So, on\na personal basis, I apologise\nunconditionally to Mr Marshall for\nthe amount of grief he has had to\ntake, and I apologise to everybody\nin College residences with a legitimate grievance that more has\nnot been made of it. Such are the\nparadoxes of the job.\nYou may note the disparity in\nlength between the Union and\nCollege sections in this editorial. Is\nthis because I have greater\nsympathy with the College? No - it\nis because I know more about the\nUnion. College administrators are\nvery good at closing ranks - the\nCollege is not democratic. The\nUnion has managed to deal with the\noften bizarre attentions of its own\npress, and I feel credit must be\ngiven to the Union for being so\ndemocratic up until now. Likewise\ncredit should go to College'for\ndealing with Felix by completely\nignoring it, which is far more\neffective but much more frustrating\nfor both the researcher and the\nreadership.\nMany thanks are due to the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, for providing\nthe Felix Office with two\ndistribution trolleys at the beginning\nof the year. I hear tha\nj min j; this v ear's Fel\n(ie or two\n|tion have\nvas rather\ndic t ment.| a scalpel\nat once.\nThe CCUs\nThe phrase 'banana republic'\nsprings to mind when referring to\nthese wasteful anachronisms.\nRather like the monarchy, there is\nno reason why they should not exist\nif people want them, but I fail to see\nwhy they are given any sort of say\nin how the total organisation runs.\nThe only useful purpose they could\nserve would be through\ndepartmental representatives, which\nis excellent as far as it goes, but\ntends to be as erratic as you would\nexpect from a voluntary service.\nWhat other purpose do they\nserve? Surely all the clubs and\nsocieties could be financed as well,\nif not better, by ICU? They only\nexist because of the ancient origins\nof the College and they still uphold\nthe nineteenth century ideal and the\nJingoism of gentlemen's exclusive\nclubs, run by a few for the purposes\nof that same few. The playground\nof the socially inept and emotionally\nimmature, it is almost beyond belief\nthat elitist squads of MI5 rejects can\ngather ranks in the name of their bit\nof metal in order to steal someone\nelse's bit of metal. This pathetic\ntribalism seems to form the\npower base for juvenile politic king. This is fine if you want it, and I am\ncertainly guilty of some such, but\nI am not entirely sure that this is\nwhat taxpayers think they are\npaying for, bearing in mind the\npresent Government's attitude, all\nof us (including Felix) ought to start\nlooking towards greater efficiency.\nSt Mary's. The majority of St Mary's students\nare extremely anti-Imperial and\nespecially anti-ICU. Three years\nago I started to regularly attempt to\nresearch news stories relevant to St\nMary's.I noticed at the time that\nvery little was forthcoming - and\nthis disinterest has slowly grown\ninto contempt and aggression over\nthe intervening years. This has left\nme with the conclusion that they\nwish to be left alone and out of\nImperial College as a whole. I see\nno reason why this wish should not\nbe granted. St Mary's Student\nUnion were forced to join with ICU\nbecause the two college administrations wished to merge the two\ncolleges for financial reasons - there\nis no common ali ty between the\nstudent populations. I hope that\nJonty will do better, but I am afraid\nI have totally given up on them, and\nthis saddens me as they could add\nso much more to IC life.\nAnd so to the future.\nI don't know next year's Union\nOffice Sabbaticals very well, so I my comments are based on very\nlittle. Chris Davidson - next year's President - has been showing great\ninterest in Union affairs this term.\nThis is a very good sign and my\ninstincts tell me that he will be able\nto deal with the College - and Felix\n- in a more mature manner. This\nwill probably not be good news for\nFelix as we thrive on presidential\njuv en ilia. Rick Bilby - next year's Deputy President - has not been\nseen in weeks. Dom WilkinsonHon Sec (Events) - is still heavily\ninvolved in Ents and so should\nknow what that side of his job is all\nabout. My only concern is that as\nhe stood only on the second election\nhe may have doubts about wanting\nto do the job. Jonty Beavan - Felix\nEditor - has got a lot to learn about\nmore-or-less everything very\nquickly. But being intelligent and\nusually hard-working, I think he\nwill be able to do it.\nThe College will get a new\nRector, appointed not elected, who\nwill most likely be an opinionated\nauthoritarian carefully selected so\nas to minimise obstruction to the\nongoing cost cutting. The\ngovernment will institute a 'students\ncharter' which will contain the key\nwords 'democrat is e' and 'choice,'\nand will offer nothing but words\nand threats to paralyse most student\nunions. Polytechnics will become\nuniversities and increase\ncompetition for research and\ngovernment money.\nThe College will grind slowly\ncloser towards being a commercial\noperation, the students will still not\ncare a jot, remain wilfully ignorant\nof everything except their course\nand w hinge about things they could\ndo something about. In the words\nof Ford Prefect to the\nGolgafrinchans, 'you're going to go\nextinct. You know that don't you.'\nHow can I be so sure? Why because\nthe only people who will complain\nabout the negativity of this editorial\n- if anyone does - will be a few self-important hacks. The rest will not\nthink it applies to them.

The new scheme\nis expected to generate \u00a3100,000\nper annum for the College from\ncharges on weekend and evening\nusers. The franchise for the car park\nis now in the possession of\nIMPACT (Imperial Activities Ltd),\nwhich has a registered office on the\nfifth floor of the Sherfield building.\nFinancial sources have indicated\nthat this franchising arrangement\nmeans that the College may no\nlonger be liable for corporation tax\non income generated by the car\npark, and may also be able to waive\nVAT payments on car park related\nexpenditure. IMPACT and Axess\nManagement Ltd, the company who\nhave the tender for the car park\nmanagement, will be accountable to\nthe newly created post of Car\nParking Manager.\nSports Centre Shutdown\nSt Mary's students are reported to\nbe disgruntled with arrangements\nmade by Carolyne Osner, IC Sports\nand Leisure Manager, to replace the\nfacilities in the South Kensingtonbased College Sports Centre. The\nSports Centre is being extensively\nrenovated and will be closed until\nJanuary 1993. Ms Osner was\nmaking arrangements with St\nMary's, the University of London\nUnion, and sports centres in\nWandsworth, Westminster, and\nKensington and Chelsea so that\ndisruption during the renovation\nperiod would be kept to a minimum. She is on record as\nexpressing regret at the\n'unavoidable' closures.\nSt Mary's students have\nexpressed surprise at the demands\nthat Ms Osner placed on their\nfacilities, and one student said that\n'she didn't get most of what she\nwanted.' Senior students added that\nthey felt a duty to help the students\nin South Kensington, not the\ncollege. They said that they would\nwelcome any South Kensington\nstudents coming to Paddington.\n'Students coming to Mary's is\nalways useful.' said Simon\nStockhill, St Mary's Union\nPresident.\nThe Sports Centre renovation is\nbeing paid for by a \u00a3650,000 loan\nfrom the Harlington Trust. The\ntrust was set up in 1989 to oversee\nmoney raised from the sale of\ngravel extracted from the Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) owned\nHarlington playing fields. The\nfields were bought by ICU in 1936\nusing money paid to the Union in\nreturn for the War Memorial\nGround in Wembley, which was\nbought by the Union in 1918. The\nWar Memorial Ground was paid for\nby funds raised by the Union after\nthe First World War.\nThe War Memorial money was\nalso used to purchase the boat house and property in Putney. The\nCollege Executive committee is\nnow considering plans to refurbish\nthe boat house. The Sports Centre\nrenovation will provide increased\nchanging space room, more\nshowers, a sauna, steam room and\nan eight person pool side spa\n(Jacuzzi). There will also be a larger\ngymnasium and an exercise and\ntraining studio will also be\nprovided.\nSpeaking to yesterday's Union\nAnnual General Meeting, Zoe\nHellinger, ICU President,'defended\nher 'about face' on the Harlington\nfunding of the renovations. On 4th October. Ms Hellinger said that 'if\nthe Sports Centre intends to try and\ndig into Harlington Trust funds, the\nUnion will strongly contest it'. By\n5th June, she had changed her\nposition to believing 'an improved\nSports Centre would attract better\nstudents and provide improved\nsports facilities'. Speaking to the\nmeeting, Ms Hellinger said that in\nOctober, she 'didn't know the facts\nfirst time'. Ms Hellinger's decision\non allowing the use of Harlington\nmoney has been attacked privately\nby one of her fellow sabbaticals,\nwho pointed out that the Union is\nlosing approximately \u00a3400,000 in\ninterest on the loan.\nUnderground\nThere is speculation this week that\nthe College is considering the\nconstruction of an underground car\npark behind the Sports Centre. It is\nbe lei ved that the owner of the land\nunder which the car park would be\nbuilt has previously applied for\nplanning permission for this, but\nwas refused as there was\ninsufficient access to the ground.\nThe access to the land is owned by\nthe College. The College is be lei ved to be very interested in buying the\nland from its present owner.\nThis issue of Felix has three separate parts - News (blue header), Arts (black header) and Features (full colour photograph).\n\n"

During the\ntournament, the team received\nraving reviews by all who saw them\nin action. However, Cardiff took\nMary's into sudden death extra time\nin the final, but they held their nerve\nto win 21-18. The IC 1st XV also\nhad their finest season to date.\nHaving won the South-East title for\nthe fifth consecutive time, they beat\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nHospital 31-0 to win the Gutteridge\nCup, in a one sided contest.\nHowever, three days later, they\nwere beaten in the semi-final of the\nU AU championship by Durham.\nThis was the first time an IC rugby\nteam had ever ventured beyond the\nquarter-finals of the U AU a very\ndistinguished performance.\nThe IC women football team, aka\nThe Dribblers, also had a very\nsuccessful season. Having been\ndepleted of a few players (notably\nCaptain Permi) they were beaten in\nthe semi-final of the UL Cup by\nKings College. However, at full\nstrength, the Dribblers were a rampant team, over-running all in\ntheir path. In the end, the University\nLeague title rested on the final game\nof the season, against K CH. Victory\nfor either team would ensure them\nclaiming the championship. With\nthe defence working overtime, the\nDribblers managed to fight off an\nearly surge by K CH to take a20 lead at half time. The second half\nproduced some good skill by both\nteams, but the Dribbler increased\ntheir lead and finally ran out\nwinners 4-1. Together with the\nleague title, the Dribblers also\nsecured their title as top boat racers\nin London, with a fine display after\nthe game!\nOn a little reporting note, the\nDribblers were the only ACC club\nto provide regular match reports of\ntheir games throughout the year.\nTheir attitude was nothing less than\nexemplary.

    "content": "24 June 1992 Felix 939 News\nFifteen major hospitals will close\nand 5.000 beds will be axed,\naccording to a report issued\nyesterday. The report from the\n'Kings Fund Acute Services\nInitiative' says that inner city\nresidents have difficulty in getting\nstandard hospital treatment because\nof the concentration of specialist\nprovision in central London.\nEntitled 'London Health Care\n2010', the report calls for a radical\nshift of resources to keep London\nas a world centre for medicine.\nThe King's Fund, the largest\nindependent health research body in\nLondon, states that the general drift\nof people from central London has\nresulted in an expensive pattern of\nhealth care which is no longer\nsustainable. It recommends the\nconsolidation of London's medical\nresearch and teaching capacity into\nfour strong Faculties of Medicine\nwithin London University, and a reduction in the numbers of medical\nstudents in the capital.\nThe Goverment's Health\nSecretary, Virginia Bottomley, has\nwelcomed the report. 'The\nGovernment will not shirk from\nmaking difficult decisions on the\nfuture of London's health services,'\nshe said, repeating the message\nspelt out by junior minister Brian\nMawhinney last month. Labour's Shadow Health Minister, Robin\nCook, said that ministers were not\nhonest about London health policies\nbefore the election. 'The new\nmarket forces in the NHS are\ndriving London hospitals towards a cliff-face. Ministers must now\naccept the case for a planned\nstrategy for London's health\nservices'.\nThe report comes before the\nresults of the government's official\ninquiry into London health care are\npublished. The Tomlinson inquiry\nwas set up in October 1991 to\nexamine 'how London's health\ncare, medical education and\nresearch should be planned in the\n1990s.' Sir Bernard Tomlinson, a former chairman of the Northern\nRegional Health Authority, has\nbeen meeting with health\nauthorities, funding bodies, the\nLondon University, medical schools\nand teaching hospitals, and was\nexpected to report in November.\nThe publication of his report may\nnow be brought forward by the\nGovernment, in the light of the\nKing's report.\nThe conventional wisdom before\nthe King's report was that\nTomlinson would recommend the\nclosure of two hospitals and one\nmedical school. The left wing\npressure group, London Health\nEmergency (LHE), had said that St\nThomas' Hospital and Charing\nCross Hospital would close. These\nreports were vigorously dismissed\nat the time by the hospitals.\n'London Health Emergency are to\nhealth what the Socialists Workers\nare to politics' said a spokesman for\nSt. Thomas's.L HE forecast that the\nTomlinson inquiry would close\n2,000 beds, which can be compared\nto the figure of 5,000 quoted by\nKing's.L HE Campaigns Director,\nGeoff Martin, said yesterday that\nWestminster Medical School is\nexpected to move to the\nWestminster and Chelsea site.\nIC has been considering a merger\nbetween St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School and the Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool. In a paper to a recent\nCollege Executive Committee\nmeeting, Professor Peter Richards,\nDean of St Mary's, proposed the\nHospitals to Close\nThe new Westminster and Chelsea Hospital on the Fulham Road\nthe King's report was paving the\nway for Tomlinson. 'The Kings\nFund report will give an air of\nacademic respectability to the\ncarnage that is being set up for\nhealth services in London.' The\nL HE statement was dismissed by\nSimon Stockhill, president of St.\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nStudents Union, who called it 'pure\npropaganda', adding that the King's Fund report said 'nothing new.'\nAttention is now focusing on the\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nHospital on Fulham Palace Road,\nand the Westminster and Chelsea\nHospital, currently being built on\nthe Fulham Road. The new\nhospital, described by L HE as a 'drain on resources', is expected to\ntake over beds currently in the old\nWestminster and Charing Cross\nhospitals. The Charing Cross beds\nare to be taken by the Royal\nMarsden Hospital, the Brompton\nHospital, and the Hammersmith\nHospital, leading to the formation\nof a specialist cancer hospital on the\nCharing Cross site. Such a specialist\nhospital would be regarded as\ninappropriate for teaching purposes,\nand the Charing Cross and\nestablishment of an enlarged\nmedical school spanning the\nImperial College (South\nKensington), St Mary's( Paddington) and Westminster and\nChelsea (Fulham) sites. The\nproposal currently being considered\nis for the first two years of a medical course (the basic medical\ncourse) to be taught in the new\nImperial Cancer Research building\non the South Kensington site, with\nthe course being completed either\nin Paddington or Fulham. It has also\nbeen suggested that the management\nschool could be enlarged to teach\nhealth service management as part\nof a new medical course.\nProfessor Richards, currently a candidate for the post of Rector,\nregards the merger proposal in\nterms of IC taking the lead in\nmedicine in West London, and\nbecoming the centre of medical\nresearch and teaching in the area.\nHe has expressed the hope that a new School of Medicine would\nhave an annual intake of 250\nundergraduate students, and that the\nSchool would attract greater\nfunding from the Universities\nFunding Council for the College.\nThe closure of\nhospitals, the\nmerger of IC\nand the Charing\nCross &\nWestminster\nMedical School,\nand the\nTomlinson\nenquiry\n\u2014 3\n\n"

He reached\nforward, grabbed the club, leaned\nto the side and swung the ape man around him through the air. Totally\nlost for grunts the tribal leader arced\naround, lost his hold on the club and\nsailed straight into the far wall.\nThirteen skulls cracked, one with a squishy sound.\nStress lifted the club high to a wave roar from the crowd and\nstarted to move forward. Unable to\nmove his right leg he looked down\nto see a neanderthal wrapped\naround it trying to gnaw through the\narmoured leggings. Uttering a crazed laugh Stress threw himself\nforward on to his hands and flipped\nhimself into a forward somersault\nsending the very d is orientated ape man through the air and into the\nsecond row of the audience.\nUnfortunately he landed among the\nwerewolf supporters who began\nbarbecuing him for the victory\ncelebrations.\n'An incredible move there by the\nhalf-back leaves himself room to\nman oe vre though I don't see much\nsupport for him breaking through\nthe nea der thal pack.

Lined\nit with spikes and are standing\nbefore it with weapons they've\nsmuggled on to the pitch.'\n. Seeing the obstacle ahead Stress\ngathered pace and running at top\nspeed dived into a series of\nsomersaults, pulling out and up as\nhe hit the ground before the\ndefending neanderthals. Spinning\nthrough the air he planted his flying\nhands on the neanderthals heads and\npushed into a final dive, landing\nhim on the touch line beyond the\nbarricade.\nThe crowds' screams of applause\nturned into a shocked silence as\nStress pulled off the wolf mask and\nbegan walking towards the pedestal.\nThe silence around him was soon\nfilled with howls of anger and\nhatred as the crowds, unable to get\nbeyond the fences around the pitch,\nspat and shouted at the pale invader.\nAs Stress climbed the first of the\nsteps a commotion behind him\nmade him turn. One of the\nneanderthals had clambered through\nthe barricade and was charging at\nhim, spear in hand. Stress fired\npoint blank, sending the caveman\nstumbling back.

The\nPunisher of the evil ones fell\ntowards the ground in a smoking\nspiral of indecision and began\ncollecting information for an\naccurate and careful judgement of\nthe wrong-doer.

Stress fired back,\nleaving her to collapse in a heap and\nbegin crying.\nHe climbed the final steps and\nwas approaching the dias when\nsmoke billowing up from his hand\nmade him look down. The truth in\nhis hand was glowing red, spouting\nblack and white smoke as it\noverheated from excessive use. As\nStress started at it in indecision it\nexploded.\nPicking himself up from the floor\nhe brushed the smoke away and\nstaggered the final feet'to where the\nsymbol of the inner system,\nmounted at the centre of the grand\npedestal, needed only a twist to set\nthe changes rolling.

    "content": "News Review Felix 939 24 June 1992\nWith the consultations due to run\nout in a matter of days, the\nGoverning Body instructed that the\nconsultation period be extended 'by\nno more than a month in order to\nfacilitate an acceptable resolution'\nof the dispute. To further facilitate\na settlement, the Governors decided\nthat the Messenger and Security\ndispute should be resolved first, and\nthat the future of the Car Park\nwould be decided at a later stage.\nAn agreement in principle was\nreached, between management and\nunions, and protracted negotiations\nwere concluded in February, with\nthe Rector announcing a compromise, and the unions\nclaiming to have won the argument.\nThe results of the new security\nsystem are clearly visible, with new\nPrime Ministerial costumes, and\nplastic identity cards.\nWhither the car park? The unions\nbecame restless in April and May,\nNever has so\nmuch been\nwritten about so\nlittle\nbut the College was keeping mum.\nThey certainly weren't revealing\nthat the future of the car park had\neffectively been decided on 11 July\n1991, that tenders were being\naccepted around the time of the\nMPG meeting on 9 April 1992, and\nthat by the MPG meeting on 14\nMay, a tender from Axess\nManagement Ltd had been\naccepted. The story of the\nconcealed tender only became\npublic when Felix broke the story\non 5 June. Again this happened\nwithout consultation with any of the\nunions, but it apparently has the\nRector's tacit approval, so expect\nchanges soon.\nThe entire story behind the\nproposals is enmeshed in layers of\ncontradiction, subterfuge and\nignorance. John Payne was\ninvolved in the 1st November\ndiscussion which drew up the\n'redundancy' announcements. John\nPayne wrote to Mick Saul of NUPE\non 14 June, with the phrase 'it is not\nManagement's intention to fill\nvacancies with Contract staff.\nSteve Newbold, the College\nMarketing Director, said that the\nletter issued to staff detailing the\nconsultation timetable was not a redundancy notice, despite Gordon\nMarshall saying that 'a period of 90\ndays will elapse from the start of\nconsultations before the first\ndismissals take place'. Staff were\ntold that the car park was to be sold\noff on the recommendation of a consultant's report, even though the\nreport never being openly\ncirculated. All that was published\nwas Val Straw's interpretation of\nthe report, which may have been\ncoloured by her job description.\nMore sinister is the fact that the\nbrief or instructions given to the\nwith his arrest, and was described\nby another student newspaper as a 'militant atheist'. His latest project\nis to condemn the Education\nSecretary, John Patten, to eternal\ndamnation.\nIn Imperial College Union,\ndisagreement was just starting to\nboil over when Dan Shields, Social\nCultural and Amusements Board\n(SCAB) Treasurer, discovered he\ncould be financially liable for any\nlosses made by societies under his\ncontrol. After several heated\nexchanges, Mr Jonathan Griffiths,\nICU Deputy President, said, T was\nabout to hit the little shit'. The\nmatter was later resolved amicably.\nThe position of Honorary\na review that was critical of a Dramatical Society - Operatic\nSociety co-production of Grease,\nshe helped remove 3500. copies of\nFelix. She was then one of a group\nwhich replaced it after the show had\nfinished its run (See letters page).\nAlthough Ms Hellinger later\napologised for her actions, she did\nmanage her first appearance in\nnational media, when The\nIndependent covered the story in its\nDiary column.\nThe disappearance of Felix\ntriggered a number of events:\nRichard Eyers, Publications Board\nChairman, resigned in protest. His\nsuccessor, David Henderson-Begg,\nalso resigned later in the year,\nconsultants remain classified. After\nall, they could have been told to\nrecommend the sale of the car park,\nand ignore any evidence to the\ncontrary.\nThe full story may never be\nknown, as freedom of speech was\none of the first casualties of the\nsecurity dispute. Bruce Sayers and\nother academics were criticised by\nthe Rector for speaking out, and at\none stage the Rector imposed a 'discipline of silence' on\nmanagement and unions. Freedom\nof speech was also attacked in the\nother example of the role of the\ncensor this year. A former IC\nstudent Michael Newman was\narrested for trying to sell a blasphemous video to a member of\nthe Police force. Mr Newman told\nFelix that he was extremely satisfied\nSecretary (Events) has been held by\nmany esteemed and reasonable\npeople. But Mr Steve Farrant, this\nyear's holder, has brought more\npublicity to the post than any other\noccupant. Mr Farrant managed to\nget a warning from the Police after\nwalking naked, tied to another man,\nbetween Harrods and Imperial\nCollege during the Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump for Rag. An\ninnocent piano became the object of\nMr Farrant's affections in the spring\nterm. While relaxing in the Union\nBuilding Mr Farrant made a throwaway comment about the state\nof the piano which resulted in an,\nas yet, unidentified group of people\ndestroying the instrument.\nBut Mr Farrant's excesses were\noutdone a week later by his fellow\nSabbatical Zoe' Hellinger. Upset by\nquoting 'immature behaviour' in the\nUnion Office as the source of his\nfrustrations. The only candidate to\nfill this gap is Hugh Eland; Mr Eland did not care to comment on\nwhen he would resign if elected to\nthe post.\nThe other Grease-related event\nwas the Trappist Monk syndrome,\nto wit, the mysterious silence of the\nnotorious Gavin Pearson during the\ntheft of Felix. Mr Pearson arrived\nin the Felix Office after the theft,\nstating he had been threatened by\nTim Proctor, President Of City and\nGuilds Constituent College Union.\nLater that week he denied all\nknowledge of the allegations. Mr Proctor, whose constituent college\nunion (CCU), along with the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union had\nfinancially underwritten part of the\n\u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1992 Felix 939 News Review\nWorking party on Residences.\n'Embarrassing' was one response to\nthis report. 'A load of crap' was\nanother. Apparently, the draft copy\nof the document contained 8 pages\nof errors concerning the residence\nsituation.\nFelix ran a lead story on the\napparent disagreements in the\nSherfield building about the cost of\nFurse House. Unfortunately, the\nonly sentence in the entire piece that\ndid not contain a qualifying word\nmeant that Prqfessor Geoff New\nwas dragged to the Managing\nDirector's Office like an insolent\nschoolboy. It is not for us to suggest\nthat Mr Fraser is an intolerant bully.\nWhat was Professor New's crime?\nHe had refused to comment on a rumour contained in the story.\nClearly Professor New is in the\nwrong job; if he were a Civil\nServant this behaviour would surely\nbe rewarded by a Knighthood.\nEstates is now on the job, and is\nconsidering a suitable replacement\nfor Southside. A feasibility study is\nnow being conducted into the\nplacing of cardboard boxes on the\nStrand. Tenders from Thames or\nLondon Weekend Television are\nespecially welcome.\nBlatant fraud occurred in the\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nbuilding in the first term, and not\nin the first floor office. Several bank\nnotes with the words 'forgery' in\nlarge red letters stamped on them\nwere taken in the Union Bar.\nInnocent students were said to be\nusing them unaware of what they\nwere. This is not surprising.\nStudents do not have money for\nlong enough to remember what it is.\nIf you do have some, then hide it,\nas you will not see it again for some\ntime.\nBlatant fraud\noccurred in\nImperial College\nUnion\nChristmas came late to Imperial\nCollege. In February, the\nUniversities Funding Council\n(UFC) awarded a19.7% increase\nin the research money the College\nreceives, this being the largest\namount to any single University. In\nMay this award was cut to just\n14.6% due to funding error by the\nUFC. The ever modest Rodney\nEastwood, Director of Planning, so\neloquent in his praise of Imperial in\nFebruary, made himself unavailable\nfor comment to the Times Higher\nEducational Supplement when this\nnews broke. To get round this, the\nHigher came to Felix for\ninformation, and in return they\npublicised the great Felix jumble\nsale, still running at a Felix office\nnear you.\nAiling research funding was\ngiven another knock when Her\nMajesty's government suggested\nthat charities should be charged up\nto 40% extra for work done in\nUniversity labs. This increase was\nsupposedly to cover administration\ncosts, and it was suggested that it\nwould lead to more money for\nresearch institutes. The charities\ndidn't see the increase with such\nclarity, and raised trite points such\nas 'we are not going to pay more\nfor the same research'. Indeed, they\nsuggested that the measure would\nlead to 40% being cut from funding\nbudgets. Developments are\nawaited.\nThe most subtle cost-cutting\nmove came on 7th November when\nall Messenger, Security and Car\nPark (MSCP) staff received a letter\nfrom Gordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, informing them that the\nCollege would no longer be\nrequiring their services. Mr Marshall told them that their jobs\nwould be contracted out to private\ncompanies, and that consultations\non 'staffing reductions' would begin\nthe next morning. Of course, the\nstaff were not being issued with\nredundancy notices. They were just\ntold that 'a period of 90 days will\nelapse from the start of\nconsultations before the first\ndismissals take place'.\nThe plans for contracting out or\n'outsourcing' of MSCP services\nwere drawn up in a paper submitted\nby Val Straw to the College\nManagement Planning Group\n(MPG) on 19 April 1991. This\npaper was revised by Gordon\nMarshall, and resubmitted to MPG on 27 September. The anticipated\nnegotiations with the unions and\nnotifications of redundancies were\ndiscussed by Caroline Fox, John\nPayne and Val Straw on 1st November. Marshall told the staff\non 7th November.\nThose unions affected, the\nManufacturing Science and Finance\nUnion (MSF) and the National\nUnion of Public Employees\n(NUPE), immediately called strike\naction. An unofficial lightning\nstrike was held on 8th November,\nand this was followed by a24 hour\nstoppage on 4th December. College\nentrances were picketed, and\nImperial was described by the\nUnions as 'quieter than Christmas\nDay'. The strike was timed to\ncoincide with a meeting of the\nGoverning Body, and the MSCP\ndispute was discussed at length by\nthe Governors Body. The meeting\nwas attended by only one Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) sabbatical\nofficer, Jonathan Griffiths, the\nDeputy President. Both Zoe\nHellinger, ICU President, and Steve\nFarrant, ICU Hon Sec (Ents),\nrefused to cross the picket line\noutside the Rector's residence.\nSir Eric Ash, the Rector, and Sir\nFrank Cooper, the Chairman of the\nGoverning Body, went outside to\ntalk to the pickets, and were\npresented with a petition. Inside,\nAngus Fraser, College Managing\nDirector, set out what he saw as the\nbackground to the dispute, and said\nthat trade unions had been supplied\nwith all the information they had\nrequested to make an in-house bid.\nHe added that a union in-house bid\nhad been rejected by the college\nbefore the meeting of the Governing\nBody.\nAlan Taylor-Russell, of the\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(AUT) said that the MSC P dispute\nwas 'no ordinary trade dispute', and\nthat it was 'a culmination of a number of events which had led to\na rift between senior management\nand the rest of the College'. This\nhad been evident for some time.\nProfessor Bruce Sayers, the Dean\nof City and Guilds, had written to\nMr Fraser in November drawing\nhis attention to the 'brutality' and\n'impertinence of Gordon Marshall',\nand deploring 'functionaries who\nhave nothing but rote learned skills\nto offer'. This letter mysteriously\nmade its way to the front page of\nthe Guardian. What particularly\nincensed Professor Sayers was\nGordon Marshall's opinion that the\nnewly recruited officers would be\n'appropriately trained and loyal to\nImperial College', which was\nregarded as an implicit questioning\nof the loyalty of 'long serving and\ndedicated' staff. 'These factory\nfloor manoeuvres are wholly\nunworthy,' he wrote.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
