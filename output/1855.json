    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | Comment 25 October 2024\nT\nhe sun has finally set on the British\nEmpire, from Adamstown to Akrotiri, for the first time since 1763. After\ndecades of maintaining its claim, Britain\nhas decided to hand over the Chagos Archipelago (a smattering of 60 islands in\nthe Indian Ocean) to Mauritius and pay\nthem for the privilege of pinching this\nvital strategic asset from us. This sharp\npolitical U-turn (which started under Liz\nTruss) isn\u2019t some justified surrender to\nMauritius and the entire \u2018debate\u2019 hinges\non a ridiculously paper-thin claim by\nthem. The reality is that the connection\nbetween Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago is tenuous at best.\nBritain annexed both Mauritius and\nthe Chagos Islands from France back\nin 1814, and continued the previous administrative arrangement. The Chagos\nIslands were sparsely populated, and\ndaily operations were handled by local\nplantation managers. For legal matters, a\nmagistrate from Port Louis would sail out\ntwice a year to handle cases. Fast forward\nto 1965 when Britain was eagerly shedding her colonies. Mauritius\u2019 main party\nagreed to ceding the islands in exchange\nfor \u00a33 million, a defence agreement and\nno independence referendum. \u201cLondon\n[had forced] its own will for decoloni-sation [sic] on a [...] reluctant territory\u201d\nwrote the historian John M. Ostheimer\n(who wrote a book on the political histories of the western Indian Ocean).\nMauritius has cloaked its claim to the\nChagos Islands in rhetoric, focusing on\nthe displacement of Chagossians from\n1968 to 1973 to make way for a UK-US\nmilitary base on the island of Diego Garcia. While no one was forcibly removed\nat gunpoint, Britain effectively displaced\nits own citizens by closing plantations\nand shipping islanders to Mauritius and\nSeychelles, where they were dumped into\nslums. The UK provided \u00a3650,000 for\nresettlement, but the Mauritian government delayed action; inflation ate away\nmost of their compensation, and the\nMauritian PM blamed \u201c\u00celois [Chagossian]\nindolence.\u201d Despite a further \u00a34 million\nfrom the UK in 1982, Chagossians continued to face poverty, housing discrimina-tion, and racial bias from the South Asian\nmajority.\nWhen Tony Blair offered the Chagossians British citizenship in 2002, they\naccepted eagerly. By 2022, the Chagossian population in Mauritius was about\n3,500, meaning Crawley in West Sussex\nnow boasts the largest Chagossian community in the world. The Chagossians\u2019\nloyalty isn\u2019t ambiguous: even Mauritian\nPresident Caseem Usteem admitted that\nthe vast majority of Chagossians would\nchoose Britain in a referendum. \u201cWe are\nBritish, and we want to remain British,\u201d\nchanted protests outside Westminster re-cently. Wanting to understand their mo-tivations, I went and talked to those who\nhad come to protest. When I asked about\nthe issue of sovereignty, the response was\nunanimous: \u201cWe are British citizens\u201d\nsaid one lady, who seemed to be leading a\nsmall group of protestors, \u201cwho have suffered immensely\u201d. Everyone else I talked\nto echoed similar sentiments. Mauritian\nsovereignty was treated as something\nludicrous, as if I had proposed giving the\narchipelago to Mordor. The Chagossians\nhave long cherished their British iden-tity. In the 1950s, Sir Robert Scott, the\nBritish Governor of Mauritius, was greeted by islanders waving Union Jacks. In\n1976, a Sunday Times journalist tracked\nthem down in the slums of Mauritius and\nnoted portraits of Queen Elizabeth II in\nnearly every Chagossian home. Scientist\nCharles Sheppard met a few displaced\nChagossians working in shops on Diego\nGarcia and asked one what they would do\nif they finally resettled under Mauritian\nrule: \u201cRaise the Union Jack.\u201d\nDiego Garcia, the largest island in\nthe Chagos Archipelago, hosts NSF Diego Gacia (a vital UK-US military base\nin the Indian Ocean) and was essential\nfor bombing operations in Afghanistan\nand Iraq. Its isolation and strategic location shields it from conventional ballistic threats and allows control over key\nglobal trade routes like the Cape of Good\nHope and the Straits of Hormuz. While\nMauritius proposes leasing the base for\n99 years, these agreements are fragile as\nseen with U.S. base closures in the Philippines and Libya. Or as legal scholar Yuan\nZi Yhu notes: \u201cSovereignty is very pow-erful; a lease isn\u2019t.\u201d With Mauritius\u2019 ties\nto Beijing, Diego Garcia\u2019s security could\nalso be easily compromised.\nUnder Britain\u2019s stewardship, the Chagos Archipelago\u2019s pristine 640,000 km\u00b2\nMarine Protected Area (MPA) is a haven\nfor over 800 fish species, 300 types of\ncoral, and thriving shark, sea turtle, and\nbirdpopulations.It\u2019soneofthehealthiest\nreef systems globally, with fish levels six\ntimes higher than other comparable protected areas. Thanks to a strict \u2018no-take\u2019\npolicy, overfished stocks have rebound-ed, and scientists Pippa Gravestock and\nCharles Sheppard value these efforts\nat over \u00a31 billion. Mauritius, whose 21\nMPAs are sixty thousand times smaller\nand poorly managed, threatens this suc-cess. With plans to lift fishing bans and\na record of reef destruction, the future of\nChagos is at risk.\nThe fundamental reason we should\nkeep the BIOT (British Indian Ocean Territory) is because, as then Conservative\nMP Paul Bristow summed up: \u201cdespite\neverything\u2014and everything we have\ndone to them\u2014Chagossians are proud to\nbe British\u201d. It would be nice to finally give\nthem a reason to be proud by allowing\nthem to resettle in their homes, or in the\nshorter term, to make the most of their\nlives here through some form of monetary support. The Chagossians are British\nand deserve the same rights and protections every other British citizen gets. We\nmust defend our islands, our people, and\nour rights; if necessary, we should be prepared to do so alone.\nCOMMENT\nCommentsWriter\nAATISH GRIDHARAN\nThe Chagos deal is a betrayal of Britain\nThe recent decision to give away the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius\nis an environmental, strategic and legal disaster that betrays the\nChagossians.\nWe must defend our\nislands, our people,\nand our rights; if\nnecessary, we should\nbe prepared to do so\nalone\n\u201c\n\n"

Unbeknown to them,\nthe specialist, Levin Kydford, came from the Physics\nDepartment at Imperial College London. His process\ninvolves explaining the science behind free kicks, long\ncross-field passes, and corners to the players. We decided to get in contact with the goalkeeping coach to see if\nthey were also looking to employ this method.\n\u201cLev has been setting the boys four problem sheets a\nweek, but the lads already abandoned two of the modules by week two,\u201d said Ren Boberts, current Chelsea\ngoalkeeping coach, also previously working for Brighton. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using this for goalkeeping, because the\nlong and short of it is, we just lump it up the pitch, mate.\u201d\nKydford wrote his undergraduate BSc project during\nhis time at Brighton Polytechnic on \u201cAnalysing the Kinematic and Aerodynamics of Free Kicks and Long-Range\nCrossfield Passes in Association Football: A Comprehensive Computational and Experimental Study\u201d. The\nstudy involves multiple simulations using Python, Fifa\n06, and experiments using a foosball table, yet we could\nnot find mention of any practicals involving men on a\nphysical pitch. Kydford took an extensive look at previous data from White Hart Lane, the late Spurs stadium,\nwhere there seemed to be a proliferation of goals conceded by the home team from corners.\nTo understand the art of free kicks, NegaFelix reached\nout to two football players renowned for their success\nwith them, to gather their perspective. When asked\n\u201cso what do you think of physics?\u201d, football legend\nDave Peckham answered \u201cI loved physical education in\nschool.\u201d We then followed with further clarification and\ngathered the response \u201call I learned is what goes up must\ncome down \u2013 Newton\u2019s fourth law of Norwich City.\u201d Although we managed to secure a quote from Thames Alexander-Ronald, unfortunately none of our interviewers could decipher what the Scouser was saying.\nChelsea \u201csoccer\u201d fans have mixed feelings on this\ntactic. When approached outside Fulham Broadway\nstation, many quoted \u201cI don\u2019t know which way we\u2019re going\u201d, revealing the uncertainty felt, feeling the need for\n\u201cdirection\u201d. We conducted a simple survey and found\nthat there was only 55% satisfaction among fans with\nthe Imperial College Physics lecturer.\nChelsea\u2019s decision to target Brighton\u2019s expertise becomes clearer when examining the numbers behind\nlong term set-piece success. Felix have compiled a table\nranking a selection of relevant clubs by the number of\ngoals arising from set pieces, to highlight the results of\nthis theoretical football approach. To further contex-tualise these numbers, we have also provided the net\nspending per goal scored from set pieces over the 20/21-23/24 seasons in GBP.\nChelsea FC have signed Levin for a forty-year con-tract.\nCATNIP\nChelsea FC feel the Blackett\nBlues\nCatnipWriter\nNEGAFELIX\nPremier poachers dribble over the peer-reviewed\nClub Free\nKicks\nCorners Goal\nKicks\nManchester City 21 17 3\nLiverpool 18 12 1\nBrighton 18 11 2\nSouthampton 12 3 0\nIpswich 11 2 1\nChelsea 9 2 1\nClub Net spend per goal scored\nfrom set pieces (\u00a3)\nChelsea 51,000,000\nManchester\nCity\n12,000,000\nLiverpool 8,000,000\nSouthampton* 3,000,000\nIpswich* 2,900,000\nBrighton 1,500,000\n*includes Championship data\nSpecial thanks this week\nA special mention to Jilbert Gackson for bringing \u201cCum\u201d into fruition.

All groups had\na thorough lack of live band, and it would have been\ngreatly appreciated had they subverted the genre by\nentirely disregarding it. However, one tradition was\nnotably missed; it was particularly disappointing that\nthere was no riff off between any of the groups. One\nsmall member of The Stethoscopes brought an overly\nenthusiastic, joyful energy to the stage. However, this\nwas overlooked by the group members, as they seemed\nto be more focused on one particularly attractive ginger fellow.\nMy knowledge of East Asian pop prior to this night\nwas limited to incredibly sexy feminine boys and bad-die girls, making bisexuality non-negotiable, but Pop\nof East Asia Society raised my opinion. One may have\nheard that \u201cthere is always an Asian student out there\nbetter than you\u201d, and these bandmates through practice,\nhard work, and talent certainly ensured this, but I would\nlike to extend this to say \u201cthere is always a student in\nPEASoc fitter than you.\u201d\nNext up was Siana Dongwriter, a mysterious dirty\nblonde with a serious case of middle-class voice. While\nthe second song was lyrically impeccable, the third was\nmy favourite, and had me creating a parasocial relationship with the cleverly intimate songwriter, noting to\ntake a good stalk of the gram later on.\nThere were then various metal and \u201calternative\u201d\nbands \u2013 so many that they formed an alloy. Cum created\nthe sound of a rabbit holding a dagger emerging out of a\npigeon wearing batman\u2019s cape, one I was not previously\nfamiliar with, and was not sure I wished to be.\nSmall Band had a 45 minute set. What was intended\nto be a Tuxedo Junction was giving finance bro function.\nThere were no bleeding hands from the drummer, or\nany throwing of chalk, unfortunately. Though their incredible musical talent gave me whiplash, I would have\nappreciated some more theatrics. Yet, their love was for\nsale, and I bought it.\nThe finale set by the DJ performer was what you\nwould expect from a DJ in South Kensington studying at\nImperial College. Overall, a touching night.\nArts night: all transition\nmetals, few noble gases\nEx-CatnipEditor\nJUBY ROY\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nThis week you practise\nyour Arts Night set\nwith your band and the\nsubdominant quickly\nbecomes the power\nbottom.\nThis week you offer\n$1 million a day to\none random swinger if\nthey vote for you in the\nAutumn Election.\nThis week you eat\neverything with a spoon\nso everything tastes like\nspoon all week.\nThis week you re-enact\nthe Last Supper.

Aaron, the Head\nof Music at ICRadio, explains how the\nevent draws in students with diverse\ninterests.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about DJ-ing or playing\nmusic,\u201d Aaron says. \u201cWe have people\nwho are producing their own music live,\nor even students who are just passionate\nabout sharing ideas. For example, we\nhave two students, Erika and Lily, who\nare running a live dating show. It\u2019s all\nabout giving people a space to express\nthemselves in different ways.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just about what happens\non stage. Behind the scenes, ICRadio\nbrings together people with a wide\nrange of skills\u2014from graphic design to\nsound engineering\u2014to make ICRadio\nand Modulate happen. \u201cWe have PhD\nstudents maintaining the equipment,\npeople working on the website, and\nothers doing promotional materials,\u201d\nAndres adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a real team effort.\u201d\nA community through music\nWhat really sets Modulate apart is the\nsense of community it promotes. For\nstudents who might feel isolated in the\nhigh-pressure academic environment\nof Imperial, the event offers a much-needed creative outlet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a night out; it\u2019s about\nbuilding connections and giving people\nthe chance to meet others who share\nsimilar interests,\u201d Andres explains. \u201cYou\ncome to Modulate, and you meet people\nwho are into underground music, who\nwant to DJ, or who just want to be part of\nsomething creative.\u201d\nDavid echoes this feeling, noting\nthat Modulate is more than just a\nstudent event. \u201cIt\u2019s a showcase of the\ntalent we have here at Imperial, and it\nbrings together students from different\nbackgrounds,\u201d he says. \u201cEven students\nwhoaren\u2019tfamiliarwithelectronicmusic\nor DJ-ing come along for the atmosphere\nand end up enjoying themselves.

What\ndoes it indicate now to have a degree or to\nbe a student? Anecdotally, a lot of academics on Twitter/X are recounting stories of how students in\nthe US are discovering innovative ways to cheat using AI,\nwhich coincidentally is the second-best use case anyone\nhas found beyond detecting cancers. A recent article in\nThe Atlantic suggested that students at elite universities\nare unable to cope with the demand of reading several\npapers and books for their courses, and everyone is suffering as a result.\nThis issue is neither surprising nor unexpected \u2013 with\ndegrees being the skill barrier into higher paying jobs, and\na commercialisation of education as a service, a university\neducation is no longer is a liberator, but instead a barrier\none must overcome to try and live a better life. I suspect\nthe same thing happens in Britain. Drawing upon personal\nexperience, one of the biggest concerns my peers and I\nhad was the cost. Student loans in England, are extremely\nhigh, and in my neck of the woods, the idea of moving\naway and encumbering yourself with loans, which despite\nthe somewhat reasonable adjustments, still feel punitive\nfor those from poorer backgrounds who will have more to\npay, despite being most worthy for some level of forgiveness or loan free education.\nThe experience at universities isn\u2019t much fun.\nGrowing up, the prospect of a degree was sold rather\nthan encouraged to my cohort of disinterested students.\nThis week, Felix has spent a lot of time looking at Excel\nspreadsheets and tables trying to figure out how exactly\nstudents, or paying customers for what is ultimately a ser-vice, feel about their degree.\nComing from an low socio-economic city (without\ndoxxing myself, it is one of the poorest cities in England),\nwe were constantly bombarded with the messaging that\nthe only \u201creal\u201d way out of this West Yorkshire shithole was\nto go to university. I was basically groomed into applying\nto Oxford; teachers would ask when, not if, I would apply.\nAs a 16-year-old, I didn\u2019t understand the material, mental,\nand physical cost of going to university, especially one so\nfar away.\nOn the other hand, I can empathise with international\nand privately educated students (those who could afford\nto pay a lot for their education), and even the middle-class\nparents (those goddamn relocations to get your children\ninto that grammar with really good Oxbridge admission\nstatistics mustn\u2019t have been cheap).\nAnd then when you finally arrive, all bright-eyed, excited to learn, the reality is a slightly different to what one can\nimagine. Imperial College is, as of right now, a research\nuniversity first and foremost. It doesn\u2019t really matter what\nhappens to the poor undergrads paying money into their\ninstitutions. They\u2019re here to pay, suffer, graduate, and maybe stay on if they\u2019re good enough. Imperial almost boasts\nabout how bad it is, and this trickles down to students and\nhow they treat each other.\nThe Higher Education sector is like many others \u2013 mis-managed. Reliant on short-term funding fixes, chugging\nby on a skeleton crew of overworked staff, and ever reliant\non successive governments who still think austerity is the\nmagic fix to the country\u2019s problems, it is no small wonder\nwe somehow have one of the most highly reputed sectors in the world. Imperial, as many students love to boast,\nis highly prestigious, and rightfully so for research. There\nneeds to be a lot more transparency on what this actually\nentails and who it benefits. I know I was sold my place\nbased on rankings.\nOn balance, it isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of academics.\nMost of these people have managed to have extremely\nsuccessful careers learning (and doing) STEM and it\u2019s\nreflected in the passion we see as students throughout\nour times here. But it\u2019s also important to reflect on the\nfact that the vast majority of academic staff have achieved\nthese careers with relatively few setbacks \u2013 many of them\nwere probably prodigies in their own time, lauded across\ntheir time as students. It\u2019s tough to take feedback on the\none thing you\u2019ve excelled at all your life from snot-nosed,\nfreshly independent adults who still can\u2019t regulate bedtime or drinking. But sometimes taking in that feedback\nand looking at the big picture is the best and most honourable thing you can do.\nOr you could turn a blind eye of course, and deal with\nfalling ratings in successive ranking systems, and plenty\nof material for Felix to write about.\n\n"

First premiered on 1st\nSeptember 2022 on Amazon Prime, the series just\nclosed out its second season, with the finale airing on 3rd\nOctober. This season, like\nthe first, has been quite an unsettling jour-ney, with underdeveloped characters and\nweak plot lines. Of course, it\u2019s quite a task\nto please the original fanbase; that being\nsaid,theentireshowwasstillgenuinelyen-joyable to watch with its fantasy elements\nlinkedtoTolkien\u2019soriginalworks,aswellas\nits Hollywood-level cinematic excellence.\nSince the show follows various, and at\ntimesconfusing,narrativesindifferentre-gions across Middle-earth during its Second Age (nearly five thousand years before the setting of The Lord of the Rings),\nhere are some key takeaways from each\nsection focusing on this season\u2019s finale.\nN\u00famenor\u2019s power struggle\nWhile the entire N\u00famenor plot line of this\nseason seemed to focus on predictable\npower struggles between Elendil, M\u00edriel,\nand Pharaz\u00f4n, it is likely that N\u00famenor\nwill play a more significant role in the\nnext season. To those unfamiliar with the\nlore, N\u00famenor is quite significant: Sauron\nwill certainly play a part in its future, and\nsoon. For this season, the power dynamics\nseemed quite vague \u2013 the finale portrays\nPharaz\u00f4n using a random scroll to decry\nthe Valar\u2019s Faithful as Sauron\u2019s allies and\narrest them when M\u00edriel had just swam\nwith the Sea Worm to rise in power. Another source of confusion came perhaps\nfrom a lack of understanding of scale and\nhow many Faithful (including Elendil)\nthere were compared to the King\u2019s Men\n(with Pharaz\u00f4n). However, one of the\nmost memorable scenes of the finale included the appearance of the Narsil sword\ngiven to Elendil by M\u00edriel. Those who have\nwatched the movies will realise that this\nsword, forged by the dwarf smith Telchar,\nbecomes Aragorn\u2019s sword Andr\u00fail when it\nis reforged by the Elves millenia later. This\nscene drew many parallels to the scene in\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\nwhere Aragorn unsheaths Andr\u00fail for the\nfirst time, evidently as fan service. This\nalso makes sense considering that they\nare very much alike since Aragorn tries to\nredeem himself from Isildur\u2019s failure and\nreturn to the glory of Elendil\u2019s days.\nMeanwhile, Kemen \u2013 Pharaz\u00f4n\u2019s son \u2013\narrives in Pelargir. Pelargir is a N\u00famenorean colony, in which Isildur \u2013 son of\nElendil \u2013 sought refuge after everyone in\nN\u00famenor thought he was dead. Kemen\nrefers to the southlanders in Pelargir as\n\u201clow men\u201d and demands timber supply\nby saying that \u201cthey\u2019re only trees\u201d. This\nphrase hints at a reappearance of the\nEnts \u2013 one of the highlights of this season\n\u2013 in the next, which I personally favour.\nThe \u201cGrand-elf\u201d and the Harfoots\nThis story line, for me, was full of missed\nopportunities and did not live up to the\nexpectations set by the original films.\nEven in the first season, I wasn\u2019t a fan of\nwhat their descendants, the Hobbits, rep-resented. We found out in the finale episode that the wizard, previously known\nas \u201cThe Stranger\u201d, was indeed Gandalf\nfrom The Lord of the Rings. We see him\nmaking the connection and learning his\nname when referred to as \u201cGrand-elf\u201d\nfrom the Stoors after saving them from\nthe Dark Wizard. Here, the show deviates\nfrom Tolkien\u2019s books, as there Gandalf\narrives around the first millennium of\nthe Third Age, and this name is given to\nhim by men in the north. Nevertheless,\nthe viewers finally got to see him gain his\npowers and find his staff.\nThe Dark Wizard initially tries to\nconvince Gandalf to take over Sauron together and become his successors. He explains that they are part of the five Istari,\nor wizards, sent by the King of the Valar\nto Middle-earth to combat Sauron, and\nthat Gandalf was the one who convinced\nhim to reside in the wastelands of Rh\u00fbn.\nHe reveals Nori and Poppy, who were\ncaptured by the Rh\u00fbnic nomads under\nhis command, and even kills one of his\nown followers to try to convince Gandalf.\nThis scene simply made me think that\nthe Dark Wizard might end up being revealed as Saruman from The Lord of the\nRings, which would be a shame. I say this\nbecause it would\u2019ve been much cooler if\nThe Stranger turned out to be Saruman,\nsince he wasn\u2019t always portrayed as evil\nbefore The Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, Nori\u2019s sympathy towards the dead\nnomad was one of many instances where\nit felt considerably less impactful compared to those of the Hobbits. Indeed,\none of the famous quotes from Gandalf\u2019s\nconversation with Frodo in The Lord of\nA recap of the latest season of The\nLord of the Rings spin-off, as well as\nwhat\u2019s next to come.\nFILM&TV\nThe Rings of\nPower: Season 2\nTVWriter\nSIJUNG LEE\n\n"

It is mentioned that\nDurin\u2019s brother has been gaining support to claim the\nthrone, as well as some information that the Dwarves\nof the Blue Mountains wish to collect their rings in exchange for their vast tributes.\nLight and Darkness in Eregion\nThe culmination of the finale took place in Eregion \u2013 the\nElven realm ruled by the legendary smith Celebrimbor,\ngrandchild of F\u00ebanor. At this stage, Sauron has taken\ncontrol of the city disguised as Annatar (Lord of Gifts),\nmanipulating Celebrimbor to forge the nine rings for\nmen and leading the Elves to believe that Celebrimbor\u2019s mind was lost. While there were some spectacular\nscenes from this episode, my personal favourite was the\ndynamics between Celebrimbor \u2013 played by Charles Edwards \u2013 and Annatar \u2013 played by Charlie Vickers. Just\nbefore his death after being tortured by Sauron, Celebrimbor tells him that the rings of power will end up being his downfall, referring to him as \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d.\nElves predicting the future before death is a common\ntheme in the Tolkien lore, and Sauron seemed genuinely\nsurprised by this notion of self-destruction.\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear to the viewers before, the finale finally\nportrays the death of Adar, betrayed by his own orcs whom\nhegenuinelycaredfor.ThiswasallpartofSauron\u2019sorchestrated plan, of course, to get the orcs to join his side during\ntheir invasion of Eregion. It truly was unsettling to watch\nAdar get stabbed by his own \u201cchildren\u201d while Galadriel just\nstood there, neither helping nor running away, even after\nAdar promised her eternal peace by handing her the Elven ring. This leads us to the scene where Sauron faces off\nGaladriel; here, Sauron shape-shifts each into Halbrand,\nGaladriel, and Celebrimbor to get into Galadriel\u2019s mind.\nThe end of this duel results in Sauron stabbing her with\nthe Morgul crown, seizing the nine rings from her posses-sion. Galadriel then somehow thinks it\u2019s a good idea to fall\noff the cliff with her ring, and Gil-galad \u2013 High King of the\nElves \u2013 tries to save her soul from falling into the Shadow\nRealm. In The Lord of the Rings, there is a similar wound\nwhen Frodo gets stabbed by one of the Morgul-blades,\nwhich makes me wonder if the show will reveal that Sauron forged the Morgul-blades from the crown. Another interesting object is F\u00ebanor\u2019s hammer in the hands of Sauron\nafter he defeats Galadriel, suggesting that he may use it to\nmake the One Ring. Sauron\u2019s ruthlessness without mercy\nwas shown well in this episode as well, even killing the orc\nwho betrayed Adar without particular reason.\nThe show ends with Galadriel alongside Elrond,\nArondir, and Gil-galad amongst dozens of defeated Elves\nin a sanctuary protected by the power of the Elven rings.\nThe wide shot of this scene indicates that the sanctuary is evidently the Valley of Imladris, more commonly\nknown as Rivendell. After all, as Celebrimbor says, \u201cit is\nnot strength that overcomes darkness but light. Armies\nmay rise, hearts may fail, but still light endures.\u201d\nSelina Ye\n\n"

Biological Sciences\nreceived similarly unfavourable results, including the\nposition of being the lowest ranked UK department\nin \u201cStudent Voice\u201d following a plummet of 19 pp from\n2023.\nSimilar trends can be observed in the Faculty of Engineering. Civil Engineering experienced a significant\ndrop in virtually all themes: as well as \u201cAssessment and\nFeedback\u201d the department fell in \u201cStudent Voice\u201d by\nalmost 20 pp, two themes\nthat did not rank highly in\nthe previous year\u2019s survey.\nThe percentage of good\ndegrees, the proportion of\nboth first class and upper\nsecond class (2.1) degrees\nawarded, across also partially reflects the state of\neach department.

Two passionate students,\nErika and Lily, are on a mission to change\nthat with their newly launched ICRadio\nshow CupidsOnCampus. The show, which\nairs every Thursday from 5 to 6pm,\naims to bring a fresh, fun, and engaging\napproach to student matchmaking,\noffering a platform for Imperial students\nto potentially find love\u2014or at the very\nleast, break the ice.\nThe concept\nThe idea behind the show is quite\nsimple but solves a common problem.\nErika explains, \u201cWe thought it would\ntake away some of the awkwardness\nof having a first date if we\u2019re doing\nthe ice-breaking for them.\u201d The hosts\nwill facilitate the initial conversation,\nensuring that participants don\u2019t feel\nthe pressure of making the first move\nor coming up with awkward questions.\nThis is not new, many YouTube channels\nproduce similar videos, however the\nidea of just listening in and keeping the\ncouples\u2019 faces unknown offers a level of\nprivacy not granted on YouTube.\nErika and Lily\u2019s matchmaking idea\ntakes the form of an hour-long episode\nwhere two individuals\u2014matched based\non their interests and preferences\u2014meet\nfor the first time live on air. The catch?\nThey can not know anything about the\nother person beforehand.\nErika describes the process, saying, \u201cIn\nthebeginning,we\u2019llstartaskingquestions\nand facilitating the conversation, hoping\nthey get along well. [...] I think we\u2019re just\ngoing to ask about their dating history\nand what\u2019s gone right in the past, what\u2019s\ngone wrong in the past, and what they\u2019re\nlooking for. By the end of the hour, we\u2019ll\nask if they want to go on a date together.\u201d\nHow it all started\nAlthough the concept sounds\nstraightforward, Erika admits that the\nlaunch was anything but smooth. For the\nfirst matchmaking session, hosted last\nThursday, she commented that they\u2019ve\n\u201chad about 15 responses so far, but people\nhave been a bit apprehensive about being\nthe first to participate. The idea of being\non a public platform and potentially\nfacing embarrassment is understandably\ndaunting.\u201d\nThe pair used a Microsoft form\nto collect responses from interested\nparticipants, creating an Instagram\naccount and linking the form for their\nfriends to see on social media. Students\ncould fill out the form for themselves or\neven fill it out for their friends, sharing\nkey details such as their interests, age,\nand what they\u2019re looking for in a match.\nThe two then use this information to\ncreate the matches. Erika says they\u2019re\nhoping the show will soon gain traction\nas more students hear about it and see it\nas a fun opportunity rather than a nerve-wracking experience.\nHow ICRadio comes in\nErika and Lily aren\u2019t doing it all alone.\nICRadio\u2019s Head of Spoken Word, Amara,\nplays a vital role in supporting the show\u2019s\ndevelopment and promoting it within\nthe radio station. Amara\u2019s goal is to\nincrease the presence of talk shows and\npodcasts on ICRadio, a station dominated\nby music-based programming. \u201cWe\u2019ve\ngot a lot of DJs, so I\u2019m trying to get more\nof the talk shows showing,\u201d she says.\nThe matchmaking show fits perfectly\ninto that vision, offering something\ndifferent from what ICRadio listeners are\naccustomed to.\nAmara is also key in helping the show\nreach a larger audience. As part of the\nICRadio Committee, she\u2019s committed\nto ensuring that talk-based shows\nlike CupidsOnCampus are given the\npromotion and attention they deserve,\npotentially attracting more participants\nand listeners.\nPrioritising comfort for\nparticipants\nOne major concern for participants\nhas been the issue of privacy. Erika\nshared that their first match was hesitant\nabout having the episode recorded and\navailable online. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it\nto be out there forever, especially if it\u2019s\nawkward,\u201d Erika explains. As a solution,\nthey decided not to upload matchmaking\nepisodes to SoundCloud, allowing\nthe interactions to remain a one-time\nexperience for live listeners only.\nErika and Lily also want to make\nsure that their participants feel\ncomfortable, emphasizing that they\nwon\u2019t use real names if the guests prefer\nto stay anonymous. The focus is to\nensure that the students can relax and\nenjoy the experience, without fear of\nMatchmaking\nwith ICRadio\nUNION & SOCIETIES\nUnion&SocietiesEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nWatch out for Erika and Lilly\u2019s\nweekly show CupidsOnCampus to\nlisten in exclusively on first dates.\nOne of them says \u2018fish,\n\u2019\nand the other says \u2018car,\n\u2019\nand they have to find\nthe middle ground!\u201d\n\u201c\n\n"

Like most\nchildren of my generation who grew up\nthere, Han\u2019s novels were an integral part\nof our youth and education \u2013 her presence was, and continues to be, the pride\nof Korean literature. As someone from\na non-English speaking country, I never\ndreamed that one day I would be able to\nread Nobel-winning books in their original language.\nHan\u2019s Nobel Prize is significant not\njust because it was awarded to an Asian\nfemale novelist \u2013 a group historically\nmarginalised in the literary community and society \u2013 but because she writes\nabout the discarded and silenced with\npassion and empathy. In an time where\nempathy in relationships is increasingly rare, Han\u2019s books hold great value by\nmaking her readers think deeply about\nhuman nature.\nHan Kang\u2019s influences\nHan Kang\u2019s birthplace of Gwangju,\nSouth Korea, played a significant role in\nshaping her. In 1980, 10 years after she\nwas born, the Gwangju uprising took\nplace. The uprising \u2013 arguably one of the\nmost violent events in South Korea after\nthe Korean War \u2013 was a student demonstration movement against the South\nKorean military dictatorship. During the\ndemonstrations, the military shot participants and innocent civilians. Under\ngovernment authority, even those who\ndiscussed the demonstrations were pun-ished.\nMiraculously, Han\u2019s father managed to\nkeep some photos taken during the uprising and shared them with his daugh-ter. Two pictures particularly affected\nher: one of bloody, bullet-lined corpses,\nand another of people lining up to donate\nblood for injured students. In an interview with Korean news outlet, KBS , Han\nexplained she was \u201cshocked by both the\nviolence and the kindness people show\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\n\u0015\u001b\u0014\u001e\u0018\u0019\u001c\u0013\u0016\n\u0019\u0018\u0016\u0015\u0019\u0012\u001c\u0011\u001a\u0019\u0010\u001e\u000f\u0016\n\u001c\u001a\u001e\u001b\u0014\u001e\nBOOKS\nDoyeon reflects on Han Kang\u2019s\nremarkable lessons of empathy and\nthe universal power of her novels.\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0019\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001e\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001d\u001c\u001e\u001b\u0018\nunder such extreme situations and started to question the duality of human nature.\u201d This led her to write novels and poems delving into the strength of human\nempathy in confronting violence.\nFacing historical trauma\nHan works often touch on historical\ntraumas that resonate deeply with South\nKorean culture. What makes her work\ndistinct, however, is her depiction of the\ndiscarded and unheard. Han\u2019s novels\ndon\u2019t focus on people with power and\nvoice. Rather, they are about people who\nwere pressured, silenced, and unable to\nopenly grieve.\nOne of Han\u2019s most famous novels,\nHuman Acts is set during the Gwangju\nuprising. The Korean title means \u201cThe\nboy is coming\u201d and fittingly, the novel\nbegins with a teenage boy compelled by\nthe thought of justice to participate in\nthe uprising. The novel depicts his painful death under soldiers\u2019 guns, how this\naffects individuals, society\u2019s view of the\ndemonstration, and the concept of hu-manity.\nHan revealed she named the novel\nHuman Acts because she interpreted the\nmemory of the uprising as an act of humanity confronting historical tragedy. A\nkey theme in Human Acts is how the experience of enduring loss can fuel a will\nto live. She wanted to show the people\nthat even in moments of violence and de-spair, beauty exists in remembering humanity and surviving another day.\nThe power of Han Kang and\nher work\nThe reception to Human Acts was as-tounding. It became a bestselling book,\nespecially catching the attention of students that didn\u2019t know about the Gwangju uprising beyond government narra-tives. South Korean schools started to\nuse Han\u2019s novel as mandatory reading in\nhistory lessons in response to students\u2019\ngrowing interest. Generations that lived\nthrough the Gwangju uprising also emphasized the importance of the book, especially given its honesty and bluntness.\nAs Human Acts gained recognition\nin 2014, the South Korean government\nblacklisted Han and Human Acts, preventing media attention and banning\nits exhibition internationally. But Han\nrefused to bend to the government\u2019s will.\nIn response, she wrote I Do Not Bid Farewell, about the Jeju uprising, where the\ngovernment slaughtered communities\non Jeju Island.\nHan\u2019s short stories and poems from\nthis era also marked her name into the\ncanon of Korean literature. Her books are\nmore than just a retelling of history. The\ncommon themes of violence, loss, and\nconfrontation of pain are applicable to\nall generations. The Vegetarian taught me\nthe dangers of male chauvinism in South\nKorea, while The Wind Is Blowing offered\nsolace as I navigated the grief of losing a\ndear friend.\nOvertime,herbookshavealsoresonated with global readers, earning awards\nand recognition around the world.\nHan Kang\u2019s message\nHan Kang does not tell typical stories\nof victory or success. Instead, she deals\nwithhowdevastatinglifecanbe,howvio-lent and inhumane some people are, and\nhow injustice can ravage the world. Yet,\nby depicting people\u2019s struggles against\ncruelty and their continuous triumph after tragedy, Han also reminds her readers\nthat we have an internal strength that allows us to carry on. In a 2019 interview,\nHan revealed that she is driven by a belief\nthat \u201cthere is something inside humans\nthat cannot be killed or destroyed\u201d. As an\nardent reader of Han Kang\u2019s work, I hope\nher messages can be delivered to every\ncorner of the world, continuously reminding us of the strength of humanity.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0016\u0012\u001a\u001c\u0011\n\n"

The Industrial Revolution moved people from farms to cities as\nindustrialisation expanded. The internet\ngranted us access to all human knowl-edgewithindeviceswecarryeverywhere.\nAnd finally, the pandemic changed how\nand where we work, accelerating virtual\nworkspaces. Now, we stand at the cusp\nof perhaps the biggest change since the\nIndustrial Revolution: the societal integration of AI.\nAI\u2019s rapid growth and influence are\nundeniable. Already, AI-driven recommendations account for 80% of content\nviewed on Netflix and 35% of Amazon\u2019s\nrevenue. Tools like ChatGPT have seen\nunprecedented usage, reaching 1 million\nusers in just five days after its launch in\nNovember 2022.\nCompanies like Nvidia are soaring\nin value, and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), which enable AI to comprehend\nlanguage and context, are expanding\nat rates surpassing Moore\u2019s law. For in-stance, GPT-3\u2019s LLM contains 175 billion\nparameters \u2013 over 100 times the 1.5 billion parameters of its predecessor, GPT2. Clearly, AI\u2019s societal impact will only\ncontinue to grow. While the benefits are\nsignificant, many are also concerned\nwith 54% of Europeans worrying about\njob losses due to automation, and 61%\nabout privacy implications, according to\nthe European Commission.\nThese concerns are understandable.\nAI has taken a foothold in technical fields\nlike science, with two out of three of the\n2024 Nobel Prizes involving AI. Furthermore, it\nexcels in\nareas once\nt h o u g h t\nu n i q u e l y\nh u m a n ,\nsuch as\nl a n g u a g e\nr e c o g n i -tion and\nreplication,\nmimicking\nhuman voices nearly perfectly. Simply\nput, AI processes information orders of\nmagnitude faster than people, has access to all human knowledge, requires\nno breaks, and is rapidly becoming proficient in complex problem-solving and\ncreativity. Its ability to \u2018brute force\u2019 processes also offsets many drawbacks compared to humans in novel, data-starved\ncontexts. You don\u2019t need an innovative\nsolution if you\ncan try every\nsingle one and\nsee which is\nbest.\nEconomic\ndata further\njustifies con-cern: studies\nsuggest unemployment\nrates of 15-20% can trigger major crises, with the\nGreat Depression peaking at 25%. Others suggest if 30% of jobs are replaced\nwithin 5-10 years, job markets could be\noverwhelmed, and our ability to create\nnew jobs will be hindered. AI\u2019s rapid\ndevelopment predominantly threatens\nindustries like transportation, retail,\nfinance, and manufacturing due to the\nease of automation and the superiority\nof AI in terms of data handling. These industries account for around 40% of global employment \u2013 1.3 billion jobs.\nHowever, AI also promises tremendous positive impact: faster, more effective medical diagnostics, uncovering\nhidden data patterns, automating repetitive tasks and, in general, massively improving efficiency across various sectors\n\u2013 its potential is staggering. In fact, PwC\npredicts that by 2030 AI will boost GDP\nby 14%, adding $15.7 trillion to the global\neconomy \u2013 assuming we adapt adequately to its integration.\nAI is the very definition of a dou-ble-edged sword; it has the potential\nto revolutionise the world for better or\nworse. Without adequate regulation and\ncontrol of its integration, it poses a major threat to the working class\u2019 livelihood\nand, therefore, to the global economy.\nHowever, if a symbiotic relationship between man and machine can be fostered,\nit has the potential to shatter barriers and\nbirth a new age, just as the internet did a\nfew decades ago.\nWhether humanity has opened Pandora\u2019s box once too often or has now opened\nthe door to a prosperous new age is yet to\nbe seen; as individuals, we are simply just\nalong for the ride...\nSCIENCE\nAI to Z: The paradigmatic shift\nfacing the world as we know it\nScienceWriter\nJAMES DESMET\nExamining the impacts of AI from industry to intelligence.\nAI is the very definition of a\ndouble-edged sword; it has\nthe potential to revolutionise\nthe world for better or worse.\n\u201c\nAn artist\u2019s vision of artificial intelligence learning to communicate with a dolphin Laimot (CC BY-SA\n4.0)\n\n"

Powerlifting involves performing three lifts: the squat,\nbenchpress, and deadlift. You might have\nperformed some of these in your regular gym routine, which makes this an\nattractive route for beginners. You have\nthree attempts at each lift, progressively\nincreasing the weight on the bar if you\ncomplete them, and your final score is\nthe total of your highest successful attempt for each lift. For example, a typical\nscore card might look like \u201cS 2/3, B 3/3,\nD 3/3\u201d. This means you failed your final\nsquat attempt, but you nailed all 3 of your\nbench and deadlift attempts!\nEver seen those insanely strong people\non the olympics throwing weights over\ntheir heads like it\u2019s nothing? That\u2019s olympic weightlifting! It\u2019s made up of two lifts:\nthe clean & jerk, and the snatch. Again,\nyou have three attempts per lift. The\nclean and jerk involves pulling the bar up\nonto your shoulders (clean) before pushing it up past your head (jerk). The snatch\ninvolves pulling the bar up straight over\nyour head starting from the ground. Both\nrequire some technical skill, but there\u2019s\nnothing practice can\u2019t teach.\nLike any society, what makes Barbell is\nthe people; the feeling of pushing yourself in a tough workout with your friends\nwhile hyping each other up, is like no\nother. Whenever someone goes for a personal record, screams fill the room and\nthe energy is transcendental \u2013 it gives\nyou chills.\nJai Hindocha, Mr President, adds:\n\u201cOur members range from complete gym\nbeginners to international competitors\n- there\u2019s space for absolutely everyone!\nWe have weekly sessions with amazing\nprofessional coaches who design club\nprogrammes for our members, and it\u2019s an\nincredibly welcoming environment. Our\ngive-it-a-go sessions were a huge success,\nseeing a bunch of new members for both\npowerlifting and weightlifting!\u201d.\nInspired by French philosopher Albert\nCamus, Treasurer Aditya Jain uses this\nmetaphor to describe the Barbell expe-rience, \u201cin the midst of winter, I found,\nwithin me, an invincible summer.\u201d\nOur secretary, Carlotta Giacchero,\nshares:\u201cIjoinedlastyearasIfoundacommunity of like-minded people to share\nmy passion for lifting with, while getting support from world-class coaches!\nBarbell has seen great success this year,\nwith many freshers deciding to join the\nstrongest club at Imperial! Our give-it-a-go sessions were fully booked, but luckily those on a waitlist now get the chance\nto make up for it by joining our weekly\nWednesday (powerlifting) and Saturday (Olympic weightlifting) sessions.\nWith the help of our expert coaches, we\naim to proudly represent Imperial at the\nBritish Universities and Colleges Sport\n(BUCS) competitions once again, hopefully following in the footsteps of our\nvery own Leonard Lai and Omar Abdelmajeed by setting new records! With\nsocials, competitions and more trial sessions coming up it sure is looking like a\ngreat year.\u201d\nUpcoming events\n1. 30th\nNov: Novice competition, aimed\nat those who\u2019ve never competed before.\nYou don\u2019t even need any International\nPowerlifting Federation (IPF)-approved\nequipment.
