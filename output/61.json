    "content": "FELIX NELSONS COLUMN Union members will be sorry to hear that the Rector has been ordered by his doctors to take a complete rest. We send him our good wishes' for a speedy return to health. It is understood that authority to make a start on the Union extension may be received any-day, work will probably start sometime in the summer term. Fred Bunting( Post grad. C&G) has been elected U.L. Rugby Captain for19545 and becomes\nth e4thI.C. man to hold this office in the last five seasons. At a lecture proceeding the Scriblerus Club Dinner, Mr. Ritchie Calder. Science Editor of the News Chronicle successfully defended his thesis^ that scientists, are illiterate. inarticulate and irresponsible,.\" The scientists present, by no means\ninarticulate in\" discussing the press treatment of sci eno e. came to the conclusion that sub editors are responsible for public ignorance. the attitude being founded on a belief that8 O56 of the population of this country were incapable of constructive thought.******* Noticed in the C&G. Hydraulics Lab. a statue dedicated to the\"uh known hydraulic engineer\". Composed of a putty base, a length of fuse wire, and a burette tap. Who made it? Plans for the prop o 'sed college film unit are at present in their infancy. If anyone is interested, they should contact the Film Society; it should be pointed out that considerable student support is required before a project of this nature can be^ definately decided upon. \u00bb * * * * * \u2022\nThe Arab Society surely unique in existing for the past2 years without asking for funds -has at last been wound up.\n* * * * * * *\nDr. William Penny, the eminent atom scientist, was a guest at the recent Annual Dinner of the\nSoccerClub. At a very successful U.L. U. Debate held recently, members of provincial debating(0& C) societies, fresh from their television appearance were guest speakers. The motion before the house was \"That\nthis house regrets the passing of the canary and the as pide stra.\" The chief aim of the speakers seemed to be to identify the as pide stra and the canary with the Victorian sitting room; it was\nnoticed that some of the jokes wh i oh were included in the speeches were also slightly Victorian in character. The motion was defeated by316 votes to131 with47 abs tensions. It was rather disappointing that out of500 or so people present at. the debate only two were\nfrom I.C. This was probably due to lack of advertisement, a common feature of U.L. U. activities VI this year at any rate as far as the Imperial College is concerned. PROFILE MARK ABBOTT Mark Abbott, this year's'o hair man of the\nSocial Clubs Committee, is a person hard to\nclassify. He readily admits that he likes athletic activities more than social ones;\nand he can express ideas more easily than facts, wh i oh may account for his skill atm a them at ios and weakness in chemistry. But we leap too\nfar. Mark came to.I.C. in1949 from the South\nYorkshire coalfields, after passing through a Co-ed school. He graduated in Mathematics in two years under the old system and, for reasons\nbest known to himself, took to Chem. Tech., He\ns.till works there, on a gallery above the rest of the room. Nobody there \u2014 including himself \u2014\nseems to have noticed what he works at, except\nhis assistant. In the Union he started quietly as Secr et ary of the Musical Society and then became\nits President and Hon. Sec. of the S. C.C. While President of the Mus. Soo. he was on oe student host to Anthony Hopkins. The latter, about to play a sonata, asked him to stand by\nand turn the score, whereupon Mark announced\nhis inability to read scores. He still cannot\nread them, does not intend to learn, and has no\napologies on that point. He is a confirmed\nWagnerite, also likes Mahler and Berlioz and\nromantics in general.\nThis explains his near ecstatic liking for Brian Thomas, D.H. Lawrence, Shakespearean\nsonnets and Yorkshire pudding. When he wasn't mature, he says, he used to write long, sent i mental poems \"About love, you know, and all that.\" He has sino e passed from that abstract state. He dislike sT.S. Eliot, single-minded\npeople, bright ties, whisky and toba ooo. He\nwas put off the last-mentioned when, in his young days, he tried a roadside mixture in his grandfather's pipe.\nMark claimed to be a member of practically all the athletic clubs and, when pressed, was\n\u2022 disappointed to find that he belonged to but half a dozen. Soccer he gave up two years ago\nand now he concentrated on rugby and squash.\nIt is interesting to note that he terms cricket an intellectual pursuit( not, mark you, 'game').\nWhen interested in something \u2014 himself, for instance \u2014 Mark waxes very eloquent. His favourite ejaculation is 'Cracky!.' ( or' C rio key!', perhaps) though it is not unknown for him to use more telling phrases. He is very fond of speak-in gat Union meetings and this habit he carries into the S. C.C. meetings as well \u2014 he finds that this speeds up proceedings. He has no ambition, though, of o eating Mike Neale-'s record of completing an S. C.C. meeting in five minutes. After reading this Profile, Mark has done\nhis best to drop 'Cracky!' ( or, as I said,' C rickey!'). Our guess is that his next will be 'gosh!'.\nR SOCIETY DINNER This contrivance was shown by Mr. P.A dorian( Managing Director of Re diffusion Ltd.) in his Presidential address to the C.&G. radio society on Monday 8 th March. He suggested this as the conclusion to the present tendency in broadcasting polio yan upright H aerial for3. B.C. T.V. a horizontal H aerial for competitive T.V. and F.M. sound, a vertical rod aerial for coverage in all directions for sound receiving, and a loop aerial for anti interference, together resulting in a modern \" totem pole\". The address was followed by the Annual Dinner in the Ayrton Hall. Richard Grubb, ( student chairman of the society) proposed the toast to the guests in which he distinguished between guests as represented by members of the Union, and distinguished guests. Derek Saunders( secretary) outlined the various activities of the society, wh i oh included' running on the top of the Be it building a transmitter'. He then called upon the; President to present the premiums,\ntotalling10 guineas, which he had awarded for the best exhibits in the so oie ty' s annual exhibition of home constructed equipment "

    "content": "FELIX MPERIAL COLLEGE\nRUGBY CUP FINAL. Imperial College...3 pts. L.S.E0 The Rugby Cup haso ome back safely to the Old Lounge after its annual excursion to Mot spur Park, being diverted through the bar on its return journey. But although I.C. is now the largest college rugby club, this mato h against L.S.E. she wed that we have no easy monopoly of success. Prom the beginning L.S.E. attacked in determined fashion, and it was nearly a quarter of an hour before the college XV could settle down and start to impose its own pattern of play. Several passing movements broke down because of uncertain handling of the close attention of the opposing wing forwards, though Hy kin once made a promising opening, and a good cross kick by Spooner bounced luckily for the defence. Ten minutes from halftime L.S.E.' s covering defender so a me up too sharply and were penal is ed for offside. Lewis took the goal kick from thirty yards out and made no mistake. L.S.E. were far from disheartened and o a me back with a rush to cause some anxious moments near the I.C. goal line just before the interval. Play was again taken inside the I.C.' twenty five' after there start, and Lewis several times cleared well under pressure, but our heavier forwards were now largely able to control the course of the game, and this proved to be L.S.E.' s last major offensive. Indef eno e however they \u2022 till harried our midfield players, often forcing them to kick or run across so that the wings reo eiv ed few chances. In the dosing fifteen minutes we were getting the ball almost continuously from s crumB and line out s, but not quite quickly enough to crack the opposition, and the end o a me without further score. the result was a fair one, though it IF a pity that the su oreo ou ld not have been a try. L.S.E. did very well to keep their line intact, and\nbe o a use of the narrow points margin excitement was maintained to the final whistle. Che o up was presented to D.H. W.Hy kin, the I.C. captain, by Br. Logan, Pri noi pal of the University. SHOOTING The deciding match for the Court man Shield was fixed on Wednesday March3 rd, and was won\nby the R.C.S. The competition was again a shot for shot fight between Guilds and the R.C.S. the sines showed their usual spirit by producing at all team for all three matches, although quite eat classed. The first match went to the R.C.S. and the second to the Guilds, both by very narrow margins. \u00a5ne third mat uh was won by3 points: R.C.S.592 Guilds589. This standard is such that the R.C.S. score has only once been bettered this season by the I.C.1s tVI with the record score of594 and this team is leading the U.I. league! Congratulations to the R.C.S. on retaining the Shield for the sixth successive year: they must remember to win it again in1955to draw\nlevel with the Guilds who have won 11 times to their10. Or will the Mines breakin? IMPERIAL COLLEGE PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY ANNUAL EXHIBITION MAY Ii th13 th OPEN TO ALL MEMBERS OF I.C. UNION-ENTRIES\n-HALF PLATE OR LARGER - TO BE HANDED IN AT\nTHE UNION HALL PORTERS OFFICE NOT LATER\nTHAN MAY 3rd H YDE PA RK ROAD RELA Y This year, the competition for the Rode rio Hill Trophy produced a higher standard of running than ever before. The cup was won by Manchester University from L.3.E., who, without their two stars, Punk ley and\nKeegan, did not defend it. This is the first time the cup has left London. The Imperial College team finished fifth, the same position as last year. The fastest lap was by Min shall, of Manchester, with a time of13 mins.8 sees., lowering the previous lap record by one second. Bailey, with sixth fastest time of13 mins.30 sees, was\nfastest I.C. man, and Pain took only8 seconds longer on his lap.A Tyrian team, not competing for the trophy, set up a course record of81 m.3 sees. Their team included the Australian and British national champions, D. Macmillan and J.D isley. The race was well organised and supported, and its annual organisation by I.C. is gaining the college credit among the many university athletic teams who are able to compete.\nHEAD OF THE RIVER RACE The Tide way Head of the River Race this year takes place on Saturday,27 th March from Putney to Mortlake., Due to the tide the rao e is being rowed on the reversed i reo tion, and with the o hang i in the conditions, anything may happen. As usual the standard each year is going up\nand up and from the Reading Head results the R.A.P. Jesus college Lady Margaret College or ews are worth yoon tenders. The I. C.B.C. fresher crews this year have already attained a good standard and are exp eot ei to improve on last years performance. JUDO \u2022 \u2014 !\nOn Wednesday, March3 rd, I.C.J. C. were at home to Kings College. The I.C. team were\ngenerally better trained than their opponents, and gained a.32 victory:' The first matches were as usual between the junior members of each team, Rot gans opponent\nsubmitted to a choke lock, and Gruse was successful with an ankle throw and a convincing upper four quarters hold-down.\nThe next contest was won by Kings, Andrews'\nopponent scoring vd th a hip throw. In the lighter grades, the contest between Ken Wool d ridge, and\nBooth of Kings ended in a draw, as sometimes\nhappens with experienced contestants when the skill in attack of one is matched by the skill in defence of the other.7 ASIDE TOURNAMENT The University7 aside tournament on the morning of the cup final was superbly organised by Derek Hughes, who arrived well before the first round matches had ended. Our two sevens, drawn from the2 nd and 3 rd XV s, had only a limited success in this competition, which was \u2022W4\u00bbr by Vets, who beat U.C. in the final. THE ART CLU BThe Rector is President of the new Art Club set up in I.C. It was born out of the very successful Art Exhibition held last term, and the attendance and interest shown at Mr. Barnett P reed man's, lecture last week was most heartening. Mr. Preedman will next year replaceD r. Jaque s as the Lecturer in Arts, and I.C. will have the opportunity of his strikingly original approach to art(\" All drawing is marking on a flat surface\" \"Don't worry if no one likes it\".) The Art Club also hopes to have some excursions into three dimensions, though lack of talent in scripture is at the moment a serious stumbling block. Prospective members ( especially from R.C.S., who has n't yet contributed a single member to date) are cordially invited to make enquiries. A pam-ph let is exhibited on most noticeboards.

    "content": "FELIX5 DON'T TEACH YOURSELF JUDO\nAs Judo is one of the less well-'-en own sports, a short description of so;;e ui.' the\nthrows mentioned on the Sports page nay he of\ngeneral interest. A word of warning these techniques cannot he mastered without expert instruction and frequent practice, and it is unwise to practise without a thorough' mow ledge of the art of falling, if broken hones and concussions are to be avoided. Firstly, the sweeping ankle throw. This, apart from being easy to describe on paper, is spectacular to watch if done skilfully. The\nmoment for attack is when the opponent's feet are together, or passing. He is then lifted slightly with both hands, and his feet swept away\nfrom under him.\nFor practice purposes, this is used after three steps to the side in order to get the feel of the opponents rhythm. This similarity t othe St. Bernard' s Waltz may account for the hesitant manner of some young ladies when approached by socially minded Judo Club members.\nThe Stomach throw is much abused by Alan ladd and Co., who are frequently seen on their backs placing their feet in the stomachs of charging villains, who then do pile vault movements into the nearest table or chair. The\nJudo throw is far smoother, more harmonious and\naesthetically pleasing. It starts with a cont in tio us circle of movement as the opponent advances and is drawn on to the defender's foot, who has\ndropped from a standing to a lying position. By\nproper use of momentum it is an easy matter to send the opponent flying over your head into a forward somersault break fall. Should a throw not result in the completed is coura gs ment of an attacker, it can be followed up with about of groundwork. In contests this means applying some form of lock to a vital spot until the opponent indicates submission, or holding him down in a helpless position for30 seconds. There is a great variety of oh oke looks and\nstrangleholds, wh i oh can best be described on the judo mat.\nThey consist essential l, of a juxtaposition* of arms and wrists calculated to bring pressure on to the windpipe, or on to the Jugular vein and\ncarotid artery, so cutting off the supply of blood to tha head, In the upper four quarters hold y down, the opponent's upturned head is pinned under your s+on a ob with your chest bearing down heavily on\nthe upper part of his body.. With his loin controlled by your hands there is very little he\ncan do to get out of it, barring eye poking and ear twisting, which are not allowed in contests. Anyone wishing to sun^ le ment this brief and inadequate description will be\nwelcome any Tuesday evening when the club has\ninstruction periods under Mr. J. Barnes, the President of the British Judo\nAs soc.. By the way, there will probably he a match with the Metropolitan Police next tern.

The meeting will be chaired by\na member of I.C. teaching staff. AB. Sc. graduate in Anthropology himself, Graham has spoken at all the major American universities with great success.

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir, May I echo your correspondent, Mr. D.J. Foster, in his plea for better treatment of Gene ral Studies Lecturers. Many of these lecturers come with a talk previously prepared to take un an\nhour, and it is unfair and disturbing to them to find they only have 45 - 50 minutes. I suggest that a better solution than those suggested by Mr. Foster would be to start all lectures at1.15 p.m. This would give the lecturer a clear hour to use for his lecture and questions, if he wished to answer any. This earlier sP.nrt\nwould not be inconvenient for either the lecturer or for the students; from 13.30 to1.15 Is ample\ntime to eat lunch. Yours sincerely, Pennant Jones. Dear Sir,I would suggest to. r.D. J. Foster that it is hardly fair to condemn the excellent idea of General Studies merely because of one mediocre lecture. Even on that particular occasion an\nattentive ear and a sharp intelligence, prepared to attend for more than a colourful film, could have extracted some wise witticisms and unintentional humour. i On most afternoons the audience is still arrivIng at1.30 and the majority must be elsewhere by\n,2.30. There is thus no justification to lengthen the45 schedule, of which the lecturers are informed well in advance. Finally, may I point out that the primary,\npurpose of the staff and student chairmen is to entertain and escort the speaker, and in no event do the necessary formalities last more than five minutes. Yours sincerely, John H. Abrahams\nDear Sir, In answer to a letter in the last issue of\nFelix, we should like to make a few points clear to those students who are interested in the subject of grants as discussed at th elastI.C. Union Meeting. I.C. Council are not pursuing a blind pol icy with regard to theN. U.S.. London Area Grants Survey, nor are they suggesting that action should be limited to oases of individual hardship. I. C.are supporting N.U.S'.( N stands for National'.} in their efforts to increase the level of student grants and, although we are not members\nof N.U.S., we have been elected onto the Cor\nordinating Committee controlling the Survey. Members of I.C. Council have already taken an active part in the preparation of a questionnaire which is being circulated in Westfield College, Queen Mary College and many other London\nColleges. N.U.S. did intend to. base its case for higher grants on the statistics obtained from students at the two- colleges, mentioned above, only. However they have expressed their willingness to accept similar information from other colleges and I.C. Council have circulated copies of the questionnaire in this Gol leg e. The. information obtained from the questionnaire will be forwarded, to N.U.S: as soon as\npossible. Yours sincerely, Tony Gill Jim Anderson Dear Sir, It is said that even a worm will turn and\nthe time has finally come when I. C.W. A. feel justified in going into print with a very strong protest at the invasion of the I. C.W. A. dance last Friday by intruders, predominantly from the Q.A. dance. Gate crashing seems to be a more or less recognised occurrence at hops and even carnivals, but surely a new low in bad taste has been reached when members of other colleges and from Q.A. take it for granted that all dances a tI.C. are equally open to, them.\nOn Friday it did not pass unnoticed that some people, and certainly none of the women,\nwho gate crashed were even members of I..C.a tall. Definitely none of them had bothered with the formality of a ticket, nor were they averse to competing for and even taking prizes.' The I. C.W. A. dinner and dance is the only social occasion when I. C.W. A. comes into its own a tI.C. and for this to be subjected to intrusion by outsiders is an insult which we\ncannot allow to pass without protest. Yours etc I cw arians. THE DRAMATIC SOCIETY The presentation of a double bill by the I.C. Dramatic Society was an outstanding success. It\nis annoying, from the reviewer's point of view, to find little Joo a'vil at, and an all favourable appr a ie ment tends to be rare Indeed. But then so was this production. Jean Osborne and Derek Robinson, the producers, had two excellently contrived plays in. which to shape and space the ao ting, and this happy choice of material, aided by the blossoming ability of our newer players, made for a delightful evening. 'The Browning Version' is an eat study of disillusionment. John Harding, taking the principal part of the retiring schoolmaster, acted with suo h competence that emotionally the a audie no e was with him, in spite of his preposterous bookish ness, from the first slow sentence, the first questioning lift of the brows. His manner\nwith the sherry was delightful. Shirley Holman, though still finding the hands rather a nuisance, gave us a mean bitter woman with revealing clarity. The floating panels were quite intriguing. Though a little formal at first, both MaLcolm Amos and Ian Duff quickly settled down\nto give impressions amusing and saddening turn by turn. The headmaster, commanding and distinguished, and played by leu an David, was made\nevil hy the half mocking smile wh i oh seemed to cover' disinterest and lack of human understanding in the head of the. school. This gave, I feel, too sinister an interpretation, but an effective one nevertheless.' A Phoenix Too Frequent' contrasted greatly with the first play, and this may have been the secret of the evening's success. Here humour of various grades extending into the near coarse mingled not unpleasantly with poetry rio h in imagery and the lyric cadence. The decor and\nlighting were simple but cleverly planned, the localised dimness giving atmosphere hut not restricting vision. Pat Wilton, playing the newly widowed Dynamene, cried and drank, ooo ed pretty phrases and courted laughter with equal charm. Martin Jacob did not seem so mu oh at home with the pretty phrases, as perhaps one would expect for a' square bashing barbarian1, but his dress and action were uniformly good. Do to, the servant maid, was given with great vivacity and\nskill by Sheila Taylor, to the great amusement\nof the audience, who delighted in the semi ln tell ect u al humour, and also in the sympathetic casting of the piece.

    "content": "3\nEVERY\nFORTNIGHT\nft UK\nNO.61 IMPERIAL COLLEGE19 MARCH1954 MOTOR CLUB TREASURE HUNT GUILDS RELIEVED AT LAST The long awaited addition to the facilities of Guilds was opened last Monday by the President. He\napproached the tastefully decorated entrance by\nbreaking the perforated' ribbon' across it. After a short speech, in which he mentioned the people who had s at upon the subject in the past, he pulled a chain to unveil the plaque commemorating the opening and named the premises' GENTLEMEN', The\nsounds of the opening were relayed over amplifiers to the gathering outside before the President emerged to end this extraordinary meeting of the Guilds Union with a Boom a lack a. Following the increase in facilities in the Guilds, it is to be regretted that similar facilities on the third floor of the Mines building will be shortly, closing due to the rebuilding there. Obtained by the R.S. M. Union negotiations, these facilities were shortly to be adorned with a plaque commemorating the struggle of the few for the many, and it is to be hoped that a grand reopening will be arranged simultaneously with the unveiling ceremony.\n\" THE R.S. M.& YOU \"\nAlways a good topic of general o on versa tion in the Mines is the age old riddle, \"how many\nstudents are there in the Mines\". Some of the more pessimistic say\" about a hundred\", generally mumbling under their breath something about \"not\nbeing able to scrape two rug ger teams together\"; again there are others who would put the figure nearer to two hundred. However, be that as it may, if we assume for the moment that there are actually one hundred and fifty students in the Mines, then one hundred and forty nine of them\nwent to the lunch hour meeting of the Mining and\nMetallurgical So oie ty wh i oh was held in the Mining Leo ture Theatre a fortnight ago. In one\nof the most successful^ meetings of reo ent years, two students under the chairmanship of The Dean,\nanswered questions put to them about the courses at the R.S. M. Five lectures a day\nwere deplored by the panel, and the advent of a lady miner was approved in answer to the question \"Why are R.S. M. students the greatest lovers in the world?\" The Mines' cookery' book,( for use in assaying) was wholeheartedly condemned by one\nquestioner for subjugating any reasoning powers which the student happened to possess to primeval minimum; Prof. Dan natt in reply stated that since thought was a comparatively rare commodity in the R.S. M., and that Practical Assaying was\nnot the sort of subject that required great reasoning powers, he did not consider this to be\nsuch a bad thing. Questions about the Geology Department^ connection with the Mines,' and the issue of cy clo stylesheet s as an aid to lecturing were also asked. A vote of thanks was\nproposed by Mr. Bernard Fisk, and the meeting ended with a wholesale rush to the next lecture. A Treasure Hunt was organised by the Combined Motor Clubs of City and Guilds, Queen Mary College and University College on Sunday March7 th. The programme was an ambitious one and by2.30 p.m.,33 separate entrants had assembled outside I.C. Union. The equipages varied from the smallest motorcycle, to large and powerful( though old) sportscar s. As from 2.3Op. m. the competitors were sent off In1 minute Intervals with a simple sheet of instructions,36 complicated clues and the organisers' blessings. The route led out through Hammersmith to the Leatherhead and Guildford districts; and from about4.00 till7.00 this area was fairly riddled throughout by keen clue seekers. Probable every lane within20 square miles was visited atleast once by atleast one competitor. One of the larger sportscar entries caused considerable confusion by being repeatedly seen by the competitors moving very fast In the ot roos lte direction to the general run of the Rally. Rain o a me on fairly heavily at times so that the motorcyclists had a thin time of It. By \"8.00 p.m.25 of the starters had reassembled at the Cock Inn, Headley to compare notes and\ntake some well deserved refreshment. Not many\npeople had passed through the one and only checkpoint( the others had failed to materialise), and\nnot much ' treasure' had been a collected. \u2022 One of the objects required had been a peach, and in response to this one of the competitors brought in a whole blessed tl ni John Wheatcroft, C.&G., In an Austin, was\nthe final Individual winner with the amazing total of99 marks; David Penny, C.&.G. was second in a Standard; and Dennison, Fiat, was third. The first team home was a Guilds one:- Wheatc r of t, Penny and Whiteley. The second team was\nanother Guilds team, and a Q.M. C. team was third. Altogether it was a thoroughly successful event and a very enjoyable afternoon a credit to the organisers ingenuity and endeavour. THE OLD, OLD STORY. The I. C.W. A. annual dinner and dance wis held last Friday, March12 th. The guest of honour was. the Viscountess Falmouth, known to the college as the wife of the Chairman of the Governors, but equally famous in her own right. This, was shown by Miss Goodway, in her description of Lady Falmouth' s work with the Red Cross, when after the last war, she toured Europe visiting refugees and 3 els encamps. In replying to the Toast of the Guests, Lady Falmouth described the difficulties that University women encounter on entering this cold, hard world, and the male prejudice that had to be overcome. Mark Abbott and Alison Entwistle between them described the past, present, and probable future Qt I. C.W. A. leaving us with the feeling: How wonderful the I.C.

So no* is the time to x isha pleasant vacation upon\nour readers, i ome of these think that we o ater too mu oh for th# beer-swilling and worn enc ha sing members of I.C. We don't agree but not because we thi nk ill of these sections of our\ne om unity: good health to the beer-s will ers; good hunting to\nthe women-chasers. And to those who disagree, let's have the\nreason.\n3ut Spring is not the season for harsh words. It is the\ntd xe for enjoying life but c amy of us are sot able to join in the glad awakening after winter. The threat of exams, though\nst.il 1 fax off, looms before us and we tend to regard the\nmaster vac. as a time to catch up on course work. We hope,\nhowever, that all the time will not be occupied with lab. reports and that there will be time to speculate. It may be\non dogs, horses, football pools or even the stock exchange\n(for those who have been attending L.S.E.) but perhaps some-thought might be given to activities at I.C. You may not be satisfied with the way things are rum\nnothing can please everyone all the time. You can always\nwrite to F3.IX about it( which is very nearly 'where we came\nin') but next tec s is the time when there is another way of\nmaking changes. It is the time of the A.G.M. s of the various\nclubs and societies (although some have already been held).\nNow is the time to think of the people who will be most\nsuitable fox your clubs and societies. In many of the sports clubs, it is common practice to\nelect the best players as officers. This may be alright as\nfar as captains axe concerned but the best players are often\nthe least satisfactory of sect xe taxies and treasurers.\nFlaying in various fixtures prevents them from putting in the\ntime needed fox the club to run smoothly whereas a less' proficient player will have an opportunity to help the club\nto a fax greater extent than he could by activities on the\nfield. Thexe axe many such considerations in electing our\nofficers and the best men fox the jobs are not always the\nmost obvious. A little thought\nA little thought now may mean all the difference in the\nway a club is run next year. That's looking quite a way ahead.\nAs yet, the Spring tern), has not ended and we have opportunity\nonce more, to hope our readers enjoy the coming xe spite from\nw ox k. \u00bb \u2022 * * *\nFH.IX congratulates two of its board on their engagement:\nDon Grasham to Mary I.rc Kenzie\nPERSONAL ADVERTISEMENTS\nAll members of I.C. Union are invited to a pre-exam. cyanide party in Room 93i New Hostel at\n8.30 p.m. on Friday19 th March.\nSPRING CONCERT Last night I.C. choir gave their Spring Concert in Queen Alexandra House with the Jacques Orchestra. This term, many of the\nexperienced altos and sopranos left, and were replaced by new members; Dr. Brown has done\nsterling work in building up and integrating them into a oho ir of this quality. The Trau erode of Bach is very little known, and some of the music is believed to hare been taken by Bach from his Passion according t oSt.Mark. Dr. Brown, a great lover of Bach, translated the words of this great work\nhimself, and conducted it with great feeling. It is an exacting work to sing, and the choir rose readily to the occasion. Both choir and orchestra really grasped the spirit of the Song of Destiny. As light unc ert a in ty of some leads among the basses was comp let ely outweighed by the overall musicianship with which this work was performed. Incomplete contrast to the other works was\n( the\" Salutation\" by Edmund Rub bra. Striking chords and dramatic changes in time signature and\ntempo abound in this work, and they were brought out to the fullest extent in this performance. The tenor line was outstanding. Two beautiful old madrigals completed the programme, performed in Dr. Brown's usual impeccable and sympathetic manner. One of the best concerts given by choir, this, not rising perhaps, to the heights reached last term in the Britten' s Rejoice in the Lamb, but an undoubted credit to I.C. musical society. Q.E.P. NOW READ ON After spending2*64 years a tI.C. we submit the following thesis of our useful work here in the hope that we are awarded a Ph.D.( Doctor of Philandering.) OBJECT: An investigation into the successful methods of navi ng several\" affairs des Coe vas\" simultaneously, and a determination of the laws and factors of safety relating to this Art. APPARATUS: The 26 main Colleges of the University, all nurses hostels and any o the institutions considered worth further investigation. SPECIMENS: The following are typical spec i mens from each group examined1) Mary normal is ed Jean case hardened Sheila highly polished2)3)(4) Joan wet\n(5) Anna bella pure(6) Glyn is highly stressed. Preliminary Preparation;1/ Acquire a good working knowledge of London and its hostels.( J;S:, FELIX46, \"Women's Hostels\")2/ Acquire a good working knowledge of elocution learning to pick out foreign accents as used by actresses( \"as the B is no p said\").3/ Acquire a good technological jargon for atleast one sport( athletic type only) and also of foreign travel, e.g., keep your ears open for such remarks as\" Didn't I see you running at Helsinki last year?\" Counter with\" Quite probably I had a lot of trouble with the bus timetables there.\"4/ Learn to appreciate and use your instincts a small amount of psychology is useful here. PROCEDURE:\n( a) Attend as many hops etc as possible specialising in those supplying freebee r.(b) After sighting potential specimen apply preliminary preparation in the above order but stopping at1/ if she wears a white frock. On reaching4/ move to the Upper Dining Han or similar en vi rome nt.( c) Use wide range of reason( c) If Fid usAr chat us* apply moderate pressure but remember method is essentially one of being careful.( d) Use wide range of reasons for your ringing her and not viceversa. In case of accidents attention should be paid to training the landlady \"Are you the girl who rang earlier\" or \"No, he\nis not in, probably gone out with the blende\" e to are examples of bad landlady training.( e) The eff eot of alcohol on the s pe oi men must be very o are fully noted as this might be of value in test( f).(f) If the above tests have been carried out\ncorre otl y it should be obvious w nether or not fur'ther testing is advantageous: e.g. if the alcohol absorption oo effie oie nti a low and one is not prevented from applying4/ one should prepare the specimen for the most severe test the' Carnival test'. This i a sure to make marked oh an ges in the\nmental state of the specimen, sometimes positive, but usually negative. Several affairs were tested to destruction and from these and other results the following conclusions may be drawn It is necessary to mention that one is a technologist and believes in equal pay for women\n( i.e. she pays half) unless of course one is drawing a large grant from some foreign power.\nQuestions under section( b) of Procedure should be dealt within not more than two dances so that no time is wasted on specimens who try to make you believe that Cockfosters is just around the corner. The two main Laws established by this experiment are as follows: LAW 1. The Number of current specimens is proportional to( grant)^ x1/ amount of coursework. A factor of safety of2 should be taken in this law to allow for changes in dates of coursework due in, parent i al trouble, unavoidable financial worry due to Police, Underground Ticket Inspectors, Digs rent final de man notes etc. LAW 2 The safe distance to keep between Nspe ci mens is proportional to log.e Is x1/ own infancy. Is is the intensity of perfume worn. A factor of safety of6 should be used as the turbulent region( Re \u00a3 x103) may descend at any time due\nto two specimens accidentally coming into contact. An allowance is also made for hostel porters who remember your face but don't pay sufficient attention to which specimen you require them to in form of your presence. Fin^ l Advice: If at first you don't succeed try, try again then give up, there' s no use being an\nutter fool about it. \u2022J.S.& A.L.M. "
