Victories\nover Brunei University, Kings\nCollege and Charing Cross and\nWestminster set up an exciting final\nmatch against RHBNC, with IC\nneeding 3 of the 6 points to ensure\nqualification. This match, played at\nPorters Park GC ended IC 3Vi, RH B NC2'/2, with three matches\ngoing to the final hole.\nWe are looking forward to the\nnext stage of the U AU championships in the spring term.\nIn the meantime, well done to all\ninvolved, particularly those coming\ninto the team this season.\nTeam from: Ed Smith, Rob\nKeyte, Jan Philp, Paul Mercie,\nNick Ralph, Mark Shimmel, Chris\nGreenshields.\nThe Club's single scull ers took a break from long-distance Tideway\ntraining with a race at Tiffin Small\nBoats Head on Saturday 21st. Eight\ncompeted in both the morning and\nafternoon against-the-clock\ndivisions, finishing well up in the\nvery strong field. Their relative\norder finished between division,\nmany athletes putting in good\npersonal performances in the event\nthat was won overall by an ex-IC\noarsman, Guy Pooley, by some\ndistance.\nMost notable were the\nperformances of John Warnock\nwho was the fastest Imperial scull er both times, finishing 8th overall,\nclose to some of the country's top\nnational squad scull ers and Andy\nRoberts, a newcomer to IC who\nwon the novice pennant in the first\nrun.\nThe squad's strongest oarsmen\nwill be completing the first half of\ntheir winter assessment in pairs and\nsingles trials at Henley next\nweekend.\nIC Badminton Club\nLast weekend Imperial College\nBadminton team made its way to\nNottingham for the annual\nindividual championships. The\nteam, consisting of six men and six\nladies, were to face the best of\nBritish badminton students. There\nwas one new addition to the men's team, Raymond Yeng, and two in\nthe ladies', Madhu Bhatuta and\nKatie Brocolli from St Mary's. The first day was the start of the\nsingles and as expected our players\nfell in the early rounds with only\nBarbara Spence advancing to the\nthird round. The team hoped to do\nbetter in the doubles and mixed.\nDay two started well with all three\nmen's pairs winning their opening\nrounds. In the 2nd round though\nAlan Crow and Richard Wangy\nLangy met with a seeded pair from\nExeter and were beaten\nconvincingly while Stephen Truffle\nand Raymond Yeng lost to their\nStrathclyde counterparts. Jin-Yee\nLim and CL Tan stormed their way\nto the third round and now had to\nface a seeded Nottingham pair.\nThey started well in both sets\nleading 7-4 and 9-5 but failed to\ncapital is e on serve and eventually\nlost 15-7, 15-9.\nIn the ladies' doubles high hopes\nrested on our top pair Barbara\nSpence and Wendy Yates. The\nreal t iv ely inexperienced Jennifer\nLam and Madhu Bhabuta put up a fight before losing in the opening\nround while the new partnership of\nUta Boltze and Katie Brocolli found\nthe going got tough in round two.\nBarbara and Wendy continued their\nwinning streak as expected but in\nthe third round were surprised by\nan unknown Bedford College pair.\nThey only wished they hadn't eaten\nthat slice of chocolate cake on the\nway up.\nAgain the mixed the combination\nof Langford and Yates were quietly\nconfident of getting into the finals.\nIn round three they lost the first set\neasily but suddenly came alive when\nRichard remembered the 'wild\nthing' gag from Oliver Reed on\n'The Word' the night before and\nsubsequently took the 2nd. Despite\nleading 7-4 in the rubber set, a series of errors accounted for their\nelimination. Had they both had\nv in da loos for dinner the night\nbefore, the end result might have\nbeen different.\nOn the team championships both\nthe men and ladies have won their\nway to the last 16 round.\nOn the home front the club has\nappointed Liam Hudson (the guy\nwith the ponytail) as social secretary\nand he has suggested a Christmas\nouting for Friday 11th November so\nlook out on the noticeboard.\nAmongst others on his agenda is a ten-pin bowling trip and a cinema\ntrip.\nJim Jee Lim, Chem Eng IV.\nTreble hopes continue for IC! After\nqualifying for the second round of\nthe U AU and going top of the\nleague last week. IC l sts outplayed\nUCL to reach the quarter-finals of\nthe UL cup.\nDespite going down after a shabbily defended corner, IC then\nproduced some quite literally\nbreathtaking one touch football\nwhich earned them an equalise r shortly after the half-time restart.\nIC continued to dominate but\nfailed to score. UCL then went\nahead thanks to the referee totally\nignoring the UCL players camping\nin IC's box. Despite the heroic\nattempts of M Atherton and B Willis (guesting from the 3rds in the\nabsence of Richard 'No Woman'\nBruce) to keep them out.\nThe inevitable equalise r was the\nproduct of the best move of the\nmatch, culminating in a superlative\ncross by J Mottashed expertly\nturned in my R Martinez.\nThe match went to extra time\nthanks to a save from often\noverlooked keeper M Atherton. The\nsave, it was reported by a bystander\nwas 'possibly the best save ever\nseen'.\nThe extra time was full of\nincidents, the main talking points\nbeing T Botzio's triple pike dive\nwith tuck, earning him straight tens\nand the UCL midfielder an early\nshower.\nIC's class and composure\nprevailed: A Fenton, T Robson, B Willis and R Burrows formed a solid back four, R Dixon, R Martinez, S Watson and T Botzios\nstroked the ball around beautifully\nin midfield. J Mottashed and A Galloway roamed menacingly up\nfront and their unselfish play earned\nIC two further goals to give IC a42 win and a place in the 2nd round\ndraw.\nRugby 1st and 2nds IC went out of the Gutteridge Cup\nin the first round against UCL on\nWednesday.\nA wet pitch and gale force wind\ndidn't help, and neither did the fact\nthat IC lost captain Rupert Carr in\nthe pre-match warm up after Ollie\n'Supersub' Dennison split his eye\nopen with a superbly timed right\nhook.\nMark Wisheart took the Hooker's shirt and IC got off to a flying start\nsoaring, two tries through George\nHabib's 'poetry in motion' style\nrunning.\nIC should have extended their\nlead soon after when Nick Flynn\nwas topped a foot short by a UCL player with a 'he can't run without\nhis Adam's apple' attitude to\ntalking.\nUCL replied with a try from the\nbase of an IC scrum when their\nscrum-half spoiled Andrew 'he\npushed me, ref!' Montgomery's pass. Stuart 'sulking bastard'\nPaynter kicked his only points of the\nday with a penalty and the half\nclosed 13-5 to IC.\nUCL, playing with the wind,\ndominated the second half and\nkicked a penalty before scoring\ntheir second try through their No. 8.\nIC threw everything into attack\nbut centres Anton 'the pass was\nshit' fields and Richard 'three fights\na match' Stubbs couldn't break\nthrough. UCL kicked another three\npoints to leave the final score IC 13,\nUCL18.2 nds22 CITY UNIVERSITY 0\nThe game started extremely well\nwith a few good drives after kick\noff, Simon Wilkinson, broken\narmed second row, made his first\ntry for IC early on but City came\nstraight back and almost stopped\nour initial celebrations. The next\ntry, by displaced Firsts captain\nRoger Gilchrist, came after one of\nthe numerous backs runs, made by\nclean ball from the hard driving\nforwards. Also returning from\ninjury, Captain Rich (Chunky)\nClemey inspired many drives from\nup front, close y supported by John\nRoebuck, abrasive John Cassidy\nand Tim savi gar who\nmanufactured a try for himself later\nin the second half.\nMatt Toolan, second row, created\nmuch ground with a couple of\nstorming runs. And it was a momentous run, after a good pass\nfrom Roger, which Karl Drage\nundertook on the wing to smash\nhome his first try as vice captain.\nThe kicks, as usual, were taken by\nLee Jefferson - who made the most\nof the inconsiderate placing of the\ntrys - and he notched up another two\npoints onto this years total.\nIC Rugby meet Sundays at 12,\nMondays at 6 and Tuesdays at 12\nin the Union Gym.

    "content": "N ews\n27 November 1992 Felix 950\nTerm proposals\nby Jonty Beavan\nInvestigations are taking place in\nImperial College into the possibility\nof radically changing the structure\nof the academic year.\nA working party of the\nUndergraduate Studies Group,\nheaded by Professor Lester\nKirschenbaum, has been charged\nwith finding ways to alter the\nCollege year which could improve\nthe academic standing of Imperial.\nThe committee will provide\nrecommendations to the Board of\nStudies and changes that are\naccepted could be in place within\nthe next academic year.\nIssues being considered at the\nmoment are whether to adopt the\nAmerican system of two\nindependent and self-contained\nsemesters in each year. This would\nmean that students would be\nexamined at the end of each term\non that semester's topics, without\nhaving to wait until the Summer to\nbe tested on material covered in the\nWinter term. Critics of the\nproposals claim that a full\nunderstanding of the subject is lost\nin the pressure of studying for each\nset of tests.\nOther pos s sibi li ties include\ndevelopment of modular courses, so\ncredit gained in a course would still\nbe of value even if a student took\ntime out or transfered to another\nUniversity. Variations are still being\nconsidered and Professor\nKirschenbaum is trying to\nencourage student feedback.\nComparing the shake up to the\nlengthening of the College day, he\ncommented people never knew\nwhat the effects of changes are until\nthey actually happen, this was a chance to participate in the decision-making process. Prof\nKirschenbaum is in Chem Eng 506\nand would welcome input\nLibrary Charges\nUsers of the University of London\nlibrary may face charges of up to\n\u00a390 for use of its facilities next\nyear. The threat comes due to doubt\nover whether the larger colleges in\nLondon will continue to support the\nlibrary when they get more control\nover their budgets next year. The\nvice-chancellor, Professor Stewart\nSutherland, said that unless there\nwas enough money provided from\nthe colleges and institutes of the\nuniversity or extra help from the\ngovernment, the library may have\nto charge individuals.\nThe president of the University of\nLondon Union, Mark Samuels said\nthe academic work of London\nstudents could suffer if the library\n'went down the plug hole'. The\nlibrary is used by approximately\n24,000 students and 2,800 staff, and\nis renowned for its collections on\nhumanities and social sciences. It is\ndoubtful, however, how much\neffect withdrawal of central library\nfacilities will have on students at\nImperial College. A number of\nstudents questioned have\ncommented on the difficulty of\nusing the university library due to\nthe bureaucracy involved in\nobtaining the card necessary to gain\naccess to the building. This process\nalso involves providing the library\nauthorities with a good reason as to\nwhy a student wants to use the\nlibrary, a situation that many\nstudents object to.\nScience worries\nEnrolments in engineering and\ntechnology degree courses have\nbeen described as 'disappointing' by\nJohn Patten, the Education\nSecretary. Mr Patten has blamed\nlow enrolment on 'what is taught in\nschools and how careers in\nengineering are perceived', writes\nDeclan Curry. The Education\nSecretary has encouraged\nuniversities to 'ensure their courses\nin engineering and technology\nstimulate their students'.\nMr Patten was speaking at the\nBirkbeck libel\nrecent inauguration of Nottingham\nTrent University. He said that he\nexpected new universities to\nprovide a range of courses 'with\nclear vocational niches', and with\n'the choice of studying either part\ntime or full time with emphasis on\nsandwich courses'. Later, the\nEducation Secretary said that 'with\nlimited public funds, universities\nhad to concentrate those funds to get\nthe best out of basic and strategic\nresearch'.\nby Declan Curry\nTrade Unionists at Birkbeck\nCollege, London, have reacted with\nfury to what they regard as a questioning of the financial honesty\nof John Kerrison, the manager of\nBirkbeck Union Bar. As reported in\nFelices 948 and 949, a dispute has\nbroken out between Barbara Bates,\nthe Birkbeck Union President, and\nDavid Gascoigne, a member of\nUnion Bar Staff. The dispute arose\nfollowing an investigation into the\nfinances of the bar, and it was\nalleged by Ms Bates that 'a lot of\nmoney had gone missing from the\nbar'. The Bar Manager had four\nformal complaints put against him\nafter the investigation, while Ms\nBates defeated a motion of no\nconfidence in her last week.\nIt is believed that it is a statement\nrefer ing to alleged missing bar\nmoney which has drawn the ire of\nsenior officers of Birkbeck MSF Union. In a letter to Ms Bates,\nwhich has been released to Felix,\nthe Chairman of Birkbeck MSF, Dr\nNH Ratnajothi, says 'after\nconsultation with our regional and\nlegal officers, lam writing formally\nto request an apology and retraction\nChild care worries for students\nby Declan Curry\nLondon students with children are\nfacing rising childcare fees and a shortage of Day Nursery places,\naccording to the University of\nLondon Union (ULU). UL U sabbaticals have warned that\nstudents will be hard hit as the Child\nSupport Act is phased in this year.\nThe UL U Day Nursery is\nreportedly struggling to keep fees\nbelow \u00a3 4 0 per week.\nThe Child Support Act specifies\nspecific nursery staff to children\nratios. The ratios are calculated\naccording to the age of the children,\nand the numbers of staff deemed\nnecessary to look after a number of\nchildren in a particular age\ncategory. These categories are\ncurrently infant up to 2 years old,\n2 to 3 years old, and 3 to 4 years\nold. Infants under 2 require a dedicated baby unit. University\nCollege London baby unit has\nwarned that its places may be cut\nin order to conform with the new\nratios.\nPlaces may also be cut at the\nInstitute of Education Day Nursery,\nand UL U Day Nursery, which does\nnot have a baby unit. Prices at the\nUL U Day Nursery are being\nincreased from a current average of\n\u00a337.50 per week for students to\nover \u00a3 4 2 per week. Eleanor\nMerton, Vice President of\nCommunication and Welfare at\nUL U, has expressed concern that\nstudents are 'giving up some of their\nstudies' to save on childcare costs.\nMs Merton also claimed that\ngovernment legislation to trace\nabsent parents 'violates the rights\nof the 'caring' parent. 'All the\ngovernment wants to do is to stop\nthe caring parent from claiming\nbenefit and to make the absent\nparent pay up where the\ngovernment should. The rights of\nthe caring parent are being\ncompletely squandered,' she said.\nMs Merton added that between\n15-20% of student parents were\nsingle parents. She said that the\nUL U Day Nursery was the only one\nin the central University of London\nof the statement you released to\nFelix 948, in which the financial\nhonesty of our member, Dr. John\nKerrison is brought into question.'\nThe letter then reminds Ms Bates\nthat she 'is fully aware that the\ndeliberations of the Disciplinary\nHearing held on 24 September 1992\nare confidential. The information in\nyour possession should not have\nbeen used by you in connection with\nthe no confidence motion brought\nagainst you.'\nThe letter continues by reminding\nMs Bates that it was she 'who\nprevented us (unions) from\ndiscussing this issue (the\ndisciplinary hearings) at a recent\nTrade Union Liaison Committee\nmeeting, claiming that we would be\nin breach of confidence. Since you\nhave chosen to make his matter\npublic, I would draw your attention\nto the fact that the Disciplinary\nHearing found that the question\nconcerning Dr Kerrison's honesty\nwas unsubstantiated.' The letter\nthen demands that Ms Bates send an\napology and retraction to Felix, and\nthreatens her with legal action\nshould she not do so.\narea that was available to all\nUniversity of London students. The\nImperial College Day Nursery, in\nPrince's Gardens, recently set a fundraising target of \u00a3161,000 to\npay for a major refurbishment\nprogramme. The programme aims\nto provide a new play group facility,\nalong with a drop in area, after\nschool care and a school holiday\nplay scheme. Miss S Thornett, Day\nNursery Manager, told Felix that\nwork on the improvements is due\nto start 'any day'. She also said that\nthe Day Nursery hoped not to\nincrease fees as a result of the new\nAct, and that other ways of\nfinancing the Day Nursery are\nbeing explored.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 950\n'eat ure27 November 1992\nHear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil\nDeclan Curry draws back the curtain of mystery on our secrets.\nFunny things happen on the road to\nand from Westminster. The\nDepartment for Education last week\npublished its now infamous league\ntables, giving sometimes erroneous\ninformation on the exam\nperformances of secondary school\nstudents. With some parents and\nteachers denouncing the tables, the\nPrime Minister launched a strident\ndefence. 'It is information that\nlegitimately ought to be available to\nparents,' said Mr Major. 'Every\ndemocrat should welcome its\npublication.'\nWas the publication on the same\nday that the Metropolitan Police\ncalled on Mr Alan Clarke about the\nlittle matter of his evidence to the\nMatrix Churchill trial? And didn't Mr Clarke . .er.. tell the truth at the\ntrial? Of course, not one\nGovernment minister was involved\nin any sort of cover up. Four of\nthem were. Mr Kenneth Clarke\nQC, President Michael Heseltine,\nThe Right Honorable Malcolm\nRifkind and plain Tristan GarelJones all signed 'public interest\nimmunity' certificates, designed to\nwithhold evidence from the trial. As\nfor the Prime Minister? It's just one\nof those things Mrs Thatcher didn't tell him about.\nThe truth of the matter seems to\nlie in Whitehall documents, whether\nseen by the Prime Minister or not.\nThese documents may be examined\nby the inquiry of Lord Justice Scott.\nShould they be open to\nparliamentary and, indeed, public\nscrutiny? Mark Fisher, Labour MP for Stoke Central, thinks they\nshould. The day before Inspector\nKnacker visited Alan Clarke, Mr Fisher introduced a Freedom of\nInformation Bill in the House of\nCommons. Such a bill would force\nthe disclosure of the documents that\nwould establish which ministers\nknew what when in the Iraqgate\naffair. Mr Fisher said 'Iraqgate\nfocuses the spotlight in a way it has\nnever been focused before.'\nMr Fisher added that the bill also\nestablishes a 'public interest'\ndefence in trials under the Official\nSecret Act. This would allow civil\nservants to act as whistle blowers\nwhere government impropriety\noccurs. Famous whistle blowers\ninclude Sarah Tisdall, Clive Ponting\nand Bill Goodwin. Not that we can\nmention the Official Secrets Act, as\nit is apparently a secret. As is the\nD notice, that wonderful system of\nself censorship, patrolled amazingly\nby the media. A bit like the lobby,\nthe last haunt of the retiring figure\nof John Cole.\nThe Fisher Bill, which has cross\nparty support, covers central and\nlocal government and their\ncontractors, public bodies such as\nhospitals, health authorities and\nschools, and some information held\nby larger private sector companies.\nInformation may be withheld on\ngrounds of security, international\nrelations and policy advice to\nministers.

Originally in\nthe vanguard of the New York\ninvasion from CBGB' s, with\nTalking Heads, Blondie and The\nRamones, they enjoyed huge praise\nfor the debut album 'Marquee\nMoon' and then suffered a critical\nbacklash and after the second tour\nthey called it quits.\nSince then, frontman Tom Verlaine has enjoyed an erratic\ncareer, last seen in London playing\nsolo at the Bloomsbury Theatre\nafter being dumped by his record\ncompany. I approached this reunion\nat the T&C with some degree of\ntrepidation as the new album is a rather lacklustre affair and after 14\nyears the band were now an\nunknown quan it y. The audience\nwas a mixture of faithfuls and new\nrecruits and what we were treated\nto was a total reappraisal of the new\nPulp\u2014Camden Palace\nIn a revivalist retrospective sort of\nway Pulp are a wonderful early 80s atmosphere sort of band. The sort\nof band you'd gleefully have\nplaying at your 21st party reeling\noff cover versions of Blondie, the\nJam and Adam and the Ants all\nnight.\nHowever, in a1992 'what's hip'\nsort of way Pulp are misplaced like\nWoody Allen is 'misplaced' in a children's nursery.\nIn their favour, though, Pulp do\nhave good bits that sound like\nWorld of Twist songs and as the\nlatter no longer exists (I only found\nthis out tonight, my finger having\nobviously slipped off the pop pulse\nover the summer) this may not be\nsuch a band thing. The tacky bits\nare sadly very tacky, the song that\nsounds like T Will Survive' for\nexample sounds TOO MUCH like\nT Will Survive' for me to listen\nwithout wondering that Pulp's entire repertoire wasn't borrowed\nfrom their elder brothers' record\ncollections.\nEvery song tonight is introduced\nwittily as 'this is the beginning\nof...'. I think they do this to try and\nmake us believe that although ALL the songs begin with the drumming\nfrom 'Atomic' they don't all have\nthe same words. Picking out the\ngood bits from all this is a dirty job\nand frankly I can't be bothered.\nMcCarter.\nmaterial with only a few glances at\nthe glorious past. I heard several\npeople remark\u2014Tf only they had\nrecorded the album after the tour'.\nEach number was now adorned\nwith the structures, inspired solos\nthat were the trademark of\n'Marquee Moon', and the guitar\nduets between Verlaine and Richard\nLloyd proved the power of the\ngroup when they are\ncommunicating. With microphones\ndraped before Vox amps, this was\nthe 'authentic' school of guitar\nplaying, but we were spared arty\nself-indulgence. Tom Verlaine is\nhowever one of the least voluble of\nperformers; we were several\nnumbers into the set before we were\ngreeted with 'Hello', but some\nmight consider this a bonus. The\nencores helped to satisfy those who\nhad come to relive the heady days\nof '77, but the real statement of the\nconcert was that Television are back\nwith new energy and a creative\nchemistry that should ensure that\ntheir second union continues to be\nfruitful. Next time, how abou*\nrecording the album live?\nAdrian.\nPage 18 Chicken pricks, that's what, rag gama ma. "

On the flip\nare two more toons. 'Little Bag\nO 'Sugar' is a little jazzy number,\nand 'Jonathan E', well groovy.\nThe lyrics may be from the\n'meaningless' school but who cares.\nI get enough people telling me what\nto think as it is.

Rap, I have learnt, is or at least was once\nthe music of black American people\nrelating very much to their own\npolitical and social situation.\nNow they have it in Berlin, too.\nYes, 'Born on the Wrong Side of\nTown' is, as you may have guessed,\nthe story of East Berlin ghetto\npeople having seen the coming\ndown of the Wall, being betrayed\nand exploited by the Westerners,\nbeing even worse off now than they\nused to be and being tempted to\nwish back the Wall again.\nThis is a thing from Germany for\nGermans to understand and identify\nwith, and it may not be the last thing\nnecessary to say about their specific\nsituation. Why then, for Honecker' s sake, does this / blok e sing, or rap,\nin English? Or alternatively, why\ndoes he deplore the consequences\nof a historic development that he\nhas to thank his own musical\nenlightenment to? Two other tracks\non this CD are anti-Nazi statements,\nmaybe a slightly more international\nproblem these days.\nThe answer to all this is\nobviously, I'm afraid, that / and all\nhis English and American co-writers, producers and mixers strive\nfor success on international\ndancefloor s rather than for\ninfluence on the political situation\nthey relate to.\nJan.\n\u2022 Out now on A&M. Nirvana \u2014In Bloom\nYet another single release from\n'Nevermind'\u2014like, do they really\nneed to promote it any more?\nMakes no difference to me, of\ncourse\u2014I bought the album ages\nago. This single does, however,\nconfirm just how good Nirvana\nreally are.\nA lot of people actually resent\nthem for their success, saying that\nthey've sold their souls to corporate\nrock, but what's wrong with selling\neight million records? Surely if a band as clued up and ultra-cool as\nNirvana breaks through to the big\ntime without compromising that all-important 'artistic integrity', it is a good thing.\nAnyway...\nWhile probably not the best song\non the album, 'In Bloom' still beats\nthe crap out of many records I 've\nheard on the radio recently. The\nflipside is a live version of 'Polly'\n(off the album, too) and it ain't bad,\neither.\nErm...'nuff said, I think. (Oh\nyeah, one more thing\u2014watch out\nfor the Nirvana/Jesus Lizard double\nA side single coming out sometime\nsoon.)\nJ Andelin.\nAlbums\nNeil Young \u2014Harvest Moon\nThere's a new feeling on the breeze.\nThe high priests of yesteryear glaze\nbackwards...we spy our roots, the\nthings that made us great. Bob\nDylan has returned acoustic 27\nyears after he went electric; Neil\nYoung has revisited his 1972\ntriumph 'Harvest'. Maybe it's the\nsense of their approaching O AP status that's causing the\nretrospection? Who cares, I'm not\ncomplaining. Still Neil Young has\nalready had his second adolescence,\nexploding with 'Ragged Glory',\n'Weld' and as acting grandad to\nskinny kids with feedback on their\nminds. So why not have a second\nmellowing as well?\n'Harvest Moon' displays a nostalgic mood, tripped out in the\nstyle of someone who's seen it all,\nand more, before. Now he can just\nsit on his porch, pipe in hand, dog\nasleep at his feet. Not surprisingly,\nthe content is as meandering as the\narchetypal mid-west stream, with\nenough false bands to infuriate but\nIP\nStrictly Ballroom: 'He Blinked!!'\njust enough recurrent to take you\nalong for a ride. Characteristic of\nthis is the problem of Young's vocal\nchords. Again like Dylan, they have\nbeen his deliverer and executioner\ncombined, depending on your point\nof view. 'You and Me' displays a falsetto voice delicately played\nagainst guitar and backing singer\nyet, it's over strained in the dotting\n'Such a Woman' and stagnant in\n'Harvest Moon', the title track,\nwhich makes for a disappointing\nopening series of tracks. So quickly\nonwards...\nHappily on 'One of these Days'\nand 'Old King' it's back to the gruff\nwhisky soaked tones. 'Old King' is\nthe highlight. Neil's dog has died\n(...that old hound dog is history).\nNot that he's too bothered. Lucky\nreally as a clanking hoedown\nresults. Still on 'Dreamin' Man',\nthe complexities of even wistful\nmemories are recovered; sweet\ndreams of you are a loaded gun\ndon't make happy bed mates.\nThey say a full moon makes you\nmad: With eyes like his, let's hope\nhe keeps dreaming, but not in my\nbackyard please.\nTintin.\nStrictly Ballroom\u2014O.S.T.

    "content": "Feature\nFelix 950 27 November 1992\nThe Curtain Falls... It's all over bar the shouting, Eire has decided. While the world waits,\nDeclan Curry describes what lies behind Wednesday's historic\nreferenda.\nHow would you like your foetus,\nSir? Travelled, informed or\naborted?\nLater this morning, the final votes\nwill be counted in Ireland's27 th General Election. The votes will\nalso have been counted in Ireland's trinity of abortion referenda.\nToday, Ireland is expected to have\nnew policies on abortion.\nThe last Irish Constitutional\nreferendum on abortion was in\n1983, after years of intrigue and\nchicanery by conservative anti-abortionists. By a sizeable majority,\nthe State was instructed to\n'acknowledge the right of the\nunborn with due regard to the equal\nright to life of the mother', and to\n'guarantee to respect and defend\nIt was in 1983\nafter years of\nintrigue and\nchicanery by\nconservative\nanti-abortionists\nand vindicate that right'. The\namendment effectively banned\nabortions, information on abortions,\nand counselling about abortions.\nBooks, newspapers and magazines\nwere censored or seized. Pregnancy\nand family planning advice centres\nwere closed. Medical treatment was\nrefused to pregnant women\nsuffering from cancers, leukaemia s, lymphomas, severe heart diseases,\nor other pregnancy complications.\nTravelling for abortions or abortion\ninformation was also banned, but\nrarely enforced.\nOn the one occasion when the\ntravel ban was enforced, the antiabortion case unravelled. In\nFebruary of this year, a14 year old\nrape victim, Miss X, was refused\npermission to travel to England for\nan abortion. X and her family were\nordered home like criminals to\nIreland by the Irish High Court. On\nappeal to the Irish Supreme Court,\nthe travel ban was upheld, but X was told that she could have an\nabortion in Ireland, as her attempts\nat suicide were judged to threaten\nher and the foetus's lives, whereas\nan abortion would only threaten the\nlife of the unborn child. Limited\nabortion was now legal in Ireland,\nand the campaign to ban it in all\ncircumstances began.\nAfter much ado, the Government\npromised not one, but three\nconstitutional referenda. These\ndealt separately with the right to\ntravel, the right to information, and\nthe right to limited abortion. The\nproposed travel amendment\npromised not to limit 'the freedom\nto travel between the State and\nanother state', a proposal branded\nby militant anti-abortionists Youth\nDefence as 'sending Irish children\nto be murdered in England', adding\nthat 'the right of any citizen to travel\nabroad is not the issue here'. The\nright to information 'relating to\nservices lawfully available in other\ncountries' is described by these\nvirtuous young souls as 'agents for\nabortion clinics touting in Ireland\nfor customers'.\nAnd as for abortion when\n'necessary to save the life of the\nmother when there is an illness\ngiving rise to a real risk to her life'?\n'There are no circumstances where\nthe life of the mother can be saved\nby direct termination. Abortion is\nmedieval medicine,' said Sean\nO 'Donell, Medical Research\nOfficer for Youth Defence.\nAt least 15 different pressure\ngroups were ranged on either side\nof the debate, with Ireland's five\nmain political parties adding to the\nclutter. The campaign itself has\nbeen vicious. The Irish Post Office\nwarned anti-abortion campaigners\nthat they may face prosecution if\nthey continued to send explicit\nliterature, containing pictures of\naborted foetuses, through the post.\nYouth Defence attempted to\njustify their policies, one of which\nwas the 'picketing' of MPs' homes.\nThe constitutional amendment says\n'Youth Defence do not accept that\na group of people arriving at a politician's house at 10pm could be\nconstrued as acting in an\nin timid a tory fashion. 'We intend\nplacing pickets on the homes of\nother politicians,' said Padraig\nPurcell, a spokesman. This\nexplanation was not exactly greeted\nwith joy by Nuala Fennell, a Dublin\nwoman MP who lives alone. ' A crowd of 15-18 people arrived at\nmy door,' she said. 'They were\ncrowded onto the doorstep and there\nwas a movement from the back\nSending Irish\nChildren to be\nmurdered in\nBritain\ntowards me. There were flashes of\nlight as if they were taking\nphotographs and the group stayed\noutside for about 20 minutes. I felt\nvery threatened and intimidated,'\nshe continued.\nwhat?\nIn the final week of the abortion\nand election campaigns, a candidate\nfor the rural Galway West seat\nclaimed she had received death\nthreats. Darina Costelloe, an\nIndependent candidate backed by\nthe Pro-Life group, received the\nfirst of the threatening calls in the\nmiddle of last Sunday night. 'A well\nspoken man, in slow, measured,\nrehearsed tones, told me to\nwithdraw from the campaign, or my\nlife would be in danger', she said.\nIrish police are still investigating the\nincident.\nYesterday was tense as the final\nvotes were counted, with the result\nnot declared as Felix went to press.\nIf the last opinion polls were\ncorrect, the amendments\nguaranteeing rights of travel and\ninformation were passed, while the\namendment to allow limited\nabortion when the life of the mother\nis at risk, was narrowly defeated.\nThe last government promised more\nliberal legislation if this amendment\nwas defeated. It remains to be seen\nif the new government will honour\nthat pledge. 'All is changed,\nchanged utterly. A terrible beauty\nis born.'\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\n27 November 1992 Felix 950\nJimi Hendrix - The Voodoo Chile\nRachel Mountford skins up and takes a trip down memory lane to the place where castles made of sand crumble into the sea...\nFifty years ago today a man was\nborn who would revolution is e the\nplaying of the electric guitar and\nchange the face of rock music\nforever. Twenty seven years later\nhe was dead - a victim of the rock\nand roll circus. That man was James\nMarshall Hendrix better known as\nJimi.\nVoodoo Chile\nLabelled the Wild Man Of Pop\nand the Wild man of Borneo, Jimi\nHendrix broke onto the London\nmusic scene in September 1966.\nHaving been brought over from the\nStates by ex-Animals bassist Chas\nChandler, he was quickly adopted\nby the British music press and\npublic. With his wild hair,\noutlandish clothes and sensational\nguitar playing, word soon spread\nabout this black American who was\nblowing audiences away in clubs all\nover London. Before the end of the\nyear the Jimi Hendrix Experience,\nfeaturing Noel Redding on bass and\nMitch Mitchell on drums, released\ntheir first single, 'Hey Joe', which\nreached number six in the charts.\nAn English tour was lined up for\n1967 with gigs up and down the\ncountry, including two shows at the\nSaville Theatre in London\nsupported by The Who, at the time\none of the biggest names on the\nEnglish pop scene, and gigs in\nBelgium and France. In between\ngigs they managed to find time to\nrecord 'Purple Haze', their second\nsingle which went to number three.\nBy the end of the tour in April 1967\nthey were stars. The Jimi Hendrix\nExperience continued to tour in\nEurope whilst recording their first\nalbum, aptly entitled 'Are You\nExperienced' which was released in\nMay. However, big as they were\nover here, they were still practically\nunheard of in Jimi's homeland.\nThus it was that after a final gig at\nthe Saville in London, Jimi and The\nExperience were flying out to\nAmerica.\nHouse Burning Down\nThe first International Monterey\nPop Festival was to mark the\ndawning of The Age Of Aquarius,\nand featured acts such as The\nGrateful Dead, The Who and 77ie Mamas And Papas. It was here that\nthe Jimi Hendrix Experience was to\nmake its American debut on the\nfinal day of the festival. No-one\nknew who they were and Hendrix\nwas understandably nervous.\nBefore the gig, an argument erupted\nbetween The Who and Hendrix.\nNeither band was prepared to\nfollow the other. In the end, a coin\nwas tossed and Hendrix lost. He\nleaned over and said quietly to Pete\nTownsend 'If we're going to follow\nyou, I'm going to pull out all the\nstops.'\nAfter The Who had finished their\nset it looked like Hendrix was going\nto have a hard task. The crowd were\ncrazed and it was decided that The\nGrateful Dead should play first to\ncalm the crowd. A lull before the\nstorm.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\ntook the stage and crashed straight\ninto a blasting version of 'Killing\nFloor' followed immediately by\n'Foxey Lady'. They had arrived\nand everybody knew it. They\nslowed it down with a Bob Dylan\ncover, 'Like A Rolling Stone', and\nfrom there built it up to the grand\nfinale.\nf tit, .' * * : % if iS i \u00ab ii4 S*t: 'You know, everybody says that,\nman, it is no big story about we\ncouldn't make it here so we go over\nto England and America doesn't like it because, you know, our feet s too big and we've got fat mattresses\nand we wear golden underwear. It\nain't no scene like that, brother, you\nknow, it's just laying around and\nwent to England and picked up\nthese two cats and now we're here.\nMan it's so groovy to come back\nhere this way and really get a chance to really play, you know.. .1\ncan sit here all night and say\nthankyou, thankyou, thankyou, but\nI could just as well grab you man\nand oh hh... but I just can't do that\nman so I'm gonna sacrifice\nsomething here that I really love\nokay. Don't think I'm silly doing\nthis 'cos I don't think I'm losing my\nmind. This is for everybody, this is\nthe only way I can do it. So we're\ngonna play the American and\nEnglish anthem combined. Don't get mad. There's nothing more I can do.'\nThey revved it up as far as it\nwould go and then plunged into the\nmost famous and amazing version\nof 'Wild Thing' ever witnessed.\nThe whole routine, feedback\nscreeching, playing the guitar\nbetween his legs, behind his head,\non his knees finally, the ultimate\nsacrifice, igniting his guitar and\nthen smashing it, still burning, to\nbits before flinging it to the crowd.\nThey left the stage in triumph.\nHendrix had come home.\nIf My Daddy Could See Me Now\nThey had become international\nsuperstars overnight, but as is so\noften the case there was a long story\nbehind Hendrix's success. He had\nbeen working for this since having\nbeen invalided out of the army as\na paratrooper five years previously.\nHe spent these five years working\nfrom gig to gig, backing musicians\nsuch as Little Richard, Sam Cooke\nand The Isley Brothers. However\nHendrix inevitably got bored of\nbeing a backing man and longed for\nthe limelight. Little Richard recalled\nhow Jimi continually tried to\nupstage him.\nHe frequently had so little money\nthat he couldn't afford to buy new\nstrings to play gigs. Black guitarists\nwere supposed to play blues, and\nblues guitarists, even good ones\nwere ten a penny. No-one seemed\ninterested in a black man playing\nthe most amazing rock guitar. Until\nLinda Keith, Keith Richard's girlfriend, sent Chas Chandler\nalong to check him out Jimi was just\nanother guitarist wondering where\nthe next gig was coming from. Chas\nwas looking for an act to take back\nto England to manage and Jimi was\nthat act.\nPage 12\nFelix 950\n'eat ure27 November 1992\nat Fifty\nWhen they got to England a band\nwas needed. Noel Redding turned\nup to what he thought was an\naudition for guitarist in The New\nAnimals only to find the position\nalready filled. When Chas asked if\nhe could play bass and sit in with\nJimi for a jam he was so broke he\nwas game for anything. They hit it\noff immediately and with Mitch\nroped in on drums The Experience\nwas born.\nAfter Monterey, the band carried\non touring and recording, releasing\ntwo further studio albums, 'Axis -Bold As Love', and 'Electric\nLadyland'. The latter marked a new\ndirection in Hendrix's musical\nstyle. He was trying to move\ntowards bigger bands with many\ndifferent musicians sitting in for\nlong extended jams. Studio time\nwas increasing and Jimi was\ndabbling in the production, too.\nThis started to have its effect on the\nband. Noel was unhappy with the\nnumber of extra musicians and\nhangers on perpetually present in\nthe studio. Things were taking too\nlong and tempers were getting\nfrayed. In the end Noel and The\nExperience went different ways.\nElectric Gypsy\nNoel Redding was replaced by\nJimi's old army buddy, bassist Billy\nCox and the band was extended by\nLarry Lee, Juma Sultan and Jerry\nVelez. In 1969 they played at the\nWoodstock Music And Art Fair.\nThey played a superb set of jams\nand extended compositions,\nshowing Jimi's increasing trend\ntowards a jazz orientated\nperforming style. However the\ncrowd, waiting for the pyrotechnics\nof two years back, soon became\nimpatient and finally many walked\nout. A sad ending for the man who\nhad been voted 'Performer of the\nYear' by Rolling Stone magazine\nonly six months previously.\nWanting to make a new start Jimi\ncompletely disbanded the\nExperience and start again.\nBuddy Miles was recruited on\ndrums and A Band Of Gypsies was\nformed. Concerts moved towards\nbecoming nothing more than live\njam sessions. Jimi's fans still\nwanted to hear 'Purple Haze' and\n'Fire' but Hendrix wasn't prepared\nto deliver. He was changing and he\nwanted his audience to grow with\nhim. The final live performance of\nthe Band Of Gypsies was at the\nWinter Festival For Peace in New\nYork City. Jimi left the stage after\nplaying only two numbers. The\nBand Of Gypsies was dead.\nCry Of Love\nJimi took some time off after this,\nconsidering where he was going\nmusically. In the end Mitch\nMitchell was brought back and The\nJimi Hendrix Experience was ready\nto take on the World again. The\n'Cry Of Love Tour' started in April\nwith a stunning concert at The LA Forum in California. The stadium\nwas packed with expectant fans and\nthey were not disappointed.\n'Spanish Castle Magic' and 'Foxey\nLady' opened the set followed by\na selection of new music and music\nfrom the Band Of Gypsies, finishing\nwith 'The Star Spangled Banner',\n'Purple Haze' and 'Voodoo Chile'\n(slight return). Jimi was finally on\nhis way back up with the new\nmaterial being stronger than\nanything he had produced in a long\ntime. The tour continued\nthroughout the spring and summer,\nincluding a show back in his home\ntown of Seattle.\nStone Free\nOn August 27th, The Experience\nflew to England for the Isle Of\nWight Festival which he was due to\nheadline. With the festival running\nlate Jimi didn't take the stage until\nthe early hours of Monday\nmorning. The whole performance\nwas hindered by equipment trouble\nand it wasn't helped by Hendrix's apprehension at playing back in\nEngland again. He'd been away for\na long time. Jimi, obviously\nfrustrated, finally turned to the\naudience. 'If you can hold on a little\nbit, I think we can get it together.\nAlright? Cos I'm goin' to stay here\nall night until somebody moves.'\nThey started again with 'Freedom'\nand 'Red House' and carried on\nthrough a mix of old and new\nmaterial. It was to be Jimi's last gig\nin England. On 18th September\n1970 he was dead.\nMany versions about the events\nleading up to his death exist, but one\nthing is undoubtedly true. It was an\naccident, a tragic but avoidable\naccident. The official cause of death\nwas recorded as inhalation of vomit\ndue to barbiturate intoxication and\nan open verdict was returned. He\nwas twenty seven.\nBold As Love\nWhat are we to make of this man\nwho was different things to different\npeople. The wild man of pop was\na quiet, even timid, man, charming\nand a true genius. He took the\nelectric guitar and redefined the\nparameters of rock music. His\nawesome power and control of\neffects from feedback to wah-wah\nwas balanced by compositions of\nsuch .immeasurable beauty that it\nseems inconceivable that they could\nbe the same man. He has been\ncopied by many, but that is all they\nwill ever be - copies. Hendrix was,\nand still is, the greatest composer,\ninventor and innovator of electric\nguitar playing.\nPage 13\n\n"

It is for this reason that\nthe Islamic Society has organised an\nIslamic Week between 30th November to 4th December. This\nwill consist of lectures as well as a stall in the JCR, where everyone is\nwelcome to attend and learn about\nIslam and Muslims.\nSo why may you ask, should this\ninterest you.

The London region of the\nstudent Industrial Soceity hitched\nfrom London to Paris for Children\nin Need Day, last Friday to raise\nseveral thousand pounds for this\ncharity event. Ten teams went from\nImperial, with about 150 teams\nfrom all over London and the South\nEast hitching in all.\nThis was probably the best event\nthat we went on with the Industrial\nSociety this year and is the best\nweekend that most of us have spent\nin the last year!\nThe teams gathered in Hyde Park\nat 8.45am on Friday and after being\nregistered started on their way to the\nEiffel Tower in Paris. Photos were\ntaken by The Times and The\nTelegraph and several people were\nin te reviewed by LW T, STOIC and\nUCL television crews. Most of the\nhitch ers were in fancy dress which\nhelped them no end in getting\nhitches to Paris. The first real\nhitch ers to arrive and the fastest\ncame from Greenwich University.\nThe fastest real hitch ers won a Financial Times filo fax and\nEurodiary each along with euro lines train tickets for a route of their\nchoice up to a certain value. They\nmade it in nine hours eight minutes\ndoor to door. The first team to\narrive at the finishing point were\nMaryane Walsh and Bill Quinton\n(awarded the 'first cheaters to\narrive' prize) from Imperial. They\nmade it in just over five hours,\nfollowed closely by James Evans\nand Antonia Blewett who were\ngiven complementary tickets by\nBritish Midland Airways.\nThe fastest cheaters also came\nbut forced themselves to enjoy the\nflight nevertheless!! The meal and\nwine were both excellent and in the\nbat of an eyelid (40 minutes in fact)\nthey had arrived at Charles de\nGaulle airport. After leaving Hyde\nPark five hours previously, they had\nnow arrived at the Eiffel Tower,\nwith the whole weekend in front of\nfrom Imperial. By sheer genius (or\nmaybe by being at the right place\nat the right time) Rick Bilby (ICU\ndep pre s) and Nefyn Jones (IndSoc\nchair) persuaded Air UK to give\nthem complementary tickets on\ntheir last flight of the day to Paris.\nThey were extremely disappointed\nto discover that this was their\nbusiness class Stirling Service flight\nthem.\nMany of the hitch ers gave the\norganisers a helping hand and\nNefyn stayed at the finishing point\nto log teams in overnight. Some of\nthe stories were incredible...The six\nhitch ers that were picked up by a Frenchman and taken to a local bar\nwhere he opened an account for\nthem, the took them home where\nstarving mother in the scorching\nheat of Africa, who has to watch\nevery moment of her child starve to\ndeath, that life is what you make it,\nnothing more and nothing less.\nWhat you live for is what you die\nfor.\nWell Islam has news for you.

I have\nhowever become disenchanted with\nthe new column: Cat's Eyes.\nOn the 6th of November it was\npretty good. The following week it\nhad become irrelevant. Last week,\nPJ Dodd really lost it. What I read\nwas half a page of cynical self-gratification on the part of the\nauthor. I got the feeling that he was\nlooking for topics with which to fill\nStatement\nDear Jonty,\nAs you know, Overseas Week\n'92 took place last week. There\nwere some excellent stalls and it is\nevident that these societies have put\ngreat effort into the event. The\nresponse from overseas societies\nwas extremely encouraging with 19\nout of 25 societies taking part. Can\nwe get a one hundred per cent\nresponse next year?\nI would like to thank all those\nwho participated in Overseas Week\n'92, especially Harpreet Singh\nChohan and Janakan Nadarajah\nFelix950 his page; perhaps a little\nhypocritical in the light of his\nremarks on tacky space fillers.\nHis musings are already full of\nunnecessary crude language,\npersonal attacks that border on\nclich e and narrow minded political\nviews that only serve to lower the\nhigh standard that I have come to\nexpect of Felix.\nI hope Mr Dodd takes this light\ncriticism as it is intended and not as\nmaterial for his increasingly\ndisappointing column.\nYours,\nC Pease, Physics 2.\nwho were directly responsible for\nits organisation. It is at such events\nthat the rest of College, especially\nUK students, can discover the\nculture and background of the\noverseas students at Imperial\nCollege.\nUnfortunately, there was a disturbance which forced the\npremature closure of the event on\nthe second day. This has been given\nample publicity in last week's Felix\nso I shan't say any more, except that\nthe people who caused the raucous\nCult Watch\nDear Jonty,\nIt has come to the attention of the\nChristian Union in college that there\nis presently a very high level of\nactivity amongst cult groups at IC\n(and UCL, see London Student\nmagazine). Of particular concern to\nus is the 'work' of the Central\nLondon Church of Christ (CLCC)\non campus. This group is a recognised cult and is banned at IC,\ndue to their aggressive tar getting of\nstudents and problems with people\nwho have wished to leave the group\nin the past.\nIt has been their practice to\napproach people in the JCR and on\nwalkways and hassle them to come\nto one of their bible studies\n(Tuesdays and Fridays). The\nChristian Union has had experience\nwith C LCC in previous years and\nwe would strongly advise people\nagainst getting involved with them.\nDon't go to their bible studies, and\nespecially don't give them your\ndo not represent overseas students.\nMy apologies to those whose hard\nwork was destroyed.\nUnlike last year, food was\nprohibited in accordance with\nCollege policy. Most stalls\ncomplied with this ruling. It is a address or phone number. If you\ndo, expect continuous pestering to\ngo to their meetings. C LCC are a highly structured organisation, and\nonce you are a member they will try\nto control your life to a great extent.\nLarge commitments of both time\nand money are expected, as is\nconformity with the leadership's ideas.\nWe would also like to point out\nthat the Christian Union\ndepartmental bible studies are on\nThursday lunchtimes and we don't invite complete strangers to our\nmeetings (although everybody is\nwelcome). Finally if anybody has\nhad problems with the C LCC and\nwould like to talk about it, we\nwould be happy to help. There is\na Christian Union pigeonhole in the\nUnion Office, or contact me\nthrough the aeronautical\ndepartment.\nJon Jordan, Aero 3.\ngreat shame that food was\nprohibited, since food has always\nbeen popular and moreover it is an\nexcellent way to express one's culture.\nYours sincerely,\nYen Yang Lim.\nCrossword by Sphinx\nAcross\n7.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 Li LI 1 11\nIssue 950 27 November 1992\nGreenwich 'Ultra\nVires' Shock\nJump for Rag\nby the News Editor\nGreenwich University Students'\nUnion has been banned by the High\nCourt from campaigning against the\nIsraeli government. An injunction\nwas brought against the union's sabbaticals by John Meyer, a Conservative Student activist at\nGreenwich. The union's President\nand Vice President were ordered to\npay individual costs of almost \u00a3500\neach.\nThe case was heard before Mr\nJustice Vinelott, who banned the\nunion from acting on a motion\npassed on 5 November. The motion\nmandated the union to campaign\nagainst the actions of the Israeli\ngovernment in the West Bank and\nGaza Strip. It also called on the\nunion to affiliate to the Friends of\nBir Zeit University, and to the\nGeneral Union of Palestinian\nStudents.\nThe ban was granted under the\nultra vire s rules, which forbid a union from engaging in activities\nwhich involve political\ncampaigning, or which involve a union in spending money without\nany clear educational benefit. The\nrules were first drafted by the\nAttorney General's office in 1984,\nin the aftermath of some limited\nstudent support for the Miner's Strike. A potential breach of the\nultra vire s rules by Hull University\nStudents' Union is now being\ninvestigated by the Treasury\nSolicitor.\nConservative Students were\ngranted a preliminary junction\nagainst the union on 16 November.\nThis banned the union from\ncampaigning against the actions of\nthe Israeli government, and from\nsending letters to the Israeli\nEmbassy and the Israeli Ministry of\nDefence. At the second hearing on\n23 November, both Greenwich\nUnion's President, Paul Thomas,\nand Vice President, Kevin Small,\nconceded that they could not defend\ntheir plans.\nThis is the first time that a permanent injunction has been\ngranted against the campaigns of a students' union. Richard Harwood,\nBar student and former\nConservative Student national\nofficer, said after the 23 November\nhearing, 'all student unions should\nnow stop any campaigning on\nPalestine'. John Meyer, the\nConservative Student activist who\nbrought the case said, 'the Union\nwas blatantly breaking the law. It\nis about time the Union spent\nmoney on students rather than on\npolitical campaigning'. Both Mr.\nThomas and Mr. Small were\nunavailable for comment yesterday\nafternoon.\nThe decision was welcomed by\nJames Pawsey, Chairman of the\nConservative Backbench Education\nCommittee. Mr Pawsey said, 'this\nclearly shows that student unions\nshould spend their time on\nrepresenting their members instead\nof dabbling in political affairs'.\nJohn Patten, the Education\nSecretary added, 'it is only a few\nstudents who get involved in\nsupporting dubious causes of no\ninterest to other students. Why\nshould the taxpayer have to pay for\nit?'\nMarcus Krackowizer on the way down as he performs a sponser ed bungee\njump for RAG. This is believed to be the second ever wheelchair bungee\njump in England, the event raised \u00a33000. Pic by Ian Gillett\nUnion Rumpus\nBy Gareth Light.\nThree incidents on the night of\nFriday 20th November in the Union\nBuilding have led to disciplinary\nhearings being called for the\nstudents concerned.\nOn two separate occasions a total\nof four students were caught trying\nto enter the Union Building illegally\nthrough an open window. The\nstudents were apprehended by\nUnion Stewards who obtained\nidentification from three of them,\nthe fourth could not produce a Union Card.\nRick Bilby, the Union's Deputy\nPresident gave Felix a statement\nyesterday about a further incident:\n'Later on, two different students\nwere physically and verbally\nabusive to members of Union staff,\nparticularly a certain female\nSteward who was alone at the time,\nand very shaken by the incident.'\nHe went on to say that the second\nincident was mainly due to\ndrunkenness rather than malice, and\nis being regarded as less serious\nthan the former. However, all\nstudents involved face disciplinary\naction this week.\n3 / 4 / 5\nReaders'\nLetters\n1 0\nIrish\nVote\n1 2 / 1 3\nJimi at\nFifty\n1 6 - 2 2\nReviews\nRound-up\n\n"

We are here to broaden the\nminds of fellow students and\ndemonstrate how good recorded\nmusic can really sound when played\nthrough a 'serious' hi fi system.\nAudioSoc has its own hi fi equipment, one system worth\naround \u00a3900, and another worth\n\u00a3 2 , 0 0 0 + . In addition to\ndemonstrating our own equipment\n(and hiring it out to members) we\nalso organise evenings with two of\nLondon's best hi fi dealers\u2014The\nCornflake Shop and The Listening\nRooms.\nOther ser vies include discounted\nLP/cassette/CD software through a distributor, 5% special discount for\nmembers at The Cornflake Shop\nand blank tapes at low prices.\nOnce a term the society organises\na day trip to ahi fi manufacturer so\nthat members get a chance to see\nhow the equipment is designed and\nmanufactured\u2014previous visits have\nincluded Michell, Meridian, Quad,\nArcam, Nairn, Roksan, Pink\nTriangle and Monitor Audio.\nA few weeks ago a minibus full\nof keen AudioSoc members took a Wednesday off to go on a visit to\nRega Research in Southend. Rega\nhave been manufacturing turntables\nfor many years and have recently\nbranched out into amplifiers and\nloudspeakers.\nWe arrived at Rega about 10am and after some refreshments were\nshown around the Rega\nheadquarters by the MD, Roy\nGandhi. All the assembly\ntechniques (turntables, cartridges\nand tone arms) were very well\nexplained and there was even the\nopportunity for members of\nAudioSoc to have a go!\nAfter a buffet lunch we were\ntaken to Rega's suppliers of PCBs\nand then on to Rega's second\nfactory where their amplifiers and\nloudspeakers are assembled and\ntested. The visit was rounded off,\nto our surprise, with an invite back\nto Roy's house for dinner and a chance to li ten to his hi fi and discuss\nthe design methods.\nIt was one of the best visits we've\never had to a manufacturer and as\nan added bonus Roy donated both\nthe Rega Elys cartridge and a pair\nof Rega Ela speakers (\u00a380 and \u00a3405\nrespectively) to the club.\nThe next visit lined up is an\nevening with The Listening Rooms\nnearer to Xmas. In addition, the\nclub is on the point of purchasing\na new turntables\u2014the Romsan\nXerxes\u2014worth \u00a31200. We are\nsubsequently planning a special\nAudioSoc demonstration evening\nwhere we will play off the Xerxes\nagainst the society's Meridian 206\nCD player (\u00a31000). Which will be\nbetter, vinyl or CD?\nIf you're interested in joining\ncome along Tuesday lunchtimes to\nSouthside Upper Lounge or contact\nRichard Bentinck, Chem Eng 4 or\nRichard Pratt, Elec Eng 2.\nICSF - Dick Tracy\nThis Tuesday, ICSF is proud to\npresent Dick Tracy. Warren Beatty\nstars in this action extravaganza\nalongside Dustin Hoffman (Rain\nMan), James Caan (Misery), Al Pacino (The Godfather trilogy) and\nMadonna (who manages to keep\ncertain items of clothing on for the\nbulk of the film).\nThe action centres around the\nbattle between cop Tracy (Beatty)\nand crime kingpin 'Big Boy'\nCaprice (Pacino) in a nameless '30s American city. Things get more\ncomplicated however, after the\nintervention of a mysterious,\nfaceless villain called 'The Blank'\nThe film is shot primarily in\nseven colours for a comic book feel\nand features a stunning cast that also\nincludes Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas),\nMandy Patinkin (Alien Nation) and\nDick Van Dyke (anyone remember\nMary PoppinsT), many of whom are\nunder extra odin ary make-up.\nCome and see if you can\nrecognise them all at 6.45pm( for\n7 o 'clock) in Mech Eng 220 this\nTuesday. Members get in for \u00a3 1 ;\nmembership costs \u00a3 3 , which\nincludes first film entry free.\n1 U \u00a3g^H.1 Generous to a fault, this week\nFilmSoc gives you two Disney\nclassics for the price of one; Little\nMermaid and Sleeping Beauty.\nSomewhere under the sea,\nbeyond your imagination, lies an\nadventure in fantasy! When a headstrong mermaid named Ariel\nfalls in love with a dashing and bold\nhuman prince, she longs to be part\nof the magical and dazzling world\non land. With the help of her\nfriends, shy, lovable Flounder and\nSebastian, a reggae-singing crab,\nAriel bravely ventures from her\nunderwater home to try and win her\nprince's love in a thrilling race\nagainst time. Stunning animation,\nOscar-winning songs, and\nunforgettable new characters make\nthis Disney masterpiece a treasure\nto be enjoyed now, and for\ngenerations to come.\nSleeping Beauty is set in a magical kingdom, and tells the story\nof a king and queen who long for\na child. At last, the queen gives\nbirth to a daughter, and great\ncelebrations are held. Seven fairies\nwere invited to give gifts, however\nthey forgot an old and wicked fairy,\nwho was so angry that she made a prophecy that on the child's sixteenth birthday the princess\nshould die by pricking her finger on\nthe spindle of a spinning wheel. A young fairy was unable to undo the\nwicked spell, but instead of dying,\nthe princess would fall asleep for\none hundred years, until a young\nprince comes and awakens her. This\ncharming and mystical classic is\ntruly wonderful entertainment for\nboth young and old.\nSo, to get in the mood for\nChristmas come along to Mech Eng\n220 on Thursday 3rd December.\nLittle Mermaid and Sleeping Beauty\nstart at 7pm and 8.30pm respectively, and the standard\nadmission charges cover both films.\nEntry is 90p for members and\nchildren, \u00a3 1 . 9 0 for non-members\nand \u00a36.50 to become a member,\nwith your first film free.

She\nsounds a bit like Sinead O 'Connor,\nthat's how dull it is. Where's the\nbar? I know it's in here\nsomewhere...\nThere's a very strange guitar tree\nat the side of the stage. It's probably\nthe only tree in West London which\nhasn't been disfigured with\ncoloured lights. Shit, man, the\nfloor's shaking. I can see it now\n'Satanic Rock Band Destroy Albert\nHall'. Eric Clapton's home hasn't seen anything like it. Mercury Rev\ndon't exactly excite the crowd:\nthey're just sort of standing there.\nThey're not even swaying. I wonder\nif they're enjoying it. I am. I haven't even thought about the bar\nyet, that's how good this is. A man\nin a Sultans Of Ping shirt shouts\n'You're shit.' A man in a Ping shirt!\nThere's hope yet.\nDebbie Harry just walked by. She\ndid. The House Of Love run\nthrough some hits. Debbie Harry's here. The House Of Love play\n'Feel', probably the best lager in the\nworld. Damn. And I swore I wasn't going to mention the bar in this\nparagraph. Debbie Harry's in this\nbuilding. I could have touched her.\nMercury rev-ea led The House Of Love play\n'Christine'. Debbie Harry's here.\nThe House Of Love do some\nencores.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 The House Of Love's new\nsingle 'Crush Me' is out now on\nFontana. Mercury Rev releases on\nBeggars Banquet.\nThe Senseless Bottoms (in joke).\nThe House of Love\u2014A View\nfrom the Balcony\nThe House of Love were only in the\ncountry for 24 hours in between a tour of the States with Catherine\nWheel and someone else (wasn't listening) and were keen to sell their\nbrilliant new album 'Bake Rainbow'\nto any converts, (the mate I took\nwas one) with freebee 10\" singles\nand playing seven of the album's ten\ntracks. There weren't any major\nsurprises\u2014opening quietly with\n'Beatles and the Stones', ending\nwith 'Love in a Car' building up to\na crescendo. Lots of great songs,\nwell played in a great venue\u2014good\natmosphere, good acoustics =\nGreat Set.\nThe Senseless ThingsHomophobic Asshole\nWhy should people be persecuted\nfor their sexuality? Gay people\nshouldn't be treated any differently\nto you, me or anybody else, and that\nincludes probably gay or looks\ncamp. An interesting point to note\nabout deceiving appearances, take\nMorrissey: so incredibly camp, but\nsuch a stud (great paradox\u2014popular\nwith women but without macho\nbullshit). It's not just about\nsexuality, if you get grief for your\nrace, religion, culture or whatever,\nsimply say fuck off. You are\nentitled to be who you are and\nidentity and free expression is a very deep part of you; if you're\nhappy and comfortable with your\nwhole being and very existence, and\nyou feel that's right, then let it be.\nGetting that one off my chest, the\nsingle is brilliant. Marvel in its\nanger and aggression, the punk\ninfluence, the sheer immensity of its\npower, and the almost\npsychopathic ally visual depiction of\nthe attitude on James Hewlett's cover artwork. An intense catharsis\nof innermost frustrations against\nindividuals and society.\nBased around the chance meeting\nof the 'homophobic asshole' by the\nband in the bar, initially thinking\nhim alright for his musical tastes,\nbut soon turned sour when he\nstarted 'cussing gays'. By the\nsounds of it, the band never told\nhim what they eventually thought of\nhim\u2014but now they have. Bitter\nsweet.\nLucas.\n\u2022 Out now on Epic/Sony. The\nopinions conveyed in this article are\nnot necessarily the views of the\neditor or staff of Felix,\nBundesbank, or George Harris of\nNewquay.\nSenseless Things\u2014Clapham\nGrand\nI feel like an a untie watching the\nSenseless Things again. An extremely ashamed a untie that\nhasn't been to see her sister's gorgeous children for such a long\ntime. But I can still make up for last\ntime now can'tI?I still know them\nwell ad n they haven't really\nchanged that much have they?\nOh my but haven't they grown?\nThey've got longer hair now but I still know it's my boys when I see\nthose cheeky grins from under their\nfringes. Have they still got the same\ntoys I wonder? The ones we\nenjoyed together so much on that\nsunny morning in Reading two\nyears ago. Yes, of course they have\nbut they've got some lovely new\nones as well now. Big bold shiny\nones that make more noise than the\nold ones and they're altogether\nbetter boys aren't they? Much more\nsensible for boys their age.\nThe new ones like 'Holdit\nDown', 'Everybody's Gone' and\n'Easy to Smile' do sound good,\nvery good in fact but I know I 've\nmissed them dearly when I hardly\nrecognise any of their new tunes.\nThey still bring a lovely smile to\nAuntie's face though when they sing\nher favourites. 'Shoplifting' and\n'Too Much Kissing' remind her of\nbetter years gone by.\nBut oh dear, here's one called\n'Homophobic Asshole', surely their\nmother wouldn't let them sing that\none to her friends would she? I think they're old enough to make up\ntheir own minds don't you Auntie\nBeeb?\nThe Senseless Things leave a untie absolutely cold. Excellent.\nMcCarter.\nElm. Upton, St James's, Wimbledon.

    "content": "Felix 950\nReviews27 November 1992\nNightfall by Asimov and\nSilverberg\nA pre/post apocalypse scenario\nplayed out on a world surrounded\nby six suns that never let the planet\nslip into darkness, except once\nevery 2049 years. A simple\nsummary of a non-too-spectacular\nstory that has its moments but does\nnot hit the mark all the way\nthrough. Famed for his Foundation\nseries with it's many convolutions,\nNightfall begins well with four\ngroups of people uncovering the\nprospect of a world in disarray in\nless than a years time. This lasts for\na little under half of the book and\nworks well while the four groups\nconnect through various plausible\nfriends and acquaintances.\nA fanatical religious organisation\npredicts the coming of darkness, the\nrevelation of stars and the scorching\nof the cities. An observatory group\ndenies the possibility and then\ndiscovers deviations in their planets\norbit. An archaeologist uncovers a hill layered with cities separated by\ncharcoal lines. And a psychiatrist\ndiscovers the disastrous effects of\nprolonged exposure to total\ndarkness. Thus the scene is set and\nvery nicely too.\nFollowing the calamity comes the\nrestructuring of society and this is\nwhere the boredom sets in. Not one\nof the characters has become dear\nto ones heart and thus the death of\neven the sweetest one matters not.\nIt has all been done before and the\nstruggle of all the small groups\nagainst the disturbing religious cult\ndoesn't even rattle my atheistic\nbrain. Overall a rather\ndisappointing read.\nAlcatraz.\n\u2022 Published 27th November by\nPan, \u00a34.99.\nChild of Time\nSilverberg\nAsimov &\nIt was a neat idea.

First he is a scientific marvel and them when the\ninitial hype has died away the\nanthropologists are disappointed\nwith the little information he yields.\nThen the emotional sub-plot, that\nhas been simmering away just\nbeneath the surface erupts. What a shame.\nTechnically speaking the righting\nis of the high standard expected,\nrequired almost. But that is not\nenough.

In the beginning, the excuse\nwas that nobody knew who Major\nwas. Unfortunately, the Private Eye\nsatirists haven't updated their\nknowledge. The result is that the\nwriting is neither sharp nor\namusing. It struggles to be mildly\nfunny, and has all the perception of\na three year old. The quick sketches\nof the other cabinet figures aren't so bad, though. 'My friend Chris'\nas a conniving g it?

I think 'Dear Bill' is\namu sant com meI agne au, so much\nso that I scour second hand\nbookshops for past issues, like a second rate literary prostitute. Of\ncourse, 'Dear Bill' has the\nadvantage in that Sir Denis\nThatcher, Bart, is still an unknown\ncommodity, with the effect that\nanything written about him can be\ndeemed within character. Not that\n'Dear Bill' is about Denis at all. His\nlady wife, she of 'Children in Need'\nfame, is the real target, and here the\nbullets sing home.\nBut then again, Richard Ingrams\nwas more subtle and humorous than\nthe piss poor Hislop.

    "content": "Editorial\nThe OSC mafia\nOne of the greatest assets of\nImperial College is the wealth of\ncultures that gather to study here.\nEven though we have many\ndisadvantages, racism is much less\nprevalent in our hallowed halls,\nthan in the rest of the British\nUniversity system. These two facts\nare not unconnected; knowledge of\na foreign country destroys\nprejudice; familiarity does not breed\ncontempt, it builds lasting\nfriendships and understanding.\nUnfortunately with a melting pot\nof cultures comes other conflicts;\nlast week's incident in the JCR was\njust another example in the\ncontinuing saga, as anyone who has\nbeen here for an extended period of\ntime will tell you. Into this morass\nof difficulties comes the Overseas\nStudents Committee, given the job\nof representing and organising these\nsocieties in College. Not an easy job\nat the best of times but mix in a liberal dose of ethnic tension and it\nbecomes impossible.\nConsquently, it is not surprising\nthat the Overseas Student\nCommittee Chairman chooses to\ntake issue with trivial and\nun contest able points in last week's front page news story; it is not\nshocking when all three sides\ncomplain about the number of\ncolumn inches their side of the story\nreceived; and tiresomely predictable\nwhen the Malaysian Society write\na banal letter of complaint about an\nun contentious news story buried on\nthe second page concerning changes\nin catering law.\nAll in all, I am not overwhelmed\nby the fact that OSC tends to act like\na mafia, but I would rather they\ndidn't. Whether OSC likes it or not\npolitical differences are part of\nother country's culture; the\ndiscussion of these issues is part of\nthe education of both British and\nother foreign students. Surely it is\nbetter to have that debate than not.\nNo one believes tourist brochures;\nit is better to deal with the realities,\notherwise what could be a rich,\nFelix 950\nworthwhile collection of cultures\nbecomes a triviality.\nCCU Rags\nHaving become the object of all the\nire among C CU hacks it is only fair\nto redress some of the balance.\nRachel, Max and Andrew, the\neditors of the various C CU organs\nare doing a surprisingly good job,\nsurprising because of the level\nfacilities they have to hand and that\nthe efforts of the majority of their\npredecessors were so poor. It is\neasy to criticise, but how many\nother people at Imperial can say\nthey have produced a regular\nnewspaper? A point which many\nother members of CCU's should\ntake note of.\nUnion wonderful shock\nI can officially declare that\nImperial College Union has the\nmost wonderful finance officer in\nthe entire world. I must confess a smidgeon of self interest, but I did\nrecieve a much needed cheque mere\nminutes after asking for it, for that,\nthank you.\nOpinion\n27 November 1992\nThanks again to all those below,\nand to those that I have\ninconsiderately omitted, may they\nall receive the bountiful blessings\nof which ever idol they choose to\nworship.\nNews; Declan, Gareth, Mimi,\nDave Goddard, Sang, Phil,\nTanya.\nFeatures; Beccy ' I can take it'\nLand, RACHEL, Mike, Jon\nJordon, David Spooner, TWF in\ntheir many guises.\nReviews; Sara, Catherine, Ian,\nPhil, Poddy, Mario, Sam, Chris\nStapleton, Rob.\nSport: Sarmad Jonathan and\nKhurrum\nWhat's On: Steve, Poddy\nSpecial Thanks: Rose, Andy,\nSimon who is not missing, The\nmysterious missing James,\nDominic, Chris, Rick, Steve\nNewhouse Richard for\n'great generosity.\nJ CR Outrage Open Letter to the Chair of the\nCollege Athletics Committee Dear Mr Chairman,\nWe are writing to express our\ndeep concern regarding the\nproposed Sports Centre pricing\npolicy in relation to IC students and\nstaff.\nBefore we set out our detailed\ncriticism may we quote the\nManaging Director from the\n'Network' of May 1992, from the\narticle entitled, 'Sports Centre\nImprovements':\n'It must be stressed that students\nand staff will not be paying for the\nrefurbishment, any more than the\nusers of the Day Nursery have been\nexpected to pay for its recently\ncompleted refurbishment. We are\nsimply seizing the opportunity to\nimprove the facilities on offer for\neveryone who studies or works at\nthe College.'\nIf these are the Managing\nDirector's views, how is it that\nincreases of such magnitude are\nbeing proposed? For example, for\na member of staff the annual season\nticket for the gymnasium and\nswimming last year cost \u00a340; for\nnext year, four three-monthly\nseason tickets for peak time use\nwould cost \u00a3 1 6 0 ; an increase of\n300%! The proposed increases are\nmade even more dramatic when\ncompared with recent staff salary\nawards (4.5%) and the increasing\nfinancial difficulties of students\nseeking to survive on loans and\nmaintenance grants frozen in 1991.\nOn joining the College, students\nand staff are offered a total package,\nwhich includes sports facilities. If\nthis package is eroded by increasing\nthe prices for the use of these\nfacilities over and above the rate of\ninflation, it will be a significant\ndisincentive to future recruitment of\nboth students and staff.\nOther comments regarding the\nproposed scheme are as follows:\n1. a peak/off peak differential\nshould not be established for\nCollege users who may not have the\noption of using the Centre during\noff peak periods.\n2. annual season tickets should\ncontinue to be issued as before.\n3. changing facilities for runners\nshould continue to be available.\nWe would be grateful if you\nwould raise the above matters at the\nnext meeting of the Athletics\nCommittee. If these proposals go\nahead, the so called refurbishment\nwill not have broadened the appeal\nof the Sports Centre, rather it would\nDear Felix,\nI look back at the incident in the\nJCR on Wednesday (18th November 1992) with sadness and\ndisgust. What I find sad is that the\nobjectives of an occasion such as the\nOverseas Week were defeated and\nwhat I find even sadder still, if not\ndisgusting, is that material such as\nthe controversial poster and several\nother pamphlets were displayed.\nI resent the fact that the Turkish\nSociety claimed that the material on\ntheir stand was only being used to\npromote Turkish beliefs and\nculture, the objectives of the\nOverseas Week (Felix, 949). I seriously do not see how drawing\nattention to the Turkish invasion of\nNorth Cyprus in 1974 could in any\nway promote the beliefs and culture\nof Turkey, unless they are those\nrelated to all invaders. However, I would like to point out that not\nputting up such material would have\navoided the particular incident from\noccurring and perhaps people would\nhave vastly reduced its\nattractiveness to College users. The\nfuture availability of IC sports\nfacilities at prices comparable with\nthose in other College and\nUniversities in London is an\nimportant issue. We would\ntherefore appreciate if you would\nreply to this letter via the columns\nhave had a chance to learn more\nabout Turkey. The topic of the\ninvasion is particularly sensitive to\nthe Cypriots and this will not come\nas a surprise to the Turkish Society\nfrom past incidents. So I ask was\nit that necessary to provoke them?\nI agree with the Turkish Society\non the count that their material was\nnot political, but it was either\nignorance or arrogance to deny that\nit was not sensitive. If it was\nignorance, they had ample time and\nwarning to take it down. But...\nAs overseas students we are given\nan opportunity to introduce and\npromote our respective countries\nthrough various annual activities\nsuch as the Overseas Week and\nOverseas Night. Let us be wise in\nwhat we choose to display and take\ninto consideration the feelings of\nour friends around the globe. We\ncome from far and near, to learn,\nto share and to make friends, let us\ndo just that.\nSangkaran Ratnam, CE2.\nof Felix and Network, in order to\nkeep members of the College fully\ninformed of events.\nYours faithfully,\nT Allen, MRE; AR Brown,\nGeology; NC Ferrand, CCS; D Procopiu, Finance; C Sterling,\nFinance; Anna Thomas-Letts,\nGeology; P Williamson, Geology.\nPage 3\n\n"

We started raking in the money.\nDark horses aren't we?\nBut then ... whoops ... up went\noil prices and interest rates and\ndown went prices of Third World\ngoods (economics, it's a scream,\neh?). Mr Dick Tatar fled. The\npeople of Thirdworldland started\nw hinging that paying all this interest\nwas devastating their livelihoods.\nThis was worrying. What if our\nprofits fell?\nSo in stepped our other friends at\nthe International Monetary Fund,\nwith one of their winning plans:\nthrow Third World people off their\nfarms and make way for huge\nplantations growing cocoa for\nwestern cho c bars! Thankfully,\ndespite a bit of death disease and\nenvironmental destruction, it's OK,\nthey're earning the cash to keep\npaying us back.\nSome people say that just because\nwe could afford to cancel the debt,\nwe should. But then some people\njust don't understand economics.\nWe and our shareholders are\nlaughing all the way to the bank!\nDo you think this story is funny?\nDid you know that your high street\nbank could tell a similar tale?\nIf you are concerned, you can\njoin Third World First on\nWednesday 2nd December.\nStudents are staging nationwide\nprotests against the injustice of debt\nrepayments. Imperial College\nstudents will be part of a symbolic\nfuneral march in London. Meet us\neither outside Southside Upper\nLounge at 1.15pm or outside UL U on Malet Street at 2.00pm. Please\ncome dressed in black.\nAlternatively, Third World First\nsuggest that you can let the banks\nknow yourself by writing to your\nbank manager, or considering\ncutting up your credit cards or\nconsider transferring your account\nto another bank (eg Bank of\nScotland, Royal Bank of Scotland,\nTSB or Coop) or to a building\nsociety.\nFor more information,contact\nICU Third World First either via\nthe Union Office pigeon holes or by\nphoning Jacob Tompkins on x4844.

Those who weren't doing it\nfor the first time should have known\nbetter.\nThe fact is, bungee jumping\nscares the hell out of you for about\ntwo to three seconds. You fall with\nabsolutely nothing holding you\nback. The ground rotates about you\nand you plunge head first, straight\ndown. This is followed by utter\nrelief as the cord pulling at your feet\nrapidly slows you down. You stop\nabout twenty five feet from the\nagain. You gradually become\nweightless as the cord slackens, and\nthe whole thing starts again.\nThe adrenal in rush is better than\nanything else I have ever\nexperienced. Being scared of\nheights, just being taken up to the\ntop of a197 foot crane on a2 foot\nwide platform would normally be\nenough to give me heart failure, but\nthen being told to jump off is\nsomething completely different. As\nyou fall and see the platform\ndisappear, the ground rushes\ntowards you and feel the air rip past\nyou. You suddenly grasp all sense\nof reality and think 'Why I have I just done that? I'm going to die'.\nJumping really makes you\nappreciate what life is about.\nFinally, I would like to thank all\nthose people who jumped.\nto Marcus who jumped in his\nwheelchair (this is only the second\ntime in Britain that this has ever\nhappened) and in my books he\nshould be given a medal.\nUNICEF & Simon Callow for\ngetting us a huge discount on\njumping.\nBungy Jump International for being\nthere and for having such a good\njump site.\nSTOIC for the video.\nAlex for taking photos.\nAnd finally anyone else who came\nalong and stood in the rain all day\nto watch us lunatics.\nPlease could people get there\nsponsorship money in as soon as\npossible, and anyone who wants\nphotos of the day should come to\nthe RAG meeting on Friday.\nground and then you go back up Congratulations must especially go\nGreat Sightseeing Challenge\n^\u2022\u2022\u2022nj BJK lMr^^ HI It lr i r*\"h The Great Sightseeing Challenge is\nthe next big RAG event of term and\nit's this weekend. In a style similar\nto Monopoly, you need to get\nyourself in teams of about four to\nsix, not forgetting fancy dress if you\nwant to do even better. You will be\nset a course around some of\nLondon's most famous sights and\nthe aim is to get round the course\nas quickly as possible. However\nthere is a catch. At each sight you\nwill have to take a challenge before\nyou are told the next sight on your\nroute. You get to choose between\na quick question, a physical\nchallenge, or an instant scavenge.\nThese in the past have ranged from\nleapfrogging across Tower Bridge,\nfinding the nearest pub and tap\ndancing in Parliament Square to\nfinding a pint of Thames water\nwithout a pint glass and being a town crier in the middle of Camden\nLock! Failure to do the required\nchallenge results in penalties being\nincurred. However bonus points are\navailable for stylish attempts and,\nas is often the case, the marshals\nwill be highly corruptible when\noffered certain liquid bribes!\nEach team will have a different\nroute to follow so cheating (as if\nyou would!) will be rather difficult.\nA crafty points system has been\ndevised so that penalties, bonuses\nand money collected will all come\ntogether to give your team a grand\ntotal for the day. The teams getting\nto the most sights with the highest\nnumber of points will be suitably\nrewarded with the usual super\nprizes you have come to expect\nfrom RAG. There will also be\nprizes for the day's highest\ncollectors so don't forget that RAG is about charity! We are collecting\nfor Shelter so get thinking about\nbegging lines to make those\npotential donat or s feel sorry for the\nhomeless at Christmas and hand\nover their do sh. For anyone worried about the one\nday tube strike, fear not. We will\nprovide everyone with detailed bus\nmaps and marshals will have\ndirections to all the sites. A bonus\nof the tube strike is that you can in\nfact collect on buses if you ask the\nconductor nicely and he says 'yes'.\nThis will make the course a little\nlonger though so you'll have to get\nthose challenges done even quicker!\nLast year this was declared to\nhave been the most fun and exciting\nevent of the term by everyone who\ntook part, so, if you have enjoyed\nRAG so far, this is not to be missed.\nTurn up to the RAG meeting at\n1.10pm today in the Ents Lounge\nif you want to know more.\nPage 7\n\n"
