To all\nthe rest of you, you get exactly\nwhat you deserve, you have\nnot even bothered to vote,\nbelieving that it would make no\ndifference to the way you live\nyour lives, I have one message\nfor you. Put nothing in, get\nnothing out.\nThe candidates have shown\nall the small-mindedness of\nchildren at play in a sweet shop,\neven those who I personally felt\nwhere good have behaved as if\nwinning an election was the\nonly thing that mattered . How\nthis pettiness qualifies them to\nrun a business that turns over\n3.5 million I have no idea, but\nthen again I will not be around\nto see what havoc they will\nwreak!\nMy only thanks is to those of\nthe student media, who have\nput almost as much time and\neffort into covering this\ncampaign as the candidates\nthemselves. And finally to the\nPrint Unit Printer Andrew\nThompson for staying up so\nlate to get this issue out, thanks\nagain and Happy Birthday\n(whenever it may be!)\nCredits\nRose, Andy, Declan, David von\nSpooner, Ian Hodge, Jacob,\nAndrew Tseng, Mike\nChamberlain, Phil Dodd, Jon\nRonson, Owain, Gareth, Simon,\nPoddy, Beccy, Steve, Dom, Chris,\nRick,\nA Slice of Life\nOwam BennaJJacJc\nFriday evening, and I arrive late\nat the Main Dining Hall for the\nInternational Night buffet. Already\nthe situation is pretty dire, empty\ntrays in the popular parts of the\nworld poi gni ant ly summing up the\nsituation found in reality in others.\nBut it's 'the biggest social event of\nthe year', I'm not allowed to think\nabout how half this lots parents are\nout to kill each other. Besides, in\nthe lucky position of Englishman,\nI can smile serenely over the whole\nmessy business and be generally\nsuperior.\nManor rushes over to me with\ntwo food coupons in hand and\nexplains that he got them working\nat the Italian stall. He shouts\n'Lasagne' at me and drags me\nacross to part with my first token.\n'Eh, you want some Lasagne?' says\nan enthusiastic Greek guy, waving\nhis knife ferociously about my\nhead. 'Or some Spinach Lasagne?'\nsays Vivek, who's of Asian descent.\nManor, from Israel, rushes back to\nhis post. Not an Italian in sight. This\nwas just the kind of Cosmopolitan\nshambles I'd hoped,for!\nWhilst eating the spinach stuff I notice Poddy drifting aimlessly\nabout. He looks tired, zombie like,\nthe election is clearly getting to him.\nOr maybe its just those genes\ncoming into bloom. He tells me he's canvassing for votes. But these\nforeign types never vote?\n'Precisely,' he says. 'So if I can get\ntheir votes I 'll have an unstoppable\ngroundswell of opinion behind me\nand next year it'll be feet on desk\nand cigar in hand.' (Or something\nless libellous.)\nDave Goddard is up to the same\nantics, a huge pile of 'vote Dave'\npamphlets hidden under a tourists\nguide to Nicaragua. Now there's a beguiling country. Their table is\nharassed but it still has food. I choose a cod dish, fitting in with my\ncurrent, 'don't eat it if it's got legs'\npolicy. Hey, Manor tells me that as\na non Jew all I have to do is make\nsure whatever I dine on is dead. Just\nno lunging at passing sheep, tongue\ndrooling, knife and fork in hand.\n(Of course corning from Wales who\nknows...) Then I notice the\nvegetable accompaniment is\ngorgeous, of course it has meat in\nit, first I 've eaten for eight months.\nMicheal loans me a spare coupon\nso it's gastronomic experience\nthree. By now I'm becoming wary\nof 'food poisoning from around the\nworld', all the remaining food\nlooking decidedly dubious. But a lovely Nigerian lady finds a whole\ntray of some delicious stew , no\ndead fluffy critters she promises.\nThen it's time for the show.\nThe queue is ridiculous and it's true that only the British know how\nto do it properly. The rest of the\nworld is more interested in getting\non with the interesting part. So I stand at the back, near the lifts,\nwhile nearly everyone else\nintersects from the stairs and gets\nin before me. Luckily Paul and\nMicheal have saved me a seat. The\natmosphere is excited, ex huber ant. The lights dim, thirty minutes late,\nand someone switches on some\ntaped drums. The 'Flag Ceremony'\nbegins.\nIt's a good way to gauge the\nracial mix in the audience, because\nof course people can't resist\ncheering loudest for their own\ncountry. I go wild for everyone.\nEach flag makes its way down to the\nstage, lit by a giant spot ii gh t. It's quite impressive. The show begins.\nNow I have to say the lighting\npeople failed to get it sorted on the\nnight. After the excellent start they\ndidn't seem to know what was\nsupposed to be on, off, in or out.\nThe hosts coped with this, and the\nappalling jokes they'd been given to\nread, pretty well. (Eg. After the\nSpanish performance Zena had to\nsay 'One of them was a fireman.\nHis name was Hose'. She deserves\na medal for that.)\nAct after act was flung onto the\nstage and gave a nice postcard effect\nof their country. Some were better\nthan others, nobody cared, we just\nwent mad for everyone. An Iranian\ngentleman seemed almost moved to\ntears by the fanatical adulation of\nthe crowd. Hell, you could have put\nIdi Amin up there to discuss torture\ntechniques and they'd have gone\nnuts.\nAnd so there I was, banging my\nfeet up and down and cheering and\nsuddenly I realised something. I might titter at the Greek display of\nmachismo and melodramatic plate\nbreaking but really I was just\njealous of their private party on the\nstage. I might have found the near\ndelirium of the performers end of\nshow finale over the top, but these\npeople really knew how to have a good time.\nWhere were the home students?\nCertainly not in any of the rows\naround me. I wondered what\nperformance the British would give\nat the 'Hong Kong Institute of\nScience and Technology'. Ironic\nsomehow, that we have 'Imperial'\nin our title. Now the world has\ncome to us and many of us don't seem to care. At once I felt very\nlonely, the world seemed very big.\nEveryone should be in a minority\nsometime.\n\n"

The underground\nphenomenon that is the 'Sonic for\nNew Election' campaign is\nunearthed by Felix in an exclusive\nencounter on the eve of the first day\nof polling.\nThe Sonic posters have been\nmysteriously appearing around the\ncollege this week, to the annoyance\nof the candidates, and generally\nspeaking, to the ignorance of Joe\nPublic.\nSo why bother ?\nWhy ? To ridicule the whole fiasco.\nThe sabbatical elections are simply\na self effacing group of people\nseeking self gratification, and a free ride on the backs of the Union\nmembers to a cheap year in the Bar\nand the pick of the first year talent.\nIn that case, your motivation is\ninflammatory, and ultimately\nwith the goal of toppling the\nUnion and causing widespread\npanic around college ?\nNaah! it was just a bit of a laugh really, see, we went up to\nWarwick University, and they've\ngot their elections on too, right.\nOne of their candidates - for\npresident or somma t is such a fuckin' s pod, right, that he used a picture of Sonic instead of himself\non all his posters.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 JJ JJ 1 11 10th March 1993 Issue 961\nMary's block vote broken\nIn a history-creating move, Rebecca\nLand has conquered the notorious\nSt Mary's Union 'block vote' to\nbecome next year's Felix Editor.\nIn a vigorously fought contest,\nthe 174-strong Mary's 'block vote'\nwent to New Election. By\ncomparison, Miss Land received\nthe approval of only 17 Mary's students. The third candidate, Ian\n'Poddy' Davies, obtained the\nremaining 15 Mary's votes. Despite\nthe 157 vote shortfall, Miss Land\nwas elected Felix Editor and Print\nUnit Manager on the second ballot,\nwith 716 votes overall. Speaking to\nFelix after the results were\nannounced, Miss Land could only\nsay, 'it is a dream come true'.\nBefore the results were\nannounced, Mr Davies said he was\nfairly confident, though very\nnervous. Following the\nannouncement of the results, Mr Davies was obviously shaken,\nalthough he did have the\ncomposition to immediately\n-congratulate Miss Land on her\nvictory. Commenting on the result\nMr Davies said, 'Fuck. Democracy\nin action? If students voted for her\nthey deserve all they (don't) get'.\nIn the flagship election, Andrew\nWensley romped home with a landslide victory over both Rachel\nMountford and New Election. Mr Wensley managed to secure the\nMary's vote. This was reflected in\nhis winning majority of 647 votes\nover his nearest rival, Miss\nMountford. Though not present at\nthe announcement, Miss Mountford\nwas praised and thanked by Mr Wensley for a good campaign. She\nseemed to have given up the\nelection after being subject to a smear campaign by unidentified\nsources early in the race.\nA smaller landslide victory saw\nDavid Goddard elected to the post\nof Deputy President. After a413 vote win over New Election and a429 vote win over opposing\ncandidate Hugh Eland, Mr Goddard\nsaid, 'I am really pleased with the\nlandslide vote in my favour... the\nvote demonstrates that I am\n77ie winners: Andrew Wensley, President elect, Rebecca Land, Felix Editor and Print Unit Manager elect\nand David Goddard, Deputy President elect\nobviously the best person for the\njob'. He commented that the result\nmay also have been due to him\nknowing 'more people around\ncollege'. Before the result was\nannounced Mr Goddard said that he\nexpected the vote to be 'tight'.\nDeputy President-elect Goddard\nsaid that he had stuck to a 'straightforward' poster campaign,\nand thought that Mr Eland had gone\nfor 'clever' posters. Mr Goddard\nadded that 'an intelligent campaign\nis not a 'vote for me' campaign'.\nIn a repeat of last year's Honorary\nSecretary election, the night',s greatest upset was the defeat of Max\nJalil, who lost to New Election by\nabout 75 votes. Speaking to Felix\ndirectly after receiving the result,\nMr Jalil said that he felt the St\nMary's block vote lost him the\nelection. He added that he will stand\nagain in the re-election if he feels\nthat the students of the South\nKensington campus want him to.\nMr Jalil, who said he was not too\ndepressed about losing, suggested\nthat the margin of defeat was not\nsuch a large one.\nThe victory for New Election in\nlast year's elections led to a second\nballot in the third term, with a completely new set of candidates\nstanding. The eventual winner and\nthis year's Hon Sec, Dominic\nWilkinson, said of this year's campaign, 'the turnout was really\ngood and the campaigns were\ngood'. Mr Wilkinson added that he\nwas 'disgusted' at the defacing of\nposters. 'If ever I get hold of\nhim ', he added menacingly.\nThis year's turnout of almost\n23% was marginally higher than\nlast year's17% poll. The highest\nturnout this year was for the\nPresidential election, with 1353\nmembers of Imperial College Union\nmarking their ballot papers\naccording to the STV electoral\nsystem. This increase in turnout has\nbeen ascribed to an increase in the\nnumber of ballot boxes, and to the\nstrong editorial lines taken by Union\nand Constituent College Union\nmedia.\nThe results will come before a Union General Meeting, to be held\nat 1pm this Thursday in the Union\nConcert Hall. It is widely expected\nthat this meeting will ratify the\nelections of Mr Wensley, Mr Goddard and Miss Land. Dominic\nWilkinson, Union Honorary\nSecretary, will be instructed by the\nmeeting to re hold the Hon Sec\nelections next term. The new\nsabbaticals will take over at the start\nof August 1993, following a one\nmonth training period. Chris\nDavidson, Imperial College Union\nPresident, said, 'I am pleased for\nthe winners and look forward to the\ncandidates hand-over.'\n\n"
