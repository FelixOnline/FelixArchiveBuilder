    "content": "10 FRIDAY 24 JAN\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Reappraisal of the British State\nO\nn January 20th\nEuropean tensions,\nsparked by Prime\nMinister Cameron\u2019s\nutilisation of migration\nas a political chess piece, came to a\nhead. The tone of UK-Europe relations\nwere reflected in the words of\nGerman Foreign Minister (and Social\nDemocrat), Walter Steinmeier.\n\u201cMany young people from southern\nEurope are coming to us, to learn and\nstudy. That benefits us and also helps\nthe states from which they come...\nWhoever questions that damages\nEurope and damages Germany.\u201d\nThe UK Prime Minister continues\nto uphold this political stance; it could\nbe construed as an attempt to pander\nto popular (and sadly,uninformed)\nBritish opinion and pressure from\nTory lobbying. This is dangerous in\ncontext of the rhetoric coming from\nother European nations who appear\nprepared to compromise on EU\npolitical matters. One fears, therefore,\nthat the patience of Europe is but a\nthin membrane, ready to split.\nParallels can be drawn with\ndiscussion within The Conservative\nParty in relation to redaction of\nthe British state: the language is\n(unintentionally) damaging. Austerity\nand fiscal rectitude have been\npursued aggressively over a three year\nperiod. British Chancellor, George\nOsborne, has actively championed\ntheir necessity. In the wake of\npositive global economic trends some\nadvocate the idea that cutting the state\nmight be \u2018good in itself\u2019. As surmised\nby Jeremy Paxman on a recent BBC\nNewsnight broadcast (January 13th),\nmany politicians are now considering\na complete \u201creappraisal of what the\nstate is for\u201d.\nThe debate is nothing new. Many\nargue that Governmental interference\nwith society is draconian, stifling and\nthe embodiment of an Orwellian\nnanny state. One would concede that\nthere are legitimate grounds for this:\nSmoking bans, seatbelt legislation\nand an infinity of \u2018red tape\u2019 have been\nintroduced over the past half century.\nMany would argue that there is a\ncritical threshold for State interference\n(and size) and that to exceed it violates\na citizen\u2019s inalienable right to define\nhow they live. Public spending has\npeaked within the last decade at 47%\nof GDP. These sentiments paved the\nway for the flagship Tory policy of \u2018Big\nSociety\u2019 in 2010.\nTo my mind this is where the line\nof thought crumbles. A decoupling\nof society and state is ultimately\ndestabilising for a nation. Society\noriginally gave consent (albeit\ninferred) to the state to uphold order\nand integrity. State is for society, not\ndespite it. Reduction of state size may\nnot provide a feasible solution for a\nnation with population 63.2 million\n(2012).\nThe debate could be ploughed ad\ninfinitum. In light of this I will raise\nbut a few key flags. What form would\na wholesale retreat of public services\ntake? To what would multilateral\nprivatisation give license? These\nconsiderations prove unsettling and\neven appear to sit uncomfortably\nwith members of Government. This is\ntypified by ring-fencing of the health\nservice and overseas aid budget.\nOne might argue that the rhetoric is\nnothing but political grandstanding.\nNonetheless the rhetoric could be\nirreversibly damaging. It shares a\ncommon thread with the stance by\nsome politicians that to be \u2018on the\nEoghan Totten\nComment Editor\n@eoghantotten\ndole\u2019 is morally questionable. This in\nturn links with anti-economic migrant\nrhetoric. If one simultaneously\nconsiders the UK\u2019s ongoing conflict\nwith the European Court of Human\nRights over repeal of the \u2018life sentence\u2019\nfor murder, their threats to withdraw\nfrom the Human Rights Act and their\ncriticism of the Lisbon Treaty it is clear\nto see that the British Government is\nrecurrently intent on defining \u2018us\u2019 and\n\u2018them\u2019. This is undeniably dangerous\non the European front, as the words\nof ECHR President Dean Spielmann\nreflected when he advised the UK PM\nto be careful \u201cnot to risk credibility.\u201d\nIn the national context it could\nprove disastrous. My intention is\nnot to invoke a Domesday scenario.\nI simply believe that a decoupling\nof society and state is nonsensical.\nEach citizen has a duty to uphold\nthe rule of law, revere civic space and\n\u2018contribute\u2019 to the general order of\nthings. One worries that there would\nbe no incentive to do so if the state\nwere deduced. Society could become\nirrevocably unpleasant, with money\nplugging the void left by obligation.\nLook no further than the Salem Fire\nDepartment, Arkansas: If things fall\napart and you haven\u2019t paid, no one will\ndouse the flames.\nWhy the Coalition Government should tread carefully\nT\nhose who complain that\nBritish politicians lack\nprinciples should look\nto Northern Ireland.\nThere is surely no other\npart of the UK where\nso many political leaders have such\nstupid, boring and ultimately harmful\nprinciples. Take Edwin Poots,\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Health Minister,\nwho has spent \u00a337,000 of taxpayer\nmoney on his legal efforts to ban gay\nmen from donating blood and \u00a357,000\ntrying to prevent civil partners from\nadopting, citing homosexuality as \u201can\nillness\u201d. This is the Health Minister.\nI spent the Christmas holidays\nat home in Belfast where I was\nsurrounded by reminders of some\nof the province\u2019s peculiarly pointless\nprinciples. Just at the end of my street,\n3menkeptaweeklyvigildrapedinred,\nwhite, blue and drizzle, huddled in the\nmiddle of the road. A year ago there\nwere enough of them to block that\nroad but now they watch haplessly as\ncars pass them by. They are \u201cflaggers\u201d;\nLoyalists determined not to stop\nprotesting until the Union Flag flies\nabove Belfast City Hall 365 days of the\nyear, as it did until December 2012\nwhen the council voted to fly it only\non royal occasions. This movement to\na more inclusive, shared public space\nhas been labelled \u201ccultural genocide\u201d\nby many of these flaggers.\nIf only our politicians would\npay these lonely warriors as little\nattention as the passing motorists\ndo. Depressingly, these flag flying\nfanatics have been holding Unionist\npoliticians to ransom, preventing any\nhint at agreement with Nationalists.\nThe past few months in Northern\nIreland encompassed talks between\nthe 5 main parties, facilitated by\nAmerican diplomat Richard Haass.\nThe purpose of the talks was to tackle\nthe issues of flags, parades and the\npast. \u201cFlags\u201d means not just the Union\nFlag on Belfast City Hall but the flags\nthat appear on street lights across the\ncountry as crude markers of tribal\nThe New Year in Northern Ireland\nthan pro-choice London. While\nUnionism is loyal to the Crown, this\nloyalty comes not via England but\nScotland, where much of Northern\nIrish Protestantism originates. To be\nUlster- Scot is to be British and yet\nScotland is this year to vote on leaving\nthe Union altogether.\nTheresponsesofarhasbeentorevert\nto the old battle cry of \u201cno surrender\u201d\nand paint more things red, white\nand blue. This is hardly sustainable.\nA mature Unionism that is relaxed\nin its own skin is desperately needed\nbut none is offered by the parties in\npower. Northern Irish Nationalists\nhave successfully demilitarised their\nidentity; now it\u2019s the other side\u2019s turn.\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\nInternationally chaired talks fail to deliver reform\nterritory. \u201cParades\u201d meant the Loyalist\nOrange parades that take place every\nJuly and are banned from marching\nthrough many Catholic areas. \u201cThe\npast\u201d meant addressing the civil\nwar the country has just left behind,\nincluding the issue of more than 1,500\nunsolved murders from the time. Both\nthe Democratic Unionist and Ulster\nUnionist parties refused to accept the\nproposals put forward by Haass, which\nwere accepted by the Nationalist\nparties. Put simply, the proposals\nwould have meant accepting that a\nshared Northern Ireland means not\nenforcing one identity over any other.\nWhat is remarkable about the talks\nwas the willingness of Nationalists\nto accept compromise. In proposing\nthat Belfast Council fly the Union Flag\nonly on royal occasions, Sinn Fein,\nonce the political wing of the IRA, was\naccepting that the British flag would\nbe flown on land they consider Irish.\nRather than take this as an important\nvictory, Unionists saw no such thing,\ndigging in their heels and clutching\nblindly to their flag. It\u2019s often said\nthat the Nationalists are too clever to\nadmit they\u2019ve lost while the Unionists\nare too stupid to realise they\u2019ve won.\nThe unnecessary flag controversy is a\ncase in point.\nPerhaps it\u2019s foolish to expect a\npolitics based historically on identity\nand fear of difference to be rational\nor reasonable. Politic-as-identity\ngoes someway to explain our present\nmadness: Northern Irish Unionism is\nundergoing an identity crisis. Many\nUnionists find themselves left behind\nby a United Kingdom that increasingly\nvalues diversity and individual rights.\nThe stance of mainstream Unionism\non LGBT rights would see them\nshunned even by UKIP and their\ninsistent opposition to legal abortion\nis more in tune with pro-life Dublin\n\u201cNationalists have successfully\ndemilitarised their identity; now it\u2019s\nthe other side\u2019s turn.\n\u201d\n\n"

Firstly, there is\nFrozen, one of only a few Disney films\nthat manages to not make the viewer\nangry when they put any thought\ninto its premise. For instance, the\nLittle Mermaid, whose entire plot\nrevolves around the main character\nchanging everything about herself in\nan attempt to impress the man she\nsaw one time on a boat. Frozen, on\nthe other hand, not only makes fun of\nthe old Disney tropes, but passes the\nBechdal test with flying colours. The\nother noticeable entry is Don Jon. In\nthis case, it is a film that could, in the\nloosest sense of the term, be called a\nromantic comedy. But this isn\u2019t your\nstereotypical \u2018our problems could all\nbe solved if we actually just learned to\ncommunicate\u2019, it\u2019s actually a good film.\nThe rest of the line-up manages\nto continue this them \u2013 nothing\nthere is intended just for the male\ndemographic.\nAnd if that isn\u2019t good enough for\nyou, then it\u2019s probably time to talk to\nHollywood.\n\n"

Did\nyou guys know each other well\nbeforehand?\nDallas Thomas: Well it started\nF\nThe Pelican Brief\nwith just filling in for a few shows,\nthen a tour, then another tour...\nTwo years later it just seemed to\nmake since Laurent decided he\ndidnt want to do the band anymore\nand focus on family and career.\nThe Swan King practices next door\nto Pelican in Chicago, so we pretty\nmuch met through the walls... Yeah\nwe all travel in the same social\ncircles so it all kind of just naturally\nclicked.\nHas the band\u2019s sound changed\nsince the change in personnel,\nand do you feel that was an\ninfluence on Forever Becoming?\nDT- The bulk of the material\nwas written by Trevor and Bryan\nsending files back and forth to Larry\nin LA. There was focused attempt\nto not be a extreme departure from\nwhat had gone before\nand still embrace it a\nfresh progression of the\nband.\nTD- There was\ngoing to be a change in\nsound no matter what\nsince the album lacks\nLaurent\u2019s contribution.\nPelican has always\nbeen the sound of\nfour distinct musical\npersonalities bringing\ntheir influences and\nperspectives to the\ntable. There was a sense\nthat removing one of\nthose voices from the\nmix would change\nthings, but if we kept\nour heads and wrote\nthat the remaining 75%\nwould come up with\nsomething that was\nrecognizably Pelican.\nI think the new record\nbears our stamp, maybe\nit\u2019s a bit streamlined in\nsome regards.\nWere you guys on\nthe same wavelength\nor was there a totally new set of\ninfluences?\nDT- I felt everything just sort\nof clicked right before recording\nForever Becoming. We all have\nsuch vast influences both similar\nand different that it wasn\u2019t some\nsort conscious effort. We just all\nfollowed what was sounding best.\nTD- The writing process in this\nband is really intuitive and not\nthought out. The influences that are\nbrought to the table are not overt;\nit\u2019s more just a subliminal effect of\nall being voracious music listeners.\nI think Dallas is right that things\nreally seemed to click right before\nrecording - the session was booked\nbefore we finished writing to kind\nof give us a deadline, which I think\nhelped ramp up the momentum last\nminute and bring everything into\nfocus.\nHow close was the band to\nsplitting up around the time of\nAtaraxia/Taraxis? Certain music\nmedia sources seemed to think\nPelican was nearing an end...\nTD- That\u2019s more or less when\nwe got momentum going again,\nalthough that\u2019s also when Laurent\nstarted distancing himself more.\nFor me there was never a question\nthat we\u2019d get back into it post-hiatus.\nHow do you feel Pelican\u2019s sound\nor way of writing and recording\nhas evolved since you first started\nmaking music?\nTrevor de Brauw: It seems\nlike we\u2019ve just grown to know\neach other better and better as\nmusicians over time and we have a\nclearer sense of how to compliment\neach other musically in the space\nof a composition. I wouldn\u2019t say\nwe were necessarily over-thinking\nanything in the past, but there was\ndefinitely a sense of laboring over\ndetails in the past that seems to\nhave been replaced with intuition.\nConversely, in terms of actual song\nstructure we used to just throw\neverything at a wall to see what\nwould stick, whereas now we\u2019re\nruthless editors. Even though some\nof the song lengths tend to be\npretty long, they\u2019re often cut down\nor adjusted because we\u2019re very wary\nof how the song flows.\nI said in my recent review (Issue\n1558) that I felt like the rhythm\nsection was a lot more prominent\nand I was wondering if you\nthought that was the case?\nDT- Yeah I would say that is a\ngood observation, besides the point\nthat Larry and Bryan are the bro\nrhythm section.\nTo what extent is there a kind\nof context or deeper message that\ngoes beyond being simply well\narranges music? I read once that\nthe title city of echoes related to\nglobalisation...\nTD- Our records will always be a\nreflection of what\u2019s going on in our\nlives between albums, manifested\nmusically. So context, yes, but I\ndon\u2019t know that we\u2019d qualify it as\na message. With regards to City\nof Echoes- we wrote that record\nduring a time when our career as\ntouring musicians was taking off\nand we were constantly traveling.\nGlobalization was definitely on our\nminds at that time because we were\nwitnessing it firsthand on a daily\nbasis; rolling into towns all over that\nbore uncomfortable similarities.\nBut the album also carried this\nsense that music was this unifying\npower that had brought us all over\nthe world and put us in touch with\nso many people and cultures that we\ndid not previously have immediate\ncontact with.\nForever Becoming was released\nOctober 15th\n2013 on Southern Lord\nrecords.\nRiaz Agahi talks to Trevor de Brauw and Dallas Thomas\n\n"

Certainly, it may\nwell lead to insurance companies \u2018reidentifying\u2019 certain patients, but this\nis a \u2018small, theoretical risk\u2019; says Mark\nDavies the new Health and Social\nCare Information Centre\u2019s \u2018public\nassurance director\u2019. The title isn\u2019t even\nOrwellian: the Tories know that the\npublic is going to have to be \u2018assured\u2019,\nbecause they sure as hell aren\u2019t going\nto be \u2018insured\u2019 any longer.\nForgive me, I move too fast; some\nof the public isn\u2019t going to be insured\nany longer. The economic \u2018liabilities\u2019\nwho are at risk of \u2018illness\u2019 and \u2018disease\u2019\nand \u2018death\u2019 and other such \u2018theoretical\nrisks\u2019. And insurance companies have\nan exemplary ethical record: take\nFriends Life\u2019 who are refusing to pay\nNic Hughes\u2019 family the expected 100\nthousand pounds life insurance. Nic\nHughes died of cancer at the age of\n44 leaving behind wife Susannah\nand their twin 8 year-olds behind.\nBut there is good reason for Friend\u2019s\nLife\u2019s decision: Nic Hughes lied on\nhis application. He failed to disclose\n\u2018pins and needles\u2019. For those of you\nwho don\u2019t know, this devastating\ndisease is responsible for the deaths\nof zero people worldwide in a given\nyear. Symptoms are a brief, slightly\nannoying itch. Causes are not well\nknown but often linked with sitting\ndown for extended periods of time.\nSo, who can fail to understand\nwhen this company which manages\n111 billion pounds \u2018on behalf of its\ncustomers\u2019 makes the tough decision\nto punish Nic Hughes for his sin by\nnot granting his remaining family the\nsupport they had expected and relied\non. What fine and unmoving moral\nfibre in the face of such a pathological\ncase. Pathological meant, of course, in\na strictly Kantian sense.\nIf you are not already persuaded,\nthen rest assured (though for certain\ntechnical reasons not insured\u2026)\nthere is sound precedent. Private\npractices like Bupa already have access\nto sensitive patient data, and the\ncomparison is relevant because Bupa,\nbeing a private practice, is clearly keen\nto take money away from patients\u2019\nfamilies. And anyway, Mike Davies is\nunsure how \u2018helpful\u2019 the distinction\nbetween \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 is \u2018these\ndays\u2019. Try asking at your local NHS\nand then some \u2018helpful\u2019 people might\nenlighten you. To the order of several\nthousand pounds.\nThis will improve scientific medical\nresearch and that is no bad thing.\nForget, that the health industry now\nhas multiple times the funding from\nthe American government as the\nfamous \u2018military-industrial complex\u2019.\nForget that this same medical industry\nmanaged to get naturally occurring\nchemical synthesis routes patented.\nThis has had two effects, strangling\nthe pharmaceutical industry in the\n\u2018developing world\u2019 and effectively\npreventing scientists from releasing\ncures to diseases unpatented even if\nthey would like. It would seem that to\nJonas Salk\u2019s question \u2018Can you patent\nthe sun?\u2019 the law has answered yes.\nSo, as you can see, the\npharmaceutical industry will benefit,\nthe insurance companies will benefit,\nand other people will automatically\nbenefit as a result. Who exactly these\nother people are, I do not know. There\nis a curious practice often noticed\nwhereby policy makers often become\nconsultants for companies which have\nbenefited from their policies, but this\nbeing a purely contingent event does\nnot amount to corruption. This would\nbe the post hoc ergo propter hoc\nfallacy, as the logicians like to say.\nWe should perhaps thank the\nTories for understanding a basic\ninconsistency that has long gone\nwithout resolution but first articulated\nin Samuel Butler\u2019s Erewhon. It is of\ncourseasridiculoustopunishcriminals\nfor their crimes if these crimes are as\na result of social conditions as it is\nto punish the diseased. And since, of\ncourse, criminals must be punished,\nand since, of course, criminals are\nalmost wholly the working and lower-middle classes, and thus criminals\nare criminals as a result of their\nsocial conditions, it follows that any\nreasonable government must punish\nthe sick and unhealthy. If these sick\nand unhealthy should be so indecent\nas to die, then this fleeing from just\npunishment must of course lead to\nthe transference of said punishment\nto those that were the lately deceased\u2019s\nnearest and dearest. It is this that the\nTory government has proposed and\nfor this David Cameron, I solute ye.\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nThe Role of Role Models\nChristy Kelly Tells It All\nI\nwill confess now that I have never really\nunderstood the appeal of role models. It\nhas always seemed slightly ridiculous to\ntreat someone as if they were an exemplary\nfigure, and with a little maturity I also came\nto recognise the symbolic violence in raising\nthat someone above their idiotic existence into\nsomething more\u2026 And leaving some Lacanian\nobjections aside (\u2018il n\u2019y a pas de rapport sexuel\u2019), I\ngenerally find the idea that a person needs some\nexemplar psychological support slightly belittling.\nThis may of course be a sign of my own comfort\nthus far, and there is little I can or intend to do to\ndeny this, but if this be the case then there should\nbe a little discernment about the choice of role-model.\nTake, for instance, the recently \u2018pardoned\u2019 Alan\nTuring, to be subject of a big new blockbuster\nstarring the new darling of the Guardian left,\nBenedict Cumberbatch. Everyone should know\nthe Turing story by now, but I must admit I find\nit baffling that he has become an LGBT icon.\nCertainly, what was done to Alan Turing was\ndisgraceful by any standards, but it is hard not to\nsense a certain rather repulsive undercurrent of\n\u2018how dare they do that to a genius or a war hero\u2019\nwhen his story is told. At the very least, the tales of\nTuring\u2019s conviction rarely have anything positive\nto say about Arnold Murray, Turing\u2019s then lover.\nPerhaps because his story wasn\u2019t \u2018tragic\u2019 enough \u2013\nhe was given a conditional discharge and nobody\nknows anything further \u2013 perhaps because he\n\u2018betrayed\u2019 Turing by stealing a tenner and letting\nhis friend rob the house.\nForgive me if I don\u2019t believe that everyone is\nshocked by the fact that British law prosecuted\nhomosexuality; people still seem to maintain that\nsomehow they are not being homophobic when\nthey object to gay marriage. Similarly, I wonder\nhow far these writers would approve if Alan\nTuring had been an unexceptional middle-aged\nacademic taking in a homeless 19 year old girl.\nAt best, the act becomes a slightly patronising\nact of charity inspired out of love or pity, at worst\nit is a frank abuse of an imbalance in power and\nthe academic gets what he deserves if his new\ngirlfriend helps herself to the family silver. Why\nthis is different in Turing\u2019s case, I don\u2019t know\n(\u2018boys aren\u2019t helpless like girls\u2026\u2019).\nFinally, does a man who complains that his\nboyfriend has stolen his stuff \u2013 police entrapment\nor not \u2013 really understand the difficulties your\naverage homosexual faced in Britain from the\nthirties to the fifties? Cambridge was a very\ntolerant place as far as male sexuality was\nconcerned, but not exactly a place open to the\ngeneral public or that many women for that\nmatter, and it is hard to see in its tolerance\nanything but a leftover of the implicitly accepted\nhomosexuality in the monastic orders of which\nCambridge is an outgrowth.\nIt seems to me that Alan Turing satisfies a\nrather different function as icon than, say, a figure\nlike Harvey Milk. There have of course been\nattempts to romanticise Milk as well, including\nthe relatively recent film with Sean Penn. I don\u2019t\ntrust Republicans, and I do not consider the\nclaim that Milk was assassinated a settled matter\n(assassination requires some political intent,\nnot just personal or ideological hatred. I admit\nthese are subtle distinctions, but I consider most\ncases are adequately covered by a different word:\nmurder).\nI am against this idealisation generally, but\nat least Milk did struggle for and bring about\nconcrete reforms. The iconography around Alan\nTuring, on the other hand, seems to satisfy a\nmore puerile function, the identification with\na \u2018victim\u2019. There is a long tendency to idealise\nsuffering and justify it through its \u2018virtue\u2019 by\ncreating \u2018victims\u2019. Think of the numerous female\nvictims in literature: Imogen, Justine, Ottilie, little\nNell. The one\u2019s too pure and too unworldly to stay\nalive: For the world\u2019s more full of weeping than\nthey can understand \u2013 at least, in their poor, dear,\nlittle heads. Similarly, think of \u2018anti-racist\u2019 books\nlike To Kill a Mockingbird, or Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin,\nbeloved of white liberals who can\u2019t even stand\n(or have never heard of) moderates like WEB du\nBois, or the genuinely powerful (early) Langston\nHughes.\nHowever, this discussion isn\u2019t just my usual\narmchair socialist complaint about the state of\nthe world. The growing consensus about how\nto \u2018deal with women in science\u2019 is to promote\nscientific role models.\nThis is more general than just in science, a\ncouple of years ago I heard Michele Bachelet, ex\n(and likely next) President of Chile and then head\nof the newly created body UN women, speak of\nthe need for greater visibility of women in leading\nroles.\nThis may quite possibly be effective in business\nand politics, though Rwanda, the country which\nhas consistently topped female representation\npoles since the genocide, and the only country to\nhave had a proportion of female representatives\nsomewhat reflective of the actual demographic\nsituation for more than five years, has not had a\nfemale president and one female Prime Minister.\nThis might be taken as a sign that Rwanda still has\na long way to go, but really, if we compare with\nthe United Kingdom languishing at 58 on the list,\nI would interpret the data to suggest that having\nwomen taking a leading role in politics is not\nnecessarily incompatible with massively sexist\nsystems.\nHowever that doesn\u2019t change the fact that\nperception is important, and certainly the\nimmediate identification scientist = male is\nsomething that needs changing. But this is very\ndifferent from saying \u2018Look! Women can be\nscientists too!\u2019 There is a slight of hand pulled\nhere when, for instance on Ada Lovelace Day,\nwe all gather round at look at the wonderful\nachievements that a Marie Curie or a Emmy\nNoether or whoever made. It isn\u2019t that people\nshouldn\u2019t recognise that these women were\nincredible scientists, rather people are too aware.\nI am not saying that we should stop recognising\nthat these women were fantastic scientists,\nand nor should we ignore the \u2018handicap\u2019 of an\nessentially sexist academic world. Neither do I\nmean find other brilliant female scientists who\nalso deserve to be role models \u2013 Lynn Margulis,\nJocelyn Bell Burnell or indeed Ada Lovelace. The\nbar is set too high.\nBecause let\u2019s face it: we\u2019re not all Nobel Prize\nmaterial. And telling me that I am capable of\nstudying my subject because, look at all these\npeople far cleverer than you who also studied it,\nis not really the way to attract me to that subject.\nAnd actually the message is worse: \u2018Look at all\nthese clever women. This is what you must be\nto prove you are worthy to study science\u2019. Mercy,\nplease.\n\n"

However, Night Vale is not what we\nwould recognise as an ordinary town, it\nis a weird and shadowy place where the\nlaws of physics don\u2019t always work and\nwhere behind every corner lurk eldritch\nabominations, ancient conspiracies\nand \u201cvague yet menacing\u201d government\nagencies.\nThis is a premise pregnant with\npossibilities and Welcome to Night Vale\nmakes full use of them. While such\nthemes are usually used in horror fiction\nthis podcast takes the bolder step of\nturning them into a comedy. In a manner\nsomewhat similar to Joss Whedon\u2019s\nhighly enjoyable The Cabin in the Woods\nthe podcast takes an almost perverse\npleasure in smashing together as many\ndifferent horror and dark fantasy tropes\nas possible \u2013 deconstructing them and\nseeing how they interact.\nSometimes this is taken to the levels\nof absurdity \u2013 such as how candidates\nin Night Vale\u2019s mayoral elections\ninclude \u201cThe Faceless Old Woman\nWho Secretly Lives in Your Home\u201d and\nHiram McDaniels, who is \u201cliterally a\nfive headed dragon\u201d. Other times it is\ndone far more subtly. Yet Welcome to\nNight Vale never descends into outright\nfarce. It always manages to maintain a\nwonderfully unsettling and otherworldly\natmosphere.\nThis is due, in no small part, to the\npodcast\u2019s main character \u2013 wonderfully\nsmooth voiced radio presenter Cecil\nPalmer. This is not because Cecil himself\nis in any way particularly unusual \u2013\nindeed he often seems close to the\nperfect everyman. Yet it is precisely his\nnormality in the face of the weirdness\naround him, and his instinctive\nacceptance that this weirdness is normal,\nthat ultimately shows the listener how\ndifferent the world of Night Vale is from\nour own comfortable experiences.\nInitially Cecil starts out as a simple\ncommentator on the goings on in\nthe town. However, his personality is\ngradually and effectively developed.\nWe get to see him as a complex and\nhighly likeable character and, through\nhis interactions with, and descriptions\nof, other townsfolk, we get to see them\nin the same way. Welcome to Night Vale\nmanages to insert some real moments\nof character drama among the humour\n\u2013 making us really care for all these\npeople, and entities, despite their\n\u2018eccentricities\u2019. It might sound that\ntrying to do so many different things\nat once may end up a mess, yet this\npodcast somehow manages it \u2013 creating\na wonderful celebration of the weird\nand esoteric \u2013 showing us that even that\nwhich is frightening can be beautiful.\nDespite having gone on for over a year\nand a half now Welcome to Night Vale\ncontinues to feel fresh and innovative.\nThe show\u2019s creative team is not afraid\nto explore new format ideas and there\nare regular guest contributors \u2013 both\nto the writing and music. The podcast\nreminds me of other similar comedy\nshows of a similar format \u2013 such as\nRadio 4\u2019s Bigipedia \u2013 however I have\nnever listened to anything that was quite\nso imaginative and daring, both in terms\nof style as well as content, as Welcome\nto Night Vale. All of the episodes are\navailable free online so there is no\nexcuse for you not to check them out.\nWith thirty nine episodes having already\nbeen released, and a companion novel\non the way, there is a lot to catch up \u2013\nbut I can promise you that you won\u2019t be\ndisappointed by this unique podcast.\nSee commonplacebooks.com/welcome-to-night-vale for more information\nand to purchase Welcome to Night\nVale merchandise.

Delacroix, a French\nartist of the mid-nineteenth century, started keeping a\njournal as a young man. He wanted to improve his already lively and original writing style; he thought he had\na forgetful, careless personality and, writing an account\nof his days, might remember them the better. He also\nneeded to understand himself as a man and as an artist\nand began a journal solely for his own use. As such, his\nmusings have a quality of self-effacement, doubt and\nhonesty that makes them all the more interesting.\nHe looked at art with the qualifying eye of an artist and\nhis interests extended to literature, music and philoso-phy. He writes about his favourite paintings, painters\nand the inspiration he takes from them; about his musical evenings in Paris; about his literary friends...\nThe description of a nineteenth century Parisian life,\nincluding meetings with other figures of the age \u2013 Chopin or George Sand \u2013 are another curiosity of the jour-nal.

    "content": "15\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 24 JAN\nARTS\nThe Secret Photographers\nFred Fyles gets a glimpse of the works of Warhol, Burroughs and Lynch\nT\nhe Photographer\u2019s Gallery,\nnestled in the heart of the\nWest End, is playing host to\na triumvirate of titans of 20th\ncentury American culture:\nAndy Warhol, William Burroughs, and\nDavid Lynch. Or maybe that should\nbe: Andy Warhol. William Burroughs.\nDavid Lynch. The gallery has decided\nto stage this exhibition not as a single\ncollection, but rather as a trio of\nseparate exhibitions, each exploring\nthe seldom seen photographs of these\nmasters. The result is an experience\nthat is rich in scope, but perhaps\nsomewhat underwhelming.\nOut of the three, it is Andy\nWarhol who has the most obvious\nlink to photography; the pop-art\npolymath\u2019s work was often based\nupon photographs, and the idea of\ncelebrity culture \u2013 along with the\nmedia exposure that accompanies it\n\u2013 is a running theme throughout his\ncareer. Warhol saw the advent of the\n\u2018point and shoot\u2019 camera as a means to\nexpand his obsessive documentation\nof his daily life. The selection of black\nand white prints on display act as a\ntime capsule from 1970s Manhattan,\nbut the themes that underlie much\nof Warhol\u2019s more formal work shines\nthrough: there are shots of the inside\nof pantries, documentations of\nconsumerism, and an obsession with\nsignage. Celebrity spotting gets an\nobligatory mention, best documented\nby his candid shot of Jean-Michel\nBasquiat looking up mid-bite, a forkful\nof pastry on its way to his lips, which\nis reproduced and stitched together.\nHowever, since Warhol would often\nshoot an entire roll of film a day, it\nseems like an arduous task to cut such\nan extensive collection down to just 50\nshots, and one wonders how much we\nare missing out on.\nWhile Burroughs found fame as\nan author and essayist, the rarely-seen photos on display here reveal\nhis skill as a photographer. Perhaps\nappropriate for such a leading light of\nthe Postmodernists, Burroughs takes\na much more analytical approach\nto photography than Warhol, often\ncutting and splicing his frames\ntogether into dense and rich collages.\nHis series What Was, What Isn\u2019t, in\nwhich he photographed his bed before\nand after having sex with his lover\nJohn Brady, forms a mediation on the\npower of photography to conjure up\nghosts from the past, and places it in a\nsimilar role to the unreliable narrator\nin his literary work. He applies his\n\u2018Cut-Up\u2019 technique to portraiture,\ncreating freakish, unnerving splices\nthat precede the work of John\nStezaker by 20-odd years. While the\npieces manage to be both candid and\nanalytical, the lack of context provided\ncan make them seem \u2013 especially\nto someone like me, who isn\u2019t overly\nfamiliar with Burroughs\u2019 work \u2013\nsomewhat heartless.\nAny disappointments I may have felt\nwith the first two sections however\nwere instantly erased when presented\nwith the Factory Photographs of\nDavid Lynch. Around 80 shots of\ndisused factories in Poland, Britain,\nand the US line the walls of the gallery,\nwhile an atonal soundtrack, created by\nLynch himself, serves to reinforce the\nominous mood. Given his illustrious\ncareer as an auteur of American\ncinema, it is perhaps unsurprising\nthat his work is the most consistent,\nfeaturing tightly framed shots of\nurban decay in shades of black and\nwhite which border on aggressive. The\nshots recall Bernd and Hilla Becher\u2019s\nexploration of industrialisation, but\nwhile the Bechers\u2019 work is ordered\nand playful, Lynch\u2019s is painted in\nmuch darker tones. Grimy close-ups\nof pipes and puddles create a setting\nthat wouldn\u2019t look out of place in his\n1977 masterpiece Eraserhead; one\nalmost expects the shots to feature the\nGirl in the Radiator, or any other of his\ntwisted creations, but instead they are\ndesolate and barren, and perhaps all\nthe better for it.\nWhile the exhibition may have\nits highs and lows, it is extremely\ninteresting to see how these three\nartists fit photography into their\noeuvres, and explore the themes\nthat permeate the rest of their work.\nThe Warhol and Burroughs give us a\ncandid, and seldom seen, look at their\nlives, but it is Lynch who stands out\nhead and shoulders above the others,\nwith work that is both eerily beautiful,\nand horrifically unsettling.\nCorruption of a convent girl\nEmiel De Lange\nWriter\nWhat: Manon\nWhere: Royal Opera House, WC1\nWhen: Until 6th February\nPrice: Various\nM\nanon premiered in\n1884, at the height\nof the Belle \u00c9poque.\nFrench imperialism\nwas at its peak,\nand a spirit of optimism flowed on\nthe streets of wealthy Paris. Twenty\nyears earlier, Richard Wagner had\nbrought his opera Tannh\u00e4user to\nthe Op\u00e9ra de Paris and begun his\ncultural revolution. French poets,\nmusicians and painters had fallen\nunder his spell, but now was the time\nfor France to reclaim its place at the\nhead of the cultural world. Manon was\ncommissioned from the celebrated\ncomposer Jules Massenet and quickly\nconquered the world\u2019s stages.\nThe protagonist and title character,\nManon Lescaut, is a beautiful young\ngirl of 16 when she arrives in the city,\ndestined for the convent. She is quickly\npursued by suitors and decides to run\noff with a handsome chevalier \u2013 Des\nGrieux. Soon, however, she is tempted\nby the life of luxury and comfort\noffered by her wealthier suitors. The\nstory explores the struggle between\nthe passions of love and of greed set\nagainst the backdrop of decadent,\nbourgeois Paris.\nIn this Royal Opera House\nproduction, Laurent Pelly accentuates\nthis decadence and makes Manon\u2019s\ncorruption by wealth a symptom of\nsociety as a whole. Rather cynically,\nthe men, all dressed alike in black\nsuits, are driven by animalistic sexual\nurges and act as a mob, while the\nwomen, by contrast all in white, are\nall too happy to oblige in return for\njewels and other goods. The sets\nlook grey and concrete, but play with\nperspective cleverly. As a whole the\naffair is rather bleak and Des Grieux\u2019s\npiety and good-heartedness stands\nout greatly. Manon, although foolish\nand na\u00efve for breaking such a man\u2019s\nheart, is portrayed as a victim with\nwhom we feel great sympathy.\nThe Royal Opera House has touted\nManon as one of opera\u2019s great tragic\nheroines, on a par with the likes of\nVerdi\u2019s Violetta. Unfortunately, I feel\nthat despite Pelly\u2019s best efforts, the\nwork as conceived by Massenet simply\nlacks the cohesion, concision and\nunity of such dramatic masterpieces.\nManon is evidently a work of its\ntime; created with one eye on its\naudience and one on the competition.\nThe entire first half of act three, for\nexample, appears to be an excuse for\nMassenet to show off his ballet music\nwhile very little happens to advance\nthe narrative.\nDespitethesehistoricalpeculiarities,\nthe musical performances were\ncompelling, and indeed Massenet\u2019s\nscore has exquisite moments of\nsensitivity and beauty. Ermonela\nJaho, in the role of Manon, is a\nforce of nature whose dynamic\ncontrol is absolutely remarkable.\nThe transformation of Manon from\ninnocent girl to corrupted socialite\nwas entirely convincing. On par was\nMatthew Polenzani as Des Grieux,\nand hearing their duets together was\nan absolute thrill. As always with the\nRoyal Opera the cast and chorus were\nuniformly excellent and the orchestra\nunder Emmanuel Villaume played\npassionately, if a little rough around\nthe edges.\nThis production is highly\naccomplished and the lead\nperformances phenomenal, but\nalthough Manon is an engaging and\naffecting drama, it doesn\u2019t quite\naccomplish what it was originally\nintended to.\n\u00a9 WILLIAm S.

There is so much snow, a lot\nof wind, and plenty of ice to get you\ninto the winter mood if you weren\u2019t\nalready. Loosely based on Hans Christen Andersen\u2019s story The Snow Queen,\nwe have Elsa (Idina Menzel), a young\nprincess who can conjure up all things\nrelated to winter. A potentially fatal\naccident has her parents worrying for\nthe safety of her younger sister, Anna\n(Kristen Bell). From that point on, Elsa\nis forever separated from Anna and\nthe two start living different lives.\nAfter a tragic shipwreck leaves their\nparents dead, it\u2019s Elsa\u2019s turn to take the\ncrown and rule over her kingdom. An\naccident of epic proportions occurs as\nher powers are no longer a secret to\nthe people, and her once-warm, sunny\nhometown is thrown into the miser-able, blistering cold. Casting herself\ninto exile, Elsa builds herself a fancy\nnew ice castle whilst singing the film\u2019s\nhighlight song \u2018Let it Go\u2019 that emphasises how strong and independent a\nwoman she is and how she can make it\non her own without having to change\nor be ashamed of who she is. It\u2019s powerfully sung by the original green\nWicked Witch Elphaba, Menzel, who\nblasts through the tough notes and\nleaves a memorable impression of her\nmoment.\nWhilst Elsa is living her feminist\ndream in the winter mountains, Anna\ntoo, is on a feminist quest of her own\nto bravely venture out into the wilderness to find her sister and to bring\nback the sun to the lands. Anna is the\none with the most patience in the film,\nas she is constantly kept in the dark\nabout everything, and yet taking such\ntreatment so well. She is accompanied\nby a male traveller, although for the\nmost part he takes the back seat. Yes,\nthis is possibly the first ever Disney\nanimated film that is so upfront and\ndriven about its female protagonists.\nFeminists are right to rejoice about\nthis one, as neither Elsa nor Anna are\nafter the fulfilment of finding the one\nman who will automatically solve all\ntheir problems. In fact if anything, it\u2019s\nthe men who complicate things.\nIt\u2019s a refreshing turn in a well-worked formula of the past, and although the opening scenes do hint at a\ncringe-inducing love subplot, that\u2019s all\ncleared up towards the end in a slightly more sinister twist than one might\noriginally expect.\nThat the two ladies are voiced by\nsuch high-spirited voice actors works\nto the film\u2019s advantage. And this being a Disney film, there are plenty of\nsongs taked with a lot of the story-telling. Menzel and Bell share some\nwell-harmonised, pleasant duets, although they\u2019re not exactly the types of\nsongs that immediately stick to your\nhead. There have only been sporadic\nperiods of brilliance when it comes\nto Disney\u2019s original film soundtrack\nof late, and with Frozen, apart from\nthe aforementioned \u2018Let It Go\u2019 (even\nthough that song itself doesn\u2019t capture\nthe former grandeur of other Disney\ngreats) its musical offerings are considerably weak.\nWhere the film excels however, is\nwith its infinitely beautiful and creative animated visuals. Winter has never looked more sparkly and whenever\nElsa plays around with her incredible\npowers, the film generates images and\nsequences that are truly a marvellous\nspectacle. Their kingdom of Arendelle serves as a majestic set-up for\nthe scenes set within the palace walls\nalong its beautiful corridors and inte-riors, and even out in the wilderness,\nthe harsh nature presents an eerie\ndose of beauty.\nOf course there is the obligatory\nneed for a loyal, trusted animal com-panion, plus some reliable comic re-lief. These roles are filled by Olaf (Josh\nGad), a snowman whose warmth and\nnaivete are a time-worthy addition to\nthe film (although his ill-advised obsession for the heat and summer does\ntranslate into an entirely forgettable\nsequence of his only song), as well as\nSven the reindeer who acts as a trusty\nriding companion of Kristoff (Jona-than Groff), the man who becomes\nthe reluctant travelling companion of\nAnna.\nWhat the film lacks is a strong,\nmemorable antagonist to sustain the\nplot\u2019s momentum. The final climax\nand showdown is unimpressive to say\nthe least, and to say that the resolution\nto all the previously set-up problems\nis rushed would be a massive under-statement. Everything is sorted in a\nsingle, anticlimactic flash, and with\nsuch a well-structured build-up the\npay-off should have been a bigger\nspectacle.\nBut in the end Frozen certainly demonstrates that Disney still has plenty\nof magic up its sleeves, and that their\nnext few offerings will be worth waiting around for.\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nLast Vegas\nDirector: Jon Turteltaub\nWriter: Dan Fogelman\nStarring: Michael Douglas, Robert\nDe Niro, Morgan Freeman, Kevin\nKline, Mary Steenburgen\nRuntime: 105 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nMake it last\nWhen an old friend finally announces\nthat he is ready to settle down with a\nwoman young enough to his grand-daughter, his friends are nothing short\nof excitement as they get ready for the\nbachelor party of their lives. Now that\nthey\u2019re all over the age of 70, even in\nVegas they need to play it safe. There\nare pills to be taken, blood pressure\nto watch and bed times to adhere to.\nAre they getting too old for this shit?\nMichael Douglas, Morgan Freeman,\nRobert De Niro and Kevin Kline certainly don\u2019t think so.\nBilly (Douglas) is the one getting\nmarried, Archie (Freeman) and Sam\n(Kline) are the best friends looking\nforward to a fun weekend away hoping\nto recapture their youth, and Paddy\n(De Niro) has some personal beef with\nDouglas and the two haven\u2019t been on\nspeaking terms for a long time. What\nhappened between the two? Well the\ndrama that exists between the two of\nthem end up becoming the best aspect\nof the film, as a touching background\nstory is revealed.\nThe trouble with Last Vegas is when\nit\u2019s trying too hard to be funny. Selfdeprecating jokes all related to how\neveyrone has aged are as old as the actors themselves, and whatever banter\nthat wants to take place between the\nacting veterans never fully material-ises. Archie has haemorrhoids, Sam\nhas been given a free weekend pass\nby his wife who says what happens\nin Vegas stays in Vegas whilst handing him a condom and Viagra, Paddy\nis a miserable, grumpy old man who\ndoesn\u2019t want to have fun especially after the death of his beloved wife, and\nBilly is deluding himself into thinking\nthat the girl he\u2019s about to marry is doing so out of love for him and not his\nbank balance.\nAll typical storylines, but things\ntake a turn for the preposterous when\nMary Steenburgen appears. Diana is\nan aged lounge singer who\u2019s following\nher dreams to...well...sing. She does a\ngreat job, and catches the eyes of both\nBilly and Paddy, something that will\nput an even bigger strain between the\ntwo men.\nIn fact, it\u2019s Steenburgen\u2019s contribution to the film that elevates the\nquality of the film. As absurd as her\nsub-plot may be, her intelligent, witty\nconversations with the two men provide a lot of the laughs and her wise,\nkind words some poignancy.\nThe four actors can for sure act\nthere is no doubt about it, and it\u2019s not\ndifficult to picture the four of them as\nbest of friends going all the way back\nto their childhood. But in a script that\nchooses to dump them in Vegas with\nvery little to actually do, not even the\nexntensive star quality on display here\ncan distract from that. What a missed,\nwasted opportunity.\n\n"

Ten years on,\nhowever, Bill Clinton\u2019s\nprediction that it would \u201crevolutionise\nthe diagnosis, prevention and\ntreatment of most, if not all, human\ndiseases\u201d is far from the truth. For\nall the project\u2019s contributions to\nbiology, little of this has translated\ninto promised \u201cpersonal medicine\u201d\ntreatments.\nThe relatively new field of\nepigenetics is beginning to fill in the\ngaps in understanding left by genome\nsequencing. Epigenetics \u2013 the study of\nfactors which control gene expression,\nother than the genetic code itself \u2013\naccounts for why cells in different\nparts of the body develop differently,\ndespite sharing the same DNA.\nEpigenetic markers switch off\nindividual genes, causing them not to\nbe expressed in a cell. More recently,\nepigenetic markers have been shown\nto be passed on to children and\ngrandchildren, shaking the belief that\ndisease caused by lifestyle can have no\neffect on offspring.\nBoth sperm and egg are specialised\ncells with their own epigenetic\nmakeup. Until recently, it was believed\nthat when these fused, the epigenetic\nmarkers were completely removed\nin a process called \u2018Reprogramming\u2019,\nallowing the embryo to develop\ncompletely from scratch.\nNew evidence suggests that this may\nnot be the case. Last year, researchers\nat the Los Angeles Biomedical\nResearch Institute found that injecting\npregnant rats with nicotine caused\nasthma to occur not only in the next\ngeneration, but the one following\nthat: the epigenetic changes caused by\nnicotine, it seems, are inheritable.\nIn the 1980s, a Swedish scientist\ncalled Dr. Lars Olov Bygren\nstudied the lifespans of people\nliving in Norrbotten, the country\u2019s\nnorthernmost and least populated\ncounty. In the late 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, poor harvests here often led\nto starvation, though some years were\nunusually abundant with food.\nDr. Bygren found that grandchildren\nof people who had plenty of food as\na child had much shorter lives than\nthose who did not. Controlling for\nother factors such as disease and\nsocioeconomic status, the difference\nin longevity between grandchildren\nof well-fed and starved Norbotten\nresidents was 32 years. Epigenetic\nmarkers passed down through\ngenerations seem to be the most\nprobable cause.\nThe idea of inheritable epigenetic\nmarkers has made its way into\nevolutionarybiology,givingaclueasto\nhow invasive species can thrive in new\nenvironments. For a species to do well\nand adapt to its environment, say the\nlaws of natural selection, it must have\na lot of variation. However, invasive\nspecies often have limited gene\npools and some, such as the Japanese\nknotweed, reproduce asexually, so are\ngenetically identical. This has long\nbeen a puzzle for biologists: how do\nthese species manage to survive?\nChristina Richards, an evolutionary\necologist at the University of South\nFlorida in Tampa, studied Japanese\nknotweed and found that individual\nplants have high variation in their leaf\nshape and height \u00ad\n\u2013 characteristics\ncontrolled by epigenetic factors.\nEpigenetic variation, Richards\nbelieves, is one of the things which\ngives invasive species their ability to\ndo well in novel environments.\nSome scientists are not so\nconvinced. Though the role of\nepigenetics is largely accepted within\nmedical science, many evolutionary\nbiologists are sceptical about its effect\non invasive species, believing their\nsuccess can be fully explained by\ncurrent evolutionary theory.\nEpigenetic inheritance need not\noppose Darwinian evolution, but\ncan integrate with it. The study of\nepigenetics could lead to new disease\ntreatmentsandpreventativemeasures,\nas well as ecological insights. Where\nthe Human Genome Project has failed\nto keep its promises, epigenetics may\ndeliver.\nAlthough it was taken back in 2007, it is the shadowy subject\nof the photo, rather than Mars looming in the background, that\nmakes this our science image of the week.\nThis cosmic selfie was taken by comet-chasing spacecraft\nRosetta, which successfully transmitted its first signal in two and\na half years on Monday.\nRosetta was launched into space back in 2004 but went\nhibernation in 2011 to conserve energy for the long journey\ntowards Comet 67P.\nThe craft successfully re-awakened at and now is currently\n500 million miles from Earth, close to the orbit of Jupiter, and\nplans to rendezvous with the Comet 67P in August, to deploy a\nLander vehicle onto the comet\u2019s surface.\nSuch a manoeuvre has never been done before, but hopefully\nit will allow us to understand a lot more about these shooting\nstars.\nPEARSON EDUCATION\n\n"

I play a lot of FPS, and\nthe battlefield series always interested\nme from the off. It was the one game\nI had always missed out on. Especially\nthis iteration, which has just built on\nthe success of its predecessors, updating the graphics, gameplay and\nmost notable introducing big \u201clevolution\u201d. Well it seems someone read my\nchristmas list, and got me the game!\nI had significant problems running\nthe game at first. Not only would I get\nkicked from the servers at random in-tervals, I would have random freezing\nas well high incredibly high ping. At\nfirst I was worried that this was due\nto my machine not being top of the\nline, but after trawling the internet,\nI found that other users, some with\nthe best gaming gear, were having the\nsame problem. After some search-ing, I found solutions and got what\nseemed like an entirely new game.\nPreviously I could only run the graphics at low setting, now I was getting\na good 60fps with medium settings.\nThe fact that DICE seemed to rush\nout BF4 before it was ready probably\nlead to several problems, that you\nmay encounter if you get the game.\nNobody really buys FPS games to\nplay the single player, so I will gloss\nover that campaign. The multiplayer\nhowever is paramount, and where BF4\nneeded to impress. With several different game modes, enough variations\nhave been thrown in to keep things interesting and cater to different moods.\nThe gameplay of the game itself is\nexceptional, and I feel all the different\nclasses and guns are mostly well bal-anced. Furthermore the mechanic of\nunlocking new weapons and attache-ments for your guns (meaning you can\nmake your own individual configurations according to your style), introduces a bit more longevity into the\ngame as it gives the player more of a\nreasontokeepplaying.Howeversome-times the game does feel a bit grindy\nto get certain guns and accessories.\nThe last thing I would love to mention\nis the implementation of counterknif-ing, how sick are those animations?\nThe graphics of the game are out-standing, and while I could not personally run them on the ultra set-ting, even on medium I get some\nvery beautiful and detailed maps.\nKeep in mind though that you will\nneed a beast of a machine to get anywhere near the top graphics levels.\nNow to levolution, the games biggest selling point. Basically the premise is that the maps would change\nradically completely redesigning the\nplaying field, and you as a player could\ninitiate most of the alterations. Imagine skyscrapers falling down, tropical\nstorms blowing in or dams breaking.\nIt sounds epic, and to be honest it\nusually is. I mean the tropical storm in\nParacel storm completely changes the\nfeel of the map, making you feel like\nyou are really fighting a war on some\nisland resort. However, I don\u2019t really\nbelieve that the levolution is really as\nmuch as DICE made it out to be. Yes\nit is cool, but really necessary? Does it\nreally change much about FPS in gen-eral? No, and therefore I would have\nwished that BF4 would have introduced some awesome new feature that\nwould have really changed things up.\nIwasgiventhispresentforChristmas,\nwhich is great because it was all gain, no\npain. However if I had spent the \u00a340+,\nthen I would have felt a bit frustrated.\nSure its a good shooter, but not for the\nprice they are asking. If you are still unsure if you want to go for BF4, wait a\nbit for the price to come down, DICE to\niron out any last wrinkles and then you\nwill get one heck of an awesome game.\nConfessions of GTA: Gamer Style\nAfter months of anticipation, Felix releases its review\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nAs a massive player of Grand Theft\nAuto 4 I was surprisingly not that\nexcited for the new Grand Theft\ngame. I felt that 4 would forever be\nmy Grand Theft Auto game of choice\nand that 5 would just be more of the\nsame in a disappointing way. The\nadverts showcasing the three new\ncharacters for this game and the way\nyou could switch between them just\nseemed like a gimmick to me, and\nthe city it takes place in, really a copy\nof Los Angeles, seemed samey. On\nChristmas day of 2013 Santa showed\nme just how wrong I was by giving\nme a copy of this game. Here follows\neverything about Grand Theft Auto\n5 that managed to change my mind!\nGTA 5 is only available on XBOX\n360 and PS3, and as much as I\nwanted it on the Wii U I was quite\nglad to revisit my XBOX for perhaps the last time. The game looks\nbeautiful, Los Santos is beautiful,\nand the game itself handles beauti-fully. The first time I drove a car in\nthe game I crashed it straight into\noncoming traffic on a motorway\nbecause I wasn\u2019t used to cars handling in games as well as this one.\nPerhaps the biggest element of this\ngame is the story. The story mode is\nlong! Really long! The missions don\u2019t\nget boring though, they are fun and\nvaried and quite often hilarious. You\nstart as Franklin, a Ghetto kinda guy\nwith a vision, tired of being in Gangs\nFranklin wants to start making big\nmoney. You then seamlessly unlock\nMichael, a retired professional criminal who lives in a beautiful house\nin the hills. The last addition is Trevor who enters in a memorable way\nwhich I won\u2019t ruin here. The range\nof characters which I had originally\nthought would get annoying is actually one of the best things about\nthis game. They keep the story mode\nfresh as you do missions with each\ncharacter and also keep the long\nheist missions varied as you complete different tasks with different\ncharacters. Each character has their\nown personality and plays different-ly. Franklin swears like a beast and\ncan drive cars in slow motion, Michael is a good all round character,\nand Trevor is a crazy maniac who\ncan take a beating and also dish it\nout. The heist missions are like the\nbank robbery mission in GTA4 but\nlonger and there are many of them.\nEach heist requires you to complete\npreparation missions and training\nsuch as learning to fly a plane. There\nis so much customisation such as\nchoosing how to complete the heists\nand who to hire to do various jobs.\nYou can go for pros but they will\ntake more of a cut or you can go for\nquirky amateurs who will maybe\nmess up but you can pay them less,\nand the more heists you do with\nthem the better they get. This level\nof changing things provides replay\nvalue, not that you\u2019ll need it as I have\nleft the best feature of GTA5 for last.\nGTA5 includes GTA onlne. Here\nyou create your own character with\ntonnes of customisation options that\nenable you to create your perfect\ncrime lord. My online character is a\nsleek Heisenberg inspired character\n(not original I know) who cruises\naround in his purple 4x4 truck emblazoned with my gang logo. The\ngang I am in I created myself, together with the hierarchy of the\ngang members (based on Top Gun\ncall signs with the top members of\nthe crew earning the rank of Maverick) and is called Danger Chicken. In my gang we race together,\ndo missions together and basically\njust enjoy the magic of the world.\nGTA5 offers a tonne of stuff I\nhaven\u2019t even mentioned from strip\nclubs to getting some fried chicken\nat Cluckin\u2019 Bell. This game can be\nplayed seriously for hours or just\npicked up to do a mission from\ntime to time. It combines the realism of GTA4 and the fun of the\nearlier games in the series. Wether you are new to GTA or an old\nfan this game will not disappoint.\n\n"

    "content": "20 FRIDAY 24 JAN\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nW\nhen I asked\nStuart if he\nwanted to come\nto Crywank\nwith me, he\nwas understandably confused.\nThankfully, I was able to quickly able\nto correct any misunderstandings\nand on Monday night we headed\nto see Crywank, performing with\nCa\u00efna, Old Skin, and Ithaca at Power\nLunches.\nCrywank is an acoustic anti-folk\nduo from Manchester who have been\ntold \u201cthey are the worst named band\nin the country\u201d. Started in 2009,\nthey\u2019ve released three albums (their\nmost recent this past November) and\nI was pleasantly surprised that they\ncontinue to perform songs from all of\nBlack Metal and a Crywank\nAMS album of the week\nBlack metal has undoubtedly\nseen regeneration in recent years.\nReleases such as Deafheaven\u2019s\nSunbather or Altar of Plagues\u2019\nTeethed Glory and Injury in 2013\nwere well received, provided you\nwere looking for challenging music\nwith power behind it. However,\nyou\u2019d be mistaken if it was purely\n\u201cgood black metal\u201d that is suddenly\nhitting home with the hipsters,\nrather than just metalheads \u2013 really,\nit\u2019s what these bands do on these\nalbums that isn\u2019t metal at all that grabbed people\u2019s attention. Enter Alcest,\nwho have been playing this game for years, merging the typical blast beats,\nhigh screams, tremolo guitars and proggy structures of black metal with\na mystical dreamy atmosphere. And just as black metal had become cool,\nfans are left scratching their heads as Alcest abandon the very ship they\nleft port on.\nShelter strips out the metal from Alcest\u2019s original sound. This isn\u2019t at\nall sudden, as the screams have been dying off consistently since Ecailles\nDe Lune in 2010. On Shelter, clean guitars weave dream pop songs with\nwalls of effects. The space left by the metal is now filled with a wider sound\npalette \u2013pianos, guest vocals, choirs and heavily layered guitars, fitting well\nwith frontman Neige\u2019s ethereal voice. Many of these are present on the title\ntrack, probably the most representative song on the album, where choruses\nare a merge of vocal hooks, simple drumming and droning guitar.\nDon\u2019t assume that Shelter never feels heavy because of this style shift.\nVoix Sereines, begins with familiar vocal and clean guitar passages, and\nhas a fantastic gradual build to its euphoric ending, where we do hear\ndistortion guitars with the new post-rock sound. D\u00e9livrance does much\nthe same, with even bolder choirs, strings and a final crescendo which ends\nwith almost Godspeed-guitar drone.\nIt\u2019s not all memorable, as some of the poppier songs are easily Alcest\u2019s\nweakest efforts (such as Away, or Opale \u2013 unfortunately the single). The\nkey in enjoying Shelter is in realising what really makes Alcest good. Behind\nall the noise, be it waves of reverb or bone splitting distortion, it\u2019s the\nsongwriting and atmosphere that has always been present making them\nworth listening to. It\u2019s still the same gift on Shelter, it just not in the same\nwrapping paper as before. Disappointed it\u2019s not black metal? Hush now,\ndon\u2019t worry \u2013 Agalloch and Wolves In The Throne Room will be saving\nthe day this 2014.\nAlcest \u2013 Shelter\nthem.\nThey opened with a cheery song off\ntheir newest album singing \u201ceveryone\nI love is going to die, and I will die\nas well\u201d, immediately followed by\nan emotionally charged rendition of\nPope Alexander off their first album.\nWhat followed was 30 minutes of sad\nsongs interspersed with witty self\ndeprecating humor and a ditty about\npaperclips.\nThe live show was everything that\nI could have hoped for and more,\nputting all the emotion heard in\nthe recordings into the live show.\nFrom the more depressing songs\nsuch as Hikikomori, to a surprisingly\nlighthearted I Am Shit, not once was\nI disappointed by the song choice or\nperformance. Mixed in with it all was\na humorous commentary, poking fun\nat themselves for writing such over\nthe top sad music.\nCrywank put on a great live show,\nand if you ever have the chance to see\nthem perform live I\u2019d recommend\ndoing so; you won\u2019t regret it. After\nCrywank, the bands all got a bit\nnoisier, so it\u2019s best if Stuart takes over\nthe review.\nFirst of the heavier acts were Ithaca.\nThey seemed to be aiming for a sound\nsomewhere in the gulf between\nMeshuggah and The Fall of Troy,\nbut without living up to the level of\neither of those acts, they ended up\ncoming across as Lamb of God trying\ntoo hard. It wasn\u2019t exactly unpleasant,\nbut after all that Crywank\u2019s set had\noffered, I definitely felt like we were\nheading on a downward trajectory.\nLuckily for me, I was proved wrong\nby Old Skin. They may feature\nCrywank\u2019s percussionist on drums,\nbut they could not be a more different\nact. Their sound is easily described by\nthe chaotic hardcore tag, so basically,\nthink Converge. That\u2019s definitely not\na bad thing though. For those of you\nwho haven\u2019t been, Power Lunches\nis a basement in Dalston with room\nfor about 80 people. It turned what\nwas already a really intense and\nheavy set into a mind melting mix of\nfurious screams, cataclysmic riffs and\npounding drums. It was really quite\nsomething.\nThe intensity level didn\u2019t slow down\nthere though. I\u2019ve put my ears through\na lot over the years, and so I generally\nconsider really loud gigs as about the\ncorrect volume. Ca\u00efna hurt. Like\nphysically hurt. In a good way. The\nman behind Ca\u00efna is Andrew CurtisBrignell, and he has crafted himself\nquite a reputation in the UK ambient\nblack metal scene. Apparently the\nname comes from Dante\u2019s Inferno,\nwhere Ca\u00efna is a bottomless fissure\nof eternally frozen blackened ice. It\u2019s\nsuprising how well that describes the\nsound. A whirl of reverb drenched\nscreams, shouts and chants creates\nan unbelievably intense soundscape\nthat chills you to the bone while the\nvolume liquifies your mind.\nSadly, his set was somewhat ruined\nby technical problems. His guitar\nnever started working, so around\nfifteen minutes after the scheduled\nstart, we were informed he was just\ngoing to play vocal stuff. We got two\ntracks of that before the rest of his\nequipment also stopped working. He\ngave a fairly grumpy apology and had\nto call it a night. It was an extremely\nfrustrating end to the night, especially\ngiven how incredible the two tracks\nhe did manage to play were. I will\ndefinitely be keeping an eye out for\nmore London dates, because I can\nonly imagine how good the full live\nexperience would be.\nForrest Seiwald and Stuart Masson report back on a very mixed bill\nS\nwedish act I Break\nHorses released their\ndebut album, Hearts,\nback in 2011. Full of fuzzy\nshoegaze, processed beats\nand dreamy vocals I remember being\nfairly impressed when I first listened\nto it, but by no means blown away. I\nthen caught them at a festival in the\nsummer of 2012 and was completely\nblown away. Everything got drenched\nin loads of noise, and it really changed\nmy mind about the band. It\u2019s a shame\nthat with their sophomore album,\nChiaroscuro, they seem intent on\nchanging my mind back.\nOpening track You Burn sets the\ntone for the rest of the album. It\u2019s fine.\nIt just doesn\u2019t do anything exciting.\nThere\u2019s no noise, the processed beats\nare far quieter than they were on the\ndebut and there\u2019s synths all over the\nshop. It does have a nice ethereal\natmosphere, it\u2019s quite pretty, and you\nknow, it doesn\u2019t offend me at all. The\nthing is, I want the music I listen to be\na few rungs above inoffensive.\nSadly, there are even a few moments\nwhere it drops a bit below inoffensive.\nThe seven minutes of Heart To Know\nare just really tedious. Dreary dream\npop that goes absolutely nowhere is\nbad enough when it is a normal length\ntrack, but seven minutes? Fuck that.\nBerceuse is also really mundane, whilst\nFaith left me pretty numb.\nThere are a few better tracks here.\nDisclosure is a really great slice of\ndreamy electro-pop, whilst Weigh\nTrue Worlds is an exciting upbeat\npop number that really works (even\nif it sounds more like Robyn than My\nBloody Valentine). The highlight is\ndefinitely Denial. A sleek sexy electropop number drenched in reverb, this\none is simultaneously really beautiful\ntexturally, and also really danceable.\nIt\u2019s the sort of track that works just as\nwell on the playlist for a quiet night as\nit would a house party (assuming you\nhost fairly hipster house parties).\nThe album is perhaps best summed\nup with my opinions on the other\nseven minute track, Medicine Brush.\nThe beats sound great, the synth\nlines are interesting and the dreamy\ntextures are great. However, the beats\nare hidden away when they should be\ngiven the lead, the synths dominate\neverything, even when they\u2019re not\nI Break Horses Break No New Ground\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\nthe most interesting part, and the\ntexture gets a bit numbing after seven\nminutes.\nThis album has a lot of potential,\nand it would take a few minor changes\nin mixing to make it really good.\nWith louder beats, a bit of noise here\nand there and trimming down the\nseven minute tracks this would be an\nabsolutely fantastic album. Sadly, I\nBreak Horses clearly don\u2019t agree with\nmy stylistic wishes for the record and\nso I\u2019ll have to make do with it being\nall right. Maybe I need to catch them\nlive again for this one to click, but\ncertainly for now, I\u2019m back to thinking\nI Break Horses are just another run of\nthe mill dream pop band, which is a\nreal shame.\nRobin Thomas\nHad to image search for Crywank...\nThe man behind black metal project Ca\u00efna\n\n"

If successful, a\nfoundation trust status will allow\nImperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust to become a not for profit entity\nthat works independently from the\ngovernment. The third public meeting\nwas held on Thursday (Jan 16).\nThe public meeting discussed the\npracticalities on how Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS trust can become\na not-for-profit organisation that\nprovides free NHS care using powers\ndevolved from government. A new\nterm \u2013 the \u2018public interest company\u2019has been coined to describe these\nbodies. Imperial College Healthcare\nNHStrusthopestoachievefoundation\ntrust status to allow hospitals to be\nmore democratically controlled.\nOn their website, they said \u201cWe see\nachieving foundation trust status as\na means towards bringing our Trust\ncloser to our patients, the people who\nwork for us, our local communities\nand partner organisations.\u201d\nIn 2003 the government introduced\nlegislationtoallowthebestperforming\nhospitals to become foundation trusts.\nThe foundation hospitals will be part\nof the NHS but outside the control\nof the Department of Health and the\nSecretary of State for Health. The\nbulk of foundation hospitals funding\nwill come from the government, and\nthese hospitals will be legally obliged\nto follow the nationally set NHS\nstandards, regulation and inspection.\nHowever, the Secretary of State will\nbe losing its power as these hospitals\nwill run by boards of governors that\nare elected and appointed locally.\nWith these changes, Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust hopes for\ngreater community involvement on\nhow local healthcare is ran.\nNick Cheshire, chief executive at\nthe trust, said: \u201cWe see achieving\nfoundation trust status as a means\ntowards bringing our Trust closer to\nour patients and local communities,\nfurther strengthening engagement\nwith our people and providing greater\nfreedom to innovate and develop our\nservices.\u201d\nThere are, however, some key vocal\nopposition to foundation trusts.\nUnison has continued to oppose\nfoundation trusts stating \u201cNHS\nhospitals were already owned by\nand run for the benefit of the whole\npublic. The governance framework\nfor foundation trusts does not lead to\ngreater local accountability or social\nownership. For example, foundation\ntrusts are able to run with only a\nvery small number of members in\nrelation to the population that uses\nthem. UNISON is concerned that\nfoundation trusts do not represent the\ncommunities they serve.\u201d\nImperial manages Charing Cross,\nHammersmith, St Mary\u2019s, Queen\nCharlotte\u2019s and Chelsea and the\nWestern Eye hospitals, providing\ncare for around two million people\nin north-west London.

These works involved the use\nof water and cement which leaked\ninto the room, damaging equipment.\nThis has meant there are no signals\nworking on the southern section of\nthe line. Our engineers are working\nhard to resolve the situation as soon\nas possible to get services back up and\nrunning, but the line is expected to be\naffected for the remainder of the day\nwhile repairs are carried out.\"\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust\nCollege Imperial College\nIndia Foundation\nScholarship Programme\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nVictoria\nLine suffers\nfrom Civil\nEngineering\nmishap\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nUsvsth3m.com\nImperial\nTeams\nreach BP\ncompetition\nsemi-finals\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nI\nmperial students have made\nit through to the BP Ultimate\nField Trip semi-finals.

Those\nof you familiar with the Walkers of\nABC\u2019s hit TV show Brothers and Sisters will know of their infamous dining\nscenes where no lunch/dinner party\nis a smooth ride. The Weston family,\nhailing from Osage County, Oklahoma, take things to a whole new level.\nThere\u2019s wine involved of course, but\nalso pills, cursing is almost a require-ment, and hurling verbal abuse is the\nnorm.\nAt the head of the table sits the ma-triarch, cancer-ridden, pill-popping\nViolet Weston (Meryl Streep) who is\nreeling from her husband Beverly\u2019s\n(Sam Shepard) suicide. The entire\nfamily has gathered to support her,\nalthough with this lot they create\nmore problems and tension. Violet\u2019s\nsister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale)\nand Mattie\u2019s husband Charlie (Chris\nCooper) turn up, as does their son Little Charlie (Benedict Cumberbatch),\nwith events taking a more juicy turn\nwith Violet\u2019s three daughters Barbara\n(Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis)\nand Ivy (Julianne Nicholson). Barbara\u2019s family is falling apart, but in the\nface of such tragedy her daughter Jean\n(Abigail Breslin) and estranged husband (Ewan McGregor) put on a united front, Karen turns up with the man\nof the year Steve (Dermot Mulroney)\nwhose strongest quality is certainly\nnot subtlety (driving a crazy loud Ferrari to a funeral, taking a phone call\nduring prayer), and Ivy isn\u2019t as single\nas her mother assumes her to be. As\nthe dramatic showdown occurs, the\nnew live-in carer Johnna (Mitsy Upham) looks on from a relative distance\nas she serves up the meal.\nIt\u2019s one hell of a cast, with everyone\npitching in strong performances to\ncreate one smooth ensemble piece.\nThere is a mixture of loud voices who\naren\u2019t afraid to lay out their opinions,\nand to contrast that some more restrained performances also have place\nat the dinner table. Streep and Roberts\nare clearly the loudest of the bunch,\nwith Violet, hopped up on all sorts\nof pain meds, is an unstoppable train\nwhen it involves insulting her guests.\nRoberts is the only one brave enough\nto square off directly against her\nmother, and between the two of them\nthere is plenty of scenery chewed and\ndevoured as they outright steal the\nshow.\nThere is a reason why these two are\nhogging all the awards attention; they\nare both phenomenal. Roberts hasn\u2019t\nhad a role this mature and seasoned in\nrecent years and it\u2019s nice to see her let\nloose and tackle her supporting role\nfearlessly. When Barbara isn\u2019t butting\nheads with her mom, it\u2019s her husband\nand daughter she has trouble with,\nwhich brings out great moments for\nboth McGregor and Breslin.\nStreep, as usual, is the dramatic\ndominant force the film depends on,\nand her wild, hysteric antics remain\nfaultless throughout, and there really\nappears to be no role that she cannot\nconvincingly handle.\nBut the script is clever enough to\ngive everyone at the table a chance\nto shine. It\u2019s a packed crowd for sure,\nwith so many big names it becomes\nhard to resist.\nRounding off the Weston family are\nKaren, a clueless, wandering, happy-go-lucky who is willing to embrace\nany man who will have her, even if that\nmeans she will be wife no. 4 to her , Ivy\nis finally learning to find happiness,\nher own place in the world and get on\nwith her life, as the only daughter who\nstuck around in Oklahoma near the\ninsanity of her childhood home.\nThere is a particularly effective scene\nwhere the three sisters gather around\nfor a late-night catch-up, a short but\ndense segment that reveals more than\nexpected from the characters. Nicholson is most engaging, finally revealing\na part of her that wasn\u2019t previously\nseen as she was being largely sidelined and ignored thanks to the funeral dinner ending in absolute chaos.\nMartindale\u2019s Mattie Fae is as bubbly (\u201cgive me some sugar\u201d she says as\nshe embracingly greets all the family\nmembers) as she can be downright\nnasty, most noticeably to her own\nson, Little Charles, played lovingly\nand sweetly by Cumberbatch, who is\na little slow, clumsy and unemployed,\nwhich makes him a screw-up in her\neyes.\nCooper, although generally quiet\nand perhaps the most sane, normal\none of the group has his highlight\nscene that comes when he sticks up\nfor his son who he couldn\u2019t be more\nproud of.\nBeverly\u2019s suicide is only the tip of the\niceberg when it comes to what the Westons have in store for the rest of the\nfilm. No secret can stay buried for too\nlong in this family, and as one dark,\ntwisted fact comes to light after an-other, it\u2019s only a matter of time before\neverything falls crumbling apart. And\nit\u2019s this slow but sure disintegration of\nvarious relationships as an audience\nmember that proves to be enormously\nentertaining to watch.\nIn the end however, no one comes\nout a clear winner, as under all that\nblack humour there is a profound\nsense of tragic underlying sadness.\nEvery single character has messed\nup issues that need dealing with but\nin this kind of environment answers\naren\u2019t easy to find. The final scenes\ndon\u2019t provide any satisfying closure,\nalthough a re-edited version of the\nending, courtesy of Harvey Weinstein\ntrying to put a more positive spin on\nthe narrative tries to give some hope.\nSurprisingly this doesn\u2019t feel too out\nof place, and after so many unpleas-antries, it could be a welcome change\nof atmosphere, even if that moment\npasses by in a fleetingly brief shot.\nA true acting masterclass of how it\u2019s\ndone on the screen, do not miss this.\n\n"

While the move will see the removal of the entire\ncollection, many books in the collection are also available\nat other museums like the British Library and the Senate\nHouse library, both in London. Students will also be able\nto visit the Wroughton library via appointment if they\nrequire books that are unique to the Science Museum.\nThe College Library staff have the concern of students\nas their top priority and will be working to ensure that\ndisruption is minimal while the books are in transit.\nThey will also provide alternate locations for the 36 study\nspaces available in the Sci. Museum library and will try to\nkeep noise to a minimum. They will also be compiling a\nlist of Frequently Asked Questions for students to consult\nabout the move and how they can access books that they\nmay need from the collection in the future.\nSimon Harding-Roots, Imperial\u2019s Chief Operations\nOfficer, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that, by working closely\nwith the Science Museum, we have a plan for the future\nthat works for both partners. On our South Kensington\nCampus space is at a premium, so freeing some up\nthrough the new arrangement will be incredibly helpful\nfor our teaching and research activities. We look forward\nto working closely with the Science Museum, and its new\nresearch centre, in the years to come.\u201d\nAfter the departure of the Science Museum library, the\nspace will remain empty while a commitee convenes in\nCollege to discuss the best way in which to use spaces\naround campus, lead by Professor Stephen Richardson\nAssociate Provost (Institutional Affairs). Student\nfeedback will be welcomed in considerations of future\nuses of the space.\nIn the meanwhile if students and staff have any queries\nregarding the changes taking place the library is available\nfor communcation via library@imperial.ac.uk.\nFor more information about the Science Museum\nLibrary at Wroughton visit: http://bit.ly/1dZsx0d\nJoe Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nFarewell Science Museum Library\nThe Science Musuem Library is moving, and change is coming to the 3rd Floor.\n\n"

Liverpool\u2019s front two are\nperhaps the most envied in the Premier League, and both could easily be\non the scoresheet in this Merseyside\nderby. Everton, meanwhile, continue\nto look the real deal under Roberto\nMartinez. They are making a habit of\nholding top teams and their strong\ndefensive backline means they do\nnot lose many. Both these sides play\na high-tempo passing game and I\u2019m\nexpecting them to serve up an entertaining draw under the Anfield flood-lights.\n2-2\nTottenham vs. Man City\n(Wednesday 7:45pm)\nTim Sherwood has injected some\nmuch-needed attacking energy into\nSpurs\u2019 play since taking over at the\nend of last year. It is unfortunate for\nthem that the sides above them keep\nwinning, as their performances have\nunquestionably matched those of the\ntop 4 contenders again of late. Meanwhile, the Manchester City juggernaut\nrolls on and having seemingly resolved their away day hoodoo, Manuel\nPellegrini\u2019s side are now hard to back\nagainst. While this will not be anything like the 6-0 rollicking the Citizens dished out in the reverse fixture,\nwith Sergio Aguero back in conten-tion, they should have enough to claim\nall 3 points.\n1-2\nSouthampton vs. Arsenal\n(Tuesday 7:45pm)\nSaints could easily have been thrown\ninto turmoil after the departure of\nchairman Nicolas Cortese left Mauricio Pochettino with a decision to\nmake over his future. But fans will\nbe relieved to learn it looks like he is\nstaying put, and the players showed no\nsigns of being affected by the off-field\nuncertainty in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland last weekend. They will face\nfew tougher tests at St Mary\u2019s than\nthat posed by table-toppers Arsenal\non Tuesday, though. Arsene Wenger\u2019s\nmen have not thrashed anyone yet this\nseason, but with a rock-solid defence\nthey have not needed to. With Aaron\nRamsey potentially back, they ought\nto win comfortably enough.\n0-2\nMan United vs. Cardiff\n(Tuesday 7:45pm)\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s Bluebirds\nshowed signs of promise at Man City\nand will doubtless go all out for the 3\npoints again at Old Trafford. But the\nRed Devils desperately need to win\nand with Wayne Rooney likely to be\nback, they should prevail.\n2-1\nNorwich vs. Newcastle\n(Tuesday 7:45pm)\nChris Hughton has a knack of grinding out a result when he needs it, as\nthe Canaries showed against Hull last\nweekend. But Newcastle are a real\nhandful on their day and are definitely\nEuropean contenders. As they showed\nat West Ham, they also know how to\nwin away.\n1-2\nSwansea vs. Fulham\n(Tuesday 7:45pm)\nFulham\u2019s hapless defence should get a\nbit of a respite against the underper-forming Swans. Michael Laudrup\u2019s\nside\u2019s home record has been atrocious\nof late and there are precious few flair\nplayers capable of lighting up this\ngame.\n0-0\nCrystal Palace vs. Hull\n(Tuesday 8pm)\nPalace finally find themselves out of\nthe bottom three and Tony Pulis will\nbe hell-bent on keeping up the winning mentality after they overcame\nStoke last weekend. Hull are no pushovers but I just think Palace will want\nthis one more.\n1-0\nAston Villa vs. West Brom\n(Wednesday 7:45pm)\nThis Midlands derby is full of intrigue,\nas while Villa cannot win for toffee at\nhome, West Brom are a shadow of the\nside that was lighting up the Premier\nLeague last season. Given their recent\nwoes, both sides would probably take\na point.\n1-1\nChelsea vs. West Ham\n(Wednesday 7:45pm)\nThe gulf in class between these sides\nis immense, and it is hard to look past\nthe Blues, who are ruthlessly efficient\nunder Jose Mourinho. Both these\nsides are arguably better defensively\nthan in attack, however, so don\u2019t expect a goal fest.\n2-0\nSunderland vs. Stoke\n(Wednesday 7:45pm)\nThe Potters have an abysmal away record and without question the Black\nCats have more to play for. Win here\nand they would skyrocket up the table.\nWith Adam Johnson bang in form,\nI expect Mark Hughes\u2019 side to leave\nempty-handed.\n2-1\nJames White gives his midweek predictions\nGETTY IMAGES\nDownload\nour new iOS\napp today for\nthe mobile\nexperience!\nhttp://bit.ly/1dkDF6J\nWritten by Kunal Wagle\n\n"

    "content": "13\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 24 JAN\nCOMMENT\nOn adaptations and dragons\nA\ns you are all\nundoubtedly aware,\nthe Peter-Jacksondirected Tolkienrelated orc-genociding\nmovie trilogy for this decade is The\nHobbit, which was for many cause\nof puzzlement and bewilderment, as\nthe novel it is based upon is much\nshorter than The Lord of the Rings,\nand hence does not seem to be the\nkind of story that needs nine hours to\nfully tell. The way it was stretched in\na trilogy became readily apparent as\nsoon as the first movie was shown and\nsubsequently reinforced by second\none, and that is by way of adding a lot\nof made up stuff that was not present\nin the book. This move has had a lot\nof fans and purists up in arms, who\nhave regarded all these additions with\nthe suspicion reserved for a filthy\nhyperactive child who excitedly asks\nto hold some valuable item. The fear in\nboth cases is that our precious\u2019 pristine\noriginal beauty will be dirtied and\ndestroyed by this immature peasant\nand RUINED FOREVER because it is\nnot handled with the reverence and\nrespect due to holy relics. Rivers of ink\nand fields of pixels (if pixels are indeed\nmeasured by the fieldful) have been\nwritten in nerdrage about this subject,\nand I cannot understand why some\npeople are so upset by the additions.\nAlright, I\u2019m lying. I understand\nperfectly why people are upset, and,\nwhen scrutinised closely, it comes\ndown to one of the tritest and oldest\nclich\u00e9s in the book: the fear of the\nunknown. I get it: when you know\nin advance how every scene is going\nto play out because you\u2019ve read the\nsource material and suddenly there\u2019s\nsomethingdifferent,oracharacterthat\nwasn\u2019t present in the original, or, god\nforbid, an interpretation of a certain\nplot point that doesn\u2019t match, there\nis the potential for a sense of loss and\ndismay. Additionally, a departure from\nthe established canon can be a risky\nmistake in terms of the overarching\nnarrative, as a change of even a small\nelement can have a domino effect on\nthe rest of the story, and be ultimately\ndetrimental if it ends up invalidating\na plot point that would\u2019ve made sense\nhad the scene been kept as in the\noriginal. As proof of this, there have\nbeen plenty of adaptations of books\nwhich have ended being subpar on the\nsilver screen because of half-baked\nbackstories and extraneous details\nthat were not present in the novel.\nJust go on any forum to discuss any\nadaptation ever and you\u2019ll find lots of\npeople who complain how changing\neven one iota of the original betrays\nits spirit and intention. While in many\ncases they can be correct, in that there\nhave been adaptations that are inferior\nto the source material, the problem is\nthat the changes and additions have\nnot be done well rather than that they\nhave been done at all.\nThe question, at this point, is what\nshould an adaptation be, and while\nthe prevailing opinion might be \u201ca\nrecreation that is as faithful as possible\nto the original in a different medium\u201d,\nI don\u2019t think that that is the best way\nto approach the subject. Treating the\nsource as the ultimate and perfect\nauthority, essentially making it some\nsort of dogmatic canon, is rendering it\na disservice and needlessly confining\nit to one interpretation. For starters,\ndifferent media have different ways\nof telling a story, and expecting a\nscene that works in a book to work\nin the same way in a movie might be\noutright impossible. Even assuming\nthat it translates perfectly, anything\nthat is not outright stated (and even\nthen, in many cases it still can) lends\nitself to massive speculation and hole-filling from the viewer or reader: the\nmotive of a certain character, the\nreason of a certain unlikely friendship,\nthe cause of something unexplained,\nthis and much more can be discussed\nand analysed. It is as old as time itself:\npeople were trying to figure out which\ninterpretation of minute lines in the\nIliad was the correct one for centuries,\nand have done the same with pretty\nmuch anything worth discussing.\nBut the thing is, even if Homer rose\nfrom the dead and explained what was\ngoing through his head when he wrote\nthat particular bit, it still wouldn\u2019t\nbe a bad thing to offer an alternative\ninterpretation. The only piece of\nliterary theory that ever stuck with me\nis the Death of the Author, which states\nthat we must separate the author\u2019s life\nand circumstances from the story he\nor she has written, and that the text\ndoes not, therefore, have a single\n\u201ctrue\u201d explanation. The conception\nthat every work has one theme, one\nset of symbols, one possible way of\nbeing read, that a scene or character\nor plot point means one thing and\none thing only, is perhaps a remnant\nof school-age literary analysis, where\nstudents are made to learn only one\ninterpretation as that is easier to\nassess and test.\nRegardless of origin, this idea can\nbe seen in any backlash against any\nadaptation that departs from the\noriginal; but I feel that an adaptation\nthat adds and changes elements is\nperhaps the best thing that could\nhappen. I already know that I\u2019ll like\nthe story, because I liked the original;\nbut instead of just being the same\nthing again, it has new pieces, different\nideas, alternate takes that perhaps I\nhadn\u2019t considered. The original will\nalways be there, and it cannot be\nsullied or ruined, no matter how much\nthe geeks complain; an adaptation can\nexpand on it, complement it, give it a\ndifferent look, all in a familiar frame\nthat means I\u2019m going to get more of\nwhat I love. Sure, sometimes this is not\ndone in the right way, and the story can\nbe messed up by the additions; but is\nparroting the original just so we can\nkeep the same traditional scheme and\nnot be frightened by the difference\nreally something we need to enforce\nfor every adaptation?\nUltimately, every change should be\njudged on its own merit rather than in\nterms of the distance from the source\nmaterial. To take the example I\u2019ve\nbegun with, I\u2019ve enjoyed many of the\nadditions in The Hobbit. I like how\nall the dwarves have a more distinct\npersonality and appearance that was\ndefinitely absent in the novel, I like\nEvangeline Lilly as an action heroine\nand I like how they gave a proper\nreason for Gandalf leaving the party so\noften other than \u201cif he stays with them\nhe\u2019ll just solve all of their problems\nwith magic\u201d. The romantic plot was a\nbit clumsy and awkward (though I feel\nit can be satisfactorily concluded in\nthe third chapter), but generally I felt\nthe additions helped the movie. You\ncan disagree and claim every change\nwas detrimental, and you are entitled\nto your opinion, but you should be\nasking yourself a question: did you\nnot like them because they made for a\nworse story, or just because they were\nchanges?\nSpoiler Alert: If you haven\u2019t seem The Hobbit yet, stop reading\nL\necturers as a profession are\nvery hard to say no to. In\ngeneral they control your life\nfrom the moment you enter\ncollege. They set coursework\nand will demand you spend time\non it, even when it is worth 0.1% of\nyour grade. They will set field trips\nor labs at times that completely don\u2019t\nwork for you, and will expect you be\nenjoying ever second.\nAs a PhD I did not expect much to\nbe different, just that it would be only\ntwo people controlling my entire life\ninstead of the teaching staff in general.\nThis turns out to be completely\nwrong. Yes the power does shift. Most\nof the teaching staff no longer have\nany say though they will occasional\ncome up to you in corridors and ask\nif you failed your final year. But your\ndepartment lecturers will ask you\nfavours and quite nicely too: \u2018Would it\nbe too much trouble\u2019 or \u2018would you be\ninterested in\u2019. Besides, more often than\nnot you are interested, as not only do\nthey now love you, (and almost as\nimportantly) they will pay you a lot of\nmoney for the honour. You become\nquite closely guarded by lecturers that\ndepend on you and they will give you\nthe good jobs such as field trips and\none-to-one invigilations.\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 8\nSometimes saying no doesn\u2019t get you out of demonstrating\nBut a time in every GTAs life creeps\nup on them when they have to say\nno. This is surprisingly horrible.\nFrequently during my undergraduate\ndegree, I daydreamed about giving the\nlecturers a few \u201chome truths\u201d about\nwhy their coursework was completely\npointless, their course unhelpful and\ntheir exam downright impossible\n(and I must admit saying no to a few\nof these people was quite satisfying)\u2026\nHowever when you second favourite\nlecturer (pipped to the mark by your\nsupervisor) askes you a \u201cfavour\u201d, or\nwhen a really nice Professor hits you\nwith the curveball of a fieldtrip worth\n\u00a3300, what do you say?\nNow there is always the supervisor\nsandwich response: \u201cThat sounds\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\nreally interesting, but unfortunately\nmy supervisor does not want me to\ntake on anything more, although I\nknow a few other people that would\nbe interested!\u201d This normally works\nfairly well, but the lecturers have\ncome up with a counter: surprise and\nthankfulness. They will appear just\nwhen you are halfway through reading\na paper that could change your whole\nthesis plan and a befuzzled \u2018let me\ncheck my calendar\u2019 is greeted with\ncries of elation. And a simple \u2018I will\ncheck with my supervisor\u2019, is not a safe\nstandby as they will check with them.\nThus, if your GTA is a bit grumpy\nthis week give them a bit of slack,\nbecause I will confess we are not\nalways there of our own accord.\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\n\n"

Well I\u2019m the\nonly one here.\n\u201d\n\u201cI think I learn\nmore in a movie\nor in a story when\nI see what a person\ndoes wrong and\nwhat happens because of that.\n\u201d\nScorsese has created such a variety of\nfilms from religious epics (The Last\nTemptation of Christ and Kundun)\nto kids\u2019 movies (Hugo) however he is\nreally known for his depictions gangsters and vigilantes on the streets of\nNew York.\nTaxi Driver (1976)\nThe most iconic film of Scorsese\u2019s filmography tells the story of a vigilante\nwho decides he wants to clean up the\nstreets and after deciding he can\u2019t kill a\npolitician, he goes after a pimp to rescue a twelve-year-old girl from a life of\nprostitution. The reason this movie is\nsuch a classic is because it masters the\nfeeling of isolation that Travis Bickle\n(Robert De Niro) feels.\nThe atmospheric music with its jazz\nrefrains, the slow motion close-ups\nof De Niro that let us ponder what\nBickle is feeling and truly appreciate\nhow brilliant an actor he is. The film\nsweeps you along and by the end you\nfind yourself siding with this sad and\nlonely vigilante. The character, Bickle,\nis such a wonderful case study I\u2019m sure\nit\u2019d be worth doing a psychology degree just to try and figure him out.\nThe seediness of the whole piece is\nreally boiled down in the scene where\nScorsese himself plays a near crazy\nGoodfellas (1990)\n\u201cAs far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,\u201d This is\nthe ultimate gangster movie, and the\nfirst of triptych of films about organised crime including Casino and The\nDeparted. The story shows how a kid\nbecomes a Mafioso, then his treacherous career and in the end how he hates\nhimself for leaving the life of crime via\na witness protection program. A true\nepic.\nAs with all his previous films we get\nfantastic camera moves and probably\nan era defining steady-cam shot following Henry Hill through the back\nentrance of the Copacobana Club,\nthrough the kitchens meeting and\ngreeting everyone and into the club\nwhere a table is bought out and put\nright at the front for him. It really led\nthe way for directors like Paul Thomas\nAnderson to use such complicated\ntracking shots.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2014)\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese\nlooking through the eyes of Jason Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a\ncorrupt and opulent man travelling\nfrom rags to obscene riches. One of\nthe first scenes shows Belfort using a\nstraw to blow cocaine into the ass of a\nprostitute and really this sets the tone\nfor the rest of the movie.\nThe first thing to say is that DiCaprio puts in an absolutely rock solid\nperformance filled with comedy and\nnuance. Alongside him the drug addled tag along Jonah Hill adds a hilarious extra dimension whilst taking\nanother step away from his teenage\nknob-gag-filled past.\nHowever, whether you enjoy this\nfilm will hang on one central tenant: Is\nshowing a morally neutral take on an\namoral person the same as condoning\nwhat they do?\nHis life is shown in first person and\nstyle of the film doesn\u2019t stop to let you\nreflect on consequences of his actions,\nbut maybe this IS how Jason Belfort\nsees the world. Is this an exploitation film showing egregious sex, drug\ntaking and violence? Yes. Is that bad\nthing? Certainly not.\nMost films that have a three-hour\nfrom early career to highlife to decline\nmovies usually stutter in the decline,\nthe plot slows down and the character\nstops to reflect, the trajectory of this\nfilm is in fact very similar to GoodFellas. This character disgusted me\nand usually when you don\u2019t like the\nmain character of a movie you don\u2019t\ncare what happens at the end. In this,\nI was vying for his decline and I was\ngripped.\nOne strange thing to note was in\nthe screening I saw that the room felt\nsplit between those who were reveling\nin his immorality (and laughing in inappropriate places) and those who\u2019d\ndecided he was awful. That being said\nlots of the film is played for laughs and\nthere is one brilliant bit of physical\ncomedy played by DiCaprio after taking to many drugs making the 2-meter\nwalk to his car look like a mile.\nCritics of this film will say it is just\nexploitation, however the last scene\nmay give us an insight into what the\ndirector really wants to say, much like\nin Taxi Driver.\n(Continued after the break with\nspoilers)\nBelfort, having left prison, is giving\na sales seminar (much like Warren\nBuffet does) and the final shot is of an\nadoring crowd leaning into listen to a\nmultiple felon. This is a reflection of\nthe audience in the cinema peering\ninto the exciting but depraved world\nand makes you stop to think that we\nare all happy to forget the people who\nBelfort has scammed on the condition\nwe can get in on the action too.\nhusband who has followed his wife\nto a another mans house where she is\nhaving an affair and then talks about\nhow he is going to kill her and what\nher mutilated corpse will look like.\nYou follow Bickle in his decision to\nbecome a rouge go on some sort of\nspree. The denouement of the film\nclashes with the rest of the movie as it\nis just SO violent, and this is where we\nfind catharsis.\nBUT\u2026\nThe final scene shows a selection of\nnewspaper articles telling the story of\nwhat he has done and a letter from the\nparents of the rescued girl. Though he\nis praised as a hero we know he was\nmoments away from killing a senator\nbefore deciding to a kill the pimps. We\nare reminded that, although we went\nalong with him for the ride, now it is\ntime to reflect on how a racist, fascist who has pretend-arguments with\nhimself in the mirror accidently became a hero.\n\n"

The\nspace is currently used by a number\nof different groups, including the\nDrama, Musical Theatre and Cinema\nsocieties. The refurbishment is aimed\nat improving the technical capabilities\nof the Concert Hall.\nThe Harlington Trust was created\nin 1989 to manage the profit from\nthe selloff of gravel excavated during\nthe redevelopment of the College\u2019s\nplaying fields in Harlington. Each year\nthe Trust awards up to \u00a350,000 to\nUnion clubs and societies to improve\ntheir facilities or equipment. The\n\u00a3220,000 redevelopment grant comes\nafter the Trust\u2019s Committee decided\non a one off increase to the funding\navailable, to assist with the ongoing\nredevelopment of the Union building.\nA number of other improvements,\nincluding a full scale redevelopment\nof the Union\u2019s media facilities in the\nBeit West Basement, are being funded\ndirectly the College and Union.\nUnion President David Goldsmith,\npraised the awarding of the grant,\nadding: \u201cThe Union Concert Hall\nis a space used by student groups\nthroughout the year and this\nrefurbishment is going to make a\nreal difference to so many students.\nThe Harlington Grants Fund is an\nimportant source of funding for many\nof our student groups and seeing it\nbeing used on a larger project like this\nis really exciting.\u201d\nThe Trust also provided \u00a330,000\nto buy new equipment for the gym\nat the College\u2019s Silwood Campus\nand a number of smaller grants were\nmade to individual student groups.\nProfessor Debra Humphris, Vice\nProvost (Education) and Chair of\nthe Harlington Committee, said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to be able to award this\nfunding to two extremely worthwhile\nprojects. I\u2019m really proud that all the\nmoney we are able to give through the\nHarlington Grants Fund goes straight\nto student groups to improve the\nstudent experience here at Imperial.\nThe Union Concert Hall in particular\nis a really important facility on campus\nand I can\u2019t wait to visit and see how\nstudents are using the refurbished\nspace!\u201d\nApplications for Harlington Trust\nGrants from Union societies continue\nto be accepted throughout the year.\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) Yas Edwards, said \u201cThe\nHarlington Trust agreed the funding\nof \u00a3215,000 for the project. We are\nworking with the principle authors of\nthe original bid to develop the plans\nat present. Our intention is that the\nspace will be improved, allowing more\ndrama and music groups to make\nregular use of the space\u201d\nAnita Chandran\nReporter\nI\nmperial College was visited last\nweek by US Energy Secretary\nErnest Moniz. In a talk on Friday,\nJanuary 17, at the Grantham\nInstitute for Climate Change Dr\nMoniz outlined the US government\u2019s\ncurrent energy policy and its plans for\nachieving a low carbon future.\nHe was keen to stress that his\nDepartment understood very well\nthat we live in a \u201ccarbon constrained\nworld\u201d, and that lowering emissions\nwas a major priority. His talk focused\non his belief that governments must\nuse all the tools at their disposal to\nhelp us achieve a low-carbon world,\nsaying that \u201cwe need to prepare the\nway for multiple solutions and that\nis why we are walking the talk in\nmaking substantial investment across\nthe spectrum of energy sources\u201d. He\nexplained the Obama administration\u2019s\nnew $33 billion loan scheme for new\ngreen technologies and emphasised\nthe need for a wide range of ideas\nin the fight against climate change,\nsaying that \u201cthere is no one low-carbon solution, but many low-carbon solutions\u201d. He also spoke of the\nproblems involved with dealing with\nthe already existing consequences of\nclimate change.\nDr Moniz has a highly respected\nscientific background \u2013 having\nattained a PhD in from Stanford\nUniversity and held the position of\nHead of the Department of Physics\nat the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology. While he was only\nappointed to his current position\nlast May he had previously served as\nAssociate Director of the Office of\nScience and Technology Policy and as\nPresident Clinton\u2019s Under Secretary of\nEnergy.\nIn a statement given after the\nspeech the Director of the Gratham\nInstitute, Professor Brian Hoskins,\nsaid: \u201cWe are really pleased that\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nUS Energy Secretary visits\nImperial\nSecretary Moritz chose to come to the\nGrantham Institute to give a lecture\non US energy policy. His message of\nprogress on all fronts gives hope that\nUS technology and enterprise may\ngive a powerful lead in the effort to\nlimit global warming.\u201d\nThe Institute was formed in 2007\nas a result of a \u00a312 million donation\nfrom the Grantham Foundation for\nthe Protection of the Environment.\nIt brings together scientists from all\nover Imperial to carry out research\nin the field of climate science. It also\naims to provide policy guidance\nto governments and international\norganisations, as well as stimulating\ngeneral discussion on the topic\nthrough events such as Dr Moritz\u2019s\ntalk. The Institute has been praised by\nGrantham Foundation patrons Jeremy\nand Hannelore Grantham, with the\npair saying that it and similar groups\n\u201care vitally important to understand\nand respond to the scale, pace and\npotential implications of climate\nchange\u201d.\nI\nmperial Debating saw success at\nthe World University Debating\nChampionships. Tensions\nand temperatures were high\nat Rajalakshmi College of\nEngineering in Chennai, the host\nvenue of the competition. During\nthe second year of attending the\ninternational competition, students\nof Imperial College argued their way\nthrough almost 350 teams into the top\nsixteen of the tournament.\nThe team of quarter-finalists\nconsisted of Ed Middleton, a final\nyear medic, and former president of\nthe debating society, James Clough.\nThrough their smooth speaking skills\nand practised persuasive tactics the\npair were respectively ranked 38th\nand 41st in the competition which\nwas comprised of almost 700 speakers\nfrom universities such as Cambridge,\nHarvard, Auckland and Sydney.\nThe competition has nine rounds\nof intense mental stimulation. From\nthe rise of the \u2018hook up culture\u2019 to\nthe private governance of bankrupt\ncities, the topics are designed to push\nand challenge all those involved.\nClough and Middleton overcame\nthe competition to fight for a place\nin the semi-finals against Victoria\nWellington, Yale and Sydney, who\nlater went on to compete in the\nfinals. Despite narrowly missing out\nto Sydney, Imperial\u2019s Clough and\nMiddleton paved the way for the most\nimpressive result in Imperial College\nDebating Society\u2019s history.\nWith such inspiring results from\ntheir seniors, current members of\nthe society are fired up to compete\nat the World Championships in\nMalaysia next year. The tournament,\nheld from late December into early\nJanuary, has a competitive selection\nprocess, with debaters vying to be\nselected by an external adjudicator.\nThe open trials, held internally, are an\nexcellent training opportunity which\nallow people of all standards to try for\nsuccess. However, it\u2019s not all about the\nWorld Championships. Opportunities\nfor international competitions range\nfrom Budapest to Vienna, Slovakia\nto Paris, with plenty of tournaments\nheld at home in the UK. The debating\nsociety urges people to come along\nand try it with James Clough, one\nof the two successful speakers at\nthe WUDC this year, never having\ndebated before beginning university.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all about\ndeveloping analytical abilities and\nlearning to charm crowds into\nbelieving what you are saying. The\nsocial side of debating brings people\ntogether from across the world to\ncelebrate the New Year in style, with\ncultural flair from the host nation. The\nlinks our college makes with schools\nfrom all over the U.K. and farther\nafield are ones that will last for a long\ntime to come. The parties are vibrant,\nexciting and filled with students from\na variety of backgrounds, all enjoying\nthe festivities in the way students do.\nWell, with a hint of banter, of course.\nTo get involved with starting\ndebating, e-mail debate@imperial.\nac.uk.

    "content": "8 FRIDAY 24 JAN\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nMDMA - a new high in research?\nPhilippa Skett discusses the benefits of ecstasy, and the laws limiting science\nM\nDMA seems to be\nkeeping clubbers and\nscientists alike on their\ntoesatthemoment,with\nresearch into the recreational drug\non the rise. Despite the law heavily\nrestricting drug experimentation even\nwithin the laboratory, there still seems\nto be an unrelenting interest into the\npotential medical benefits of many of\nthe illegal substances out there. With\nnew research published this week, it\nmay only be a matter of time before\ndrugs such as ecstasy are no longer\nrestricted to the dives and dens of\nthose partying past dawn.\nMDMA, or more widely known\nas ecstasy, induces the release\nof serotonin, dopamine and\nnoradrenalineinthebrain,anddelivers\nfeelings of euphoria, diminishes\nanxiety and causes mild psychedelia.\nOften the drug will be taken with\nother neuroactive substances like LSD\nor magic mushrooms, but when taken\nalone its effects are usually felt around\nan hour after consumption and last\nfor a further three to six hours.\nA recent study carried out here\nat Imperial College has revealed\nthe first images of brain activity\nexperienced when taking MDMA.\nThe images, published from a project\nled by Professor Nutt, show just how\nthe drug affects various areas of the\nbrain and provide a new basis to\nsupport how MDMA could be used\ntherapeutically.\nThe images were produced by\nfunctional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI), and show where\nand when blood oxygenation levels\naltered throughout the brain under\nthe influence of MDMA. An increase\nin bloody oxygenation is indirectly\nindicative of an increase in neural\nactivity; when an area of the brain\nis activated, its metabolic demand\nincreases, requiring an increase in\noxygenated blood flow to provide\nglucose to the neurons that need more\nenergy.\n25 healthy volunteers, all with at\nleast one experience of MDMA, took\nthe drug under controlled conditions\nand were simply left to enjoy the ride.\nSubjects experienced a reduction\nin blood flow across the right\nhippocampus, thought to be\nresponsible for navigation, and the\nright amygdala that control emotion.\nThe reduction in blood flow across the\ncerebral cortex in general positively\ncorrelated with the intensity of the\ndrug effects felt by the volunteers.\nSo what does this mean? A\nreduction in neuronal activity by\nthe amygdala may be related to the\nsense of euphoria felt when high on\nMDMA; the ability of the amygdala\nto harness emotions diminishes and\ntherefore the feeling of elation occurs.\nNot only that, a reduction in activity\nof the hippocampus could result in\nmemory impairment; often removal\nof the hippocampus altogether results\nin amnesia.\nBoth the hippocampus and the\namygdala are part of a wider brain\nsystem, the limbic system, which links\nemotion and memory together. The\nresearch found that MDMA increases\nthe functional connections between\nthe amygdala and the hippocampus,\nshown by the results of the volunteers\nbeing asked to recall their least and\nmost favourite memories while on\nMDMA.\nThose on the drug recalled their\nfavourite memories to be more vivid\nand emotionally\nintense, and\nexperienced their\nworse memories\nless negatively.\nMDMA may\ntherefore be\nuseful in treating\nthose with PostTraumatic Stress\nDisorder (PTSD);\nif it can make\nusers\u2019 traumatic\nmemories less\ndistressful, it\ncould be used\nas a therapeutic\nagent for when\nPTSD episodes\noccur. It has\nbeen previously\nfound that the\nc o n n e c t i o n s\nbetween the\nhippocampus and\nthe amygdala are\nactually weaker in\nPTSD sufferers,\nso MDMA may\naid to restore\nf u n c t i o n a l i t y\nbetween the two\nand alleviate\nthe symptoms\nassociated with\nthe disorder,\neven if it is just temporarily.\nHowever, in the UK, research\nsurrounding the drug still remains\nconstricted, politically motivated\nand indeed controversial. Despite the\nAdvisory Council on the Misuse of\nDrugs stating in February 2009 that\nit would recommend downgrading\nMDMA from a Class A to a Class B\ndrug, the UK Home Office rejected\nthe notion. They did this on the basis\nthat such a reclassification would send\nthe wrong message to young people,\nand so it remained in the highest Class\ntier alongside cocaine, heroin, LSD\nand magic mushrooms.\nAside from the usual class\nclassifications in the UK, drugs are\nalso sorted into \u2018Schedules\u2019, numbered\nfrom 1 to 5. These outline the way\ndrugs can be used as controlled\nsubstances in a pharmaceutical\ncapacity. MDMA falls into the top\nSchedule, Schedule I, meaning it faces\nthe highest restrictions in scientific\nexperimentation too. These Schedules\nwere set by the UK Home Office, again\nshoehorning a political framework\ninto the legislation surrounding\nresearch and making it exceedingly\ndifficult to access funds and licencing\nfor projects based on high ranking\nsubstances.\nThis new research could hardly be\nconsidered as a definitive landmark\nin neuroscience in that it does have\nseveral weaknesses; with a sample size\nof volunteers that is disappointingly\nsmall alongside a high-level of\nvariability in the drug backgrounds\nof said volunteers, it may raise more\nquestions than it answers.\nHowever, with previous research\nhinting at the possibility of MDMA\nbeing used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease,\nvarious anxiety disorders and even\npossiblypaininotherpartsofthebody,\nmore research is certainly needed. It\nmay be that softening the legalisation\nsurrounding drug experimentation\nneeds to be done to allow MDMA to\nreach its full medicinal potential.\nBiological Psychiatry\nwww.justice.gov\nfMRI images of the changes in connectivity under MDMAin the hippocampus (top) and the amygdala\nRSFC (bottom).

The film\nshouldn\u2019t offend, nor should it be an\nunbiasedly kind portrayal, as even the\nmost celebrated people have flaws to\nspeak of. And Mandela: Long Walk\nto Freedom does get that balance to a\ncertain extent, putting the long years\nof Nelson Mandela\u2019s struggle against\noppression to the screen.\nThe film benefits enormously from\nthe presence of Idris Elba who plays\nthe title role with impressive restraint\nand although at appropriate times,\ngreat force. His natural assets, the tall,\ntowering frame and deep voice work\ntremendously to his advantage in setting him up to take the role of a strong\nleader. Elba takes his role even further,\nputting a very much relatable human\nface to the extraordinary man.\nIt moves at a remarkable pace,\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nFrozen and Thor: The Dark World\nIn recent years, many have said\nthat Disney animation has been on\nthe down and outs but hopefully\nthe arrival of Frozen will spell a\ncomeback!

Anna sets out on a mission\nto find her sister to reverse the deep\nfreeze along with a host of random\nm8s she meets along the way.\nFrozen marks the long-awaited\nreturn of the classic Disney musical\nformat but unlike our old childhood\nfavourites , Frozen uses a mixture of\nCGI and hand-drawn animation for a\nsleeker, more realistic feel whilst still\nretaining the trademark Disney look\nthat we all know and love.\nThor: The Dark World sees the\nreturn of the eponymous well-muscled Norse god and his wayward\nbrother Loki. Thor has to save\ndubious astrophysicist Jane (Natalie\nPortman) after she is kidnapped so\nhe enlists the help of imprisoned\nmurderer brother Loki who is\nconsequently freed in order to save\ndamsel in distress Natalie.

Just getting\nhim elected takes 141 minutes.\nThe idea of a 27-year imprisonment is remarkably diminished and\ntrivialised and its harsh conditions\nare barely looked at, during which\ntime we focus on Winnie Mandela,\nNelson\u2019s second wife, and her more\naggressive, no-nonsense stance to\nresist inequality. Winnie Mandela is\nplayed by Naomie Harris, the newest\nMiss Moneypenny, who goes through\na startling change from being Nelson\u2019s\nfemale companion, to a fearless leader\nwho frequently clashes with Nelson\u2019s\nmore peaceful approach to diplomacy.\nAnd it\u2019s a flawless transition Harris\nshows with compelling charisma.\nFor anyone unfamiliar with any part\nof the history it is enormously informative too, highlighting the most\nimportant, intense events surrounding the character\u2019s complex life (a lot\nof senseless shooting, a lot of riot-ing, plenty of deaths, cue news channel clips), but for experts, errors and\nmissed out details will be glaringly\nobvious.\nCould this have served better as a\nmini-series? Yes. Even at 141 minutes\n(an off-putting length for sure) not\neverything is squeezed in. With a cast\nthis good they could have been put to\neven more use, and there are of course\nsuch productions planned, although it\nwill be difficult to find actors as good\nas the aforementioned pair.\nT\nhe Secret life of Walter Mitty\nis a Ben Stiller film based on\nthe short of the same name\nwritten by James Thurber\nfor the New Yorker in 1942.\nIn the film Stiller plays the titular\ncharacter, Walter Mitty, a simple man\nin a niche job, born into a grey suit.\nThe story follows Mitty as he falls\nfor a new co-worker, Cheryl (played\nby Kristen Wiig) and evolves from\na man who daydreams about doing\nthings to a man who actually steps out\nof his shell and taking a grip on the\nhandlebars of life.\nMitty works as a low-level employee\nat a magazine before adapting to\nthe changes brought in by the new,\nmodern management team.\nAs the film progresses, Walter\nleaves the comfort of his home to\ntravel further afield, learning more\nabout himself while trying to find an\nelusive character that he\u2019s never met\nin person.\nThe cinematography in the film\nprovides a rather stark surreal\nexperience that adds to the overall\nfeeling of the film. As the character\ndevelops the scenery reflects changes\nthe terrain.\nThe film explores themes of\nromance, corporate life and online\ndating (via gratuitous mentions of\nOK Cupid) over the course of the\nfilm, with Walter becoming more of\nan explorer and less of a basement\ndweller (something I can sympathise\nwith - Ed.).\nThe film also explores the\nrelationship Walter has with\nhis mother and his sister; two\ncharacters that provide useful plot\ndevices in unexpected parts of\nthe script. The audience also sees\nWalter\u2019s inexplicably spry skills on\na skateboard, while showing tricks\nto Cheryl\u2019s son in a park (or a stunt\nman \u2013 if you believe in those kind of\nthings).\nOverall, Stiller has produced a\nwarm, feel-good, philosophical film\nwith some amazing cinematography,\na healthy dose of good guys and bad\nguys.\nHowever, for people who are\nlooking for an intellectual, action-packed movie, it might be time to\nlook somewhere else...\n\n"

This\nfirst image will be taken again in May,\nusing a different set of equipment,\nand another five locations will be\ninvestigated over the next three years.\nLove Science?\nFollow us on Twitter & Facebook!\nWe post any and all interesting science-related stuff that we stumble upon while\ntrawling the Internet for cool pictures.\n@SciFelix\nFelixScience\n\n"
