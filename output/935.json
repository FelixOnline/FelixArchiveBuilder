    "content": "Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992\n'Very good, welcome in Egypt!'\nwere the first words that the taxi\ndriver shouted at me as we sped into\nthe centre of Cairo. It was still early\nmorning and a cool breeze swept\nacross my face. On the horizon lay\na dusty collection of buildings and\nan intense orange sun broke through\nthe mystical blue fog that hung\naround them.\nI was dropped at Midan Talaat\nHarb, the 'centre' of Cairo and the\narea for budget hotels. This was the\nbeginning of my three week\nexpedition to sample some of\nEgypt's ancient and modern\ntreasures. I was soon checked into\nacclimatizing to the heat and\nsampling the food. With a change\nin diet and the poor standard of\nhygiene in some restaurants it was\ninevitable that I was bound to be\nstruck by, what is known in Egypt\nas, 'Pharaohs revenge'. This\nunfortunate bowel condition can\nstrike anywhere and at any time so\nyou soon learn to carry a few\nessential items around with you.\nEgypt is predominantly a muslim\ncountry. Everywhere you travel tall\nminarets pierce the blue skyline.\nYou will also become aware of the\nmuslim practice of prayer five times\na day. I was made only too aware\nThe Pharoah's Revenge\nThe land of the\nPyramids, the\nbirthplace of\none of the oldest\ncivilisations in\nthe world has\nlong drawn\nvisitors. Richard\nLyle reports\na dark and dusty hotel and eager to\ninaugurate my trip.\nVenturing out on to the crowded\nand congested streets that had lost\nthe serenity that I had witnessed\nearlier, I battled my way through a barrage of people and cars as a fierce sun beat down on my neck.\nWandering amongs't the bedlam and\nfumes I wondered what the Ancient\nEgyptians would have made of\ntoday's madness. Modern Cairo is\na huge sprawling unplanned city\nwith an estimated population of up\nto 18 million people - the total\npopulation of the country is\nestimated at 51 million.\nMy first goal was the Egyptian\nmuseum. This un imposing building\nhouses an awesome collection of\nrelics from Egypt's long and varied\nhistory. The infamous treasures of\nTut Ankh Amoun can also be found\nhere. My battling continued, this\ntime through droves of tourists, as\nI tried to view the solid gold mask\nand other relics found in the burial\nchamber of this celebrated Pharaoh.\nI spent my first few days in Egypt\nof this when I stayed in a hotel close\nto a mosque. Having wondered why\nthe rates that they had offered were\nsuch a bargain the answer came in\nthe early hours of the following\nmorning - I was rudely awakened\nby the deafening call to prayer. And\nof course just as I was drifting back\nto sleep the car horns and general\nhustle and bustle commenced.\nThere are many sites to see in\nCairo itself including ancient\nmosques, the Citadel (a medieval\nfortress and the sight of Old Cairo),\na camel market, on the outskirts of\nthe city the Great Pyramids of Giza\nand many interesting bazaars, such\nas Khan el Khalili.\nShopping for local handicrafts\nand the odd souvenir or two is\nalmost inevitable on any trip\nabroad. Many of the traders that\nyou find in Egypt are ruthless\nbusinessmen and will make you feel\ndistinctly guilty if you do not buy\nwhat they have to sell. Khan el\nKhalili is an excellent place to make\nsome purchases. This is reputedly\nthe worlds largest bazaar and is\nfound close to the Citadel. Here the\neager tradesmen coax you into their\ntiny shops crammed with treasures.\nMaking a purchase can be an\nextremely civilised and enjoyable\nexperience. Having myself\nexpressed an interest and entered a shop I was offered a cup of tea.\nWhilst I was relaxing with my drink\nthe bargaining began. After a short\nperiod of haggling I was offered a 'special price for you only' for the\nsilver jewellery that I had decided\nto buy. I drew out a wad of tatty and\ndog-eared cash. I thought this\nmoney was going to disintegrate\ninto a thousand pieces as I handed\nit over to my smiling and most\nappreciative recipient.\nOnce I had sampled the delights\nof Cairo I took the overnight train\nto Luxor, and although in second\nclass the carriage still had the luxury\nof air-conditioning. My 14 hour\njourney never contained a dull\nmoment. Everywhere I turned there\nwas commotion of one sort or\nanother going on as old men argued\nand traders drifted by offering all\nsorts of goods.\nAs you weave your way around\nthis intriguing country you will soon\nrealise that Egypt is littered with\nancient relics and monuments.\nLuxor was no exception. On arrival\nat this place a multitude of\nattractions awaited me - the great\nTemple of Karnak, which was\nadded to and modified over two and\na half thousand years; the Valley of\nthe Kings, containing the tombs of\nmany Pharaohs including Tut Ankh\nAmoun, Ramses I, II and III; the\nTemple of Queen Hatshepsut; the\nRamesseum; the Valley of the\nQueens; the Tombs of the Nobles;\nand the Luxor Temple.\nThere is also, of course, the Nile\nwhich provides a spectacular sight.\nFeluccas can be seen gracefully\nwinding their way across the\n22 May 1992 Felix 935 Feature\nshimmering waters of this river.\nThese Egyptian sail boats that have\ntransported goods up and down the\nNile for centuries. In more recent\ntimes they have transported a more\nlucrative cargo - tourists. With such\na beautiful location it is no surprise\nthat a sunset ride along the Nile is\na must for most visitors to Luxor.\nAfter a long and hot days\nsightseeing there is no better way\nto round it all off by sinking a few\npints of the locally brewed 'Stella'\nbeer. However I must offer a warning for any would be\nconsumers. Do not drink too much\nunless you want to experience the\nworst hangover of your life - the hot\nand dry climate coupled with the\nfact that the beer is somewhat rough\nin nature ensures this. After\noverdoing it myself I vaguely\nremember falling into bed,\nextremely drunk. Lying on my bed\nbathed in sweat, in my oven for a room, I was hit by an unusually\nlarge bout of paranoia. Above me\nthe blades of the roof fan seemed\nto be moving very erratically, in\nfact rocking wildly from side to\nside, on their loose fittings. The\nconcept of gravity took on its full\nmeaning as I wondered how this\nantique contraption could possibly\nstay up there.\nAs my trip unfolded I was\noverwhelmed by the variety of\nmethods of transport available:\nbuses, taxis, camels, donkeys,\nbicycles, horse and carriages or\nfe lucca s.I took the bus to Aswan.\nOn boarding the already full bus I remember being relieved to find a space on the back seat. As the\njourney got under way I soon\nrealised why no one had wanted to\nsit here - the seat was situated\ndirectly over the noisy engine which\nblasted heat up into this end of the\nbus. This coupled with the fact that\nthe bus was equipped with\n'Egyptian air conditioning' (cooled\nby opening the window) and I was\ndreadfully hung over from the night\nbefore, turned my five hour bus ride\nalong the Nile into a living\nnightmare.\nThe further south that you travel\nin Egypt the hotter and drier it gets.\nThis fact becomes blatantly\napparent in Aswan. I arrived at\nmidday and the heat was stifling.\nOnce I had checked into my hotel\nthe only solution to the heat and my\ntesting bus ride was an afternoon\nsiesta.\nWhilst in Aswan I took a number\nof fe lucca rides around the islands\nlittered across the Nile. I also\nvisited Abu Simbel, the site of a spectacular giant temple to Ramses\nII, on the shore of lake Nasser. It\nseems crazy that we drove for 280\nkm across barren desert, the\nhorizon marred only by the\noccasional group of rugged\nmountains, just to see this tern ple. Then we drove all the way back to\nAswan by the same route. I suppose\nthe expression 'when in Rome'\nsprings to mind here - or perhaps\n'when in Egypt.'\nHaving returned to Cairo by train\nmy next goal was the monastery of\nSaint Catherine located on the Sinai\npeninsular. My pilgrimage was a visit to Mount Sinai, the acclaimed\nsite of the ten commandments.\nHaving stayed the night at the\nmonastery's hostel I rose at three\nthe next morning and set off for the\ntwo hour hike to the summit of\nmount Sinai. Whilst climbing the\nmeandering path in the darkness I gazed up and witnessed a most\nbiblical sight - silhouetted against\nthe stars were three camels,\ncomplete with riders, which\nreminded me of the story of three\nwise men. On reaching the summit\nI rested to watch the sun rise. It was\na spectacular sight. The barren\n\u2022 iii ii lil h'm mm\nmountains became a radiant orange-red colour as the sun came up\nrevealing the desolate landscape.\nNo holiday to an exotic country\nis complete without a few days\nslumbering on the beach. The town\nof.Hurghada situated on the shores\nof the Red Sea provided me with\nmy fix of sun, sea and siesta. On\none of my days there I took a trip\nout to the nearby islands and coral\nreefs. This is a popular day trip and\nboat loads of eager tourists are\nshipped out to a selection of coral\nsites in the area. As these boats\ndescend on these areas droves of\nmasked beings can be seen jumping\nin all directions from them. After\na short period they are herded off\nto some other reef or a beach for\nthe whole process to continue. All\nthe same it is a good day out even\nif at times you felt a little like a sheep following the herd. The water\nis also warm and crystal clear, in\nfact when swimming it seems as\nthough you are floating in a gigantic\nswimming pool.\nAt the end of my trip I had\nenough time for a final visit to the\nPyramids. Sitting in a nearby cafe\nsucking on a water pipe as the sun\ndropped to its sandy horizon,\nsilhouetting these giant stone relics,\nI was certainly in a pensive mood.\nIn three weeks I had witnessed some\nsix thousand years of history and on\nthis evening I was watching just one\nmore sunset in the long life of these\nmagnificent monuments to\nmankind.\n\n"

It's just bloody\ntypical of IC.\nAt present I am a range-officer at\nthe gun club and next year I will be\nthe treasurer and will take on a major slice of the running of the\nclub. Unfortunately we get\npractically all of our new members\nin the first term of the year and, like\nall other clubs, require a certain\nnumber of members to get our\ngrants. The li kli hood of getting a sufficient membership starting just\nafter Chistmas is very slim. This\nwill mean that in two years time we\nwill be, a minor club with no one\nsufficiently capable or experienced\nenough to run it. The club will then\nhave to close (we don't elect people\nto run the club\u2014guns are dangerous\nthings and should only be handled\nby experienced people).

There was a slight\nambiguity in the wording, due to the\nlegal nature of the story and a misunderstanding between myself\nand my source, a source so highly\nplaced that checking the story\nfurther with Silwood was irrelevant.\nIrrelevant is also a good description\nof the criticism that Silwood made\nabout the story.

    "content": "Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992\nAt the crack of dawn on the first\nday of the Easter holidays, sixteen\ndivers made their way through the\nwreckage left outside the Union to\nour cellar. It was not a pretty sight\n- none of us having had time to\nrecover from the night before. In an\noperation that was the most efficient\nwe have ever managed we loaded\nthirty air tanks, one very heavy\noutboard motor, an inflatable boat,\nforty sacks of dive gear and various\nother vital bits and pieces into two\ngroaning vans. At the last minute\nwe threw in a couple of surfboards\nand our water-skis, just in case.\nHopes were high as we left London,\nDiving the Lizard\nand were ready for something a bit\nmore adventurous - half an hour of\nswimming around kelp bed is\nenough to dampen anybody's enthusiasm. Little did they know\nwhat was in store for the next few\ndays.\nIn the afternoon we managed to\npump some life into our ageing\ninflatable and under the sturdy\nseamanship of Rolf 'Fizz' Tietemer\nthe day's second dive took place a little further out on the same kelp\nbed. No one was too worried by this\nlack of variety, we all hoped that\nbetter things were in store for the\ncoming days, for which we had\nhired a bigger and faster boat from\na local boatman.\nAs we went to bed on Monday\nmorning the ominous sounds of the\nscattered over the bottom of a kelp\nbed during WWII. There was no\nchoice but to take another plunge\namongst the weed and look for\nedible wildlife. When all the day's deeds were done the final score was\nICUC 1: CRABs 1. Tom Brown\nand I managed to capture a monster\ncrustacean, only for it to claim its\nrevenge, drawing blood from one\nof the hapless divers' fingers. At the\nend of the day we all passed out\ndreaming of exciting wreck dives to\ncome.\nNeptune was still against us on\nTuesday, the wind had now\nincreased to force 8. The diving in\nFalmouth was beginning to look a little limited in these conditions and\nSteve was scraping the bottom of\nthe barrel to find us anywhere to go.\nTheICU\nMermen and\nMermaid Society\nsojourned in\nCornwall last\nEaster. The\ndefinitive record\nof their exploits\nis inscribed by\nSimon Milling.\nignoring the weather forecasts that\nall seemed to be predicting gale\nforce winds whipping along the\nCornish coast.\nWe arrived at our luxury caravan\nsite with plenty of time to make\nourselves at home in the local pub\nand spin some salty yarns, designed\nto turn all but the hardiest novice\ninto a quivering heap of jelly. As\nwe staggered to our beds after a slight overdose we tried our best not\nto notice the way the caravans were\nstarting to rock as the wind gathered\nstrength.\nSunday dawned bright ish and\nclear ish, despite expectations, and\nwas the first day's diving for the\nnew boys and girls. They were\ntaken off to a nice sheltered cove\nand thrown in, accompanied by\nsome of our more expert members.\nAll reappeared half an hour later\nwind could again be heard\nbeginning to shake the frail\ncaravans.\nThere were many sick looking\nfaces at the briefing later that\nmorning. The vans had rocked so\nmuch through the night that they felt\nlike we were already at sea. The\nMet Office did not do much to\nlighten the day, reporting Force 7\ngales on the coast set to continue for\nthe rest of the week. When we\npulled up at the harbour we were\ngreeted by the harbour master and\na small crowd of locals who\nmuttered darkly and shook their\nheads as we told them of our plans.\nDespite all these ill omens the\ndecision was made to face the\nelements head on. The only\nsheltered site Steve the Skipper\ncould suggest was the last resting\nplace of the 'Falmouth Subs',\nWe dropped off the boat into 8m of\nwater by the lighthouse and spent\nhalf and hour being thrown around\nby the swell. The local point of\ninterest was a set of gulley s leading\ntowards the headland, everyone\nmanaged to find them except Pete\nBowen and his buddy. Pete claimed\nlater that he had gone in exactly the\nopposite direction on purpose. He\nwas, however, unable to explain\nwhy. It was about this stage of the\nholiday that we noticed that the\nstress was beginning to tell on Pete,\nour beloved chairman.\nUnfortunately the effect of all the\ntough decisions the weather had\nforced him to take was making his\nalready sparse hair fall out. This\ndisturbing trend was set to continue\nfor the rest of the week despite the\nministrations of Rhoda, his\nmedically qualified deputy.\n-12-\n"

But within the dark citadel | i of Surefire, the pallid and unearthly\nflitted in fear of daylight through the\ne tio late d catacombs.\nAnd where was that Wagnerian Gallant, Lieutenant Tristan Khartoum? He had not been sighted for weeks - was it that he was so a feared of\nthe light that he had retreated to the foe tid and s cr of u lou s bowels of the castle ? Or was he spending more time with his families ? Or was he\ncontemplating what would happen if a resident of the Royal Gardens or Blight decided to inform higher authorities that they were not fit to be\nlived in? How many of the residents of the South Royal Gardens knew that the building had been given 25 years to live when it was built 27\nyears ago?\nBut he knew that this could never happen, for then those very same serfs would be cruelly evicted - or was it possible that the serfs would\nbe granted leave to remain rent-free? Quelle horr eur! Nonetheless, he contented himself by knowing that nobody would dare tell until they\nwere sure of not being thrown out - he could always fob them off by saying that reparations were in hand. Though whose hand, he did not\nsay.\nMany had ventured into the region of troglodytes - Gudzin, to the south and the unpronounceable Mntstr to the west- few had returned\nsane. Even fewer had returned with the bounty they sought. They were populated by strange, twisted dwarf like beings, who fed on triplicate\nNCR paper. They were every way identical to each other except that the denizens of Gudzin would say 'was s is s then? Yacan only get this in\nMntstr. Sorry, I can't give you the rest 'cos the form's wrong,' while the inhabitants of Mntstr would say 'was s is s then? Yacan only get this in\nGudzin. Sorry, I can't give you the rest 'cos the form's wrong. ' They would then refer the poor unfortunate adventurer to the mythical\n'stationery store,' deep within the Surefire Fortress. Many were the gallants who wandered within the Empire's bounds gibbering with\nfrustration and chewing on their triplicate forms.\nSad times, poor times - the Emperor himself had been seen hurrying into Cromwell's Emporium, where good food costs less, to buy the\nlast, cheap bread before they shut. As this was the mode of purchase of most of the Empire's serfs, many had witnessed and wondered at it -what terrible armageddon did it portend? Delicately curled smoked salmon slices on yesterday's baguette with a dash of parsley? Oh, that the\ncaterers at the Royal Gate should heave and retch at such a suggestion! And on culinary matters, it was noted that Sir Otto d 'Oignon's right\nhand maiden and leading acolyte, Baroness Dzhugashvili, had placed chocolate mousse on the menu of her leaving party - though why such a tragic parting should breed such celebratory joy is quite beyond me. Mousse... soft, spongy, insubstantial, yet somehow lapland y and antler y to boot.\nAnd so the gentle zephyrs of May warmed the citizen's frigid hearts - the serfs' souls were lifted unto a higher plane. The duck had\nreturned to Blight Square - her chicks had hatched, and the anxiety of the serfs' impending rite of passage, the hope of summer and the inner\neye looking farther to a world beyond the present squalor drove the processes of life to a new vitality. What was to become of the Emperor's new loaves? What was Sir Tristan doing with all his spare time? How many serfs know that Iosef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili ruled the Soviet\nUnion from 1926 until 1953 and knew nothing about computers? And so the story and verbosity continues\n\u201418\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion Felix 935 22 May 1992\n.. if this is NUS\nactivity then the\ngovernment is\npaying students\nfor activity the\nstudents have\nnot themselves\napproved. The\nGovernment is\npaying for its\nown subversion\naccountable to all, though apathy\ntends to get in the way. Arguments\nto show that this would be improved\non by voluntary membership have\nyet to be advanced.\nThe most damaging aspects of\nvoluntary membership have yet to\nbe fully explored. Under voluntary\nmembership, college student unions\nface potential cash shortages. If they\nare unable to maintain their current\nlevels of membership, then their\nfunds will drop. This means that\ncuts will have to be imposed, and\nservices reduced. It could also mean\nstudents having to pay supplements\non their memberships for individual\nsocieties.\nIf IC Union runs short of money,\nwhat is at risk? This is difficult to\nassess, and it depends on the extent\nof the fall off in membership. If the\ngovernment were to say to the\naverage student, 'here is \u00a380. You\ncan join ICU, you can join aCC U, you can join Conservative Students,\nor you can spend it,' there should\nbe no doubt about where a significant number of people will\nspend this \u00a3 8 0 . Especially if\nstudents do not fully appreciate\nwhat will be lost by not joining their\ncollege student union.\nAlmost certain to be hit first will\nbe clubs and societies. Members\nwill find themselves either facing a rapid reduction in funding, a slicing\nof services, a substantial increase in\nmembership fees, or all three.\nMany clubs, most clubs, your club\ncould and will go to the wall.\nSporting clubs will be hit hard.\nThese clubs already have to pay a proportion of their costs. This\ncharge could rapidly become 100%\nof their costs.\nDramSoc, OpSoc, and other\nSCAB( Social, Cultural and\nAmusement Board) societies would\nhave to stage self funding\nproductions. Not just productions\nthat make a profit, but productions\nthat can pay for themselves before\nthey happen. The last production of\n'Grease' was half underwritten by\nthe CCus alone. Under voluntary\nmembership, the CCUs would have\nto become self funding themselves,\nattracting their own membership,\nfacing a dire future.\nAll publications would certainly\ncease. The only potential survivor\nwould be Felix, which may be able\nto attract enough advertising to\nsurvive, and which could levy a cover charge. IC Radio could\nbecome a community service, and\nthus lose the purpose of its\nexistence. STOIC? Deepest\nsympathy.\nSympathy also for ICU Rag,\nwhich could see itself fundraising\nsimply to pay for the Imperial\nCollege Union welfare service. The\nwelfare service brings out another\ndrawback in the voluntary\nmembership scheme. Should\nwelfare advice be given to nonmembers of the union? Could the\nsituation arise where a student\nknocks on the welfare officer's door, on the brink of eviction, only\nto be told that an \u00a3 8 0 membership\nfee has to be paid before advice can\nbe given? Will all students be\nchecked for membership before\nthey even enter the union building?\nThis apartheid system will also\napply to other trading outlets. Will\nnon members be allowed to use the\nbookshop? Will there be checks on\nthe door? Will there be a two tier\nsystem, double pricing, different\ncheckouts? Will students find\nthemselves barred from the union\nbars? Will non members be charged\na higher rate than members? Who\nwill the union snack bar be open to?\nMembers? Non-members? Will any\nof these trading outlets survive\nfinancially, remembering that at the\nminute they are all running to\nprofit?\nDecisions, decisions. What gets\ncut? What closes first? Who gets\nturned away? None of these are\nvoluntary decisions.\nThe results of voluntary\nmembership could be catastrophic.\nThe proposals threaten to destroy a major part of the educational\nsystem, and the fabric of college\nlife. Why are these proposals being\nput forward? To increase\n'accountability', or to crush the the\nNUS - a dormant pussycat dressed\nin lion's clothing, an organisation\nthat fools no-one, not even itself?\nThese proposals are being put\nforward by Conservative Students,\na body that lives off the back of the\nstudent union system like a parasite.\nLast year, IC ConSoc received\n\u00a3520 of IC Union money. This\nyear, it is claiming for \u00a3535. Some\nof this money will be used to\naffiliate to Conservative Students,\nand to Conservative Collegiate\nForum. This organisation is itself\nfunded by the Conservative Party.\nIts chairman, Rob Marvin, worked\nfor the Conservative Party in Bath\nduring the election.\nthe result of\nvoluntary\nmembership\ncould be\ncatastrophic\nIt is not only a case of\ngovernment's money making its\nway back to the party of\ngovernment. It is a case of students'\nunion money, Imperial College\nUnion money, being used, in\nhowever small a way, to fund the\ndestruction of Imperial College\nUnion, and all its services. A biologist told me before that a cancer is described as a malignant\ndisease, which spreads by deriving\nbenefit from the host, and by\nspreading destroys the host. If the\nUnion is the host, then Conservative\nStudents are the cancer in the\nstudent body. They are, to quote\nMrs Thatcher, 'the enemy within.'\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

As well as their role in the\nConstituent College Unions\nImperial College Management\nSchool has announced that four\nscholarship places are to be made\navailable to full time members of\nCollege staff and their children. The\nscholarships will be valid for the\nMaster of Business Administration\n(MBA) degree from the beginning\nof the academic year 1992/3.\nBoth MBA courses are covered\nby the scholarships, which will be\nawarded on the basis of the\nManagement School's selection\nprocess. Only those already\naccepted for the courses will be\nconsidered for award of the\nscholarships. Applications for the\nfull time course, which begins in\nOctober, must be made by July.\nImperial College Union 'Pimlico\nConnection' has been in the public\neye this week following the\npublication of three articles in\nleading journals. Chris Riley, an ex-Pimlico tutor and IC PhD student,\nwrites in New Scientist that the\nPimlico Connection is designed to\npromote science and technology and\nto increase the staying-on rates for\nstudents of further and higher\neducation. However, in Institute of\nElectrical Engineers (IEE) News,\nMr John Hughes, BP Fellow for\n(CCUs), dep reps are eligible to\nvote on ICU Council. According to\nZoe Hellinger, IC Union President,\nICU regards the dep reps as their\n'most representative' officials and\nshe added that ICU does not make\nenough use of them.\nThe constitution states that\nelection papers for dep rep elections\nmust be posted around the\nrespective department for fifteen\ndays, and that nominations must\nremain open for ten days. Each\nnomination for dep rep requires one\nproposer and ten second ers, except\nin the case of the Management\nschool, where only five second ers are required. If no candidate is\nnominated for a post after this time,\nthen papers should remain up until\nnominations are received.\nThe elections for the dep rep\npositions should be held in the\nSpring Term, the constitution reads.\nThe only exception to this is the\nManagement School, where the\nDep Rep is elected during the first\nfour weeks of the Autumn Term.\nThe ballot should be open from\n10.00am to 5.00pm on one college\nday.

Further\ninformation on the courses can be\nobtained from the Admissions\nOffice in the Registry Division,\nSherfield 327, or from Kim Everitt,\nextension 3318.\nThe announcement of the\nscholarships follows a difference of\nopinion between college\nmanagement and Imperial College\nAssociation of University Teachers\n( IC AUT) on the award of\nscholarships. At the start of 1991,\nthe Management School announced\nthat it was withdrawing free places\nfor College staff studying on the\npart time MBA course. At this time,\nStudent Tutoring, writes that the\ntutoring scheme has now branched\nout into English, modern languages\nand humanities.\nStudent tutoring began at Imperial\nin 1975, and last year 130 students\nvolunteered to go out on\nWednesday afternoon into local\nsecondary and primary schools.\nWriting in the National Association\nof Teachers in Further and Higher\nEducation (NATFHE) Journal, Mr\nHughes, says that 97% of students\nin the Pimlico scheme feel they get\nnomination, that candidate should\nbe deemed elected after the close of\nnominations. ICU Returning\nOfficer, Steve Farrant, told / CNN that objections can be lodged to a specific ratification at the EG M on\nThursday. In this case, an election\ncould be re-run.\nThe query on the constitutional\nposition follows muted concern at\nthe running of dep rep elections in\nthe Department of Computing\n(DOC). As the current dep rep is\non industrial leave, one of the\ncandidates approached ICU President, Zoe Hellinger, to\norganise the election, and presented\nher with a list of candidates. This\nwas passed on to City and Guilds\nC CU President, Tim Proctor, and\nthe election was held as for aCC U post. Both Ms- Hellinger and Mr Proctor were unaware that the\nelections for dep rep were covered\nby the ICU Constitution. There\nwere five candidates for DOC dep\nrep; Samir Karia, Nainish Batna,\nDavid Cohen, James Grinter and\nNew Election. Samir Karia was\nelected DOC dep rep on the third\ncount.\nthe AUT assumed that this\nwithdrawal of free places would\nalso cover staff children on the full\ntime course, though this was not\ndiscussed until September 1991.\nThe AUT, in a confidential report\nleaked to Felix, said that they would\nbe in favour of 'a scheme of four\nfree places for staff and none for\nchildren of staff. On 19 September,\nthe college Management Planning\nGroup decided to offer three free\nstaff places and one free place for\na staff child.

    "content": "22 May 1992 Felix 935 Opinion\nStudents have now hit on a scheme\nwhich, under current\ncircumstances, would allow\nindividual students to leave the NUS\nbut would not allow individual\nstudents to join the NUS.\nThe crux of the scheme is that the\nNUS only allows whole college\nstudent unions to affiliate. If\nstudents were given the option of\njoining a college student union,\nrather than being forced to join it,\nand then if that union were to\naffiliate to the NUS, the student\ncould leave the college student\nunion, and thus the NUS. However,\nif a college student union were to\ndecide not to affiliate to the NUS,\nthen an individual student could not\njoin the NUS as the entire college\nstudent union needs to affiliate.\nThis is an opt out policy, but not\nan opt in policy. It is known as\nvoluntary membership.\nAll IC students are members of\naCC U, ICU and UL U. CCUs are\nfunded by ICU. ICU is funded by\nthe College. The College is funded\nby the Universities Funding Council\n( UFC). UFC is funded by\nGovernment. Thus, runs the\nargument, the government funds\ncollege student unions. An essential\naddition to this is that the\ngovernment's money is taxpayers'\nmoney.\nImperial College\nUnion money is\nbeing used to\nfund its own\ndestruction\nIf this argument is continued to\nits logical conclusion, then the\ntaxpayer is paying for other student\nactivities through the student grant.\nFor instance most alcohol\nconsumed by students in the union\nbar, most of the food eaten by the\nsame students, and the taxpayer is\nleft simply scraping the vomit from\nExhibition Road. By a subtle shift\nof im perception, the government is\npaying for political activities of\nstudent unions. And if some of this\nactivity is the NUS activity, then the\ngovernment is paying students for\nactivity that the students have not\nthemselves approved. The\ngovernment is paying for its own\nsubversion.\nThis is where voluntary\nmembership comes in. The theory\nbehind it is that students are given\nthe option of joining the college\nstudent union, and so can exercise\nmore control over its workings.\nInstead of giving government\nmoney to student college unions\nthrough college, the money is\ninstead given to students directly,\nwho then decide whether to join the\ncollege students union or not.\nThe scheme breaks down quite\ncomprehensively when applied to\nthe on the ground situation. The\nfirst simple question is on how\nmuch money individual students are\ngiven to join the union. At present,\nImperial College pays between\n\u00a375-\u00a380 per student to Imperial\nCollege Union. Thus, it appears\nthat the government, under\nvoluntary membership, would give\nan additional \u00a375-\u00a380 to each\nstudent. The government would not\nonly have empowered students with\nthe grudging authority to spend this\nsum, they can also brazenly claim\nto have increased the levels of\nstudent financial support. But not\nbefore long, this sum would be\nabsorbed in the main grant\npayment.\nThe major problem with this\nscenario is that the figure of \u00a375\u00a380 has been set by College. All\nCollege funding is given by UFC to the College for the College to\nspend according to its budget.\nMoney for ICU and the CCUs is\nincluded in this block grant. UFC does not add a little note saying that\nx amount is to be paid to the unions.\nUnion money is not ring fenced. Therefore, it is not possible to\nidentify a specific amount of\ngovernment money that funds the\nstudent unions, save that which the\ncollege itself identifies. With the\ndecisions on union funding resting\nwith individual colleges, it cannot\nbe said that every student pays the\nsame amount for student union\nmembership, because of the\ncollegiate variations. It would thus\nbe exceptionally difficult, though\nnot impossible, for government to\ndecide on a national flat rate to be\nallocated to each student in lieu of\nunion membership. Beside this, a flat rate would fail completely to\ntake into account regional variations\nin the cost of goods, services, rent\nand staff salaries.\nThe assumption that 'by giving\nstudents the option of joining their\nunion then the union will become\nmore accountable' is itself highly\nquestionable. If a students' union\nwere to pursue a divisive policy,\nthen the immediate reaction of those\nopposed to the move would be to\nleave the union. Again, the\nprecedent is set by those students\nwho hadn't the guts nor the stomach\nto reform the NUS from within and\nleft to join that lunatic fringe,\nConservative Students.\nIf the proposed policy is\nespecially militant, then the\ndeparture of the opposing\nmoderates would make the existing\nunion even less accountable to\nmainstream opinion. Or is that what\nthe Conservative plan for voluntary\nmembership is designed to do?\nThus, it is not proven that\nvoluntary membership would make\ncollege student unions more\naccountable. Indeed, despite all\ncriticisms levelled, Imperial\nCollege Union is potentially\nwhy are these\nproposals being\nput forward?\nTo increase\n'accountability'\nor to crush\nthe NUS - an\norganisation\nthat doesn't even fool itself?\n\n"

Even more true to form he\nforgot to take it with him when we\nleft the caravan site.\nThe second dive of the day was\nonto a little-explored wreck, the\nGunvor, found conveniently close\nto the place where we were staying.\nIt was a bit weedy again but this did\nnot matter too much, one good dive\nin a day is enough to satisfy all but\nthe most demanding diver. The best\nfeature of the beach at Kennack\nsands was the surf. This was not\nmuch help when trying to launch the\nboat, but it did mean that Jeremy\ncould show off his talent at body-surfing, honed to perfection during\nhis mis-spent youth.\nThe wind came back with a vengeance after Wednesday's relative calm, blowing itself up to\na force 8 gale, with gusts of 70mph. To our surprise Steve decided that\nit might be OK to attempt the wreck\nthat we had all been hoping to dive\nsince Monday - the Hera. The first\nwave of divers climbed nervously\ninto Steve's all too fragile-looking\ncraft ready to face the trip of their\nlives. It was like Alton Towers\nwithout that feeling of security you\nget from knowing that no one ever\nfalls off the corkscrew. The half\nhour trip to the dive site left us all\nexhausted and exhilarated. After\nthat, the dive itself seemed tame -we descended into excellent\nvisibility on the Hera and swam\naround her for a while making the\nmost of the large intact sections of\nthe hull. The ride home from the\nwreck was no less exciting than the\njourney out, with waves crashing\nover the boat, ferocious winds and\nmountainous swell. It was all too\nmuch for Steve, he had to go home\nafter one trip to recover. The\nsecond wave didn't manage to get\na dive at all.\nThe last day's diving gave us the\nconditions that we would have liked\nfor the entire week. Those who\ndidn't manage to dive the Hera were\nfinally taken out there in much\nmilder conditions. Phil 'Gills'\nLenz's was the only casualty of the\nday. He came unstuck when his hi-tec dry suit failed him and let in\nrather more cold seawater than he\nmight have liked. In his usual\naltruistic fashion he carried on with\nthe dive so that his novice could\nclock up the quarter of an hour\nneeded to be logged.\nEveryone else then dived the\nEpsilon, a small wreck whose main\nattraction was that it was not\ncovered in kelp. Nick Volpe at last\nshowed his true colours, after much\ntough talk through the week he\nwimp ed out of the Epsilon.\nComplaining that he was 'a bit\ncold'.\nAfter a tiring and enjoyable week\nwe made a final visit to our local\nfor our traditional end of trip\ndinner, an excuse for one and all to\nindulge in yet more salty stories of\nthe sea. The novices could now join\nin with the best of them, having\nexperienced at first hand what it's all about.\nThe end of this story belongs to\nGareth Jones and his Hertz van. Not\ncontent with making us all wait for\nthree hours when he burst a tyre on\nthe M4 on the way home, Gareth\nforgot that the clocks went forwards\non Sunday night and managed to get\nout of bed the next morning just\nafter the van had been towed away\nto Warwick Road pound.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 935 22 May 1992\nThe implementation of a students'\ncharter now looks imminent.\nWestminster sources have indicated\nto / CNN that the students' charter\nwill be one of several charters to be\ndiscussed at a meeting in Ten\nDowning Street, on 19th June. This\nmeeting will be attended by the new\nCharter minister, William\nWaldegrave, and the new Education\nSecretary, John Patten, amongst\nothers.\nThe Conservative Student\nCharter Stall was set out by one of\ntheir national officers, Kevin\nShinkwin, last February. Speaking\nto IC Radio, Mr Shinkwin said., 'we-want to see grants paid on time; we\nwant to see local education\nauthorities get their act together and\nmake sure that the cheques are there\nwhen the students get back from\nholidays ... we want to see loans\nextended.... and we also want to see\nThe Enemy Within\nA revolution in\nStudent Union\nfunding is\nheading our way\n- and this time\nstudents have\nhad nothing to\ndo with it.\nDeclan Curry,\nIC Radio News\nEditor, reports..\nThe students' charter is expected\nto follow the pattern already laid\ndown by other charters. Its\nmeasures are expected to be fairly\nlimited, concentrating on little\nirritants rather than taking a wider\nview and tackling issues su crT as institutional under funding, staff-student morale, and student\nfinancial support.\nWhile no specific details are yet\navailable, Conservative Studdhts\nhave outlined a package of ideas for\ninclusion in a charter. Conservative\nStudents, or Conservative\nCollegiate Forum, are rapidly\nbecoming the power behind the\neducational throne, and their ideas\nare the best indication of how\ngovernment is thinking. Their\nchairman, Rob Marvin, recently\nhad high level discussions with the\nnew Higher Education Minister,\nNigel Forman. These discussions\nleft Mr Marvin 'confident' that\nwork set in train by Conservative\nStudents before the election would\ncontinue to be carried out by the\nnew Minister.\nan extension of free speech on\ncampus.'\nThe imminence of the charter's introduction was acknowledged by\nConor Pickering, another officer on\nthe Conservative Student national\nexecutive. Mr Pickering told /CNN\nthat 'reform of student unions will\ncome through the Citizen's Charter.'\nThe charter was originally\ndiscussed at a Downing Street\nmeeting in January 1992. The then\nEducation Secretary, Kenneth\nClarke, described the charter as an\nidea the Department of Education\nand Science (DES) would need to\nlook at. However, with the election\nthen pending any new charter work\nwas construed by DES officials as\na party political matter, and so the\nidea was shelved until after the\nelection.\nThe Conservative election\nmanifesto contained a typically\nvague passage which read, 'we are\nputting in place new mechanisms to\nensure that academic standards are\nmaintained in higher education.'\nThough charter watchers took this\nto refer to a students' charter, the\nparticular extract could have\nreferred to anything.\nThis trick of placing woolly\nwords in a manifesto so that\nsubsequent legislation can be said\nto have the mandate of the people\nis an old one. It was employed to\ngreat effect with the poll tax,\nintroduced following a four line\ndash in the 1987 manifesto. In much\nthe same way that the poll tax was\nthe hidden agenda behind reform of\nthe rating system, is there a hidden\nagenda behind the students' charter?\nNot really. There is no hidden\nagenda insofar as the agenda has\nalready been publicly set. The only\ndifference is that the agenda has\nbeen set, not by the government,\nbut by Conservative Students.\nLooking behind the charter's initial\nsuperficiality, it's clear that when\nConservative Students talk of\nreform, they mean the annihilation\nof the National Union of Students\n(NUS). Indeed, Conservative\nStudents have compared the\nintroduction of the charter to the\ntrade union reforms of the early\n1980s. Conor Pickering told / CNN that 'in the same way as the 1980s saw the Government reform trade\nunions, so the 1990s will see the\nreform of student unions.'\nHerein lies the simplest and most\ninjurious way to 'reform' the NUS.\nConservative Students intend to\nliquidate the NUS by reforming or\ndestroying every single college\nstudent union in the country.\nCurrently, all students are\nautomatic members of their\nrespective college student union.\nThis means that Imperial students\nare members of their constituent\ncollege union (CCU), the parent\nImperial College Union (ICU), and\nthe University of London Union\n(ULU). There is no choice in this\nmatter.\nDecisions on affiliation to the\nNUS are made on a campus wide\nbasis only. If a college student\nunion affiliates, then every member\nof that college student union is a member of the NUS. The concept\nof individual membership of the\nNUS does not exist. A student\ncannot join the NUS if its college\nstudent union is not affiliated. A student cannot leave the NUS if its\ncollege student union decides to\naffiliate.\nConservative Students have long\nsought to reduce the membership of\nthe NUS. In the past, they tried to\nforce introduction of voluntary\nmembership to the NUS. Under\nthis, students could leave or join the\nNUS as they pleased - though they\nwould still be members of their\ncollege student union. Conservative\n~ 4 \u2014\n\n"

The cut follows\na blunder by the Universities\nFunding Council (UFC) and the\nUniversities Statistical Record\n(USR).\nThe UFC announced last\nFebruary that Imperial was to\nreceive an increase in funding of\n19.9%, but following a story in last\nFriday's Times Higher Education\nSupplement, the research figure has\nbeen revised downwards to an\nincrease of 14.6%.\nThe mistake has been blamed on\na 'data error' by the UFC. Speaking\nto / CNN, they said that 'there has\nbeen a small readjustment' of the\n1992-3 grant. The UFC pointed out\nthat the total sum involved\nnationwide was \u00a31.4 million, which\nthey then part-funded IRCs. This\nleft the IRCs with two sources of\nfunding, the UFC and research\nrepresents less than 0.1% of the\ntotal national grant.\nRodney Eastwood, Director of IC\nPlanning and Management\nInformation Services, told / CNN that the error was introduced into\nthe funding system by the\nUniversities Statistical Record.\n'The error was not introduced by\nus,',Jie said, and added that the\nfigures used to decide the level of\nfunding this year relate to the year\n1989/90. These figures were also\nused to decide 1991/2 funding\nlevels, without any error. 'They\nwere used by UFC last year and\nthey got it right then,' he said.\nIRCs have been totally funded by\nthe UFC in the past, but this year\nthe UFC introduced a new funding\nstructure, whereby it gave some\nadditional money to the research\ncouncils (ie SERC, NERC) and\ncouncils.\nThe UFC said that, in effect, they\nare funding IC's IRCs directly as\nwell as through the research\ncouncils. Thus part of the projected\n\u00a31.26 million funding for IRCs had\nbeen duplicated.\nMr Eastwood puts this duplicated\nfigure at \u00a3400,000, though the UFC had written to the College to request\nthe return of only \u00a3300,000. He\nalso added that as the money\nallocated was not to be paid until\nAugust, there was no physical cut\nin funds. But he admitted that\nCollege had already produced\nspending plans for the additional\namount.\nThe funding cut affects the IRC\nfor Semiconductor Materials, the\nIRC for Process Systems\nEngineering, and the NERC Centre\nfor Population Biology. Other IRCs\nwhich are funded by bequests,\nindustrial grants or charities are\nunaffected. These are the Bagrit\nCentre, the Centre for Toxic Waste\nManagement, the Wellcome Centre\nfor Parasitic Infections and the\nGlobal Environment Research\nCentre.\nOther universities have been\nunderfunded as a result of the\nstatistical error and these\nuniversities will have extra money\nallocated to them by the UFC. The\nUFC has announced that any\nfinancial shortfall as a result of the\nfinancial readjustments would be\nmet out of its 'flexibility margin.'\n\n"

As a three-way psychological battle begins\nbetween the Turners and the\nbag lady, it becomes clear that Dan's development scheme in his home\nvillage is a two-fingered salute to\nthe locals, with his wife realising it\nis becoming an obsession. Not to be\nout-acted, the b army bag lady claims\nthat Dan is HER husband. Whether\nit is make-believe or faint\nrecollection is eerily blurred.

    "content": "22 May 1992 Felix 935 Editorial\nInstinct III editorial\nDear Adam,\nI was most shocked by the vicious\nattack on the reviewer 'Boris' by\nMr Stokes. While Mr Stokes did the\ngood thing to write a letter to Felix\n(unlike the sad number of apathetic\nstudents in IC) having a go at a reviewer is not very constructive;\nmounting personal attacks on\nanyone with whom you disagree\nwon't take you very far in life. I would like to emphasize that this\ndoesn't only apply to Mr Stokes'\nletter, but also to Mr Pritchard and\nMercer's attack on Lise Yates, as\nwell as countless attacks in the past,\ndirected at nearly anyone working\nin one of the college's media (Felix,\nSTOIC and IC Radio).\nEnclosed is the review that I have\nwritten for STOIC.\nIn Basic Instinct, Michael Douglas\nplays Nick, a cop who, like every\nother cop in USA it seems, has had\nproblems in the past, but is now\nokay. He stumbles across a murder\nwhere the victim was killed with an\nice pick. His primary suspect is\nCathryn, played by the beauteous\nSharon Stone.\nCathryn is not only a 'femme\nfatale', but wicked in every action\nshe takes on earth. Add another\ncouple of beautiful lesbian and ex-lesbian females, and everybody,\nincluding Nick and us, is confused\nabout who did it and what's going\non.\nBefore the performance, we were\ngiven leaflets by some gay activist\ngroup. The film indeed portrays\nlesbian women as ruthless\npsychopathic killers. The leaflet is\naimed at protesting against\nHollywood's view of queer\ncharacters.\nHowever, this is in fact NOT a typical Hollywoodian film. It's got\nmore sex than anything from\nHollywood, more violence, and an\na typical end. Hollywood hated it.\nWhy?\nWell, the director of the film was\nPaul Verhoeven, a dutchman. And\nthis film has a distinct continental\nflavour. It starts at lOOm ph, and it\nends abruptly. The audience is\nsubjected to, open quotes, 'The fuck\nof the century', and loose morals\nare widely portrayed.\nThe film made \u00a32.65 million in\nthe UK On the first weekend of\nrelease, and it's been at number one\nin the US box office for a couple\nof weeks. Some movie critics hated\nit, and some loved it. Why would\none hate it? By mus understanding it, because this is a film that can be\nunderstood in a number of different\nways. Basic Instinct is not a movie\nabout sex, not about murder, not\nabout lesbians, but, as Sharon Stone\nherself says, about love.\nUnconventional love, that is. If\nyou keep that in mind, then you'll\nrate this film as highly as the Silence\nof the lambs. I did. 8 out of 10.\nMay I also point out the fact that\nthe f word was 'beeped' on air and\nthat, although I wished to have\nshares in the film, I was unlucky not\nto have acquired some. Judging\nfrom the film's success, I'd be very\nrich by now.\nCheers,\nOlivier MJ Crepin-Leblond,\nPG2, Elec Eng.\nOne of the main purposes of this\npaper is to stir up debate - it is only\nthrough debate that the opinions that\nform the basis of decisions are\nbrought to the fore. Felix has been\naccused of being 'negative' - though\nin my four years here I have never\nknown Felix accused of anything\nelse, despite that in looking back,\nFelix' stance seemed to be\nindifferent, or even faintly\nencouraging. In addition, the only\nplace Felix can have a 'stance' is in\nthe editorial - the news being based\non fact insofar as it is known, and\nif it isn't, then the errors must be\npointed out - the rest of the pages\nbeing comprised of personal\nopinions which are open to\nanybody. I don't really know why\nI am still labour ing this point;\nperhaps not enough people in the\nCollege have grown up yet to\nunderstand what 'free speech' is.\nEverybody benefits from free\nspeech in the long run.\nThis particular diatribe was\nbrought about because of alleged\n'anti-CCU' (constituent college\nunion) bias in Felix. Where? Have\nthe news team written something\ninaccurate? If so, then tell us. Let's get this clear - I am not anti-CCU\nand Felix is not anti-CCU. If people\nwant them, then I would not be so\narrogant as to tell them otherwise.\nI happen to think that more people\nshould know about the finances of\nthe CCUs - and ICU, and the\nCollege as well - particularly if the\nUnions have to tighten their\nfinancial belts. The taxpayer who is\nfinancing the Unions as well as the\nstudents who should benefit from\nthem have a right to know that their\nmoney is being spent in a useful and\npurposeful manner.\nCredits\nRose, Andy, Declan, David S, David HB, Simon, James, Poddy,\nCatherine, Sam, Scott, Ian, Steve\nN, Marge, Khurrum, Troy\nTempest, Rag and Seedy, Richard\nLyle, Simon Milling, Carl Fairhurst\nHarassment\nDear Adam,\nWith respect to last week's letter\nabout a sexual assault in Southside.\nAt present there is a lot of work\ngoing into forming a Union Sexual\nHarassment Policy describing\nactions and procedures to be taken\nafter cases of harassment.\nHowever, in the mean time,\nwhenever any students experience\nwhat they perceive to be sexual\nharassment whilst in the Union,\nthey should immediately (if\npossible) report it to any member\nof Union staff including Bar and\nDuty Officers who will assist. They\nare easily recognisable by their\n'staff tops.' Every reported case\nwill be treated seriously and in\nconfidence.\nIf you wish to report any other\nincidents within College then please\ncome and see Mandy Hurford\n(Union Manager) or Stef Ruis\n(Union Welfare Advisor).\nYours sincerely,\nZoe Hellinger, ICU President\nRag and Seedy's Crossword\nAcross\nGist (3)\nComputer Language (7)\nFlaw (6)\nSoon (4)\nPut Right (7)\n.

    "content": "Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992\nSTOIC is the student television\nservice for Imperial College\nstudents. Why point out this basic\nfact you ask? STOIC seems to be\nCrepin-Leblond, whose idea it was,\nand to Ronjoy Choudhury, who did\nthe (very good) artwork for the\nvideo. The second award was third\nSTOIC goes into the Night\nplace in the documentary section\nwith a report on last year's Japan\nFestival. Thanks for this must go to\nAlex Wiedmann for this. STOIC\nwas also complemented on the\ntechnical quality of its material,\nwith the news intro being thought\nso good that it sparked off a new\ncategory for next year for the best\ntitles. In this week's Into the Night\n(Thursday 28th, from 7.00pm) we\nwill be showing the award winning\nprogrammes and also some of the\nmaterial that we have obtained from\nsome of the other student television\nstations that attended.\nThat is the past - what about the\nfuture? On the technical front, the\nnetwork to Southside and Prince's gardens should now be well and\ntruly fixed, but do bear with us if\nit isn't we've over four miles of\ncable to check! The sound quality\nshould also be much better due to\nour recently acquired compressor\nwhich should eliminate much of the\nbuzzing noise. Unfortunately our\nsecond frame store and cameras\nhave both ceased to function, so we\nare a little restricted as to what we\ncan do at the moment, but we\nshould hopefully have it all fixed\nsoon.\nOn the programme front we have\nlots of ideas but still not enough\npeople. So if you feel like helping\nCarl Fairhurst\ngives an\nintroduction as\nto what has\nbeen occupying\nSTOIC of late\nand what will\nbe shown on\nCollege screens\nin the future\nless well known than the other two\nUnion publications (Felix and IC\nRadio), and in this article I hope to\ninform and show you just what\nSTOIC does, and why.\nA complaint we quite often get is\nthat the actual output of\nprogrammes is small. We can't argue with this point as it's true.\nCompared with IC Radio, for\nexample, we broadcast our own\nmaterial only a few times a week.\nBut this is not due to laziness - a television programme will on\naverage take over ten times the\nlength of a radio programme to\nthink of, record and edit. This\nmeans that one hour of STOIC\nprogrammes will have taken at least\nten hours to prepare, and quite often\nmuch longer.\nEven though our output is fairly\nsmall, it is of a high standard.\nDuring the Easter holidays NaSTA\n'92 took place. This is the National\nStudent Television Association\nconference, and this year it was\nbased at Brighton Polytechnic.\nDuring the conference there were\naward ceremonies for different\nprogramme categories and STOIC\nwalked away with two awards. The\nfirst was for the best video to music,\nand we were awarded the first prize\nfor our Valentine's Day video.\nMany thanks must go to Olivier\n& s Se\n%rf\nc.

    "content": "22 May 1992 Felix 935 Clubs & Societies\nCadwell - in the middle of\nnowhere, or Lincolnshire, which\namounts to the same thing. Three\nand a half hours and 150 miles from\nhome we were faced with a gleaming collection of brand new\nVFR400RS (a motorbike),\n\u00a31000-worth Diadora leathers and\nour instructor, Simon 'Kiwi'\nCrater.\nNo sooner had I got my lid on\nthan we were up to the line for the\nfirst five laps at following the\nleader. We'd been sniggering at the\nprevious groups' attempts at the\nhairpin bend - I remember telling\neveryone not to laugh because at\nleast one of us would end up going\nstraight on. The first attempt were\ndesigned as Mearn-the-lines' laps,\nthen there were five 'try-them-out-yourself laps being watched by the\ninstructor behind, then five 'try-and-keep-up' advanced pursuit laps\nand finally five 'shake-your-thang'\nlaps where you go mad, botch\neverything and fall off. Somehow\nPJ kept getting lost which is strange\nsince there are no turn-offs on a race track. Coming into the hairpin\nwe would always slow down to\nregroup and thus we never really\ngot much of a shot at the hairpin.\nAs soon as I was given the go-ahead to go-it-alone I got scared\nsilly because there's an empty track\nin front of me and no clues as to the\nbraking points anymore. The\nhairpin is usually the slowest bit of\nthe circuit where lots of people\ncongregate to watch - but not for\nme, because I came in un sighted, hitting 12,000 revs in third. I hit the\nbrakes, locked the front, back and\nbuttocks, piled my crotch into the\nfuel tank (ouch), left a40 metre skid\nmark down the track and\nunderpants, stopped just before hay\nbales and managed to peel round the\ncorner much embarrassed but\nwithout the need to trundle back.\nAnother 4 laps of screwed lines and\nstuffed corners followed until we\nwere called in for the half way\ndebrief.\nOnce out on the track again, all\nrational thought goes AWOL as\nsoon as a member of the other\ngroup is spotted ahead. Overtaking\nis simply not permitted; but\ncatching up and looking smug is\nfine! I screwed up a corner horribly\nand let him grab a few metres back,\nbut as soon as I was getting close\nSimon, the instructor, casually\nsailed past and called the guy to one\nside letting us pass him. How did\nhe do that? The instructors are on\nexactly the same machinery as us\n(except that they have mirrors) but\ncan pass any one of us with\nconsummate ease at any point on\nthe circuit. It's a depressing world.\nDuring debriefing we were told\nthat Akio and myself had bags of\naggression but we needed more\nwork on our lines (no -1 don't know\nwhat they are either -Ed) and Mad\nColin was far too much of a lunatic\nand might once or twice have hit the\nright line. Mad Colin (aka Schizo\nScholey) is indeed quite insane. As\nevidence for this - note how high the\nfoot pegs are on a VFR400R (see\npicture). Then be flabbergasted at\nthe fact he was scraping them in\ncorners. But all in all, we three\nwere all pretty close to each other\nin terms of lap speeds. We were,\nSimon said, pretty typical of the\nyoung blok es they get there - the\nolder chaps are good on lines but\nride very timidly.\nI read in MC N recently that\nYamaha are starting a race school\nat Donnington with Rob McElnea,\nbut it costs \u00a3 1 5 0 whilst ours cost\nabout \u00a345 plus travel expenses\nbecause it was a club thing.\nImperial College Union Sporting\nMotorcycle Club meets on\nWednesday lunchtimes at Southside\nupper lounge. Anyone interested in\nbikes, whether they have one or\nnot, is welcome to join us. We help\nbikers (or wannabe bikers) with\ntraining and have sociable pub runs\ntoo when we don't have exams. We\nare lovely people, and not all of us\nare hairy. Next big event is the\nTreasure-Hunt Tear Around!\nBiking at Cadwell\nThis article was heavily edited due\nto its idiosyncratic use of syntax and\nunusual lack of meaning.\nNonetheless, my appreciation goes\nto the ICU Motorbike club for\nbothering to write, something many\nclubs do not, though they should to\nadvertise their presence. But it\nwould be a good idea if the authors\nof these articles would bear in mind\nthat Felix is read by people who do\nnot necessarily understand the\njargon used in their particular\nactivity. Blow-by- blow accounts\nmay be of interest to the author, but\nthey are so boring as to be totally\nunreadable to others. Articles\nshould have a clear purpose - who\nwrote it; who are the people\ninvolved - we don't all know who\nthe nicknames refer to; what club\ndid whatever the article is about;\nwhere they went and what it is they\nwent there to do and who to contact\nif the reader is interested in joining.\nThe use of slang and conversational\nEnglish should be used sparingly as\nit is extremely difficult to read. I suggest that such authors should let\nsomebody outside their immediate\ncircle proof their articles before\nsubmission, because when I do it,\nit has to be quick and brutal -Adam .\n\n"
