Why are science festivals, that\nrun the risk of failing due to the stigma\nscience can have of being boring or too\ncomplex, actually rising in popularity?\nAre people starting to actually enjoy\nscience?\nBuilding on the foundations of\nprevious Imperial Fringe nights and\npreceding Festivals, this year\u2019s festival\nspanned over two days, beginning on\nFriday afternoon and spanning late\ninto Saturday evening.\nAttractions were scattered right\nacross campus, and included guest\nlectures, comedy performances,\nsurgery simulations, and student\nmusical acts. hese were all based\naround the central pivot of the festival,\nthe Research Zone, located inside the\nomnipresent marquee on Queen\u2019s\nLawn. Here the staf and students\nof Imperial presented their current\nresearch and experiments, giving a\nplatform to the work we as a college\nspend our time doing behind closed\nlab doors.\nhere were also lots of opportunities\nfor visitors to gain some hands-on experience themselves, such as\nextracting DNA from strawberries,\nseeing the world through the eyes of\na ly, building edible molecule models,\nor just sit serenely stitching long\nstrings of blood vessels.\nA Pop-Up Surgery, based in SAF,\nwas hosted by the fantastically named\nDr Roger Kneebone. It featured an\noperating theatre complete with\na realistic patient on the surgical\ntable, and also boasted \u201ccutting\nedge\u201d technology \u2013 a scalpel that can\ndetect cancerous tissues as it cuts\ninto them. Meanwhile, Dr Sujata\nKundu, Imperial alumnus and cocktail\nconnoisseur, explained the chemistry\nbehind alcoholic concoctions, with\nfree samples available for the adults of\nthe audience.\nSmaller attractions included a\nDance Tent featuring belly dancers\nand student performances, such as\nFunkology, and a Workshop tent\nprimarily for the younger visitors.\nhere were also campus tours of\nCollege\u2019s own laboratories, robotic\ncentres and even our resident light\nsimulator. Tours proved to be very\npopular, with slots being fully booked\nwithin two hours of the festival\nopening.\nAppropriately, some of Imperial\u2019s\nhumanities students (a very rare breed\nof students), those studying science\nCommunication, also got involved\nwith the festival, many presenting their\nprojects for the public to see. hese\nincluded Project Uproot, a grassroots\ninitiative hoping to get more people\ninterested in environmentalism and\necology, who succeeded in re-homing\nover one hundred re-potted plants.\nOver the past two years, visitors\nhave attended in their thousands,\nand this year was no exception.\nAlthough one visitor explained that\nthey attend each year to catch up on\nthe research of one group of scientists\nand see how their work is developing,\nmany other visitors simply came to\nenjoy wandering about between the\nattractions at their own pace.\nMany said the festival had a pleasant\natmosphere, that they enjoyed their\ntime looking around campus and said\nit actually felt almost like a festival\n\u2013 with the farmer\u2019s market, music\nand (mostly) undisturbed sunshine\ncontributing to a leisurely day spent\non campus (for a change). So could\nit be that the festival was indeed a\nsuccess?\nImperial Festival is just one branch\nof the growing movement that is the\npublic engagement of science, an\nincreasingly important priority for\nanyone involved in science in any way,\nshape or form.\nWith it being only recently that\nthe government has acknowledged\nthat science communication is more\nbeneicial when it is interactive\nbetween scientists and the general\npopulation, as opposed to one-directional, much more efort has\nbeen put into engagement events like\nthese.\nhese sort of events aim to start a\ndialogue about science, and blur the\nlines between the scientists in the lab\nand the public that their work can\nultimately efect, hopefully leading to\nboth groups inluencing and shaping\nthe work and opinions of the other.\nHowever, just like the Imperial\nFestival, public engagement of science\nis very much in its infancy. Some\n\u201cpublic engagement\u201d endeavours\ncan be rather circular in nature, with\nenthusiastic scientists preaching (or\nrather, communicating) to the choir\nof equally enthusiastic science fans,\nand not really interacting with a wider,\nmore diverse audience.\nSuch a trap is easy to fall into\nconsidering students at Imperial\nare already pretty committed to\nscience, and don\u2019t need a whole\nfestival, blocking the library entrance,\nto reinforce that. Some certainly\ndon\u2019t need encouragement during\nthe intense revision season when\nrelationships between students and\ntheir subjects are almost at breaking\npoint.\nIn fact, many in attendance, such\nas some of the older alumni, actually\nbrought excited, attentive children.\nWith such a varied range of attractions\non ofer, it is more than likely it did\nmake a lasting impact in some way,\nat least on the younger generation if\nnot those who are already committed\nscience advocates.\nHowever, the aims of public\nengagement with science is not\nto make more people want to be\nscientists, or even want to study at\nImperial (this may require more than\na weekend festival). It is ultimately to\nmake what is perceived to be \u201cscience\u201d\nmore accessible to those not directly\nin contact with it, and for science to\nit almost seamlessly into the wider\nsociety as a whole.\nhese events therefore don\u2019t act in\nisolation, but are contributing as a\nwhole to a potential cultural paradigm\nshift, where science isn\u2019t seen separate\nanymore to the wider society but\ncomplementary to it, and something\npeople will be willing to discuss and\nlearn about more frequently.\nHopefully, the Festival left both\nthose visiting and those hosting the\nfestival thinking about how science\nisn\u2019t as abstract and alien a concept\nas some perceive it to be, and no\ndoubt has set the stage for even more\nimpressive public engagement feats in\nthe future.\nIf not, it at least provided a welcome\nrevision break from those studying\nscience in the library to have a glimpse\nat science in action in the wider world.\nLEtIzIA DIAMANtE\nLEtIzIA DIAMANtE\n\n"

As I\napproached him and asked if he\u2019d\nlike to be featured in Felix, he\nseemed shy, yet lattered and eager\nto tell me about his style, and the\nfact that he own 20 pairs of shoes!\nImpressive for a man of Imperial.\nWhen I asked Jack where he got his\nfashion inspiration from, he replied\n\u2018I just wear things I like.\u2019 After\nsome thought, his friend mentions\nthat he is \u2018super preppy.\u2019 hat\u2019s\ndebateable. Jack tells me he loves\nto shop at Reiss and Zara, staple\nbrands for those who embrace the\nsmart casual look. Jack doesn\u2019t have\nany fashion icons (smells like lies, I\nbet he wishes he was Ryan Gosling),\nand he describes\nhis style as unconventional.\nSo the big question is, where did he\nget his threads from?\nRed scarf: United Colours of\nBenetton\nShoes: Barkers\nSocks (he got excited about his\nsocks): Marks and Spencer\nKnitted trousers: Zara\nWatch: Emporio Armani\nT-shirt: Zara (he thinks, but he told\nme he was too shy to take it of and\ncheck.)\nAs I thank him and make my way\nback to my table, he calls me and\nsays \u2018actually, can you add quirky\nto my style description?\u2019 So there\nyou have it, Jack Parkinson is THE\nunconventional quirk.\nI couldn\u2019t have put it better myself.\nNaisaZakariaisamastersstudentat\nImperial\u2019s business school, studying\ninnovation, entrepreneurship and\nmanagement (what a mouthful!)\nI spotted her on a sunny day in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens. She was with her\nbusiness school team and I simply\nhad to have her in this spread. She\nbeamed when I asked her if she\u2019d\nlike her picture in an article about\nImperial\u2019s best dressed.\nAs she stood up for the picture, my\nbrother, Guillaume Borkhataria,\non her course and team, told her\nhow to pose so that the picture\nwould look \u2018just right.\u2019 A degree in\nilm production does make you a\nperfectionist when it comes to these\nthings, but the pose is just fabulous,\nand isn\u2019t her smile infectious?\nNaisa doesn\u2019t get her fashion\ninspiration from any place in\nparticular, for her, its innate.\nMassimo Dutti and Burberry are\namongst her favourtire brands. She\ndescribes her dress sense as \u2018boyish,\nclassic chic.\u2019 Her choice of beige\nhues is indeed very chic.

When I asked homas\nwhere he gets his inspiration from,\nhe told me that he has no icons or\nspeciic sources of inspiration, he\n\u2018deines himself\u2019 and his own style.\nHe would describe his style as \u2018East\nLondon meets West london.\u2019\nHe likes to incorporate chic polished\ncoats and accessories with trainers\nand other eccentric shoes like silver\nsandals. His silver sandals are so\nlashythatheevengotcomplemented\nby one of the guys from the mormon\nchurch on exhibition road! You know\nyou\u2019ve got style when even the suited\nmissionaries of Christ are checking\nyou out.\nHe has no favourite designers in\nparticular, and generally shuns the\nmainstream fashion world in favour\nof lesser known creative individuals.\nTom prefers to dress himself in\nclothes from hidden gem designers,\nthose that are still emerging in the\nfashion world. For everyday basics\nthough, he swears by Cos.\nhe clothes he\u2019s wearing in this\npicture are from an eclectic mix of\nhigh street and designer brands.\nShoes: Superga\nCoat: Ermenegildo Zegna\nCigarette holder (which oh-so\nfabulously pulls together the look):\nHarrods\nSunglasses: Benjamin eyewear\nSocks: asos\nAs I show Tom the pictures, he\ninsists that I pick this one because\nit \u2018captures his best side\u2019 and the\nall-important cigarette holder.

Oh, and there\u2019s\nCricket as well... and Cross-Country...\nIC once again brought home the\nbacon at BUCS regatta, capturing the\nMen\u2019s Victor Ludorum and inishing\n2nd in the medals table over the three\ndays and inishing with the most\nBUCS points of any university in the\ncountry (again) despite the absence\nof big lad Henry \u2018gully\u2019 Gooder and\ntoken chopper Ben Spencer-Jones.\nhe big BUCS extravaganza began\nas always after half the squad had just\ninished their exams and the other\nhalf were beginning the next week.\nOnly one thing was on everyone\u2019s\nmind \u2013 knocking Durham of the top\nof the overall victor ludorum. Not to\nwin it for themselves but just to ruin\nany foundation to Durham\u2019s claim\nthat they are \u2018he most successful\nundergraduate rowing programme in\nthe country\u2019 (lol good one lads).\nhe trip began with a convoy of 3\nminibuses illed with mens squad,\nwomens squad and novice women\nand after an (for once) entirely\nuneventful journey, which required\nsome big tunes and large amounts of\nFrench abuse to drivers Paul Jones and\nFabien Evrard to liven things up a bit,\nwe arrived late on Friday evening in\nNottingham.\nDay 1\nEvery morning saw an unnecessarily\nearly start for everyone with time\ntrials starting at 8am, but especially\nfor IC\u2019s not-so-big lads who had to\nweigh in at 6am, the only upside\nbeing Stu Whitelaw had actually tried\nbooking rooms for 50 people over 2\ndays in advance, rather than being\nsurprised at there being nowhere\navailable to stay near Nottingham (as\nhappened last year when there was\nsome big event in Nottingham which\nevery University in the country was\ngoing to or something). Anyway, again\neverything somehow went to plan.\nhe irst medals of the weekend\ncame in the lightweight singles. In\nthe Intermediate lightweight single\ninal, despite having a gentleman\u2019s\nagreement to save their legs for the\nlightweight 4, Myles Holborough\nsaw red and sped of in front of Le\nCaptain Paul Jones, taking the silver\nmedal, whilst Paul cruised to 5th\nplace, putting in a cheeky sprint to\novertake an Irish guy who had blown\nout of his tree. his was followed by\na bronze medal for Wilf Kimberley in\nthe Champ light single.\nBig dogs Mel Wilson and Michelle\nVezie brought home the irst medal\nfor the women, capturing the bronze\nmedal in the champ women\u2019s pairs.\nhis was followed by Jade \u2018Chubba\u2019\nHubbard and Nicola Mason, who did\nwell to inish 6th in the inal of a savage\nchamp lightweight doubles event.\nNewbie Sorcha Cotter began\nthe irst of a series of phenomenal\nbeginners\u2019 results for the weekend,\njust the wrong side of a 3-way tussle\nfor bronze, inishing 5th, and 51\nseconds behind a Cambridge girl who\nwas deinitely not a beginner. She\nwas followed later by the ruddy lads\nmen\u2019s beginner four (Shobi Grinstead,\nJuha Leppanen, Nico Lautard, Giles\nMortimer & cox Lucy Osbourn who\nwent in hard and were leading until\nthe 1500m mark where they just didn\u2019t\nquite have the power to hold on. Big\n2 man Juha Leppanen can only be\ndescribed as blowing out of his ring\npiece, with some unbelievable tekkers\nin the 100m.\nhe irst of the weekend\u2019s golds\ncame from the men\u2019s lightweight 4\n(Paul Jones, Myles Holborough, Wilf\nKimberley & Tim Richards), who\nsuccessfully defended their title for\nthe 5th year running. his year saw\nnot only an IC/UL showdown, but\nalso a showdown between brothers,\nwith Tim Richard\u2019s younger brother\nJames Richards stroking the UL boat.\nhis race showed Tim to be the better\nbrother, as IC cruised through a fast\nstarting UL to take the gold.\nhe second of Saturday\u2019s big lad gold\nmedals came from the women\u2019s champ\n4 of Mel Wilson, Michelle Vezie, Isa\nvon Loggia, and powerhouse Lily\nBeadle. Despite being 2 seconds down\nof the start on some large UEL girls\nfrom Texas, the girls ploughed back\nthrough to snatch the gold by a second\n(it would probably have been like 10 if\nIsa wasn\u2019t a UL chopper).\nhe inal race on Saturday was the\nblue ribboned event, the men\u2019s 8. In\nthe semi-inals, the lads had stormed\nthrough UL to take 2nd place and\nlooked to be in the hunt for the\nmedals. Unfortunately UL had clearly\nbeen saving themselves and had a\nstorming inish to take the bronze\nmedal, pushing IC back in to 4th place.\nDay 2\nSaturday evening saw a blow to our\nVL eforts with illness striking down\nMVP Mel Wilson and Lidia Cammack.\nOn top of this, fat lad Harry Mayne\nhad seen a good bulking opportunity\non inding Mr Halls\u2019 barbecue,\nweighing in at a solid 75kg back at\nthe hotel. his called for some serious\nsweating down, with Harry adopting\nthe Dan Powell 4am makeshift sauna\ntechnique. With only seconds to spare,\nthe men\u2019s lightweight 8 managed to\nweigh in and inally get some food in.\nhis clearly didn\u2019t even phase Mr\nMayne as the lightweight 8 (Fabien\nEvrard, Harry Mayne, Nico Lautard,\nRomain Barnoud, Paul Jones, Myles\nHolborough, Wilf Kimberley, Tim\nRichards & cox Ellie Smith) brought\nhome the irst of a gluttony of silver\nmedals, just losing out to UL who\nwere deinitely entered in the right\nevent and had deinitely not bent the\nrules (rules are made to be broken\nright?). Kimberley & Richards still\ncouldn\u2019t quite crack the light double\nand took the silver medal.\nhere was a tussle for the bronze\nmedal between two IC girls in the\nintermediate singles - Michelle Vezie\nand Isa von Loggia. Despite a big\ninish from Isa, Michelle just managed\nto hold on to the bronze. Imagine the\nplaces she could go if she actually\nrowed at IC.\nhe two big results of the day\nhowever came in the intermediate\nmens double and the Beginner mens\n8. Ben homas pulled Harry Mayne\nalong to a big 1st half, getting 5\nseconds up on the rest of the ield and\ntrucked to victory, bringing home the\nonly gold of the day.\nWords can\u2019t really do justice to\nhow big the beginner men went\nthis weekend. he men\u2019s 8 (Aris\nAristodemou, Nicholas Robertson,\nRob Mcpherson, Nico Lautard, Shobi\nGrinsted, Juha Leppanen, Tom Peake,\nE-Jazz Ahamadeen and cox Lucy\nOsbourn) brought home the silver\nmedal, missing out on a gold by only\n0.66 seconds. Bear in mind that in the\nlast few years, the D-inal was a decent\nresult. here were a number of other\nstrong results with the men\u2019s coxed 4\ninishing 4th, and the women\u2019s 8 and\nlight 4- inishing 6th.\nDay 3\nSo as we got up at the crack of\ndawn once more, the mood was a bit\nmelancholy - it appeared the overall\nVL trophy was beyond us. However\nthere was some light at the end of the\ntunnel as IC lead the contest for the\nmen\u2019s team championship over UL\nby just a handful of points (the trophy\nfor this was bigger than the VL trophy\nanyway) and the Monday events\nlooked like they were in our favour.\nhe biggest morale boost of the day\ncame from an event IC is starting to\nhave a bit of a tradition in \u2013 the men\u2019s\nbeginner single. Filling some seriously\nbig shoes previously illed by the likes\nof Tom Jones and Paddy Hudson was\nRob McPherson, who also more than\ndoubled his total number of singles\noutings throughout the day. Lifting\nthe rate to 24 for a big inish, Rob\ntook the bronze medal (rumours that\nhe started his massive sprint to the\nline when he saw Yewande Adesida\nwatching from the bank are yet to be\nconirmed). Disaster almost struck 10\nmeters from the inish after a collision\nwith a buoy 10 meters from the line,\nbut McPherson managed to hold\nhimself together and stay upright.\nhe Richards/Kimberley lightweight\ndream team combined once again\nin the lightweight pair. However in\ncontrast to previous year they had\nsome stif competition, inishing 2nd\nto an Edinburgh pair who had beaten\nalso beaten them in the double the\nday before. However, the lads weren\u2019t\ngoing to let themselves get beat at\nsweep. It was nip and tuck all the way\nto the 1500 where the boys put in a\nbig lad push to get half a length up.\nhis proved to be a coup de grace as\nthe Edinburgh bowman blew and got\npulled across 2 lanes, with Kimberley\nblowing 50 metres later.\nAfter a quick walk, rehydrate and a\ncouple of collapses from exhaustion,\nthe pair then went straight in to\nthe lightweight 4x with Paul Jones\nand Myles Holborough to attempt\nto defend their title for the 4th year\nrunning. On seeing everyone getting\ntired, Holborough knew it was time\nfor an inspirational speech. It began\nsomething along the lines of \u201cCome on\nlads we\u2019re gonna f*cking win this one,\nF*ck UL\u201d and was followed by some\nmore expletives that I\u2019m told can\u2019t be\nput in, despite being highly amusing.\nAnyway, the speech clearly worked as\nthe boys led Edinburgh out of the start\nand inished with clear water, with 3rd\nplace 15 seconds behind.\nStepping up to replace Rory Sullivan\nas token club geezer, Ben homas\nteamed up with Tom Jones for the\nmen\u2019s (intermediate) pair. Despite\nTom Jones just getting worse and\nworse down the course, the boys put\nin a DJ Sully style big inish, taking\ndown Newcastle and winning the\nsilver medal behind Queens Belfast.\nOther strong performances came\nwith a bronze medal from Michelle\nVezie and Isa von Loggia in the\nwomen\u2019s champ double, 4th place in\nthe women\u2019s champ coxed 4 (Michelle\nVezie, Isa von Loggia, Lily Beadle\n& Jade Hubbard) and 5th for the\nHubbard/ Mason duo in the light pair.\nA special mention has to go to the\nnovice women, who just missed out\non the inal, and inished 2nd in the B\ninal.\nSo, all in all we inished with the\nmen\u2019s vICtor LADorum trophy, 2nd\nin the medals table and 3rd in the\nwomen\u2019s team trophy and 3rd in the\noverall VL. his of course called for\na big celebration on hursday night,\nwith MVP Seb de Traford ending\nup wandering around in Vauxhall\npretending to a secret agent. I\u2019m\nlooking forward to seeing our new\nsocial sec in action next year. Well\ndone to everyone who raced once\nagain, especially the beginner guys and\ngirl for stepping up to the occasion big\ntime. Our thanks must go to all the\nparents who helped out once again\nand made the annual weekend of hell\nbearable. Cheers then.\ngILES MoRtIMER\nStU WhItELAW\nRowing reaps the rewards at BUCS Regatta\nWilf Kimberley reviews the action as the men bring home the Victor Ludorum trophy, but the College miss out on the overall prize\n\n"
