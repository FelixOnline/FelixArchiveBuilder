    "content": "Music Felix 913 1\n8 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nNine Inch Nails The Pixies\n-Trompe le Monde\nThis band supported Guns N' Roses. I'm also given to believe\nSimon (yes, you know the drill...)\n'Bates' has played their latest single\non Radio One, not that I listen to\nWankspeak, you understand. What\nis most surprising about this band\nis that they bear more relation to,\nsay, Ministry, Front 242 or a well\nfuckin' 'ard Depeche Mode than G N'R. Not that they're any less\nmiffed.\nThe aforementioned single, Head\nlike a Hole is the opening track on\nthis re-released l.p., and is sleek\nand brutal, in fact, a veritable\ncorporate assassin of a song. It's Progenitor is a something of an\nangry man going by the name of\nTrent Reznor, and as a vocal\nanalogy, you might care to imagine\nThe Exorcist with InXS Michael\nHutchence replacing Linda Blair.\nFrom a purr to a growl of synth-hook that's as velvety and elegant\nas it is menacing and aggressive,\nHead like a Hole is pure pop\nbubbling away in a cauldron full of\nmalevolence. Reznor's lyrics and\ndelivery set him firmly in the ivory\ntower prison camp for social misfits\n('The Devil wants to fuck me in the\nback of his car and there's nothing\nquite like the feel of something\nnew'). As a se'er of the world, he\nhardly sports rose-tinted shades, but\nvery occasionally, I get the\nimpression that even he isn't convinced by his vision herein.\nMaybe it's down to the poppy\nquality he' imbues his voice with,\nwhich makes the prospect of Nine\nInch Nails even more alarming than\nPerry Farrell, AI Jourgenson or\neven, god forbid, Jello Biafra.\nAs for the rest of Pretty Hate\nMachine, it's nervy enough; broken\nup rhythms and eerie melodies\nembellish a fine slab of industrial\nfunk to the point where this could\nrightly be considered a very\npromising debut. Terrible Lie is\neminently freaky, as is That's what\nI get, both taking the skeleton of\npunk, coating liberally with highly-polished chrome and taking onboard the gleaming demon of a cyber psychosis. Never is this more\napparent than on the bizarrely\nbeautiful 'Something I can never\nhave'. This is sick, unholy shit, but,\nas Reznor says himself with more\nthan a modicum of pride, ' May beI'm all messed up'. Yeah, right.\nMaybe I am, too.\nDavid\nFor some strange reason about to\nbe recounted, I'm not thinking\nabout The Pixies right now. No, I'm thinking about tw atm usos and\ntheir phallic egocentric it y.I' m thinking about scum-sucking rock\nn' roll virtuosity, notes-per-second\netc. I'm thinking about Jimi Hendrix and the legions of wan kers he unwittingly spawned because\nChapterhouse\n-Mesmerise\nPearl may have been may favorite\ntrack from ' The Scene' as the press\nwould call them, but this comes\nclose third. A massive chunk of\nnoise is mixed with a vocal that\nlurks menacingly below the surface,\nready to pounce on any\nunsuspecting listener.\nIt flows along like lave on a carpet, sticking like glue to anyone\nor anything it can. At stages it\nappears to die, only to re-emerge\nlike, well something that re-emerge ges, full of life and ready for\naction.\nOn the flip is another remix\nwhere they appear to sample\nthemselves (that gets around the\nlegal problems, good thinking) and\nthis time the vocals are definitely\nrelegated to the third division. The pure noise and energy takes over\nand the enjoyment begins. People\nmight complain, 'and where's the\nmusic?', well isn't music al about\nenjoying yourself?\nPebbles\nthey didn't understand what he, and\nwhat rock n' roll, were about. He did. So does Charles ' Black' Francis of The Pixies. Rock n' Roll\nis a primal thing, articulating for the\ninarticulate gut instincts, fear and\nloathing, obviously, desire and\naggression. Rock n' Roll is not\nabout high art, but it is at once\nsurface and symbol (thanks, Oscar).\nWe intellectual is e rock n 'roll at our\nperil.\nSo now, after deftly avoiding the\nobvious, I'm going to talk about the\nPixies. It has been remarked that\nFrancis' interest in the cosmos\namounts to nothing more than\n' Fuck, man. A in' t space huge?'\nwhile heavily stoned. I might\nsuggest it's a little more than that.\n' Boss a nova' was loaded with\nspacey imagery, and ' Trompe...' takes it further. They still use those\nodd rhythmic twists and jerks in\ntheir blunt but effective method of\nengaging the listener, so much so\nthat this synonym y could conceivably metamorphose into a bizarre self-parody, but it has to be\nsaid that there is something\nstylistically heavy rock about\n' Trompe...'.' Velour i a', from 'Bossanova', had a similar power\nchord structure to a lot of these\nsongs, 'Sad Punk' and ' UMass' in\nparticular, but the harsh, punk y jolts\nand Francis' eerily sweet voice\nmaintain their glorious pig-shit thick\nstubborn ess. Their cover of The\nJesus and Mary Chain's 'Head On' flogs the original to death, by the\nway. This is a very cool record, and\none I strongly advocate ownership\nof, but don't kill for it. 'Planet of\nSound' et al, keep Pixies at the top\nof all sharp and bitching pop at the\nmoment, but we all know pop is an\nart form. Thanks again, Oscar. All art is useless.\nDavid\nHAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\n071-823 8968\nWe have a fantastic offer for all you students, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women Check us out !\n10\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "18 October 1991 Felix 913 Music\nChaim Velial: Live?\nI have a strange feeling that this tape\nis a bootleg. Not only amI not\nsurprised by this, I'm actually\nrather proud of it. So there. I personally feel there is something\nrather disquieting about the whole\nethos of little or unknown bands\nplaying live sets consisting entirely\nof cover versions. These days it\ntakes a really extraordinary contribution to even merely add\nsomething to, let alone record the\nThis Picture\ndefinitive version of, ahem, a' classic'. Of those that have\nsucceeded, I can think of three,\nmaybe four, off the top of my head.\nSisters of Mercy's version of Hot\nChocolate's Emma, The Fail 'doing\na job' on The Kinks' Victoria, Nick\nCave's cover of Elvis' In the\nGhetto, and possibly Scott Walker's heartbreaking rendition of Jacques\nBrel's// You Go Away. From what\nI hear, Chaim Velial make a point\nof confusing their audience, sometimes playing sets entirely\noriginal, sometimes just covers. DidI say 'Just Covers'?\nThe vocalist, mysteriously known\nonly as 'Matthew' opens this\nremarkably good recording with a tribute to 'a son of the city', a cover\nof Marc Almond's Mother Fist, it's ornate chamber orchestrations\nreplaced by a lurid haze of dive-bombing guitar and Sadean\nmalevolence. In the background,\nforeground, FUCKING EVERYWHERE, an awesome\nstate of total groove. Even before\nthe sculptured feedback has been\ntwisted 'round on its final axis, the\ndrum box kicks into action for a white noise trip through Madness'\n' Michael Caine' that is truly\nbewildering. Throughout the\nswirling chill of growing then\ndecaying sound are woven choice\npop icons; Primal Scream, Big\nBlack, Prince, Adam & the Ants,\nthe whole spectrum including\nEinsturzende Neubauten and Steely\nDan. Jesus Christ, they even cast a shadow over Sisters of Mercy's Train. With a list like this, I'm occasioned to wonder wherein lies\ntheir sense of the absurd - it's obviously there, it's perfectly\nbloody mischievous, but its location\nis damned difficult, so genuine, so\noften, seem their sentiments - but\nthis is a minor point with which to\ncontradict so massive a performance. Fuck, but I wish I'd been there.\nThis extraordinary show is closed\nwith, and I quote, a homage 'to\nYear Zeros'. Chaim Velial, such a serious 'arty' name, proceed to\nlampoon (and harpoon) the entire\n-world with a razor-sharp, sheet\nmetal maniac of Dead Kennedys'\nHoliday in Cambodia, every one of\nJello Biafra's sneers reinvented with\nan astounding menace. This is a mighty and frightening experience;\nI can't wait to see them.\nDavid Suzanne Vega\n-Tom's Album\nDeep in Manhattan, on Broadway,\nlives a small diner. Tom's. DNA\nopen this album with a remix of Rusted Pipe from the Days Of Open\nHand album, included as a bonus\ntrack. The then follows the original\nversion, plain, sparse, barren,\nadjective, and then this album gets\nseriously warped. A version sung\nin German, a completely unrelated\nrap sung by Nikki D. using the\n\" dep de do dep\" bit skulking\naround the background, and then\nWaiting At The Border which is a quiche pastiche on the subject of the\ngulf war, George Bush and all. It's quite funny. Then there's the first\nlow point, a reggae version. Oh well, turn it over. Italo-house,\nsomething excellent about / Dream\nOf Jeannie. Remember that. No, neither did anyone else in my flat.\nBut I do. It was this 60's series\nabout a genie, and.. .The next track\nis a rap rewrite, and it's quite good\nas far as rap could be. Then there's a Swedish version, mo in s de la\nDNA back beat, and then off to the\nBorderline, for REM's( Bingo)\nHand Job doing a very silly version\nabout nothing, the original instrumental, and DNA's smash,\nwhich is where we started. Too cool\nfor words.\nLise Yates\n-A Violent Impression\nThere is a definite Irish feeling to\nthis record, be it the lilting vocal,\nthe subtle pipes and violin or the\nsoft mellow melodies, anyway you\nlook at it you see a clover leaf. I'm not going to compare them to other\nIrish bands, that's unfair on them\nand on you. This is good mellow\nstuff that occasionally rocks out a little to get your feet tapping and the\nmind racing.\nIt all makes me feel like riding in\na convertible with the roof down\nrolling along a quite country lane,\nthe wind in my hair and not a care\nin the world. It makes you feel\nhappy, jolly and, well there's no\nthesaurus so add a word of your\nown. As for the words, they're\nEnglish and make about as much\nsense as a parrot on speed. As far\nas I can tell the main topic of conversation is love and the general\nill quality of what is available. A typical topic but as they say, 'the\nold ones are still the best'.\nThe guitars mix perfectly with the\nmood, and the light drum in the\nbackground add to the mellow\natmosphere rather than\noverpowering the slower more\nmoody tracks.\nAll good stuff.\nPebbles\nForget-Me-Nots\n-Live at the South Bank Poly\nVoice Of The Beehive play South\nBank poly, shock!! And only a week after nearly playing here.\nDespite our beloved London Transport setting fire to a train at\nElephant and Castle, I found my way to the industrial style bar with\na fine selection of lager. In clouds\nof dry ice out come two girls, who\nI will call Michelle and Eithne,\ninstead of Tracey and Melissa,\nbecause, for the second time in a week, I have a suspicion that this\nis not in fact a pair of West coast\nyankees (in the noose), but instead\nsome Irish people. They bring with\nthem three lads, and sing about\nsupermarkets, and other such things\nin a sweet and lovely way.\nAnd, on record, what are they like\non record? Sweet and lovely, again,\nin a poppy kind of way, and the\nBeehive in them creeps into their\nlyrics. Compare and discuss.\n'There's a man in your bed and he's asking your name' (Forget-me-nots,\nGirl) ' He'll wake up in the morning\nand say, 'who the hell are you?\"( Voice Of The Beehive, I Say\nNothing) But so what if they sound\nsimilar? At least they don't sound\nlike Chapterhouse. Forget-me-nots\nare dreamy and soft, and when\nEithne sings 'Turns my light oh oh\noh on,' I begin to feel that maybe,\njust maybe, this is a truly wonderful\nrecord. Forget-Me-Nots, I think I love you.\nLise Yates\n\u2014 11 \u2014\n\n"

The church court's reasoning was that\nhe behaved in a way 'unbecoming\nto his position', a sort of bringing\nthe game into disrepute I suppose!\nHe comforted his parishioner after\na bereavement in her family, and\ncontinued to give her a serious\ncomforting on a regular basis.\nApparently they were going at it\nlike rabbits for twelve months, and\nyou could say he took the laying on\nof hands a bit too far! Could this\nhave been based on the Gospel of Sexual Healing according to Marvin Gaye?\nWhy amI writing this letter?\nWell in a church in East London the\nlocal vicar publicly pronounced that\nhe is not only gay but also carries\nthe AIDS virus. He says he can't understand why God has given him\nthis disease. We're going to have\nto let him work that one out for\nhimself. But will this geezer be\ncharged with 'bringing the game\ninto disrepute'. I think not.\nThe Rev. Tyler, who was kicked\nout of his family home and given\nthe elbow by the church, must think\nhimself unlucky. Perhaps the\nChristian Union could explain this\nto me, because it seems that if Rev\nTyler had interfered with one of his\nchoir boys, collected funds for the\nIRA or campaigned for the release\nof the 'Renault 5' then he would\nhave been forgiven.\nYours as always,\nAlan Bailey.\nDear Adam,\nI just wanted to enquire about the\nstress you must be under. I suppose\nit must have been stress to call the\nScience Fiction society ' FilmS oc' as\nyou did in 'What'sOn' last Felix.\nYou even left ICS F in the message\nitself.

The cost will be \u00a31 to members who\nhave already seen one of our films\nDear Editor,\nI would wholeheartedly like to\nagree with your proposal to change\nthe name of Felix. Personally, I find\nthe manner of ex-IC students who\nautomatically ask after Felix, as\nthough it were a fixture and fitting\nof college life, painful almost to the\npoint of being patronising. In these\ntimes, when the government is\nrunning the further education\nsystem so liberally, I see little point\nin maintaining such trivial connections with Old Centralians et\nat.\nAs for the new name, try the\nsound of 'the imperial college\nthis year.

Be There!\nO.K. so I suppose you want to\nknow something about it. Well how\ndo these prospects grab you:\n(i) Mugging tourists to find out\nhow many bedrooms there are in\nBuckingham Palace.\n(ii) You and your team building\na human pyramid outside St. Paul's Cathedral.\n(iii) You and your team finding\na pint of Thames water without a pint glass, in London at this hour!\nWell these are all challenges that\nyou may or may not come across\non Saturday's Great Sightseeing\nChallenge. Let me explain further\nThe G. S.S.C. is yet another fun\nday out for all the family (?), but\nof course being Rag, trying to raise\nas much money for charity (in\ntomorrow's case, UNICEF) as\npossible in the process. The aim is\nfor your team- of 4 to 6 (so if you\nhaven't got one together yet do it\nnow) to complete the course in the\ntime permitted, hopefully having\ncollected some money en route.\nThe route will take you around\nabout 9 of London's greatest sights,\nso if you're new in town, or you just\nwant a fun day out come and join\nus. Everybody's welcome (whether\nyou've done any Rag events yet or\nnot). At each sight your team will\nhave the choice of either:\n(i) A Quick Question\n(ii) A Physical Challenge\n(iii) An On-the-Spot Scavenge (as\nabove), only after having completed\none of these can your team be told\nwhere the next sight is. If at any\npoint your team can't fulfil the task\nchosen you can change task, but\nyou will incur a penalty. The team\ncompleting the route with fewest\npenalties are the winners. In the\nevent of a tie (quite likely with\nnearly 50 teams), the winning team\nwill be the one with the highest\namount collected. Easy? Try it!\nThere will be prizes for the top\nfive fresher s only teams (although\nveterans are more than welcome) as\nwell as other prizes for top\ncollectors and our usual incentive\nscheme for the \u2022 amount raised\nduring the year : \u00a350 = Free Mug, \u00a3150 = Free T Shirf and \u00a3300 =\nFree Sweatshirt.

IC students\nare no exception and the Union's welfare office deals with an\nincreasing number of queries on\ntenant's rights each week.\nMost new, private tenancy\nagreements are now either Assumed\nor Assured Shorthold letting s and\nare regulated by the 1988 Housing\nAct which came into effect on 15\nJanuary 1989. Students with\nagreements prior to this date may\nlandlord provided they give at least\ntwo months notice to quit. This also\nmeans that in a tenancy of six\nmonths' duration it is possible for\na landlord to give notice to quit after\nfour months and for this notice to\nexpire at the end of the six month\nperiod. This means that the tenant\nwould have to leave after six\nmonths.\nAlthough the tenant cannot be\nevicted without a court order, if the\nlandlord has served a valid agreement and given correct notice,\nthe court must then evict.\nshortfall. If you find yourself in this\nposition seek advice!\nWhat happens once the fixed\nterm of the AST comes to an end?\nProvided that the landlord doesn't exercise their right to repossess the\nproperty by giving appropriate\nnotice s/ he may then offer you a new A ST, for a further fixed\nperiod. Alternatively, the\nagreement can simply be allowed to\nexpire, creating a periodic A ST. If\nthis happens, a landlord must then\nserve two month's notice of their\nintention to repossess the property.\nFinding your shoe box Stefano Ruis,\nICU Welfare\nAdviser, leads\nyou through the\nac como dati on labyrinth.\nWelfare advice\non ext 3507\n.yes, but it's cheap.

A very high\nproportion of IC students occupy\nproperty in the private rented sector\n(this does not include university,\ncouncil and housing association\naccommodation) and this is a brief\nintroduction to agreements\nregulated by the new Housing Act.\nAssured Shorthold Tenancy\nIt is likely that this will be the most\ncommon type of agreement\nlandlords will ask students to sign.\nA nAST is an agreement which\nallows you to stay in the property\nfor a specified period of time, the\nminimum being six months. In\norder for such an agreement to be\nvalid a landlord must give you a separate sheet of paper stating that\nthe letting is of an Assured Shorthold type before you sign the\nmain lease.\nOnce the period of time specified\nby the agreement is over, the\nproperty can be repossessed by the\nEnding an Assured Shorthold\nTenancy Early\nStudents may wish to leave their\nproperty before the end of the\nminimum six month period. Unless\nthe agreement allows for this or if you are able to agree this with the\nlandlord you will continue to be\nliable for the rent until the expiry\nof the minimum period. If you are\nin this position seek further advice\nfrom the Welfare Office.\nJoint tenants (i.e. more than one\nstudent signing a single agreement\nfor a house or flat) must give notice\njointly, although it is sometimes\npossible to negotiate with the\nlandlord and get someone else in.\nYou should bear in mind, however,\nthat the landlord can maintain the\ncurrent level for the whole property, regardless of the fact that\none person may have moved out.\nFor example, if one of three joint\ntenants leaves, the remaining two\nmay have to increase their share of\nthe rent in order to make up the\nThe tenant, likewise, is also\nrequired to give two month's notice\nof their intention to leave (less\nnotice is required if the landlord\nagrees).\nRent Increases\nOnce the rent is agreed on at the\nbeginning of an A ST the landlord\ncannot raise it. At the end of the\nfixed term, if the agreement\nbecomes a PAST the charge must\nremain at the same level unless the\noriginal contract contained a clause\nallowing the landlord to review the\nrent. Note that if a landlord wishes\nto increase the rent after an A ST has\nexpired and the tenants do not agree\nwith this, the landlord can then gain\npossession of the property by\nsimply giving two months' notice to\nquit.\nIt follows from the above that\nstudents should try, if at all possible\nto sign agreements that suit their\nacademic year and holiday plans. In\npractice, this is rarely possible\nthough!\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

I have seen Drop Dead\nFred twice now, once when I was\nstill in The States, and frankly, the\nsecond time around it is terribly\ntedious. This movie seems to have\nbeen put together as a tool of\nmasturbation for dear old Rik. This\nisn't to say that the movie does not\nhave some extraordinary strokes, as\nit were, of genius, but it does get\na bit tiring after a while. There are\njust so many pelvic thrusts for\nem n has is a viewer can take.\nHaving said this, I would like to\npoint out some of the finer points\nof this otherwise extremely mediocre movie. The supporting\nactors add a decisive edge to the\nfilm. Carrie Fisher, plays the role\nof Best Friend that she perfected in\nWhen Harry Met Sally. Her character is a new age corporate\nlawyer. This is wonderfully expressed when she power walks in\nsearch for her end orphic high with\na cigarette in hand and spouts\n'Visualise! Visualise!' to her dear\nfriend Elizabeth. However, she\ndoes seem to treat Lizzie as a child\nwhen she indulges her 'imagination'\nand tries to strangle Fred, even\nthough he is quite invisible to her.\nAlso a bright spot in this film is her\nchildhood best friend. His acceptance of her head problems\nand even his attempt to join in on\nthe insanity is quite funny.\nThis is definitely a one-time see,\nbut only once, and during the\ndaytime please. I wouldn't want you\nwasting an extra three quid. In fact,\nsee it on video; it should be ready\nfor release in the next month. Rik Mayall can provide a laugh at times,\nalthough these laughs do require the\nintellect of a seven-year old to\ndetect, and the brilliant performances of the supporting\nactors is enough to give you the\nendurance to sit through the film.\nHowever, if you like Rik Mayall, go see it for god's sake - it's made\njust for you!\nJennifer Argabright.\nMichael J. Fox ! Teenage girls !\nFast cars ! Adolescent fantasies a go-go ! Wow, sit back and wait for\nan hour and half of wisecrack in' inimitable fun with the Fox! Actually, it appears that Mikey has gone ADULT and alas, that\nmeans the movie's( wow, what a great word ! movie's! entering new\nuncharted etymological territory\nhere ! Where possessives have no\nmeaning and the apostrophe is the\nenemy of man !) also gone ADuLT and that means, nat ch, that stuff\nabout ReLATioNS h lPS and\nMoTiVATioN and SoUL SeaRCHiNG have entered the\npicture. And the picture is this : The\nFox is a whizz surgeon who's had\nenough of helping the needy and\nworking his butt off and all that\nstuff, so he's off to California to\nearn him some big money on the nip\n' n' tuck market. On his way, he\ncarelessly fails to spot a pair of\ncows in the road (of the bovine\nvariety) and consequently drives his\nPorsche Speedster (fast car ! fast car\n!) into, the local judge's fence. Said\njudge is not too happy and orders\nhim to perform community service\nby way of recompense. While he\ndoes so, gritting his teeth in\nfrustration, he meets a remarkably\nuninhibited local lass, Lou,( Julie\nWarner) and a variety of (very)\nsmall-town folks. His car can't be\nfixed because the locals tend to deal\nin swine rather than pearls, so he\nwhiles away the time trying to lever\nhis way into Lou's pants and having\na few emotional medical sequences.\nIn the end, all comes out happily,\nhe warms to the place, etc. etc.\nThis is a deeply unsurprising\nfilm, but it has enough quirks in it\nto maintain interest; The Fox makes\nthe transition from bubble-gum to\nADULT with a reasonable degree\nof smoothness and generally the\nwhole shebang bubbles along\npleasantly. You wouldn't be\nthrowing your money away.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nThe Rescuers Down Under\nAfter only 14 years Bernard and\nBianca are back in a rip-roaring\nadventure set at the limit of the\nmind's eye's deepest dreams\nimagination. Okay, it's Australia.\nThey' re out to rescue another kid\nwith negligible nose (why do\nDisney kids have negligible noses?)\nwho has been caught by a nasty\npoacher while rescuing fickle\nanimals. Pretty obviously, if you\nsaw the previous tale, the poacher\nneeds the child to get the treasure\n(flipping huge eagle). Rather than\ncrocodiles there is a goanna lizard\nwho provides slapstick aplenty in a menacing manner and the usual\nbunch of amiable verbose marsupials. The albatross is back\n(well his brother) and the romance\nbetween lead mice is aflame. This\nmay sound rather like the first\nmovie, and some of it gives\nuncanny deja-vu, but there is a new\naction tilt. Possibly too much\naction, with the brat coming so\nclose to death that he could read the\nlabel on the reapers pants, and even\nthe emergence of Bernard as a macho he mouse. A lot of sequences can be seen to be\ncomputer designed with smooth\nflowing action to immense precision. The animation is very\ngood (but not up to Little Mermaid\nstandards) and some of the voices\nare well chosen. Bob Newhart gives\nvoice to Bernard, Eva Gabor to\nBianca, John Candy to Wilbur the\nalbatross, George C. Scott to\nMcL each the poacher and Tristan\nRogers to Jake the kangaroo mouse.\nJake has the only realistic Australian accent in the film and\nsome of the accents really have to\nbe heard.\nIt's great. Really great. Super\nsmashing lovely. Bit short, but\nreally great.\nThe Amazing Machine\n\n"

    "content": "The Imperial College Careers Fair\na 'clearly well\nplanned' success\nAn estimated 5,500 students\nattended this year's careers fair\naccording to its manager, Jeremy\nBurnell. About70 companies\nattended the fair which was held in\na marquee last Tuesday and\nWednesday on the Queen's Law n.Mr Burnell expressed his opinion\nthat the companies were actually\nrecruiting rather than simply giving\na public relations display. He added\nthat in his view 'the fair was far\nsuperior to last year' when there\nwas a large amount of d is organisation preceding the event.\nThe representative for Price\nWaterhouse commented that the fair\nwas 'clearly well planned'. Procter\nand Gamble said that it was a 'well\norganised event' and Mark Emery of Rolls Royce claimed that the\nwhole show was 'very busy and\nvery impressive'. British Telecom,\nwho are presently seeking to recruit\nabout 500 graduates, described the\nstudents attending as ' above average' while Harbinder Dhaliwal\nof Logic a said that 'the standard of\nstudents is very, very high... they\nare of a very high calibre'. She\nadded that of the 139 graduates\nrecruited last year, 20 were taken\nfrom Imperial College, which was\nmore than any other establishment,\nincluding Oxford, Cambridge, King's College and University\nCollege.\nSome companies' representatives\nexpressed disappointment with\nstudents. Among these were\nBanque Indosuez who felt students\nlacked personality when compared\nto last years eager job hunters. They\ndescribed the graduates that they\nwere looking for as having 'a pleasing personality, a sense of\nhumour and the ability to look one\nin the eye' while Bill Henderson\nfrom Albright and Wilson Ltd. said\nthat 'most students were average;\nthere weren't many outstanding\nones.' Many companies, including\nNational Physical Laboratories,\nsaid that they were 'looking for\nsomebody with a bit of spark'.\nBill Fox of Imperial College's Careers Advisory Service stated\nthat despite the recession and the\nlower number of companies attending in comparison with the\nlast fair, there were some companies offering 'quite a few\nmore vacancies than last year'. He\nadded that the prospects for\nengineering and physical science\nstudents were 'a little more optimistic than I expected' and that\nvery few students from outside the\ncollege attended the fair. Mr. Fox\nclaimed that he could 'tell the\ndifference between a student from\noutside the college and an I.C. student by their hair and clothes, or\nrather lack of.'\nHolbein Slammed\nOccupants of Holbein House are\ncomplaining of its state of repair.\nThey say that desks and chairs are\nwobbly and falling apart, wallpaper\nis peeling off the walls, study lamps\nare broken and wardrobe doors fall\noff. A Holbein postgraduate told\nFelix that 'we are expected to live\nlike squatters'. Jeremy Greenwood,\na sub warden in Holbein, said that\nthe conditions make studying very\ndifficult.\nSixty students live in Holbein,\nwhich is a College owned student\nresidence in Evelyn Gardens,\nincluding many mature students and\npostgraduates. The College plans to\nclose the Hall at Easter until next\nsession for renovation. The warden\nof Holbein, Dr Toumazou, was\nunavailable for comment, but Mr Greenwood informed Felix that two\nof the five showers were out of\norder because they leak into the\nrooms below. One of these was\nreported to College at the start of the summer and the other at the start\nof term. One of the rooms below\nhas been closed so the shower above\ncan be used. He said that workmen\nclosed a shower last week, but have\nsince made no attempt to work on it.\nThe Hall has four ovens and a non-functional microwave. Mr Greenwood said that three\nmicrowaves were ordered at the\nstart of term with a promise from\nCollege Estates to supply them in\na week. Mr Graham Daniels,\nResidences Area Manager told\nFelix that a single microwave and\na fridge arrived yesterday.\nHolbein residents pay \u00a340 per\nweek, the same as other similarly\nsized rooms in Evelyn Gardens. Mr Greenwood said T don't blame\nanyone for complaining' as the Hall\nis 'generally shabby' and Mr Daniels said that he is considering\nHolbein a priority and will be\ninitiating a project to 'rectify major\nfaults in showers' throughout\nCollege but admitted that 'faults\ncannot be rectified overnight'. He promised to deliver new appliances\nhimself as staff were unavailable.\n\n"

Jonathan Griffiths, ICU Deputy President, has been\napproached by members of the\nAfro-Caribbean Society who have\nasked him to lift the two year old\nban.\nThe Bar sub-committee stopped\nthe society from using licensed\nareas of the Union as the society's events 'attracted considerable\nattention from the police.' Mr Griffiths suggested that the Society\nheld some events in non-licensed\nareas in order to show good intent\nbefore appealing to the Bar subcommittee to lift the ban. As it\nstands, the ban extends to all college\nrooms.\nEqual\nOpportunities\nImperial College is to start\nimplementing its Equal Opportunities Programme. After an\n18 month discussion period, Caroline Fox, Director of Personnel\nand Administrative services, has\npublished a document stating the\ncollege's policy on advertising job\nvacancies and interviewing procedure. A monitoring group and\ntraining programme for staff are\nalso being arranged.\nRob Let ham, Manpower Planning Manager, told Felix that\n'we want to show we care about the\npeople we employ'. He said that he\nhad no information about how the\nprogramme was being implemented\nbut that he expected feedback by\nNovember. He declined to\ncomment on the cost as he\nexplained that it was an ongoing\nexercise.\nDisturbance\nThe Police were called to the Union\nBar on Wednesday night after a serious disturbance in which a second year Chemical Engineering\nstudent entered and attempted to\nassault students and staff.\nThe student threatened Steve\nFarrant, ICU Hon Sec, who in turn\nthreatened to ban him from the\nUnion Building. The student started\nrandomly attacking people in the\nbar, at which point college security\nwere called. They referred the\ndisturbance to the Bar Manager who\nthen called the Police.\nNobel Prize\nThe Nobel Prize for Physics has\nbeen won by Pierre-Gilles de\nGennes of Paris for his work on\nliquid crystals. The prize for\nChemistry was won by Richard\nErnst of Switzerland for his work\non Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.\nOxford Uni\nhaul into 20thC Professor Richard Southwood, one\ntime professor at IC and now Vice Chancellor of Oxford University, is\nre-vamping their old collegiate\nsystem to prepare it for a more\nmarket based system. He hopes to\nraise more than \u00a3300 million to try\nand compete with American Universities like Harvard.\nProfessor South wood is\nattempting to make sexual\nharassment an offence in the\nUniversity. In order to come into\nline with regulations about staff\nharassment of students, students\nthemselves can now be disciplined\nfor abuse of other members of the\nUniversity.

The box had been left\nin an unlocked drawer in an\nunattended office. Terry Briley of\nthe security office told Felix that\npeople should 'not leave anything\nunattended even for a short period\nof time.'\nAn attempt was made to steal a brand new Ford Sierra from the car\npark during working hours on\nTuesday. The thief opened the\nbonnet to change the fuses but\n'made a bit of a bod ge' and was\ntherefore unsuccessful.

There was so\nmuch enthusiasm among all the\nstudents that the day went\nexceptionally well.\nAbout 280 students took part in\nthe actual game of Monopoly, but\nthe collecting began at midnight on\nSaturday, with 38 students heading\nfor Leicester Square, to collect from\nthe people leaving the cinemas and\nclubs. This went well and at about\nMany of the students arrived to\nregister in fancy dress of varying\ndegrees of silliness and there was\neven a team of eight excellent\nsingers who sang for money and\ntreasure. Every team had a name,\nand these were fairly unusual at\ntimes. Quoting Will Stallard, the\nRag secretary: 'I had to go into the\nlounge bar and shout for teams to\nstart counting their money. Things\nstarted to get ridiculous when I had\nto shout for OG2 Sex Kitchen. It\nRags to riches\nLeading r aggies, Beccy Land and\nMarc Ellis\na.k.a. the mute\nswan on\nMonopoly. So\nfar Monopoly\nhas raised\n\u00a38,300.\n4 am the group headed for\nSmithfield Market. Unfortunately,\nwhen they arrived, they found that\nit was shut until Monday. They then\ndecided to make their way to New Covent Garden Market. Five people\nwent by taxi and the rest made their\nway by tube. Some decided that\nthey would head back and get some\nsleep before Monopoly, and the rest\nwent to either the Elephant and\nCastle or to Portobello Road\nMarket. Everyone was back at\ncollege by 10 am to take part in the\nMonopoly, most without having\nhad any sleep.\ntook three attempts before I got a reply out of them.'\nNearly everyone attempted the\nMonopoly clues (which some said\nwere too difficult), and everyone\nmanaged to collect some money\nalong the way. A lot of people have\nnow raised enough money for a Rag\nmug, and a few have even collected\nenough for a Rag T shirt.\nMost of the treasure acquired was\ndone so legally, which made a pleasant change from previous\nyears. Some of it was quite\nspectacular. The items collected\nranged from the inevitable traffic\ncones to restaurant menus to posters\nfrom video and record stores to the\nultimate - the offer of a free disco\nfor Rag from a traffic warden. A fair amount of treasure relating to\npenguins was also brought back, to\nthe delight of our currently voiceless Rag chairman.\nMencap organised a party at\nKing's College (King's Road) for\neveryone who collected for the day,\nwhich included students from many\nother Rags around the country.\nQuite a few IC students went and,\napart from the expensive food and\ndrink, it was an excellent evening.\nThe winning team was The Superteam which consisted of Nick Allen, Pete Bowen, Tams in Braisher, A led Fenner, Martin\nHeighway and Demi Jones. They were all part of the group collecting\nthrough the night.\nThe final total raised last Saturday\nwas an amazing \u00a38,290.72, which\nalmost doubled the amount raised\nat last year's Monopoly. This,\ncombined with the money raised at\nthe Tiddlywinking and the Rag\nCloakrooms during Fresher s' Week, means that Rag has raised\nover \u00a311,000 in only two weeks.\nThis is a third of the final total for\nlast year. At this rate, Rag is going\nto be unbelievably huge this year -keep up the good work.\nHiya, it's Penguin the RAG Chairman here again. RAG, for\nthose of you who still haven't come\nacross it this late into term, is\nbasically students raising money for\ncharity in the most fun way possible\n('cause it's easier to raise money\nthat way). We do it exceptionally\nwell at I.C., but this year has far\nexceeded anyone's expectations.\nWith only two events gone we're\nalready almost a third of our way\nto last years overall total! As well\nas that, this year we have more\npeople involved than ever before\nand the fun atmosphere associated\nwith it is second to none!\nLast Saturday was Live MONOPOLY, at which we raised\na staggering \u00a38,290.72, an amount\nthat I owe entirely to those who took\npart. Everyone who participated,\neven those who participated a small\namount had a brilliant day, which\nis good because it means that I'm doing my job properly.\nRight, down to business. Seeing\nas you're reading this during\nFriday's lectures (like everyone else\nin college) that means that there is\nnow less than 24 hours until the\nthird massive Rag event of term: it's this Saturday (19th Oct) and there's going to be literally hundreds taking\npart (although that doesn't mean we\ndon't want more).

If you\nare in this position, seek advice.\nExpiry of FT AT Some agreements may stipulate\nwhat will happen to the contract\nonce the fixed term expires. If this\nis not specified, the tenant will then\nbecome a Statutory Assured Tenant. A landlord may then only\nrepossess the property by court\norder and must, in any case give\nnotice (usually two months). A court can only grant possession\nback to a landlord if they are\nsatisfied that a particular ground (or\ngrounds) for possession exists. The\ngrounds for possession are\nstipulated in the Housing Act and\nfurther information on these can be\nobtained from the Union's Welfare\nOffice.\nDeposits\nMost landlords will charge tenants\na deposit in order to indemnify\nthemselves against unreasonable\ncosts arising when tenants leave the\nproperty. On some occasions\nlandlords will try to deduct money\nfrom deposits or even fail to\nreimburse them for no good reason.\nWhen paying a deposit you should\nobtain a receipt from the landlord\nwhich also stipulates exactly what\nthe money is for. In order to protect\nyourself from possible future\nproblems regarding this it is a good\nidea to follow the procedure\noutlined in section two of the ICU Housing Rights Pack.

Schlum Companies Have It\nSooner or later, engineering graduates have to make a decision whether to stay close to the technology that\nfascinates them and in which they have excelled so far, or whether to move out into management-style functions\nwhich are perceived - often quite rightly - to be the most effective way up to the top.\nIn Schlumberger you don't have to face such black-and-white decisions.\nSchlumberger operates a policy of promotion from within which means that all the senior managers (and we are\ntalking about all the way to the chairman) have come up from the graduate engineer level. While providing\nunsurpassed management opportunities for young engineers, our system of career development also means that\nemployees are not pigeon-holed or likely to experience one-way tickets into support functions. A typical career\nin Schlumberger will lead in and out of technical, management and support roles, broadening experience,\nproviding a unique variety and building the strongest corporate management potential of tomorrow.\nAnd while we are looking for the potential in our recruits to benefit from this philosophy, we do not compromise\non engineering expertise.
