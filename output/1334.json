I found it hard settling in\nas the people in my halls do not\nunderstand me. I am finding\nthe workload challenging and\nfeel there is no-one to turn to.\nI\u2019m seriously thinking of leaving\nImperial tomorrow, but do you\nthink I should stick it out at least\nuntil the end of the term?\nTroubled Fresher\nDear Troubled fresher,\nI totally sympathise but life isn\u2019t all\nthat bad and things could be much\nmuch worse. Just take a look at the\nheadlines in the newspapers every\nmorning and you\u2019ll start thanking\ngod that you\u2019ve ended up in\nuniversity in the first place!! Uni is\nreally different from everything that\nyou\u2019ve known before, so adjusting\nis hard. Now I realise that physics\nisn\u2019t easy and that their parties\nhave been so boring in the past that\npeople have resorted to reading the\nbooks in the room, (why you\u2019d put\nyourself through that torture\u2026\u2026)\nbut there are good mates to be\nmade, you just have to find them.\nLatching on to a 2nd/3rd year and\nbegging for revision notes has also\nbeen known to work in the past. You\nseem to have just been unlucky in\nyour halls, but if you hold out for\njust that little bit longer things will\nget better. Try getting that little bit\nmore involved Spend your nights\nin the common room, or down the\npub with halls people, give them a\nchance to know you, They\u2019ll accept\nyou, unless of course you do choose\nto start attacking them with a chain\nsaw, that is just never going to be\nsocially acceptable. The great thing\nabout uni is that there is such a big\nmix of people and everyone is so\ndifferent, maybe you just haven\u2019t\nfound your clique yet? I mean to be\nhonest IC isn\u2019t really a normal uni,\nit\u2019s not what you expect, and we are\nall that little bit different but there\nis still fun to be had. Hold out for\njust that little bit longer, and see\nwhere life takes you. Remember\ngoing home is going backwards and\nthere\u2019s so much to look forward\nto\u2026\nHow to get a girl in 10 steps...\nDear Miss Confidentiality,\nI told my Chinese classmate that\nI was cooking for her, so I invited\nher at my place next Saturday. I\u2019ve\nalready set the menu according\nto her preferences but the problem\nis that there is no living room\nin my flat and we must have\ndinner in my room. I don\u2019t want\nto intimidate her, but I\u2019ve fallen\nfor her and I\u2019d like the dinner to\nbe intimate. It\u2019s my first \u201cdinner\ndate\u201d, so I\u2019m pretty nervous and\ndon\u2019t know what to do. Any advice?\nFeeling Nervous\nDear Feeling Nervous,\nTo start with, take a deep breath,\nIN! Hold, OUT! Feel better?\nNow I\u2019m not going to give you the\nstep by step guide on how to get\na girl into bed, but I will give you\nsome advice. Firstly don\u2019t stress\ntoo much about the whole having\nto eat in your room scenario, not\neveryone has lounges. Now I get\nthat you really like this girl, and\nwant everything to go perfectly, but\ntake things slowly and stay relaxed,\nIf you over plan she\u2019ll think it\u2019s\ncontrived and may get the wrong\nidea, thinking that you\u2019re a creep.\nNow I know you want to show her\nthat you\u2019ve been looking forward\nto tonight, and you already have by\ncooking her something that you\u2019ll\nknow she\u2019ll like, now chill!! If you\npush her too fast you\u2019ll scare her\naway, and that the last thing you\nwant to do. Make the evening light\nhearted. Be charming and funny,\nand if you can\u2019t manage that, then\njust be the person she agreed to go\nout on a date with, that who she\u2019ll\nwant anyway. Just take it slowly\nand show her that its\u2019 her you care\nabout, not a roll between the sheets,\nthat\u2019s your best bet! Good luck and\nsave me some dessert!\nWhat goes around comes around!\nDear Miss C,\nI no longer go out of my way to run\nover little dogs or cats with my\nbike, I don\u2019t fart in crowded lifts\nbefore I get out, & have stopped\nmaking prank phone calls. So, my\nquestion is: how does this whole\nKarma thing work? I\u2019ve been\nreally good for a couple of weeks\nnow, and it\u2019s been agony! When\ndo we start seeing some payback?\nSeriously, I\u2019m beginning to have\nmy doubts if it really exists!?\nDes Tiny\nDear Des Tiny,\nWhat do you mean you go out of\nyou way to avoid running over little\ndogs? What kind of a sick freak are\nyou? You\u2019re asking when you\u2019ll get\nsome payback? Well I think fate\u2019s\nbeing kind enough! Let me clear\nthis up for you, karma is about\nthings happening when you least\nexpect it! Being nice to some poor\ninnocent animals and not subjecting\nthe rest of the world to your\nrepulsive bodily odours then buying\na lottery ticket hoping it\u2019ll pay off\nwon\u2019t work. You may have a cleaner\naura and so girls will no longer see\nyou and run away screaming, but I\nwouldn\u2019t hold my breath. What goes\naround come around? It seems to\nme that you have a lot of bad thing\nto pay off before anything good is\ngoing to happen! If you\u2019re finding it\nthat much agony though, my advice,\ndig a big big hole and jump in! Stay\nthere until you see some sense,\nthen you can rejoin humanity!\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHey guys. Keep the questions\ncoming, the star letter winner\nnext week wins two tickets to\nsee a film of their choice! So get\nthinking I\u2019m here to answer all\nyou can throw at me!

It is evident that poverty, war\nand oppression are all symptomatic\nof the social and economic structures present today and they cannot\nbe resolved without fundamental\nchanges. Further it is only the activity of the people that can transform\nthe world to create a truly socialist\nsociety.\nHere at Imperial the SWSS group\norganises many debates, discus-sions, film showings and cultural\nevents revolving around how the\npeople of the world can unite to\nmove society forward.\nHowever the most important role\nSWSS plays is in the active ongoing campaigns both on campus and\nthroughout London. SWSS has been\ncentral in the fight for student welfare here at Imperial, campaigning\nover issues such as top-up fees, hall\nrent increases and student repre-sentation. SWSS has led the anti-war\nmovement in college. Side by side\nwith Islamic Soc, Imperial against\nImperialism and Amnesty, SWSS\nhas initiated the Free Babar Ahmed\nCampaign, fighting for the civil liberties of a former student imprisoned without trial. Outside of college\nmembers of SWSS have supported\nvarious workers and aided the successful Respect election campaign\n\u201cWe are the most\nactive of the main\nparties at Imperial;\nConSoc is a great way\nto meet\nfellow minded\nstudents.\u201d\nSocialist Workers Student Society\nin the east end of London.\nThere are a number of events and\ncampaigns under way:\nInternational Peace Conference:\nCalled by the Stop the War\nCoalition.\nSaturday 10th December\nWith delegates from Iraq, USA, and\nthe UK.\nstopwar.org.uk\nInternational Day of Climate\nProtest: London Demo, Saturday\nDecember 3rd.\ncampaingcc.org\nCivil Liberties Talk (Supported by\nStudent Respect): The week 7th-14th November.\nrespectcoalition.org\nTo Join or for more information\nplease e-mail: swss@imperial.\nac.uk.\nRespect Society\nR\nespect was born out of\nthe anti war movement.\nThe urge to find an alternative to a government\nthat took the country to\nwar even when the majority of the\npopulation was against it has provided an MP (George Galloway) and\na Councillor (Ollie Rahman).\nRespect stands for:\nAn end to the war and occupation\nin Iraq.\nAn end to all privatisation and\nthe bringing back into democratic\npublic ownership of the railways and\nother public services.\nAn education system that is not\nbased on the ability to pay, comprehensive and gives an equal chance\nin life to every child from nursery to\nuniversity.\nThe repeal of the Tory anti-union\nlaws.\nOpposition to all forms of discrimination based on race, gender, eth-nicity, religious beliefs (or lack of\nthem), sexual orientation, disability,\nnational origin or citizenship\nAn end to the destruction of the\nenvironment by states and corporations for whom profit is more important than sustaining the natural\nworld on which all life depends.\nStudent Respect on campus aims\nto include a broad range of people\nfrom a range of different societies\nand backgrounds. This will enable\nRespect as a group to campaign on\na number of different issues such as\na permanent Friday prayer venue\nfor Muslim students, improving\nthe colleges environmental policy,\nremoving the weapons research\nthat occurs within the college and\nlooking out for the civil liberties of\nall students of imperial college.\nWithin a few weeks time student\nRespect at imperial will be supporting a civil liberties campaign\nthat will incorporate a \u201cKnow Your\nRights\u201d theme, where students can\nfind out what to do and what their\nrights are if held under the section 44 anti-terror laws.

We\nare an open society aiming to provide a forum to discuss and debate\nLabour ideas and policy.\nThis Thursday (10th November)\nthe always entertaining Steve Pound\nMP will be joining us for a drink\nin the Union bar at 7pm to chat\nabout what Parliament is really like.\nBefore becoming an MP\n, Steve has\nhad a varied career including working as a seaman, bus conductor and\nhospital porter.\nAs a member of Imperial College\nLabour Society you can expect an\nexciting mix of guest speakers,\nMPs and ministers, giving you a\nchance to question the Government.\nWe organise lively debates, social\nevents and campaigning. The society has been addressed by Education\nMinister Stephen Twigg, and former\nSecretary of State for Health,\nFrank Dobson MP\n, joined us for a\nlively discussion about the NHS.\nMore recently Hilary Benn MP\n,\nSecretary of State for International\nDevelopment, highlighted Labour\u2019s\nachievements in increasing foreign\naid spending and cancelling the debt\nof the world\u2019s poorest countries.\nFormer Cabinet Minister Michael\nMeacher MP spoke passionately\nabout his opposition to the war in\nIraq.\nLater this term we will be running an event highlighting the huge\nhuman rights abuses taking place in\nColombia in association with Justice\nfor Colombia. Also invited for this\nterm is Science Minister Lord\nSainsbury to talk about the state of\nBritish Science.\nWe are affiliated to Labour\nStudents and the society has good\nlinks with London Young Labour,\nwhich provides further opportunities for meeting like minded people\nacross London.\nWhether you\u2019re a Labour Party\nmember or are just interested in\npolitics and want a say, you\u2019ll be\nwelcome.\nFor more information, contact\nalexander.guite@imperial.ac.uk or\nvisit union.ic.ac.uk/labour.\nAlexander Guite\nT\nhe IC Conservative\nSociety welcomes members from all quarters.\nObviously,westandinsupport of the Conservative\nParty and its policies, but we are\nopen as a forum of debate for conservative ideas. All are welcome,\nwith a low membership fee of \u00a33, or\n\u00a35 including Conservative Future\nmembership (the youth wing of the\nnational party). We are by far the\nmost active of the main three British\npolitical parties at Imperial; ConSoc\nis a great way to meet fellow-minded\nstudents.\nOur main meeting is every\nTuesday at 12.00 in the Union bar,\nwhere we have a fun informal chat.\nWe also have guest speakers and go\nto local and national party events.\nFor example, we are attending a\ntalk by David Cameron on his vision\nfor the party at Knightsbridge this\nevening: a first-class event that only\ncosts \u00a310 to ConSoc members. Such\nevents generally include a plentiful\nsupply of wine, and we go out to\nthe pub afterwards and shoot the\nbreeze. ConSoc is worth joining for\nthe social events alone! We also take\npart in election campaigning for\nthe party, for instance in this May\u2019s\nGeneral Election, which is a great\nway to meet people and directly\nstand up for Conservative beliefs.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a hack to join\nConSoc; our meetings are relaxed\nand good-humoured.

A deepening relationship between British universities\nand the military industrial sector\nin recent years has gone largely\nunnoticed by students and lectur-ers. However, some arms companies support universities by providing graduate recruitment, research\ndeals and sponsorship.\nUniversities holding the highest number of shares include\ntop universities like Oxford and\nCambridge. CAAT have stated that\nImperial College holds shares in\nsix UK based arms companies:\nBAE Systems, Cobham, GKN,\nRolls Royce, Smiths Group and VT\nGroup. However, the exact number\nof shares could not be ascertained.\nAlthough this cannot be con-firmed, CAAT believes that the\nwealth of many of these universities\nlies largely in the number of shares\nthey hold in these arms companies.\nIn a CAAT study it also states that\n\u201cthe notorious wealth of several\nOxbridge colleges rests upon arms\ncompany investments that rival\nthose of entire universities\u201d.\nCAAT was set up in 1974 by a\nnumber of peace organisations with\naims to end government subsidies\nand support for arms exports, as\nwell as exports to countries involved\nin an armed conflict or region of\ntension.\nCAAT has launched a University\nClean Investment Campaign to\ntarget universities supporting the\narms trade and to end their support.\nCAAT state that the trade has a devastating effect worldwide, and as\nuniversities are centres of internationalism and play a unique role in\npublic life, they should not be party\nto it. Students and staff can support\nthis campaign by passing motions\nin student unions and requesting\nmore information concerning their\ninstitution\u2019s investments. By doing\nthis, we will truly be able to call ourselves an international institution.\nRuby Chu\nThe results of two of the posi-tions, Union Council and Equal\nOppurtunities Officer, have yet to\nbe annouced despite voting having closed more than two weeks\nago. Complaints have been made\nto the Returning Officer, Sameena\nMisbahuddin (Union President),\nregarding the conduct of some can-didates. These elections saw the\nlargest number of candidates in\nrecent memory.\nFelix has learned that the complaints centre around abuse of email lists. It is made clear to all\ncandidates that the abuse of e-mail\nlists, such as those held by clubs and\nsocieties, is against the rules.\nThe Union has held numerous\nemergency closed meetings to discuss how to deal with the situa-tion. Felix has been specifically prevented from attending any of these\nmeetings, and the participants have\nbeen warned not to discuss the matter with Felix.\nFelix was reasssured by Ms\nMisbahuddin that the matter would\nbe resolved on Tuesday night and\na full statement would be provided.\nHowever, she now refuses to discuss\nthe matter with Felix at all, stating\nthat, \u201cit would be unfair on the individuals to talk about it because no\ndecision has been made\u201d.\nHundreds of complaints were filed at\nthe Southampton University accommodation office last week. This follows a series of issues resulting in\nseveral students either failing to be\nallocated the rooms they requested\nor being entirely forgotten. Behind\nthis chaos is the private accommodation company UNITE, claiming\nto be \u201cthe UK\u2019s leading provider of\nvalue-for-money high-quality accommodation services for students and\nkey-workers.\u201d\nUNITE is responsible for privately\nletting halls of residence to universities in 28 cities around the UK and\nreported net rental income up 53% at\n\u00a329.1m. Despite rent at UNITE halls\nin Southampton being advertised\nat \u00a369.99 per week, students found\nthemselves facing an \u00a389.99 fee. A\ncomputerised application system\nsupposed to simplify the allocation\nprocedure meant several students\nwere left sharing single rooms.\nAt the UNITE halls of residence\nin Charlotte Place, students were\nconfronted with of having to pay\ntheir entire rent for the first term\nup-front. This was approximately\n\u00a31,400, on top of which a substantial\ndeposit was requested. Heavy-handed negotiations from Southampton\u2019s\nUnion of Students led to the withdrawal of these excessive financial\ndemands.\nThis is UNITE\u2019s second significant blunder in Southampton. In\n2003, the company failed to ensure\nthe completion of Orion Point, leaving students staying in hotels. Upon\nmoving into the halls, a host of\nproblems was unveiled: incomplete\nlaundry rooms, leaking showers and\nresidents trapped in lifts with falling\ndebris, to name a few.\nThis academic year, Imperial\nCollege have outsourced accommodation from UNITE. Due to the necessary closure and building works\nat Southside which commenced in\nJuly 2005, a two-year lease of Orient\nHouse in Fulham and Piccadilly\nCourt in Islington was taken up.\nDespite transport issues, for which\nUnite can be spared the blame, an\narray of concerns has been brought\nto light by occupants. Hugh Stickley\nMansfield, a re-app at Orient House,\ndescribed an appalling lack of laundry facilities, showers that flood the\nrooms and the presence of rodents.\nThe warden Ioannis Fotinopoulos\ndid not wish to comment when questioned by Felix and expressed dismay at the letter submitted to the\neditor by Mr Stickley Mansfield.\nIronically, in November 2004,\nUNITE signed a voluntary code of\nstandards with the National Union\nof Students (NUS). NUS vice-presi-dent of welfare said, \u201cNUS hopes\nthat this code of standard will tidy\nup the way that student accommodation is run and that student complaints of shoddy treatment at the\nhands of the accommodation managers will be a thing of the past.\u201d\nMichael Olymbios\nAccording to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), universities, including Imperial College, are\nprofiting from the misery of war.\n\n"

I will\nbe analysing and dissecting (read: rambling on\nabout) the week\u2019s entertainment that has been blasted out\nof your \u2018tellybox\u2019, as the E4 creators\nso annoyingly refer to it. If you\u2019ve\ngot beef with my comments, want\nto suggest some programs I should\ntune in to, or want to send me fan\nmail, you can do so by emailing:\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLast Wednesday evening saw the\nfirst episode of HBO\u2019s sex and san-dals, swords and violence, sex and\nrape and sex epic Rome. From the\ncreators of the excellent Band Of\nBrothers, BBC2 were hoping for\ngreat things from Rome. The program was a massive success attracting 6.6m viewers, unfortunately one\nof whom was me.\nSet during the era of Julius\nCaesar, it was billed as, \u201ca story\nof love and betrayal, masters and\nslaves\u201d. However, in reality it felt\nmore like the BBC were whacking\nout some soft-core porno in a bid to\nshow Channel 5 how it\u2019s really done.\nRome was terrible. Oh, don\u2019t get me\nwrong - swords and sheaths, sex\nand rape appeal to me as much as\nthe next guy. But trying to follow the\nstory was far too much effort, and\ntv tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPulled from US television schedules\nnot once, but twice, it is perhaps surprising to see a Family Guy movie. I\nuse the term \u201cmovie\u201d loosely, as this\n90 minute feature went straight to\nDVD and is little more than a buffed\nup, extended episode. However, this\nis a fitting reward for fans who resurrected the series buying the DVD\nin droves. Why it was pulled from\ntelevision in the first place is a mys-tery, probably due to most American\nhumour going along the lines of:\n<Joey and Monica are chatting.\nEnter Ross.>\n\u201cOh man, if Ross finds out I\nsmashed his car up, he\u2019s gunna be\nmad.\u201d\n\u201cErr\u2026 Joey, Look behind you.\u201d\n<Audience \u201cOoo\u201ds. Ross frowns\nwhilst retaining his puppy-dog vis-age>\nThe Untold Story focuses on the\nbest character in Family Guy as\nit follows the calculating, megalomaniac baby from a near-death\nexperience, to finding his real father\nand finally a bit of time travel. The\njourney is merely a changing background for the writers to unleash\ntheir insane, twisted and controversial humour upon. The jokes come\nthick and fast and they push the\nboundaries of decency even further\nthan the series. Joking about every\nmoral grey area under the sun, or\nshould that be Peter\u2019s belly, there is\neven room to squeeze reference to\nincest. As always, there are many\ntrademark asides that are irrelevant to the plot. Highlights include\nI couldn\u2019t care less which grunting\nRoman got screwed over next. This\nwasn\u2019t helped by the fact that UK\nviewers get a trimmed down version\nof the US show. Three US shows\nare streamlined into two of ours.\nUnknowingly, the BBC was doing us\na favour. A lot of wasted denarii then,\nbut the BBC won\u2019t be complaining. I\ncan only hope that you didn\u2019t have\nto suffer the torture of last night\u2019s\nepisode before reading this.\nThankfully, I only had a ten minute\nwait until Lost, so I brushed my\nteethandjumpedinbed.Incidentally,\nelectric toothbrushes are safe \u2013 get\none. And speaking of which, doesn\u2019t\nit make you wonder how scrubbed\nup the survivors manage to keep?\nEspecially the blonde girl, you know\nthe one? Oh yes. Ah, Shannon, that\u2019s\nit. Blemish free skin and blinding\nivory pegs - I dunno. Ahem, anyway,\nwhat an episode! You\u2019ve probably\nseen the next episode last night or\nare even two episodes ahead if you\nare a naughty E4 viewer. So, I\u2019m\nwriting for the Sunday crew.\nIt was Mercutio\u2019s, sorry Michael\u2019s\nturn to be centre of attention. We\nfound out his girlfriend left him and\ntook his child, but she died when\nWalt was 9, giving reason to the\npoor father-son relationship. Walt\u2019s\nadmiration of the bald-one continued and led to a tussle between\nLocke\u2019s lap-dog Boone and a protective Michael. Later, Walt wandered off into the forest. In true Lost\nfashion, we were kept on the edge\nof our seats. Ten minutes to go.\nAre we going to see the monsters?\nHell yes! But, oh..! It\u2019s another polar\nbear? The penultimate scenes were\nvery tense and torn relationships\nwere resolved using the Hollywood\nstruggle-to-success therapy. Were\nthe writers done there though? Hell\nno! The final scene saw the whiny\npregnant one emerge through the\ndense undergrowth, smeared in\nblood wearing a smile. But, did she\nstill have a bun in the oven? I didn\u2019t\nnotice myself, but chums of mine\nsuggested that was the twist.\nSpeaking of baking, Thursday was\nthe night of 24 rip-off Spooks, but\nmore importantly Gordon Ramsay\u2019s\nThe F Word. This week he had a\nbake-off against him mum. They\nwere cooking apple puddings. She\nwas lovely, but Ramsey is even a\ncheeky bastard to her. Not that I\u2019d\never give my Petal jip... To be fair\nthough, he was very complimentary\nto his mum after he had beaten her\n2 votes to 1, saying she taught him\neverything he knows. Aww. Ramsay\ngets a bad press for swearing super-fluously and being too hard on people who can\u2019t cook as well as him.\nThe F Word portrays him in a good\nlight and one I think he deserves.\nHe demands perfection, he is honest and yet knows when he has gone\ntoo far such as when he apologised\nto Joan Collins for kicking her out\nof his restaurant seven years ago.\nFor that, he deserves reward and he\nis getting it from Channel 4 who are\nrightfully airing this program. Watch\nit, but I dare you to cook something\nfrom it.\nRight, I\u2019d better wrap this up for\nthis week as I\u2019m off to Battersea\nto see flowers blooming in the\nnight sky. I\u2019ve been keeping one\neye on X-Factor and all I can say\nabout tonight is I hope the bloody\nConway Sisters get kicked off. The\nlast thing we need is another bloody\nB*Witched clone clogging up the\ncharts. Westlife are doing a splendid\njob, thank you. Not that I have anything against the Irish!\nWill I be here next week to write\nthis page? Or will I be fermenting\nin a Guinness barrel? Tune in next\nweek.\nTomo Roberts\nLast week\u2019s TV DVD Reviews\nStewie recalling his failed attempt at\nworld domination, where he is found\nhiding in a box by US infantry and\ncombed for lice live on TV whilst his\nstatue is pulled down with chains by\nIraqis. Another very funny aside parodies Indiana Jones, where Stewie\nis his Chinese side-kick complete\nwith \u201cDr Jones\u201d catch phrase.\nAlmost all of the characters return,\neven the squeaky-voiced, greased\nup guy who featured in about two\nseries episodes. This also acts to\nalienate first time Family Guy view-ers. There are plenty of in-jokes and\nthe humour may be too overwhelming for 90 minutes. The Untold Story\nbegins to lag after about an hour, but\nit redeems itself for the finale. More\nscreen-time for Captain Syphilis\nhimself, Quagmire, would have been\nwelcome but there is too much of\na good thing. I suppose this is The\nUntold Story\u2019s main failing. For fans\nof the series, they will feel right at\nhome, on the sofa in Quahog. But it\nis essentially a long episode. Family\nGuy is best in short doses and if you\ndon\u2019t already own the series DVDs,\nbuy those first.\nTomo Roberts\n\u201cThe BBC were\nwhacking out some\nsoft-core porno to\nshow Channel 5 how\nit\u2019s really done\u201d\nWatch TV?\nIf so you have enough qualifications.\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nfelix\nThursday 10 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFamily Guy Presents Stewie Griffin\n- The Untold Story\nCertificate: 15\nHHHII\n\n"

    "content": "V\nive la resistance! Never has it been\nknown in modern history for a section\nof a community to rebel so absolutely\nagainst the order of the day. Riots all\nover northern Parisian suburbs, and even last\nnight in central areas, have continued for ten\nnights straight. Assuredly, more riots are to\nfollow. The spirit of the Resistance seems to\nhave embedded itself in a paradoxically vicious\nmanner with members of France\u2019s economically\ndeprived North African community. Such is the\neffect of the perceived meaningless loss of life,\nno matter the number. Two or two million, the\nemotional effect is the same. These actions mark\na totally frustrated and deprived set of people.\nYes, the violence is their own fault, but the rage\nof those particular individuals could be seen as\nintoxicating.\nComparatively, the student reputation of\nbeing politically active and making their voices\nheard does not even register. If our lives were\ntruly changed for the worse, if first years were\nmade to live on the streets due to Southside\u2019s\ndemolition, if tuition fees were so high that\nonly those with actual \u201cinheritances\u201d could go\ninto higher education, we would act decisively.\nAnd if necessary, angry or hurt enough, we\nwould all fight (and indeed burn) like those that\nare doing the same in France, perhaps as we\nspeak. It is a harsh reality to bear, but if we or\nsociety take enough from people, the equal and\nopposite reaction to pain spirals out of control.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not \u201cinciting\u201d anyone to\nanything sinister. But what a spectacle it would\nbe for students to find some real excitement\nin their lives. Heroes are made only when the\ncircumstances are there for true courage to\nshow. Yet there is no modern war that affects all\ntoday, no great cause to rally the masses, no idea\nto change the governance of life. Each shade of\ngrey masks the opportunity for glory. Perhaps\nwe should be happy. It means that for the most\npart our lives are taken care of, and that each\nday we are assured of a mundane existence. No\nevil to fight, no cause to be won.\nOver the horizon, however, there is much\nturmoil. Natural disasters and war are\ncommonplace. One could not be blamed for\nasking \u201cwhat is wrong with the world?\u201d Its\ninhabitants and its habitat. There, people are\nmoving. Insurgencies, repression and truly\nbeautiful acts of compassion often draw well-off\nboredom-heads like ourselves to areas where\nwe can feel some special kind of life. There is no\nhope for ultimate success, with shockingly little\nfaith in our leaders to govern well, let alone to\nachieve world peace, its nigh on impossible. But\nwhat a life to live! It sure as hell beats the essay\nI have to write now that\u2019s already late and had\n20% deducted. Damn the stress.\nI\nn last week\u2019s Felix (No.1333, \u201cULU in\nchaos\u201d), we saw coverage of some of the\nlatest homophobic remarks of University of\nLondon Union (ULU) Council Chair, Luca\nManfredi. On a notice board, he said that should\na future son of his introduce him to his boy-friend, he would \u201ctake out a big gun and make\nsure he [would] not dishonour my family\u201d.\nHe was subsequently forced to apologise, but\nrather than do so with any sign of remorse, he\ntried to qualify his remarks by saying that \u201cthe\ncomments were intended for use against one\nvery restricted group of people\u201d. This shows he\ndoes not understand that it was his comments\nthat were offensive and unacceptable and not\nagainst whom he intended them. As Chair\nof ULU Council, Luca Manfredi is regarded\nas a representative of London students. His\ncomments concerning homosexuality give\nno confidence in his ability to represent all\nstudents, especially those that he believes are\nliving in sin.\nEven if he had given a full and sincere\napology, which in my opinion he did not, I\nwould not be satisfied with simply letting this\ngo. What Luca posted was not a light jibe \u2013 it\nwas a threat of shooting someone because of\ntheir sexuality. Nor is this the first time Luca\nhas aired his candid and bigoted views. Just a\nyear ago, he posted similar comments, one of\nwhich supported the idea of parents telling their\nchildren to commit suicide rather than come out.\nHe said that he would stick to that \u201cuntil they\nintroduce me to their same-sex friends; at that\npoint I would commit two murders\u201d.\nThe wider problem we face is not just bigots\nlike Luca, but those that seem to think that such\nbigoted views are acceptable. Just imagine a\nstudent representative saying that he\u2019d shoot his\nson if he converted Islam \u2013 or if he came home\nwith a black girlfriend. Homophobia isn\u2019t as\nvisible as other hatreds \u2013 and we must tackle all\nforms of bigotry head-on. It matters not whether\nthey affect ten percent of the student population\nor just one \u2013 prejudiced discrimination should\nnot be tolerated.\nOur welfare and equal opportunity\nrepresentatives need to take homophobia and\nIslamophobia seriously \u2013 not just as issues\nthat can be swept under the carpet. It is not\ngood enough to accept as a justification for\nintolerant comments that they were only\nintended to \u2018provoke\u2019. Nor is it adequate to allow\na representative like Luca to give a half-hearted\napology and think that that should be fine.\nIntolerance does not just affect those it is\naimed at, but all of us as students who believe\nin a decent society. Our union should take\na more proactive approach in challenging\ndiscrimination of all forms. We should celebrate\nour involvement in Rise Student Week, tackling\nracism and Islamophobia. And I hope that\nour union will get involved in ULU\u2019s London\nLiberated campaign and Equality Month in\nFebruary. We cannot allow our representatives\nto stand by, pleading impartiality. Only by\nstamping out hate can we live in a community\nthat values people for their worth, and to live\nfree from fear, violence and prejudice.\nI\nn Anushri Patel\u2019s recent column, she asked\nsome big questions about God\u2019s nature in the\nlight of some of the natural disasters we\u2019ve\nseen recently. We want to be thinking people,\nand the Bible is God\u2019s word and has answers to\nthese profound questions.\nIt\u2019s important to keep God\u2019s character in mind\nhere. God is Love, and He is Justice. We know\nwhat love is, because that\u2019s what God is like. Do\nyou see? If God did not love, or was not just or\neven good, then we wouldn\u2019t even have words for\nthese things.\nWe have this weird concept of what the world\nought to be like. We feel that natural disasters\nought not to happen, and that there ought not\nto be any suffering or sadness. In a world without a loving or just God, why shouldn\u2019t these\nthings happen? In this world, suffering happens\nregularly, but everyone, whatever they believe,\nfeels instinctively that the world is not the way it\nought to be. We feel a crushing sense of injustice\nand outrage at the suffering we see and experience every day. Even Jesus felt this way.\nThe big question is: how can anyone deserve\nto die in a natural disaster like Kashmir or\nKatrina? In Luke 13:4-5, Jesus talks about a\ncrowd of people crushed by a collapsing building:\n\u201cthose eighteen on whom the tower of Siloam\nfell and killed them: do you think that they were\nworse offenders than all the others who lived in\nJerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent,\nyou will all likewise perish.\u201d\nYou see, we often think sin is like cream cakes:\na little bit naughty, but at the same time sort\nof nice. No big deal. It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. As\nlong as we don\u2019t do anything too bad, like kill\nsomeone, then God shouldn\u2019t be angry about it\n\u2013 because after all, we\u2019re just doing what we feel\nlike.\nBut that\u2019s not what Bible says. Sin is much\nmore serious. The Bible tells us that all sin is\nrebellion against God. It destroys us and our\nrelationship with him. It is a grave offence before\nGod, because every sin primarily stems from a\ncompromise to do evil on our part. A God who\nis perfectly upright can never come to terms\nwith evil, never. There can be no compromise,\nbecause if there ever is, then he has allowed evil\nto prevail, and has failed to be ultimately good.\nSo where do we stand before God, the perfect\njudge? Ecclesiastes 7:20 says: \u201cThere is not a\nrighteous man on earth who does what is right\nand never sins\u201d, and Ezekiel 18:4 says \u201cThe soul\nwho sins is the one who will die.\u201d It\u2019s as simple\nas that.\nWhat does the face of sin look like \u2013 Hitler,\nStalin? Yes, but also people like you and me.\nWhat hope can there be for us? We are accountable to God. The suffering we see in the world\ntoday is simply a curtain raiser for the time\nwhen God\u2019s justice is finally poured out.\nThis can be very hard to swallow. We usually\nsimply judge ourselves by our own standards,\nand when we do that, of course, we come off\nlooking pretty good, but before God and his perfect standard we are guilty. No matter how good\nor bad any of us think we are, we are all in a\ndesperate state.\nThis is the good news of the Gospel \u2013 that rather than leaving us lost in our sin with no future,\nGod sent his own Son, Jesus Christ, to die in our\nplace. The punishment that I deserve has been\nput on him \u2013 he is my substitute. \u201cFor all have\nsinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are\njustified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented\nhim, as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in\nhis blood.\u201d (Romans 3:23-25).\nJesus himself says \u201cI am the resurrection and\nthe life. He who believes in me will live, even\nthough he dies; and whoever lives and believes\nin me will never die.\u201d So, even though we are all\nsinners who stand utterly guilty, bankrupt, and\nwithout hope, God in Jesus Christ has opened\nthe way for the relationship with him to be\nrestored. God\u2019s justice and love are finally satis-fied. It\u2019s a free gift; all we have to do is believe in\nhim. He will do the rest!\nSuffering has existed in this world for as long\nas sin has, but that sin and pain have been fully\nand finally defeated by Christ Jesus \u2013 no wonder\nhe\u2019s the most famous man in history! No one\nelse has done what he has, not even close.\nRevelation 21, has this prophecy about heaven:\n\u201cAnd I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,\n\u2018Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will\nlive with them. They will be his people, and God\nhimself will be with them, and be their God. He\nwill wipe every tear from their eyes. There will\nbe no more death or mourning or crying or pain,\nfor the old order of things has passed away.\u2019\u201d\nEvery week, the Christian Union runs Impact,\nan event held in the Union Dining Hall between\n12 and 1pm on Tuesdays. It\u2019s a chance to investigate the claims of the Bible in a relaxed and\nfriendly environment and to ask any questions\nyou may have.

It was finally time\nto venture out of the SAF with it\u2019s\noverpriced and mayonnaise-filled\nsandwiches and trek over to the\nSherfield building for what was to be\nmy first hot meal at Imperial. Sad,\nconsidering I\u2019m in the 2nd year.\nAnyway, I sheepishly approached\nthe counters clutching my tray and\nwas swept up by a throng of starving\nstudents. Before I knew what was\ngoing on I had to give my order and\npointed to the nearest thing, which\nhappened to be chicken curry and\nrice. I was subsequently then pushed\nout the other end. Traumatised I\ntried to find hot pudding but was\npointed in three different directions\nby staff and eventually had to give\nup and paid at the till. It was then\nthat I realised you had to get a knife\nand fork before paying and had a\nrun-in with a semi security guy asking if I had paid.\nAfter re-grouping with friends and\nsampling their various dishes I was\npleasantly surprised at how nice\neach of the options was. Of particular note was the thai pork strips,\nchicken and beef curries, fish and\nchips and the salmon slice. Certainly\nbetter than any of the school dinners I had previously experienced\nanyway.\nAlthough stuffed I had to try the\ncrumble and custard which I eventually discovered randomly in the\nBurger Bar. When I asked the lady\nbehind the bar if I could have custard with my crumble she nodded\nand walked off so I leaned over,\ngrabbed the ladle and helped myself.\nIt was just like puddings from back\nat school; soggy with custard, sugary and moreish.\nSome students complain food on\ncampus is overpriced and unhealthy\nbut I challenge you to find a balanced meal off campus for near the\nprice that doesn\u2019t involve washing\nup.\nToad in the Hole (serves 3)\nToad in the hole is a perfect recipe\nfor cold weather. If you\u2019re a fan of\nsteaming yorkshire puddings and\nsausages this is a match made in\nheaven. Serve with 2 veg and gravy.\n6-8 sausages\n1 pint of milk\n2 eggs, roughly beaten\nsalt and pepper\n1 cup of flour\ndrizzle of vegetable oil\n1. To make the batter pour the\nmilk into a bowl and season with\nsalt and pepper. Add the eggs and\nwhisk gently.\n2. Slowly add the flour, sifting it\nin if you have a sieve. Add it until\nthe mixture feels less runny which\nsounds ridiculous but it\u2019s the best\nway to desribe it. Making batter is\nall down to experience- the finished\nproduct should be like emulsion\npaint but it won\u2019t be the end of the\nworld if it\u2019s not exact.\n3. Leave the batter to stand while\nyou place the sausages into an oven\ntray at least 5cm deep, and drizzle\nwith a small amount of vegetaable\noil. Cook for 5 minutes.\n4. After 5 minutes pull the tray\nout slightly and pour the batter into\nthe hot tray around the sausages.\nClose the oven door and cook for 30\nminutes until golden brown.\nBruce Bogtrotter\u2019s Cake\n(from Roald Dahl\u2019s\nRevolting Recipes)\nIn case it\u2019s been a decade since you\nlast read Matilda, Bruge Bogtrotter\nwas the obese glutton who was\nforced to eat an entire cake in front\nof the whole school.

Have I\nmentioned that one serving alone is\nmore than your recommended daily\nintake of saturated fat?\n8 oz chocolate\n12 tablespoons butter (200g)\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup plain flour\n6 eggs, separated, yolks lightly\nbeaten\nfor the icing:\n200g chocolate\n200g double cream\n1.

Whisk the egg whites until stiff.\nGently fold half of the whites into\nthe chocolate mixture, blending\nthoroughly, then fold in the\nremaining whites.\n5. Pour the batter into the cake\npan and bake for about 35 minutes.\nThere will be a thin crust on top\nof the cake, and if tested with a\ntoothpick the inside will appear\nundercooked (don\u2019t worry, the cake\nwill get firmer as it cools). Remove\nfrom the oven, and let cool in the\npan on a wire rack.\n6. While the cake is cooling, make\nthe icing. Melt the chocolate with\nthe cream in a heavy\u2013bottomed\nsaucepan over lowest heat, stirring\noccasionally until the chocolate is\nfully melted and blended with the\ncream. Remove from heat and let\ncool slightly.\n7. When it\u2019s cool enough to handle,\nremove it from the pan and discard\nthe wax paper. The cake is prone\nto sinking slightly in the middle, so\nflip it upside down before icing by\nplacing a plate on top and carefully\nturning over the cake pan and\nplate together. Carefully spread the\nchocolate icing all over the cake.\nThe Burger bar- serves fish burgers, veggie burgers, meat burgers.....\nLunch time at spaghetti junction. Courtesy of Stevie.\n\n"

Now the father,\nAlejandro finds that leading his double life is far too hazardous and\nvows to hang up his cloak. Zorro is\nno more.\nHowever, he has become addicted\nto the dangers he faced as his alter\nego and when California\u2019s pending\nstatehood is jeopardised he finds\nhimself taking action, much to the\ndispleasure of his wife. So much so in\nfact, she files for divorce! Alejandro\nis now faced with the decision to\nsave his beloved country, or save his\nmarriage.\nThe plot is strong all the way\nthrough and is also pretty easy to\nfollow.

Not actual different\ncharacter roles, but she performs as\n\u201cthe loving wife\u201d,\u201dworried mother\u201d\netc as well as looking good the whole\nway through and getting to kick the\nblokes\u2019 asses in some fight scenes.\nWhilst on the subject of fight\nscenes, I must say they were a bit\nsparse for an action film. However\nthe action scenes they did have\nticked all the right boxes for me.\nJust the right length, well choreographed and also displayed some\noriginality, including Zorro riding\nTornado along the top of a moving\nsteam train.\nAnother aspect of the film I enjoyed\nwas the lighter, more comical parts\nto the film, usually looking at the\nrelationship found between Zorro\nand his horse. These little jokes\nmade here and there made everything that much more enjoyable as\nit does with every film.\nDespite these positive things,\nthere was one feature of the film\nthat I wasn\u2019t too keen on. This\nwas the large focus the film had\non Alejandro\u2019s son Joaquin. Some\nscenes see him doing damage to the\nbad guys with his slingshot, which in\nmy opinion is taking things just a little bit too far. Leaving the grown ups\nto do the fighting would have made\nthe film a lot better and would honestly have made a lot more sense.\nAll in all, I enjoyed \u201cThe Legend\nof Zorro\u201d and would recommend it\nfor someone who doesn\u2019t want to\nsee a film that makes you think or\nquestion what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a\ngood film to see with friends plus\nCatherine Zeta-Jones serves as eye\ncandy for the guys. An unnecessary\nsequel, but a good sequel none the\nless.\nStephen P Smith\nI\u2019m back, please don\u2019t hate me!\nWargames. maybe if Bush had one of these, there wouldn\u2019t be a war...\n9\nfelix\nThursday 10 November www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Shares in London rose for five\nstraight days last week \u2013 taking the\nindex close to its previous highs of\nthree and a half years ago.\nThe Spanish mobile operator\nTelefonica led the way with a takeover approach for O2, which values\nthe UK company at \u00a317.7bn. The\nall-cash bid in the form of loans\nfrom Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank\nof Scotland and Citigroup is nearly twice the \u00a39.4bn that the Dutch\nmobile group KPN, offered for O2\nlast year. The bid is a 22% premium\nover O2\u2019s Friday share price and values the company at 20 times itwws\n2006 earnings forecast.

Some analysts\nare concerned that Telefonica will\nhave too much debt and could find\nitself in a similar position if the cost\nof borrowing rises.

Vodafone has also\nrecently completed deals in the key\ngrowth-markets of India, Romania\nand the Czech Republic and sold its\nlagging Swedish business.\nOverseas companies have launched\n\u00a367.7bn worth of deals in the UK\nso far this year \u2013 the highest since\nthe dotcom boom. Some of the biggest names include the bank Abbey\nNational and the drinks-manufac-turer Allied Domecq.\nThe latest British companies to be\ntargetedwerethetelecomscompany\nO2, the shipping company P&O, the\nglass-manufacturer Pilkington and\nthe construction group Mowlem;\nwith a combined value of \u00a324bn.\nP&O\u2019s exceptionally wide geographical spread and its recent\nrestructuring drive, have turned the\nworld\u2019s fourth largest ports operator\ninto an attractive take-over target.\nDP World is owned by the Dubai\ngovernment and is the world\u2019s\nnumber six ports operator, but it\nlacks both the world-wide spread\nand access to emerging markets\n(such as Thailand, Southern China\nand India) that P&O enjoys. DP\nWorld has launched a \u00a33.1bn bid\nfor P&O, in an effort to double its\ncapacity to 42m container units by\n2001. Although P&O\u2019s freight business returned a \u00a3154m profit last\nyear, the smaller ferry business lost\n\u00a315.4m and would probably be sold\nif DP World to secured the group.\nLikely counter-bids could come from\nHutchinson Group or AP Moller, the\nworld\u2019s number one and two port\noperators respectively and could\nreach \u00a33.5bn.\nPilkington has received a bid worth\n\u00a32bn from Japan\u2019s Nippon Sheet\nGlass (NSG), who already own a 20%\nstake in the group. Many analysts\nsuggest a figure of \u00a32.6bn as a more\nreasonable bid, in view of the fact\nthat \u00a32bn only values Pilkington at\neight times its earnings. Increasing\nthe bid may be out of reach for NGS\nhowever, as it would struggle to pay\nthe interest on the amount of debt\nthat would be required for such a\nmanoeuvre.\nSimon Jones\nThe current round of Mergers and\nAcquisitions (M&A) in the city have\nattracted much attention, not least\nbecause they have all been foreign\ncompanies targeting UK companies.\nThis year, Unocal, the US oil\nand gas producer, was the target\nof a take-over battle between US\nChevron, and the Chinese oil com-pany, CNOOC. Chevron acquired\nUnocal for less than CNOOC was\nprepared to bid, as it became apparent that the US senate was not about\nto let a Chinese state-backed company take over an American company with substantial oil reserves\nin the US.\nThe UK is renowned as a very\nopen market, but some politicians\nhave voiced concern about the \u2018selloff\u2019 of UK companies. There are\nbenefits to foreign take-overs, and\nsome fund managers prefer foreign-run companies to British compa-nies, claiming that they display better corporate governance. The lure\nof UK companies as potential takeover targets, implies that British\ncompanies are more profitable and\nhave higher growth potential than\nforeign companies.\nMore deals to follow\nInvestment banks can charge fees\nof between 0.125% and 0.5% of the\nvalue of the deal, and individuals\ninvolved in the Telefonica bid are\nexpected to net over $50m (\u00a328m) in\nbonuses. Their fees have increased\ndramatically in recent years, while\nthe cost of the actual debt to fund\ndeals has fallen.\nIn 2005 the average bidder paid\n27 times the value of the companies\nannual earnings (price to earnings\nratio or P/E), which included a 20%\npremium over the target company\u2019s\nshare price. During the last M&A\ncycle, the figures were higher \u2013 an\naverage P/E of 36, including a 25-40% premium on the share price.\nSenior M&A bankers suggest this\nimplies the current M&A cycle, and\nprices of companies, has yet to peak,\nand that M&A activity will continue\nwell into 2006.\nPlenty of other companies have\nbeen linked in potential take-over\nactivity, including Shell and BG, the\ngas producer. Rumours of potential\nbids have been rife in every industry\nsector, as companies continue to\nrelease record third quarter profits\nand have large cash reserves.\nPilkington\u2019s share price rose 30p to 157p on news of NSG\u2019s approach.\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 10 November 2005\nSimon Jones\nBusiness Editor\n\n"

What is certain, however, is\nthat from the moment the whistle\nwent to signify the start of play,\nImperial College looked like they\nwould settle for nothing less than a\nwin on a rather inclement October\nafternoon.\nNewcomer Flan(ge) impressed on\nhis debut with a man of the match\nperformance, setting the tone by\nsuccessfully fielding the kick off and\ncharging into the thick of the single-figure-IQ South Bank forwards. The\nball was then excellently cleared\nby captain of the day Jim Pedder,\nwhose decisions in all areas of the\ngame left little room for improve-ment, and whose tackling and work\nat the breakdown was gladiatorial.\nSoon after the lineout, South Bank\nwere deemed to have illegally used\ntheir hands in the ruck, and a penalty was awarded to Imperial just\noutside the 22. Pedder slots it, 3-0 to\nImperial.\nSouth Bank must have been\nangered by this great indignity (not\nsurprising considering they had\nenjoyed a run of 31 straight victories of recent times) and there\nthen followed a period of late tackles\non Fly-half Pedder and Full-back\nGabs. Imperial were obviously so\nintimidated by this, shaking in their\nboots so much that they turned over\nthe South Bank scrum and started\ntheir dominance in this area of the\ngame that was to last until the final\nwhistle.\nThere then followed a sustained\nperiod of pressure by Imperial, with\nsolid work by Nathan in midfield,\nstrong defence by Rob Phillipps, and\na good rolling drive off a lineout by\nhixxy, who enjoyed another typically\nbruising day at the office. With South\nBank now rattled, Imperial again\nexerted pressure on the scrum,\nand forced a hurried pick up by the\nSouth Bank number 8, who fumbled\nand flung it haphazardly to his wing.\nGreat pressure from Pedder resulted in a loose pass to full-back, who\nwas denied a clearance kick by flan\npulling out a superhero style charge\ndown, allowing Pedder to touch the\nball down in the goal area.\nSoon after the restart, a clearanc\nkick was made downfield. The fullback took his time to gather the ball,\nonly to look up to see Achi, knife and\nfork ready, napkin tucked into shirt,\nbearing down on him and licking his\nlips with blatant intent of gobbling\nup the silly little poser for daring to\nstep foot inside Fortress Harlington.\nThey say your life flashes before you\nbefore you die. It would not surprise\nme if the poor soul had his, and the\nlives of all his relatives and pets,\nflash before him in the moments\nbefore his imminent demise. Making\na choice of life over death however,\nthe full-back escaped by knocking\non the ball, leaving only a very visible stain in the seat of his neon-coloured shorts as a reminder of his\nbrush with fate.\nAbout 25 minutes into the first half,\nafter a rather artistic reaction by\nNath to at worst a slap, you got the\nfeeling that South Bank were starting to find their feet, and pushed\nup to the IC line. Jovan, dominant\nin the set piece, then showed his\nworth in open play as he made the\nfirst of his two try saving tackles to\nkeep the opposition scrum half from\ntouching down.\nUnfortunately, scrum half Rob\nRobinson, whose delivery to the line\nwas excellent in difficult conditions,\nwas a little too eager to win possession back, and was shown the\nyellow card for collecting the ball\nfrom the ruck. Imperial then had a\nmomentary lapse of concentration\nand allowed South Bank to score\ncheaply in the corner just before\nhalf time.\nWith the sun now gone, and new\nboy john Gordon on the pitch, the\ntwo teams got set to battle out the\nsecond half. After another crunching tackle at the kick off by rhino-man mark wills, who was destructive\nthroughout the afternoon, Imperial\nsoon gave away a pointless pen-alty, allowing South Bank to level the\nscores at 8-8 with a good kick from\ntheir fly half. After some good work\nby O\u2019Rourke, the elusive Gabs, and a\npowerful run by Achi in the midfield,\nhooker Luke Taylor was forced to\nleave the field after a knock on the\nhead. Alex Games was then thrown\ninto the deep end with a lineout 8\nmetres from the South Bank line.\nHe rose to the challenge admirably,\nand with a perfect throw to John\nGordon, the forwards executed a\ntextbook drive to the line, with hixxy\nscoring a try to put IC back in the\nlead. South Bank responded quickly\nwith 3 points to close the score to\n13-11.\nThe heavens then opened and,\nafter a few stolen line outs thanks\nto the increasingly impressive John\nGordon, Jovan surprised everyone\nwith his skills by fielding an up and\nunder, skipping round the opposition\nfull back, and charging infield. With\ntop drawer rugby now being produced by both sides, and good work\nin the tight by Dangerous Dave and\nNorthern Steve, IC found themselves defending their line.\nAfter a penalty (which would\nhave given South Bank the lead)\nwas reversed for a player stamping\non Flannan\u2019s delicate bits, play was\nsoon stopped after a big tackle from\nO\u2019Rourke caused a South Bank player\u2019s ankle to fall off.\nA long wait for the ambulance\nthen ensued, before the players\nreturned to the field with a new\nweapon on the wing by name of\nObiora Okoye. With the game in the\nbalance, Imperial took a stranglehold on their opposition. Excellent\ndecisions by Robinson to box kick\ndown field, tight play from the for-wards, and solid running from the\nbacks resulted in IC lineout on the\nSouth Bank 22. After another accurate throw by Alex Games to John\nGordon, it was fitting that Captain\nJim Pedder should round off a fine\nperformance by finding a gap in the\nSouth Bank defence before putting\nObi over the line for an excellent\ntry to secure the match. It was an\nimpressive display by a talented\nsquad, who now promise much for\nthe rest of the season.\nSolid victory for 1st XV\nIf one heads through the mist to the\nnorth of the park, following the clip-clop of prostitutes\u2019 stilettos and the\nslap of pimp-glove, they will eventually reach a small wooden wall. If\nthey venture closer the outline of a\ndoor emerges, beyond which lies a\nshed.

Sadly today it still is.\nLike Imperial College, squash\nbreeds strange characters.\nFortunately in recent years there\nhas only been a handful of men\nmoulded in our dank shed (although\nrumours have circulated concerning a second team).\nThese \u201csquash players\u201d roam the\nCollege unnoticed, quietly plodding\nabout their every day business.\nThe squash elite would not win a\npopularity contest, or even a drinking competition - indeed they have\nfailed to formulate any testosterone\nfuelled chants, a standard feature of\nall other Imperial teams. They do,\nhowever, all possess the gift of distinctly longer than average arms.\nThese five or six players have\narrived at the shed from disparate\nparts of the world: a French engineer with a penchant for gadgets, a\nPakistani immigrant and a Brazilian\nbillionaire to name but a few.\nIt is a little known fact that there\nexists a number of analysis techniques used in the professional\nworld of squash - the most famous\nof these being the SS Index (devel-oped at the Gary Tanaka Building).\nThis ratio pits a competitor\u2019s style\nagainst their success and the shed\nhas produces a wide spread of SS\nindices in its team.\nAt one end of the spectrum lies\nour French international, Monsieur\nElliot. His seemingly uncoordinated\nmovements in conjunction with his\nequally uncoordinated facial hair\nmake for an unparallel strategy of\ndistraction. While his style rating\nstrays dangerously close to zero his\nsuccess rate flies high, charged by\nan obscene will to win.\nMr. Kadan (an Indian potato farm-er) lies nearer the other end of the\nSS spectrum. His classically trained\nstyle drastically fails to compensate\nhis inability to run. His uncanny tendency to forget he is playing squash\nwhile on court has all but eradicated\nany signs of success.\nIn the middle lies our Pakistani\nimmigrant Mr Kardar. In him lies\nmaybe the only balanced player of\nthe team. If he can overcome his\nporcine physique he might be able\nto curb his propensity to run into\nwalls (momentum = mass*velocity).\nHowever he remains the shed\u2019s\nbest chance to produce a truly great\nplayer?\nA thought for the formulating\nguru\u2019s at Tanaka. The well tested\ntheory of the SS Index has no explanation for our Brazilian millionaire,\nMr. Brantley. He lacks both style\nand success. Is zero an acceptable measure of his squash ability?\nMaybe we\u2019ll know at the end of the\nseason, after all a team is only as\nstrong as its weakest link.\nSquash\nKadan Jehangir\nInterested\nin squash?\nAfter last week\u2019s shock non-thrilling\n1-0 victory over Arts, IC 7\u2019s took their\n100% record to Chislehurst looking\nto prove to their coach/fan Duncan\nthat they still knew how to play the\nbeautiful game the way it was meant\nto be played. Beautifully.\nFortunately for the 7\u2019s, IC 6\u2019s had\nplayed against, and beaten, QM\u2019s\n4th\u2019s the week before, and were more\nthan willing to pass on the secret\nto their success: Queen Mary\u2019s\njust cannot resist being taken from\nbehind. Armed with this top secret\ninformation, the 7\u2019s set out with the\nexpress intention of gifting Queen\nMary\u2019s an early lead. This proved\neasier said than done, however, as\ntheir hilarious \u201cattackers\u201d missed\na string of chances, each one easier\nthan the last, before finally taking\nadvantage of a well-staged and thoroughly convincing \u201cdefensive error\u201d\nto roll the ball past a stranded Ian,\nIC\u2019s emergency stand-in goalkeeper\n(picked for his expertise as a wicketkeeper\u2026well, it kind of makes\nsense, doesn\u2019t it?).\nA 1-0 deficit successfully estab-lished, IC\u2019s Bat-signal was sent up\ninto the south London sky and the\n7\u2019s sprang into action. Wave after\nwave of magnificent attacking football crashed against the bows of\nQueen Mary\u2019s pirate ship as their\ndefenders cowered in the face of\na terrifying storm of IC pressure.\nSomething had to give. And it did.\nDebutant Jas was proving a thorn\nin the side for QM and had already\ncome close on several occasions\nbefore he lashed in a left footed\neffort from close range to provide\nthe equaliser. More pressure followed as Sam went close with a\nsuperb effort from inside the cen-tre-circle, and Sandy almost scored\nafter a great run in from the right\nof the QM area. He went one better soon after as he swooped on a\nrebound from Jarlath\u2019s shot to give\nIC the lead.\nThe half ended with IC looking\ncomfortable and good value for their\nlead. The two teams could not have\ndeployed more contrasting styles,\nwith IC zipping and pinging the ball\nabout with verve and pizzazz while\nQM\u2019s game plan centred on creating\nchances from their own goal kicks.\nHoof hoof hoof!! Sam\u2019s inspirational\nhalf-time team-talk was obviously a\nload of shite, however, as IC somehow found themselves clinging on in\nMens Football\nQueen Mary 5th XI 1\nImperial College 7th XI 3\nSam Styles\nSteamroller sevenths unstoppable!\nthe early stages of the second half.\nIn another demoralising victory\nfor terrible football, the big-kickers\nwere firmly on top and although\nMo and Paul at centre back did a\nfine job gobbling up the big balls,\nIC\u2019s football became increasingly\nfrantic as QM created a string of\nhalf, perhaps even three quarter\nchances. After 2,368 minutes of the\nsecond half had gone by without a\ngoal (I think they were cheating\u2026.\nmust be medics) IC swept upfield to\nput the result beyond doubt as Sam\npicked out Jarlath on the edge of the\nbox, and Jarlath\u2019s trademark finish\nfinally brought the curtains down\non the longest game of football that\nULU division 4 has ever seen. Four\nwins from four and IC Seventh\u2019s are\ntop of the league. Hooray!!!\nPlease send your sports reports, reviews and comments to\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Students live a stressful life\nat Imperial and most people find\nstress relief in Physical activities.\nAikido is a practical accessible to\nall martial art that teaches self\ndefense and leaves plenty of room\nfor self-improvement.\nSituated near Paddington the\nSherman lounge is a space used\nby martial arts that require mats,\nAikido being among them. At the\nbeginning of term, the Sherman\nlounge was closed down so that\nworks could be done to turn it into\na proper dojo. Even if the societies\nlost valuable practice time and\nsome members they were happy\nto have better facilities. Recently,\nthe matted martial arts have been\ntold that they can not use the\nSherman lounge for the last week\nof November and possibly longer.\nThe reason: another group of\npeople that have no link to martial\narts have rented the place. Practice\ntwice a week is very important\nfor matted martial arts especially\nbefore a long break. In addition the\nAikido society will be particularly\nbadly affected since they have\ngradings in December.\nThe president, the secretary and\nthe instructor of the Aikido society\nhave already tried to resolve the\nissue but they have not even been\nLetters to the editor\n20\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 10 November 2005\nStar\nLetter\nExtremist at Imperial?\nDear Editor,\nI\u2019m writing in response to your\neditorial about the group \u2018Hizb ut\nTahrir\u2019. The vast majority of IC\nstudents, including myself, know\nlittle about what this organisation is\nabout and why it warrants a ban, so\nI think it might help if Felix gave us\na bit more information about them.\nI\u2019ve spent my evening using Google\ntrying to find out information about\nHizb ut Tahrir. As far as I can see,\nHizb ut Tahrir is a political party\nwith a revolutionary left-leaning\nideology which seeks to achieve\nits aims via non-violent means.\nAccording to GlobalSecurity.org:\n\u201c[Hizb ut Tahrir] ... remains a\nradical organization. Hizb ut-Tahrir\nis not against violence as such. It is\njust against the use of violence now.\nBut they still think jihad (holy war)\nis a positive concept. The United\nStates Government is continuing\nto monitor Hizb ut-Tahrir... the\nUnited States has found no clear\nties between Hizb ut-Tahrir and\nterrorist activity. Hizb ut-Tahrir\nhas not been proven to have\ninvolvement in or direct links to any\nrecent acts of violence or terrorism.\nNor has it been proven to give\nfinancial support to other groups\nengaged in terrorism.\u201d\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but this\nmakes Hizb ut Tahrir no worse\nthan the Communist Party, which\nisn\u2019t facing a ban.\nThe Union should look into this\nclosely, and I think we at IC should\ncome to our own decision rather\nthan following others. So I think we\nneed to look into the reasons why\nthe NUS barred the group, and why\nthe government wants to ban them.\nAnd importantly - are they antiSemitic or not? I haven\u2019t been able\nto find a definitive answer from my\nevening\u2019s web surfing.\nIf we have proof that the group\nhas been peddling racial hatred on\ncampus, then that most certainly\ncalls for a ban. Besides, surely\neven an extremist would agree that\nracism is forbidden in Islam - in\nwhich case the organisation ought\nto ban itself!\nSo what I\u2019m saying is; if the Union\nis to ban any group, it should be\ndone for good reasons and the\nstudent body should be informed\nabout those reasons. Otherwise it\u2019ll\nlook like the Union is stifling free\nspeech.\nKind Regards,\nMohammed Marikar\nStormy Woods\nDear Rupert,\nThursday means one thing, picking\nup the latest copy of Felix. And like\nevery other Thursday there is the\nlatest drivel from Ash-wannabe\nThe author of the \u2018star\u2019\nletter received each\nweek will win \u00a310\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nlistened too. The people that aim\nto use the Sherman lounge would\nneed to remove the mats, which\ngiven the recent transformation is\nnot a 5 minutes job, so the Sherman\nlounge is probably not the best\nplace for them.\nIf the competent authorities\nlooked into matters like these\nrather than ignoring them Imperial\nwould have facilities that could\nmeet up to the standards of other\nUK Universities even if Imperial\nCollege is in central London.\nYours truly,\nJohannes Gambari\n1st year Physics PhD\nFelix\nDear Editor,\nFelix as we all know is the\nnewspaper of the students, for the\nstudents. We\u2019re a good fun loving\nbunch of people and our tastes\ndiffer tremendously. However, I\nthink most of us can agree that we\nwould like something interesting\nin our paper. Last week I was\nbrowsing through and there was a\nsection on Politics and a Business\nsection... this might be interesting\nfor some, but I feel that we are all\ncapable of picking up a (discounted)\ncopy of the Times or Financial\nTimes if we want to know about\nthese issues. These papers are\ncertainly more up to date, and I feel\nthat with these sections in Felix,\nthe paper becomes more boring\nthan it is already. This is not to\nsay we can\u2019t have articles about\nthese if they affect the students. I\nhave been reading Felix for several\nyears, and I\u2019m disappointed that it\nis no longer holding my attention\nfor more than a few minutes.\nPlease make it more interesting!\nSimon Pascoe\nRupert Neate replies:\nThanks for your letter. Felix exists\nnot only to entertain, but also to\ngive students the opportunity to\nhave a go at being journalists.\nWhat would hold your attention?\nI think we\u2019ve got quite a good\nbalance of funny and serious stuff;\nit\u2019s certainly less serious than\nlast year. Also, it does seem to be\nappealing to the students (we are\nprinting 500 more copies than last\nyear).\nFood Felix\nHi Guys,\nYour breakfast report mentioned\nhot baked beans from the JCR.\nCan you tell me at what time you\nwent? I have used the JCR for\nbreakfast, off and on, for some\neighteen months and have never\nfound anything to be hotter than\ntepid!\nOh and you don\u2019t print the prices\nbut say it is \u201call student friendly\u201d.\nMmmm maybe the grants for\nstudents are bigger than we are\nlead to beleive...\nRegards,\nGraham Ford\nHannah Theodorou, Food Editor,\nreplies:\nDear Graham,\nThankyou for reading my articles\nso avidly. Unfortunately I cannot\nspeak for Ping and Paul so the\nmatter of whether or not the beans\nwere served hot is not something\nI can resolve. As for prices,\nenclosed is the breakfast bar\u2019s\nmost recent price list. The discount\nfor students is considerable and,\ncompared to alternative breakfast\njoints, the prices are comparativey\nreasonable. By the way, students\nno longer recieve grants as\nstandard any more \u2013 funds are\nraised through repayble loans.\nLook out for my review of the main\ndining hall in the upcoming Felix.\nCoffee shops\nDear Editor,\nWhat\u2019s with these trendy coffee\nshops that litter this city we live\nin? I really don\u2019t understand why\npeople need so many places to buy\nsomething you can make yourself\nfor practically no cost at all. I\nwent walking through one part of\nthis city the other day, doing a bit\nof shopping for particular items.\nCould I find what I was looking for?\nCould I heck \u2013 every other shop\nwas selling \u201cskinny-mocha-chinofrappa-dabbi-do-das\u2026..with cream\nand chocolate sprinkles on top\u201d.\nWhere I come from, there are\nno coffee shops in the village\nstreets. Go into the nearest town\nand there\u2019s still none - people\nmake their coffee in the morning,\nusing coffee power, milk and\nboiling water. If they love their\ncoffee enough, they make a lot\nand put it all in a flask so as to\ndrink it throughout the day. Hey, it\nbeats paying \u00a32+ every time! For\nthe price of your average coffee-bar coffee, you can buy enough\ningredients to make many drinks,\nexactly the way you like them!\nI hear the average cost to the\nvendor to make you a \u2018coffee\u2019 in\none of these shops is little over 10p.\nHow much do you pay for them?\n\u00a32? \u00a33 sometimes?? You can get a\ndecent bite to fill a hole in the day\nfor that price.\nIt\u2019s also apparently \u2018trendy\u2019 to\nget this drink as a takeaway, so you\ncan return to your place of work/\nstudy holding a cup with a logo\nblazoned across it, telling everyone\nin the room that you just bought a\ndrink that was vastly overpriced\u2026.\nand isn\u2019t actually coffee! \u201cOooh look\nat me and my \u2018vanilla-decaf-lattemocha-medium roast\u2026..with toffee\nsprinkles\u2019\u2026.aren\u2019t I trendy and\ncool?!\nLast time I drank out of a paper\ncup, I was probably 8 years old.\nThe dinner ladies didn\u2019t want the\ninfants to have proper cups or\nglasses \u2013 we\u2019d end up dropping\nthem. Nowadays people will pay\nout of their noses for the privilege\nof having recycled paper (you know\nit\u2019s got old toilet roll in it!) touch\ntheir lips as they taste whatever\nfancy syrup and sprinkles they have\non their drinks.\nSo the next time you wish to\norder your \u201cskinny-mocha-chinofrappa-dabbi-do-das\u2026with God\nknows what on top\u201d, sit posing in\nthe window staring at all the folk\nyou think you\u2019re above in society,\ndrinking from a paper cup because\nthe staff don\u2019t trust you to hold a\nmug safely\u2026remember that the\nowners of the shop are laughing\ntheir bollocks off at you \u2013 you might\nas well pay to breathe and shit.\nAnonymous\nPS Tea tastes better\nBar Nights\nDear Editor,\nIt has come to my attention that\nFelix are having regular bar nights\nfor their staff in the union, where\nthe beer is paid for from Felix\u2019s\ncoffers.\nI was just wondering a) where the\nmoney for this beer is coming from\nand b) how the editor intends to\njustify this kind of expense on beer\nwhen surely the money could be\nbeing used to improve the facilities\navailable to writers, subeditors and\nfuture editors in the Felix\noffice?\nThanks,\nA Concerned Student\nAll at Felix collectively respond:\nFelix Bar Nights are essential if we\nare to produce a good newspaper.\nThe Imperial student body, as we\nall know, is not a very literate\nbunch. It is very hard to build up\na good team of contributors from\na group of people who have a very\nheavy study schedule and aren\u2019t\ntrying to crack into journalism.\nThis isn\u2019t Cardiff, Cambridge or\nYork, which have to fend off many\ngreat writers as everyone there\nwants to work for the Guardian.\nThere has to be some incentive\nfor people to spend hours and\nhours toiling away creating your\nnewspaper. One of those incentives\nis the Felix Bar Night. These are\nheld only about three times a term,\nand we have not yet spent over\n\u00a3200. When you consider that this\nis only 10% of the income from one\nfull page advert, the cost is negible.\nIf it were not for the hard work\nof everyone who contributes to\nFelix, we would not attract such\nadvertising. So in a sense the Felix\ncontributors are just reaping their\nreward for making the paper a\ngreat read.\nWe do also spend the money\ngenerated through advertising\non facilities \u2013 we are currently\npaying off a loan, which paid\nfor our editoral suite and are in\nthe process of investing in new\ncomputers and a camera. It is not\na question of spending money on\nbar nights instead of facilities. If\nyou believe there is a facility we\nare not offering which we could\noffer, please get in touch.\n\n"

Ask any\nfitness instructor, and they\u2019ll probably tell you that as you age, your\nmetabolism slows and becomes less\nefficient; in other words, it\u2019s harder\nto lose weight and easier to gain fat.\nHowever some studies have reported otherwise. Either way, it seems\nage is definitely an important factor.\nFurther medication and ethnicity\nare also too big variables to be left\nout of a study result.\nThis study shows just how important the peer-review system is in\nscience; it gives non-science journalists and writers an easy way to\ndecide if a paper is worth reporting\nto the general public, which ultimately helps the reader.

As well as weighing\nup salaries, holiday time and\nbonuses, how about taking time\nto consider the company\u2019s impact\non society and the environment?\nPeople cannot have failed to notice\nthe worldwide shift towards consideration for the environment and\npeople\u2019s rights. Some of you might\neven be wearing your white bands\nnow or have put out their recycling\nbins this morning. While ethics will\nplay no part in many of the careers\nImperial graduates choose, others might want to take the time to\nconsider the wider implications of\ntheir employment.\nReversing the interview process\n\u2013 ethical grilling for potential\nemployers\nIt is a typical job interview: you\nhave spent an hour, apprehensively trembling, subject to intense\ngrilling, and then comes the apparently immensely important end-of-the-interview question: \u2018Have\nyou got any questions for us?\u2019 The\nnormal responses include \u2018What\ncareer development opportunities\nare there?\u2019 or \u2018Are there opportunities to work abroad?\u2019 While these\nare important questions, they are\nnot the only ones that we could\nask. What impact is this company\nhaving on society and the environ-ment; what are their policies about\nreducing their global warming\nimpact? The simple fact is that you\nhave the responsibility and power\nto ask questions about the social\nresponsibility of your potential\nemployer.\nDispelling the myth of ethical\ncareers\nBut, I hear you cry, I don\u2019t want to\nbe working in a dank, dingy base-ment, in the middle of nowhere, for\nvery little money and with minimal\ncareer advancement options. In\nfact, there are many opportunities\nto have a positive impact on peace,\nsocial justice and environmental\nsustainability while enjoying a\nchallenging, influential and financially viable career. Basically, an\nethical company places humanitarian and environmental concerns\nalongside commercial and financial pressures.\nThere are ethical careers available in both the private and public\nsectors, in areas such as investment banking and consultancy,\nas well as in traditional non-profit\norganisations. You could help\ngovernments achieve non-prolif-eration of nuclear weapons, companies respond to climate change,\nand charities support and build\ncommunities\nAnd that is only naming a few.\nEthical careers \u2013 a new trend\nThe number of companies that\nconsider themselves ethical, while\nat the same time fitting the criteria\nfor a fulfilling career described\nabove, is growing in Britain. For\nexample, solarcentury advertises\nits ethical purpose (solar energy)\nand ethical business manners,\nand is also ranked the 25th fastest growing technology company\nin Britain (www.solarcentury.\nco.uk). This is all-important at a\ntime when oil prices and concern\nover global warming has reached\nan all-time high. WhitbyBird is\nan engineering consultancy that\nhas made environmental sustainability a priority (www.whitbybird.\ncom). The trend is also evident in\nthe recent increasing function of\nCorporate Social Responsibility\n(CSR) departments in companies.\nOf course, you are not limited to\na company that terms itself \u2018ethical\u2019; there are many ethical jobs\navailable embedded within larger\ncompanies. For example, in the\npublic sector you could contribute to policies determining social\nresponsibilities for companies. In\naddition, it is in academia where\nmany of the technologies are first\ndeveloped that aid and support\nethical criteria.\nSo why mention all this now?\nIt may help to keep ethics in mind\nat the Union Careers Fair on the\n9th and 10th November. Any organisation affects its surroundings, so\nas a potential employee you may\nwant to consider the nature of that\neffect and whether you believe that\nit is justified, and there may as a\nresult be some alternative questions that you may want to ask at\nthe fair.\nPlus, if the taster provided in\nthis article has piqued your interest about future career prospects,\nthen you can wait in eager anticipation for the Ethical Careers\nExhibition, which is organised\nby the Pugwash Society and\nEnvironmental Society with support from the Careers Advisory\nservice and Volunteer Centre. The\nfair will provide information about\nimmediate internships and volun-teering, as well as graduate jobs,\nincluding skills and qualification\nrequirements and constructive\nideas for how to meet these.\nLetitia Hughes\nEthical Careers Exhibition:\nWed 1 Feb 2006, Great Hall.\nWebsite: www.union.ic.ac.uk/\nethicalcareersexhibition\nE-mail: www.ethicalcareers\nexhibition@imperial.ac.uk\nEthical careers in science\nY\nou only need to browse\nthrough the daily newspaper to find an article related to health. If\nyou\u2019re lucky you might\neven find a nice glossy supplement\ncompletely dedicated to the newest\ndiets, the quickest way to lose that\nexcess fat and the new, updated\nline-up of good foods, which will\nguarantee you a \u2018longer, healthier\nlife\u2019. Then there\u2019s the ever-increas-ing band of nasty foods, which will\nrot your teeth, give you spots and\nturn you into a big, blubbery circle\nof lard. It\u2019s all based on scientific\nresearch, so it must be true, right?\nNot necessarily. A study published\nearlier this year by the University of\nKansas claims that a lot of research\ndone on the effects of weight loss,\nexercise and a combination of both\non general health and fitness of subjects is inaccurate.\nAccording to the study, these\npapers fail to report all the variables of the subjects involved in the\ntrials. For example, of the reports\nscrutinized, 92% failed to report the\nuse of further medication by sub-jects, 86% \u2013 their ethnicity and 11%\n\u2013 their age.\nWhy should we care? The problem\nis that a lot of the newspaper arti-cles, popular health books and all the\ncommon dietary advisory reading\nmaterial take their information from\nthese original papers. Journalists\nand writers \u2018translate\u2019 the findings\nfrom jargon-loaded scientific papers\nto easily accessible informative arti-cles. This is for the benefit of the\nreaders, who don\u2019t want to have\nto sift through the load of statistics normally found in the original\npapers. They just want to know how\nthat research will affect them, or\nwhat the basic steps to obtain the\n(usually) beneficial results reported\nfrom the research are.\nThe journalists are therefore acting as a sort of interpreter, explaining to the readers why the research\nis important to them. Unfortunately,\nmany of these journalists fail to dissect the papers properly, and simply\ntake the results as infallible. They\nthen report these to their read-ers, who take the information to be\nbeyond doubt. So they go on to fol\u201cReporting Quality of Randomized\nTrials in the Diet and Exercise\nLiterature for Weight Loss\u201d.\nCheryl A Gibson, Erik P Kirk,\nJames D LeCheminant, Bruce W\nBailey Jr, Guoyuan Huang and\nJoseph E Donnelly\nBMC Medical Research\nMethodology 2005, 5:9 (23\nFebruary 2005)\nYou are what you eat, but don\u2019t believe what you read\nRichard Chatwin warns about the dangers of believing the dietary supplements\u2019 interpretation of science.\n\u201cUnfortunately, many\nof these journalists fail\nto dissect the papers\nproperly and simply\ntake the results as\ninfallible.\u201d\nists and writers.\nHowever, the biggest lesson you\ncould take away from this, regardless of how accurate or reliable this\nstudy is, is that, at least when it\ncomes to health and fitness arti-cles, it\u2019s probably worth reading\naround and about the subject at\nhand, before making those crucial\nlifestyle changes. It might save you\na lot of time and effort, and you\nmight find some useful information\nor even another, better diet or fitness regime.\nBut if you\u2019ve really paid attention\nwhilst reading, you\u2019ll probably want\nto check out the research paper\nin question here, and then decide\nwhether or not to believe any of\nthis.\nRead the original paper at:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/\ncontent/pdf/1471-2288-5-9.pdf\n\n"

Yet as a\nscientific alternative to Darwinism\nit is. Why can ID not be taught in\nreligious classes, evolution in biology classes, and let those in the line\nof fire \u2013 the children themselves\n\u2013 choose between them? Or is that\na compromise beyond the grasp of\nthese two gladiators of society? One\nthing is for certain, though: we live\nin troubled times.\nof incremental mutation. Even more\noutrageous arguments (such as why\nwe do not see missing links, say, a\nbird with a bony tail and teeth in\nits beak in the world today) appear\nto undermine Darwinian evolution\nsuperficially. These concepts elaborate on one aspect of evolution, such\nas animals evolving from ancestors,\nwhilst ignoring the associated idea\nof ancestors becoming extinct due\nto competitive exclusion.\nHow can an idea that rivals evolution maintain a viable challenge if it\nselectively ignores those aspects of\nits adversary which it finds too awkward to explain away? It appears\nthat ID is mounting a challenge\nbased on half-truths and misconcep-tions. Its proponents protest it is not\nabout God per se, yet God is merely\nreplaced by an abstract \u201chigher\npower\u201d. This is illustrated further\nby the fact that ID is a repackaging of \u201ccreation science\u201d which was\nbanned by the US Supreme Court\nin 1987. Why? For amounting to\nreligious teaching in schools, something which contradicts the First\nAmendment. Even the central textbook of ID, Of Pandas and People,\nwas originally drafted as a creationist textbook.\nThe ultimate paradox of ID is\nthat it professes to be a scientific\ntheory whilst not being based in\nany way on observations gathered\nfrom research, and has no falsifiable\nhypotheses.

A subsequent\neruption of conflict has emerged\nbetween those who see ID as the\nfirst step on the road to a religiously\noriented state and society, and those\nwho see it merely as the antithesis to scientific understanding and\nknowledge.\nThe general thrust of ID is that\nit sees life as being far too complicated to have arisen by chance;\ninstead, it must have been designed\nby a \u201chigher power\u201d. Furthermore,\nit argues the concept of \u201cirreducible complexity\u201d \u2013 remove one of\nthe stages in a metabolic pathway,\nthen it falls apart, so it could not\nhave evolved in a Darwinian sense\ning in fact.\nTrue, evolution remains a theory,\nbut a theory with a huge amount of\nevidence to support it.

    "content": "A Picture is Worth a\nThousand Words\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nM\ny2pence:Slow-paced,\ncolourful, descriptive\nand devoid of any\nreal story. A timeless\nclassic, nonetheless,\nthat is a fascination to behold and\na pleasure to read.\nWhen I decided to review a Nobel\nPrize winning novella by, arguably,\none of the greatest writers of 20th\ncentury English Literature, I found\nit a real challenge. There are persons of far greater wisdom and far\ndeeper insight than yours truly that\nhave dedicated entire lifetimes in\nstudy and admiration of this novella,\nif not the author himself. Therefore,\nmy criticising Mr Hemingway\u2019s\nparamount achievement should be\ntaken with as much cynicism as\nthe reader believes I deserve. For,\ncriticise it, I did. When I re-read\nthis novella for reviewing purposes,\nI emptied my mind of any notions\nI had earlier as to the genius of\nErnest Hemingway and the fact\nthat I had enjoyed this book before.\nFirstly, this is indeed a novella \u2013 a\nvery thin read that should take about\ntwo days to tear through for the\naverage reader. However, a quick\nread this is not. It is extremely slow\nto get through and remains so even\nthroughout its \u2018climax\u2019. Yet, this is\nnot a book to be laboured through,\nbuttobesavoured.Theauthoroffers\nthe reader gratuitous amounts of\ngorgeously selected prose and near\ninfinite descriptions \u2013 all done in a\nmasterful manner clearly portray-being that a lot of it is given away\nin the title itself and what actually\ntakes place can be summed up in a\nparagraph.\nHowever, this is far from an\nunsatisfying read. What the author\nhas managed to accomplish is to\ncapture a moment from his imagination and display it in its entirety\nto the world \u2013 not unlike a picture or\nsculpture, which, I believe, was his\nintention. The title, the reader will\nnotice, could be to a painting. No,\nnot much happens in this book in\nterms of plot, but that\u2019s not the kind\nof creation the author (or is it artist,\nnow?) wanted. The author simply\nshows us the status quo \u2013 a poor,\nold man starving with no prospects\nto survive except for a struggle he\nprobably cannot win; and, in doing\nso, he generates a deeper level\nof sympathy than any plot driven\nnarrative could achieve. The reader cannot help but be taken into\nthe hopelessness, perseverance\nand blind hope that the protagonist embodies; instead of waiting\nto see what happens to a distant\ncharacter, the reader, in essence,\nbecomes the old man. This closeness to the character is the driving\nforce behind the storm of emotions\nproduced when this book is read, as\nit certainly was with this reader.\nThis creation is nothing like an\nordinary piece of literature; it says\nnothing but shows us more than\ncould ever be said. The story goes\nnowhere but takes our hearts with it\nnonetheless. I believe it was Oscar\nWilde who said, \u201cThe only excuse\nfor making a useless thing is that\none admires it intensely. All art is\nquite useless.\u201d This, my fellow read-ers, is an exquisite read and a work\nof art if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\nThe Old Man & The Sea\nby Ernest Hemingway\nRetesh Bajaj\ning his talents and experience. The\nwritten word appears to be carefully\nselected to avoid losing the reader\u2019s\ninterest with an overflow of meaningless imagery; he uses language\nas paint yet is careful not to dazzle\nus with colour, as it were. The quality of writing by Mr Hemingway can\nnever be doubted to be among the\nbest in modern English; he has an\ninnate sense of getting the reader\nto follow him into the depths of his\nmind and see with his eyes \u2013 a quality which many attempt to emulate\ntoday, without success.\nThe story for this novella is pretty much non-existent; there is an\nencounter with a big fish as the Old\nMan in question goes fishing one\nday and this is a description of that\nevent. I certainly don\u2019t believe that\nwarrants the word story. The reason\nThe American\nDreamer\nOf Mice And Men\nby John Steinbeck\nRetesh Bajaj\nM\ny 2 pence: tragic,\nhumorous and well\nwritten; simple in\nidea and brilliant in\nexecution \u2013 the ideal\n\u2018light\u2019 literature read that can be\nsped through in no time at all.\nThroughout the history of\nLiterature, there has never been\na more quintessentially American\nvoice than that of John Steinbeck.\nHis novels, by and large, cover the\ntheme of poverty and the quest for\nthe American Dream \u2013 the idea of\nself-sufficiency, independence and\nchoice. Perhaps understandable as\nhe grew up in and was greatly influenced by the Great Depression, his\nnovels carry a dark undertone of\nhopelessness and futility \u2013 something very obvious in this short\nnovel. His honest style portraying\nthe true brutality of the economic\ndisaster of those decades on the\ncommon blue-collar American led\nhim to, deservedly, win enormous\nliterary acclaim \u2013 including the\nPulitzer Prize, National Book Award\nand even the coveted Nobel Prize.\nThis novella, set during the Great\nDepression in America, centres on\nthe fortunes of two poor farmers on\nthe road in America searching for\nwork; the one large, strong and of little intelligence and the other smart\nand almost fatherly in taking care\nof his comrade. They have a dream\n\u2013 to be able to earn enough to buy\na piece of land for themselves and\nwork on their own time and terms;\ngrow what they need to survive\nand never have the need to work\nanother job again. As with most of\nSteinbeck\u2019s works this tragic book\nis tinted with wit and casual light\nheartedness in sharp contrast to the\npainfully moving climax the author\npresents to the reader. It is a story\nabout the true meaning of friend-ship, bitter irony and the failure of\nhope that so many experienced in\nMiddle America during that period.\nSteinbeck\u2019s characters are vibrant\nand colourful, if a tad one-dimen-sional, which is to be expected in a\nnovella as very little time is devoted\nto character progression. They are\nwho and what they are and that\ndoesn\u2019t change throughout. Yet, his\ncharacters are delightfully believa-ble, allowing the reader to laugh and\ncommiserate with them, adding to\nthe overall strength of the writing.\nThe conclusion of this novella\ndoes, however, feel a bit rushed,\nlacking the near perfect tempo of\nthe rest of the narrative \u2013 perhaps\nto add to a sense of urgency and to\ncatch the reader off guard with its\nmessage. Unfortunately, the author\nfails in this aspect, at least with this\nreader, and the ending seems too\nabrupt, though still powerful enough\nto make this more than a satisfying\nread.\nSteinbeck\u2019s book is far from per-fect, but it brings to heart a type of\nhumanity that is very hard to find\nin other books \u2013 the prospects faced\nby his protagonists never seem to\nbe impossible or fantastic, but only\ntoo real. It isn\u2019t a monument to the\nAmerican spirit nor is it inspiration-al, but it is what every person out\nthere can relate to. This realism is\nthe reason readers such as I return\nto this piece of literature every year\nor so \u2013 to remember that some-times, dreams don\u2019t come true.\nfashion fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nbooks\nS\nometimes when I look at\nthe medical school, I wonder about what sort of doctors they\u2019ll all make.

I am fully aware of\nthe differences but my point holds\ntrue for all, if they are not British\ncitizens, why should the British\ntax payer pay for them to sit in a\nprison cell? I also felt I made it very\nclear that I was fully aware of the\nconsequences for some people if\nthey were deported; I said that if\nthey really were being terrorised\nin their own country they would be\nmore careful not to break the law\nbecause they would have so much\nto lose.\nI am not talking about someone\nbeing caught speeding here but\nthings like human trafficking, rape\nand beating women are fairly major\ncrimes and, to me, they suggest\nthat the people who do them are\nnot very nice and can probably\nlook after themselves in a country\nthat is less friendly and welcoming\nthan Britain. Likewise, if they are\na terrorist from a rather extreme\ncountry I would not suggest they\nare sent back to their own country\nbecause they might be free to commit more atrocious acts against\nBritain later on.\nHe also said that I had a \u2018loose\ngrip\u2019 on the asylum figures in\nBritain, it is wonderfully true what\nyou can prove with figures, for\nexample I can prove that there are\nmore new asylum seekers applying\neach year than there are failed asylum seekers being deported (mainly\nbecause the Government can\u2019t\ncatch them), therefore the number\nin Britain is increasing and I feel\nthis shouldn\u2019t be the case.\nAnd in that final sentence we\nhave the crux of the matter; \u2018I\nfeel\u2019; it is my opinion. I love Britain\nbut frankly I want to emigrate to\nAustralia because I am so fed up\nof the political situation in this\ncountry. I freely admit what I am\nand do; I vote conservative because\n1) I don\u2019t like the amount of tax I\nhave to pay, 2) I hate Tony Blair and\n3) I want to go fox hunting again.\nAlex, in my opinion, is a liberal,\nworld saving do-gooder whereas\nI think that we, in Britain, have to\nlook after our own interests first\nand make sure that everything is\nsorted in our own country before\nwe go to save everyone else.\nI don\u2019t want to cut all\ncommunication to the rest of\nthe world (I\u2019m not a communist,\nfar from it) but I think it\u2019s more\nimportant to sort out things like\nthe NHS and the failing education\nsystem than piss off the entire\nMiddle East. No other country is\nso obsessed with correcting all the\nwrongs in the world as us; America\nonly does it because it is to their\nown advantage. What is perhaps\neven worse is the fact that we don\u2019t\nactually try to save everyone, at\nleast then we would be consistent.\nWhen thousands of people in\nZimbabwe were being terrorised\nby Robert Mugabe, no one lifted a\nfinger to stop it because they were\nall too scared of being called racist,\nex colonials trying to reclaim their\nlost empire.\nI know that to Alex all of this will\nmake me seem stupid, insular and\nunaware of the political situation in\nthe world - but that is his opinion.\nBring me political revival\nThe almost\nguaranteed\nfailure of the\npolicy to thwart\na terrorist attack\nnulli\ufb01es the\nexercise.\n\u201c\nIain Heaton\nfelix\nThis isn\u2019t school\nAlthough the rationale for introducing the ruling that forces students to display their swipe card\nat all times is understandable, the\nalmost guaranteed failure of the\npolicy to thwart a potential terrorist\nattack nullifies the exercise. For the\npolicy to fulfil its objective, Security\nOfficers would need to be stationed\nat every single entrance to campus,\nwhich would drain College\u2019s already\nstretched resources.\nIf a potential intruder desired\naccess to College he/she would not\nhave to do much homework to discover the public right of way along\nImperial College Road, from which\nany building in College is readily\naccessible.\nIt looks likely that the only thing\nthe dress code will achieve is to\nget students riled. Most freshers\narriving at university are elated at\nbeing able to throw off the shackles\nof imposed dress codes and start\nexpressing themselves through\nthe way they dress. It looks like\nImperial College does not believe\nin freedom of expression through\ndress.\nThe success or failure of this\ndirective is in the hands of the student body. If the students decide on\nmass to flout these new rules, the\nCollege will have to back down and\nhave a re-think.

In some departments the\nnotice was forwarded to all staff and\nstudents, but in others it was only\npinned up on obscure noticeboards.\nWhen Felix asked Imperial when\nthe students would be properly\ninformed, we were told; \u201cCollege\nnotices are distributed widely, not\nonly to academic departments,\nbut also to the ICU President and\nPermanent Secretary, and we hope\nthat the Union will work with us to\nensure the students are aware of\nCollege rules\u201d. However, Sameena\nMisbahuddin, Union President told\nFelix, \u201cIt is up to College to enforce\nthe rules. If there is a health and\nsafety matter, I will inform the students\u2026 I certainly won\u2019t be enforcing the hoodies ruling\u201d.\nAlthough, the code is intended for\nsecurity purposes, it also includes\ncaveats on \u201coffensive dress\u201d. The\nnotice states that \u201cwhere it is perceived that a particular slogan or\nsymbol is offensive, the wearing of\nsuch slogans or symbols may be\nconsidered a disciplinary offence\nand dealt with accordingly\u201d.\nThis appears to have very little to\ndo with thwarting potential terrorist attacks on campus and seems\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUniversity of Kent takes over at Wye\nTheBearmanCommittee\u2019sProposal\nis being finalised this month,\nbestowing upon the University of\nKent at Canterbury (UKC) the task\nof piloting the future of Wye cam-pus. Now the question students\nare asking themselves is no longer\nwhat is happening to the campus,\nbut why did Imperial ever delve into\nthe rural Kent countryside?\nOn the lips of many students is\nthe question: \u201cWhat exactly have\nImperial contributed to enhancing\nstudent life in Wye?\u201d Surely the\nisolation of the campus should have\nbeen compensated for somehow. An\nimproved Student Union Building,\nor the continuation of more than\none undergraduate course at the\ncampus, would have been nice.\nIt is thought that Imperial ought to\nhave adequately implemented management of the changes. These criticisms originate from the College\u2019s\nlack of action to keep lecturers on\nor to appear concerned about their\nfutures, even though students still\nneed them after having developed\nthat fundamental student-teacher\nrelationship. Communication to\nstakeholders over the future of\nthe campus was also neglected.\nIronically, the College places a\nheavy emphasis on the successful\nmanagement of such elements in\nthe Applied Business Management\ncourse, the single undergraduate\ndegree now running in Wye.\nIt has been argued that the\nCollege didn\u2019t want to make a statement saying \u2018something will be\nhappening to your campus, but we\ndon\u2019t know what yet\u2019. However, a\npress release was published on the\nImperial website over the summer\nholidays, only noticed by a handful\nof the more media-attentive stu-dents.\nImperial College is very punctual\nin sending invoices for accommodation and tuition fees, and demands\npunctuality in students\u2019 response.\nSo it seems peculiar that College\nfailed to inform students that their\ncourse and department would be\nclosed down over the following\nyear.\nAside from the communication\nelement, students\u2019 perceptions of\nthe proposals are mixed. Some see\nImperial as tyrants that UKC will be\nproviding an escape from, whereas\nothers regret having to part from\nImperial College, although they concede that it may enhance the welfare of student life in Wye. Students\nand alumni are hoping that UKC\nwill actually adopt the campus as\none of its own, rather than dismiss\nit as a hindrance and actually place\nimportance on the undergraduate\nteaching of Business Management.\nThe agricultural component, the\nfoundation of Wye\u2019s history and tra-dition, has all but gone. However, in\nfairness, Wye College had originally\nadapted from being the horticultural Swanley College, so changing\nwith the times is inherent to the\ninstitution. Does this make it all\nright for Imperial to disrobe Wye of\nagriculture, or is it entirely different\nas Wye College was established in\nan altogether more agreeable and\ngood-natured fashion?\nWye students wonder whether the\nCollege took over the campus in\nan authentic venture for growth\nand diversification, or whether the\ntakeover was ever taken seriously.\nWill the College actually sustain an\ninterest once UKC have taken the\nreigns, or are they just saying that\nthey will? And will they actually\ncommunicate the answers to these\nquestions to Wye students properly,\nor will a few geeks who constantly\ncheck the Imperial website tell us\nover MSN?\nSahota Dawinderpal\n3\nfelix\nThursday 10 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix wins award\nScience Felix journalist, Zo\u00eb\nCorbyn, won the runner-up best\nstudent feature writer award\nat this year\u2019s Guardian Student\nMedia Awards. The Awards are\nthe most presitigous student\nmedia awards in the country with\njudges including Channel 4 News\npresenter Jon Snow and Piers\nMorgan of Daily Mirror fame.\nThe judges said about Zo\u00eb\u2019s\nwork: \u201cHer writing has lovely\nrhythm and showed an excellent\neye for detail. It is also encouraging to see someone with the confidence to pick their own subject.\u201d\nI, Science, Felix\u2019s new spin-off\nscience magazine, was nominated in the catergory of Best\nStudent Magazine. Over 400\nentries were recieved in this cat-egory, and the winner was Cardiff\nUniversity\u2019s Quench. Cardiff\nUniversity did tremendously\nwell at the awards, also scooping\nNewspaper of the Year, and its\neditor, James Anthony, won the\nStudent Journalist of the Year\naward.\nZo\u00eb paid tribute to last year\u2019s\neditors of both Felix and I,\nScience: \u201cDave and Darius were\nreally encouraging and supportive with the features I wrote.\nI,Science was an ambitious new\nproject and its recognition at the\nawards shows people really do\nlike reading about science.\u201d\nDave Edwards said: \u201cIt\u2019s the\nfirst time we\u2019ve had any nominations for the Guardian awards\nin at least 6 years, and possibly\nthe first time ever, so obviously\nwe\u2019re very pleased, especially as\nI, Science is such a new publica-tion. I think this shows just how\ngood Imperial\u2019s student media is\n\u2013 we\u2019ve got no arts students but\nwe still produced one of the five\nbest student magazines in the\nUK. Zo\u00eb did brilliantly to be voted\nrunner-up.\u201d\nZo\u00eb said: \u201cI loved writing for\nthe student press because you\nhave free reign to write about any\nsubject you want and experiment\nwith your style. There\u2019s heaps of\ninteresting stuff going on around\ncampus. Finding a story that\nneeds to be told is like finding a\ngold nugget \u2013 you just want to\npolish it up and tell everybody.\u201d\nIf you want to do as well as Zo\u00eb,\nwhy not write for Felix, e-mail\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. Zo\u00eb graduated from from Imperial last\nyear with an MSc in Science\nCommunication.\nWhat not to wear\ncontinued from page 1\nshare of responsibility for the safety\nof the Imperial community \u2013 it is for\ntheir benefit.\u201d\nSecurity Officers are already\nattempting to enforce the new directive and have been challenging students and staff at various entrances\nto College armed with neck chains\nto hand out to offending students.\nAlthough most students appear to\nbe ignoring the ruling, Ceri Davies,\nHead of Security at the South\nKensington Campus, told Felix he\nthought that \u201cthere was no reason\nwhy the ruling would be unenforceable [although he] appreciates we\nare not a commercial company\u201d. He\nbelieves it will take time and \u201cwon\u2019t\nbe throwing people off campus in\nthe first few weeks\u201d.\nOn Tuesday a Felix journalist\noverheard a Security Officer in conversation with a woman, who was\nasked whether she was a student or\nmember of staff. When she replied\nthat she was neither and was \u201cjust\ngoing to the shop\u201d, the officer just\nwaved her onto campus. When Felix\ninformed Mr Davies of this apparent security lapse, we were told the\nruling was being \u201cenforced only\nfor College buildings and not the\nwhole campus\u201d. Another Security\nOfficer said he did not like challenging students, as he feels he\nmay be \u201cintimidating\u201d them.\nThe decision was made by\nImperial\u2019s Management Board, a\nselect group of eleven Principal\nCollege Officers, on 21 October. This\nis the same body which made the\ncontroversial decision to merge the\nfaculities of Life and Physical sciences (Felix 1333). Both of these\ndecision were made without\nany consultation with\nthe students or the\nStudents Union.\nAlthough the\ndecision was made\nnearly three weeks\nago, most of the students Felix talked to\nwere unaware of the\nnew directive. An\ne-mail notice was\nsent to all Heads of\nDepartment on 2\nto have just been tacked onto the\nnotice. Felix reporters could not find\nany students who recollect seeing\nanyone walking around College in\noffensive clothing. College skirted\naround Felix\u2019s question as to why\nthey have included this point when\nthere is not an apparent problem.\nThey did not say whether or not they\nthought there was an offensive dress\nproblem. Instead a spokesperson\nsaid, \u201cImperial is a cosmopolitan\nand international community and\nwe have long had protocols against\noffensive (racist, sexist, homopho-bic) language. The College Notice\nis a reminder to staff and students\nthat this exists and also applies to\nslogans on clothing\u201d.\nIn contrast to the usual apathy of\nthe Imperial student body many are\nincensed at what has been described\nas \u201can attack on civil liberties\u201d. A\nfirst-year physicist told Felix, \u201cI\nthought I had left uniforms behind\nwhen I left school. Isn\u2019t university supposed to be the most liberal\ntime of your life? Isn\u2019t an imposed\ndress code the exact opposite of\nliberalism?\u201d The banning of hoodies\nand \u201coffensive clothing\u201d seem to be\ncausing the most annoyance. One\nstudent told Felix: \u201cThis isn\u2019t bloody\nBluewater, it\u2019s a university\u201d.\nGenteel Imperial College at Wye, soon to become part of the University of Kent.\nLeft to right: Darius Nikbin (I, Science Editor 2004-5), Zo\u00eb Corbyn\nand Dave Edwards (Felix Editor 04-05).\n\n"

At this point the silky\nskills of Parrot started to grab a\nhold on the game as he started a\nmazy run through the all 11 of the\n1st team which won a corner. Hideki\nwas starting to find space on the left\nand the midfield pairing of Pricey\nand Ant were chomping all over\nLouis and JR. A Louis corner then\nmissed everyone and was curling\nin till the intervention of AK on\nthe line. JR then fizzed a shot that\nwas turned over by the impressive\nMike. The 2nd\u2019s started to exert\na period of pressure with Gready\nworking the ball out wide for Hideki\nand Parrot to work their stuff. Then\ncame the best chance of the game\nso far as Parrot again beat his man\nfor skill and slipped the ball through\nfor DAL. The trap was beaten, but\nDAL\n\u2019s shot slid agonisingly wide of\nthe post. Half time came with the\n2nd\u2019s tails up and the 1st\u2019s looking\nsubdued.\nThe second half started with the\n1st team looking to buck their ideas\nup, but couldn\u2019t find the killer bit of\ninspiration they so craved. The first\nchance of the half came towards\nWill from a Hideki corner but the\nmelon-headed one again spurned\nthe chance when his salmon leap at\nthe far post failed. With no-nonsense\ndefending from the seconds, several\nstops were required to retrieve balls\nfor the play to continue. As the game\nwore on, the firsts began to push\non further looking for that goal and\nas they did so the spaces started to\nopen up with Parrot starting to cause\nthe Beef problems with his direct\nrunning. Mid way through the half\nthe seconds were denied the opener\nas again. Parrot fed DAL the ball\nwho calmly slotted home, only for a\nblatant piss-take by the firsts\u2019 linesman to give off-side. Again and again\nthe firsts looked for a way through,\nsport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Merseyside, the Old Firm, the\nMilan: three passionately fought\nlocal derbies. However, there is one\nfixture in football that surpasses\nthem all. Imperial firsts against\nImperial seconds. With the demise\nof the medics (Ha-ha!) this fixture\nnow takes precedence in the football calendar. In recent years the\nrivalry has been well battled out\nwith the firsts usually gaining the\nupper hand. But with the seconds\non a high from their blistering BUSA\nform coupled with a couple of committed and proud, if not fully suc-cessful, performances in ULU, the\nscript was asked if he could please\nstand up, walk to the window and\nthrow himself out of it. At stake\nwere not only 3 points in ULU but\nbragging rights for the whole of the\nseason. This one is not for the faint\nhearted.\nThe game started brightly with\ntackles flying in and no-one given\nany time on the ball. The firsts were\nlooking to get forward early and\nkill the game quickly. With Irvine\nmaking the runs, T was left to link\nup the defence with attack, but with\nthe imperious moon-faced MacAdie\nand the shark-like Milad in defence,\nany balls not hit to perfection were\ndealt with contempt they deserved.\nHowever the ball started to get out\nto Pavel on the left, and his runs\nPhil Price\nMens Football\nImperial 1st XI 0\nImperial 2nd XI 1\nBrown on\nSport\nStephen Brown\nSports Editor\nbut apart from a half chance that\nfell to Irvine they were getting noth-ing.

    "content": "who apparently ignores his lack of\ninterest and leaves him her phone\nnumber anyway.\nOnce in Elizabethtown, Kentucky,\nDrew meets his relatives and is\nthrown into a journey of getting to\nknow his dad with whom he has\nbecome estranged due to his work-obsession. Having a mother and a\nsister who were both coming to grips\nwith their own loss and a girlfriend\nwho has dumped him for greener\npastures, Drew calls Claire and the\nsingle phone call soon extends to\nwhat-must-have-been an 8-hour\nconversation.\nWill they or won\u2019t they? That is the\nmillion-dollar question. As expected\nfrom Cameron Crowe\u2019s film Jerry\nMaguire, this film is another one of\nthose all-men-are-idiots or rather\nyou-never-appreciate-what-you-have stories. However, before we\nset off condemning the ubiquitous\nplot, let\u2019s focus on what set Jerry\nMaguire apart from the rest of the\nromantic comedies.\nFirstly, it isn\u2019t the line \u201cYou complete me\u201d. (That\u2019s a ridiculous line, if\nyou don\u2019t mind me saying.) However,\nit wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched to say that\nboth scripts for Jerry Maguire and\nElizabethtown were both simple\nand tastefully done. It\u2019s basically\nthe mood of the movie that strikes\nyou. Just like in Jerry Maguire, the\natmosphere in Elizabethtown is\ncalm, peaceful and slightly melan-cholic.\nOnce again, Cameron Crowe displays his unique taste and ability to\ncatch the softest and most beautiful of human emotion on camera.\nThere are numerous scenes in the\nH\ne started off as an ethereal prince from the\nland of the elves, only\nto be emasculated later\nin his stint as Paris in\nTroy. This time around, Orlando\nBloom takes the lead in romantic\ncomedy, Elizabethtown with the\ncute and spunky Kirsten Dunst. Will\nhe or won\u2019t he re-dignify himself in\nthe hearts of women everywhere?\nThis was what I wanted to find out.\nOrlando Bloom plays the workaholic footwear designer, Drew\nBaylor. Unfortunately for the young\nand upcoming inventor, he has just\nlost his company $972 million and\nconsequently, he lost his job. (Duh!)\nHe\u2019s all set to kill himself with a\nstrange stabbing device he created\nfrom his stationary bicycle but his\nsuicide attempt is postponed temporarily when he receives the news of\nhis father\u2019s death.\nAs he is the eldest son, he is forced\ninto the responsibility of returning\nhis father\u2019s body to Oregon from\nKentucky by his mother, Hollie\n(Susan Sarandon). On his lonely\nplane ride to Kentucky, he encounters the kooky and neurotic steward-ess, Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst),\nElizabethtown- Hit or snooze?\nDespite vitriolic reviews, Felix decides to check it out and here\u2019s our review.\nfilm that truly deserves mentioning.\nOne of them includes the flashback\nscene of Drew as a child, wearing\nhis father\u2019s shoes. Another artistic\nshot was the scene of Drew scattering his father\u2019s ashes into the river\nand by the statue in Oklahoma City.\nTo be honest, it\u2019s difficult to be a\nsceptic in reviewing this film. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful film and it is disarming to\nsee how the strong and silent Drew\ncrumples and collects himself emo-tionally. It is also particularly touching and perhaps even otherworldly\n\ufb01lm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nto witness the instant connection\nof two people who do not; on the\nsurface have anything in common\nat all.\nA lot of people might watch this\nfilm and brush it off as another one\nof those Hollywood\u2019s attempts to\ncharm the pounds off our pockets.\nHowever, think about it this way.\nForget Orlando Bloom. It\u2019s just a\nstory of a man on a journey to overcome his guilt and loss and when it\nseems as if his life is permanently\nlost in quicksand, he meets someone who pulls him out of it.\nWatch Elizabethtown because you\nwouldn\u2019t regret it. Take it anyway\nyou please, be it as a first-date film\nor as a touching-artistic film. It\u2019s\none of the rare films that entertains\nand soothes you as well. Personally,\nI\u2019m a big fan of Orlando Bloom\u2019s\neasy smile and pretty brown eyes,\nbut then again, it\u2019s the story behind\nElizabethtown that takes my breath\naway. Not him.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nTwo people who meet- is it a coincidence or is it fate?\nElizabethtown\nDirector: Cameron Crowe\nStarring: Orlando Bloom, Kirsten\nDunst and Susan Sarandon.\nLength: 124 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nReleased:4 November 2005\nHHHII\nO\u2019 Lord!

for ICSM 2nd XI\nMens Football\nICSM 2nd XI 3\nImperial College 3rd XI 1\nJason Adhikaree\nIC3\u2019ssecondmeetingwithyetanother ICSM team this season has predictably ended with another defeat.\nWhat the IC players lacked in heart\nand commitment, they made up\nfor with unsporting behaviour and\nunnecessary verbal abuse. A special\nmention must go to the \u201cgentleman\u201d\n(if I can call him that) in the number\n7 shirt on the IC team. The away\nteam opened the scoring with their\nfirst attacking move, despite the\nMedics dominating most of the first\nhalf. A corner and the subsequent\ngoalmouth scramble led to IC\u2019s only\ngoal. With their confidence unjustly\nhigh and their egos boosted, the 3rd\nXI\u2019s fall from grace was far more\npainful than expected.\nThe Medics were unable to convert most of their chances into goals\nand ironically, the equaliser was\npretty ugly and not exactly typical\nof their fluid performance during\nthe game. A timid cross into the box\nwas fumbled by the goalkeeper who\ndived to the ground with the grace of\na beached whale as the ball slithered\nunder his considerable waistline for\nVikas, the Medics sharpshooter to\nslot home. To put this into perspec-tive, the goalkeeper looked like Rik\nWaller and played football like Rik\nWaller. Actually, even Rik Waller\nwould have prevented the equaliser\nfrom going in.\nThe Medics carried on with the\nsame energy and commitment after\nthe break. Big Stan, the Medics cen-tre-back put in a sterling performance to ensure that IC\u2019s chances\non goal in the second half were few\nand far between. I think that must\nbe the most polite way to describe\nthe awful second half performance\nby IC. In the 55th minute, a ball\nplayed from the wing culminated\nwith Vikas coolly controlling the ball,\nturning inside and letting rip with\na 20-yard screamer that hit the top\ncorner as the medics took the lead\nthey deserved.\nWith IC realising that a second\ndefeat to the Medics was immi-nent, started to improve their\ngame although they were unable to\ncapitalise on their chances. As the\nmatch wore on, they were punished\nfor their tactical naivety when the\naway team started to commit more\nmen forward. The gaps in the back\nline were being frequently exposed\nas every Medic counterattack produced some infuriating near-misses.\nKevin, a fresher, managed to scored\non his debut for ICSM 2nd XI to\nmake the score 3-1 and put IC out of\ntheir misery, as he collected the ball\non the half way line and ran rings\naround the IC defence to slot home\na third goal for the Medics. He had\ncaused a Mount Everest of problems\nfor the opposition during the game\nwith his strength and speed, despite\nhis relative inexperience of univer-sity-level football.\nIC were rather wasteful in the\nlast 15 minutes of the game as their\ncommitment to the cause started to\nseep away, as well as their chances\nof even scraping through with an\nunlikely draw. With a second defeat\nto the Medics (they were beaten 4-1\nby the ICSM 1st XI on the first day of\nthe season), the question still stands:\nAre IC 3rd XI losing the plot?\nLoughborough Beginners is a\nmassive tournament with 32\nteams playing on 3 pitches over\n2 days. The games were each 18\nminutes long. Indoors each team\nhas 5 players on the pitch, one of\nwhom could be experienced. The\nexperienced players couldn\u2019t score\nso the beginners had to work extra\nhard.\nAfter a mediocre start and a\nvery large curry we headed off to\nLoughborough\u2019s Union in full costume (See Picture). Loughborough\nunion is one of the best in the\ncountry, they have a huge light up\ndance floor which kept us dancing\nall night. Aki had a go at DJing\nwhich went down a storm on the\ndance floor.\nThe Party Award (a giant disco\nball) went to Brunel who came as\nSmurfs and danced from start to\nfinish.\nWe got up at 8:00 and were ready\nto go but had to wait till 10:40 to play\nour first game, against Air Wolf. The\npartying had obviously done us good\nand netted us our first win of the\ntournament.\nWe needed another win to improve\nour position and to keep playing.\nWe obviously had a good thirst for\ndisc as we went out and played the\nour best game of the tournament to\nsecure the win.\nIf the previous game had felt tight,\nthe last game definitely was. Mental\nDiscs tried to equalize in the closing second but Manny laid out and\nsmashed their hopes.\nDisc Doctors came 25th out of\nthe 32 teams. With so many games\nwe all came away experienced and\nnone of us can wait to go back next\nyear.\nUltimate Frisbee\nGeorge Brownbridge\nDeviants in wet action\nFor the first time in history, the\nDeIViants faced a UCL team.\nUnfortunately this also meant we\nhad to endure the baggage that goes\nwith playing UCL. As the story goes,\n10 intrepid DeIViants and their not\nso intrepid captain set off for the\nshort journey to Surbiton in Surrey\nlooking for their first victory of the\nseason. After 2 tubes, 1 mainline\ntrain and a bus journey we had beaten the UCL team there (our only victory of the day) but by the time we\ngot there the torrential rain made\nsure the pitch was in perfect condition\u2026 for a mud wrestling match.\nHaving lost all our 3 previous\nmatches without scoring but improving greatly with each game, the\nDeIViants were looking forward to\na good match with our Drag Queen\n(Max) in centre midfield acting as\nour inspiration, defenders Maria\n(Luke) and Kama Suture (Khilan)\nholding the back together and our\nnewly acquired forward Almaher\nthe target man.\nAs we entered the pitch, we\nreleased the game wasn\u2019t going to\nbe pretty as the pitch was about as\nclean as the floor of a pub toilet and\njust as slippery as well. The game\nstarted well\u2026 for UCL, they obviously eat weetabix over in Gower\nStreet and they dominated the game\nwe conceded short corners. This\nwas our downfall as our defence\nwere rock solid in open play, how-ever, after facing Drag Flicks from\nDrag Queen in the warm up, our\ndefenders were a little tentative\nwhen running out to defend the corner and conceded, twice. With this\nin mind, we picked ourselves up and\nwent on a rampage with Post (Ray)\nand Cotton Eye Joe (Alex) troubling\nUCL with plenty of runs down the\nwings. All of this eventually led to\nus being awarded a Short corner\n(hurray!) and with the melee that\nensued we scored a goal, our first of\nthe season from man of the match\nAlmaher! With the goal the team\nwere obviously lifted and we started\nto play some good hockey.\nAfter a rather diplomatic half time\nchat, the DeIViants continued their\ntradition of playing much better in\nthe second half and this time it was\nUCL under pressure with us having\ngot used to the pitch, we started to\ndominate play and our erratic captain (Tim) started to contribute on\nthe pitch. Drag Queen started to live\nup to his name and started dancing\naround midfield with the ball setting up numerous attacks. However\nagainst play, UCL scored twice,\nowing to slips from our backline\non the increasingly slippery pitch.\nAgain we responded with 4 short\ncorners in a row fired in against\nUCL, but this time we just couldn\u2019t\nbundle it into the goal.\nThe game finished 4-1, but scoring\nour first goal was enough for us, and\nwe left the pitch fairly happily despite\nbeing drenched and covered in mud.\nWe were greeted with an excellent\ntea from UCL which we were grateful for, and for some (Maria and Slow\nOn The Uptake) there were girls to\nlook at afterwards, the rest of us\nhowever realised they had the average age of the Tanaka building and\nsteered clear of such jailbait.\nMens Hockey\nUCL 3rds 4\nImperial College 4ths 1\nTim Lui\nDisc Doctors lay sound\nfoundations\n\n"
