    "content": "FIIIX\nU1 Jt mia \u2022\niF miH9 I \u2022 1 \" II.i Ten Years After Ivan Denisovich\nby Zhores Medvedev (Penguin Books)\nIf Alexander Solzhenitsyn had not\nsuddenly become extremely fashionable\nto read,such a book would never have\nbeen published. It is a symptom of the\npublishers desire to cash in on the boom.\nAnything vaguely related to the great man\n(and I am not denying the fact that\nSolzhenitsyn is a great novel list) will sell, so publish and con the public. I wonder\nhow many people having bought this\nintroverted book will have managed to\nplough through the min u tae of detail of\nSoviet literary life. It reads like one long\nwhimpering cry that the world is not a fair place, which is hardly a dramatic\nrevelation. It also tends to reinforce the\npreconceived nations;of the USSR which we in the West possess. This is a bad\nthing to stem from the book in itself\nsince like all preconceived notions they\nare nothing like the truth. The idea tends\nto be implied that nothing like that could\never happen in the West but that in itself\nis demonstrably untrue.\nSome words must be said about the\nstyle and content of the book. The book\nchronicles the progress of soviet\nliterature from 1962 onwards. It is written\nfrom the viewpoint of the author with an\nexcessive use of phrases such as, 'I did\nthis', 'Imet him' and continuous references\nto obscure journals.\nIf you are taking a degree in Russian literature then by all means buy this book\nbut if you just happen to be vaguely\ninterested in the literature and have been\nmoved by the novels of Solzhenitsyn such\nas 'Cancer Ward', 'The First Circle' and\n'A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich' do\nnot get conned.\nThe Private Future by Martin Pawley\n(Pan Books)\nMartin Paw ley's first book not related\nto architecture consists of a closely\nreasoned analysis of the trends in consumer\nsociety. It hits home as he argues that\ncommunity in the West is gone leaving\nonly a linear pattern of supply and\nconsumption. He demonstrates how people\nare withdrawing into their private heavens,\nbuttressed by consumer durable s and\nmes meri sed by the media. The book shows\nhow this withdrawal is visibly reflected\nin Politics sport and entertainment.\nFurther, ne argues that such life has led\nto the acceptance of a preferred media induced reality as ap posed to the primary\nreality. As the logic proceeds one feels\nthat not only may such a situation exist\nfor the faceless public, but also for ones elf. At this point it becomes a profoundly\ndisturbing book and one looks, in vain for\na solution to be offered.\nIt is written in a readable manner\ndespite the sprinkling of soci a logical jargon. The book is full of phrases that\nare compelling, for example, \"alone in a centrally heated, air conditioned capsule,\ndrugged, fed with music and erotic\nimagery, the private c Hizen of the future\nwill have become one with the end of\neffort and the triumph oi sensation\". The\nindex seems both useless and pointless,\nbut this is only a small point and overall\nI would recommend it as a compelling, if\ndisturbing book. DBH\nConcerts Ian Morse\nHorslips/\nJonathan Kelly\nSaturday night's concert in the Great\nHall was really the story of an audience\n(or at least a manic section of it) taking\nover a gig as far as sheer spectacle goes,\nthe band on stage merely providing the\nnecessary spark to set off their fanatical\nfollowers on the road to what seemed,\nmust eventually lead to their ultimate\nself-destruction.\nA contingent of particular y volatile\nHorslips fans had made the journey from\nManchester especially to see their heroes\nperform. It was quite clear after the\nfirst few bars of the band's set that these\npeople were out to make the gig into an\nevent. Spurred on by obvious intoxication,\nthe scene was more reminiscent of say,\nthe Eton Wall game \u2014 bodies falling\neverywhere, groups of fans forming\nthemselves into rugby scrum s and\ncharging into each other with all the\nferocity of an All Black pack - all amazingly carried out in the greatest\nof humour. It came as no surprise that\nthe bass-player of the band appealed for\na little calm, stating that the life-expectancy up front was about one\nminute! All this and we were only into\nthe third number. So it went on, by the\nfifth song most of the audience were up\non their feet, caught up with Hors lip's particular brand of jig-rock, the Mancunians\nin front of the stage seeming to have\nsome sort of lemming complex, relentless\nin their quest to self-destruct.\nThe overall atmosphere of the event\nwas further enhanced by the fellow who\nthoughtfully chun de red by the exit door-so providing an ideal skid-trap for the\nunfortunates who took that particular\npath, and there were many. It must have\naccounted for at least a dozen people.\nAlthough their music is capable of\nmuch subtlety which they tried to expound\nwith a few slower numbers, Hors lips' attempt to vary what was always going\nto be a breakneck pace, was an abortive\none. So they gave the punters what they\nwanted \u2014 the well proven formula r of jigs/ reels and rock equal success, the\nmusicians being brought back for two\nencores.\nEarlier, Jonathan Kelly was given a generally warm reception. Having\ndispensed with his backing band Outside,\nwhich on the one occ as sion I saw them\nperform together, seemed to get in each\nothers way Kelly is fully capable of\nholding an audience by himself, with\nhis slightly whimsical offerings. Familiar Kelly songs like 'Madalaine', 'The\nCurse of Anna Store' and 'Stoned Junkies'\nwere very well received, Kelly's performance enhancing his reputation as one of\nthe countries most underrated folk\nsingers.\nVan Der Graaf Generator - Great Hall\nThere have been, occassions in the\npast when I found the Stark solemnity of\nVan Der Graaf Generator's music little\nshort of overpowering. The relentless\nviolent force portrayed in their music was\npreviously countered by tongue-in-cheek\nrenditions of, for instance, 'Dambusters'\nMarch' or 'Theme One', the signature tune\nof Radio One .Judging by the performance\ngiven by the new MK II Generator last\nTuesday night, it would seem that they\nhave forsaken this sometimes re leaving part of their person i a, instead treating\nthe audience to two and a quarter hours\nof some of the most incessant musical\nviolence he a red since Magma last invaded\nthese isles. Playing mostly new songs from the\n'Godblutf album [Undercover Man,\nScorched Earth, Larrossa), plus some\nvintage violence courtesy of 'Angels\nSavours, Refugees', 'Lemmings' and\n'Black Room', the band interpreted them-with great conviction. Peter Ham mill's distinctive voice piercing the melee of\nMahler \u2014 inspired signatures laid down by\nHugh Banton on keyboards and drummer\nGuy Evans, whilst Dave Jackson with his\narray of electric reeds (looking for all. the world like a battery-powered Action Man) adding a much needed top to the\narrangements.\nThroughout the set, Generator's intensity level was not allowed to\nslacken for a moment, each number as\nvehement as the last, showing all the\nsubtleties of a division of Panzer tanks.\nAlthough at their best hypnotically\nstimulating, this complete lack of musical\ndynamics will, in my opinion be the main\nreason why the group will always fail to\nwin'mass accept en ce like others of their\ngenre.\nAt the end of the performance Generator\nwere brought back for an 'encore by a generally ecstatic audience, although for \"\nme, two and a quarter hours of walking\nthe same high voltage tension wire can\nlead to positive overkill., NOTICE Anyone interested in joining Opsoc on Tour or in London\nas cast, stage crew, orchestra or front of house might like to\nring the Opsoc Tour nerve-centre on 720 7239.

Affairs of the heart may cause some strain on the\n20th and 26th but you' ll really feel like a ram around the 29th! TAURUS (21Apr21 May): As in the early part of the month,\nyou will still be attracting the opposite sex and enjoying the\naffections of others. The main theme changes around the 24th from\nwork to partnerships th ough the work will still go on. GEMINI (22May22 Jun): Your charming and witty nature is apt\nto spark off an affair (or two) before the end of the month. One of\nthe most likely dates is the 28th when you may also find yourself\nwinning more admirers.\nCANCER (23Jun23 Jul); There is a possibility of changes in\nyour personal affairs if they have not yet occured. It may be that\nyour attitude towards personal relationships is changing. Your\nprestige, fame and profession continues to grow especially around\nthe 19th and 28th. LEO (24Jul23 Aug): Mental activities and all sorts of communication continue to play an important role. Jupiter brings success in\neducational areas especially around the 19th and 22nd and 28th. These dates are also fortunate for romantic pleasures.\nVIRGO (24Aug23 Sep): This is really your month. Personal\nrelationships and affairs of the heart should all make you more than\ncontent especially around the 21st and 3 1 st Financially, owing to\ny> ur prudent nature you're still smiling and may even have a good\nlaugh around the 28th. LIBRA (24Sep230 ct): You may find yourself more interested\nin career considerations as well as your prestige among friends or\nassociates. Partnerships (cooperation with others) may prove\nexceptionally harmonious on the 19th,22 nd and 28th but could go\nagainst you around the 26th. SCORPIO (240ct22 Nov): Your work and health are both\nprotected by Jupiter and they thrive on the 19th and 28th Romance\nfrom social gatherings and group activities is highly probable\nparticularly on the 21st. Around the 26th your ironic tongue may\ndrop loose and cause some unwanted damage to hearts.\nSAGITTARIUS (23Nov22 Dec): Activities are still centred\naround social gatherings, friendships and partnerships. Your\nprestige continues to grow especially on the 21st and 31st. Many\nopportunities exist for romance particularly around the 28th. However, the 29th may prove trying but don't despair there's so much\ntin in November.\nCAPRICORN (23Dec20 Jan): Activities involving education\ncould be the source of a romance. Especially fortunate days are\nthe 21st and 31st. There may also be extra communication (some of\nit behind the curtain) regarding your present or future career. You really have to wait until the end of November if you are looking for\na ball. AQUARIUS (21Jan19 Feb): Education and travel is the main\ninterest. After the 24th you may. become concerned about your\ncareer or prestige particularly on the 26th and 27th. You may also\nfeel more impulsive on those days. There may be some sudden\nfortunate changes around the 15th and 25th. Romantically, nothing\nunusual.\nPISCES (20Feb21 Mar): Your personal relationships and\naffairs of the heart all flourish. You may find yourself attracting\nmany members of the opposite sex and having romantic involvements\nbut emotions may run a bit wild! If you try to keep things on a relatively descent level you should be able to find time for work as well. "

    "content": "FiUX I) FELIX SPORT 3\nRUGBY Imperial College A's:4 Chelsea College 1st XV: 0\nThe A's boarded their coach on Saturday emanating an air of\nconfidence. They had won the previous week (44 - 0) against\nMiddlesex Hospital, RCS had thrashed Chelsea College the previous]\nyear.\nAlas, any thought of an easy victory was swept away by\nChelsea' s trick of fielding fifteen fit men, totally unlike those who\nconfronted RCS last year.\nEvery IC player threw himself desperately into the fray. Hugh\nDuncan abandoned the newspaper he had brought to read in the\nanticipated quieter moments. Lynne Davies, on the wing, thought\nit wiser to remove his bassoon to the sidelines. The first half was uneventful\nbut energetic, and at half time\nIC were unlucky not to be in\nthe lead. Slowly things started\nto swing in IC's favour in the\nsecond half. Jon Pitcher came\nclose to scoring, and afterwards\ngave many reasons for not\ndoing so, each of them totally\nconvincing. IC were under\npressure a few times but the\nforwards held their own, the\nline being cleared by Hugh\nDuncan after the inevitable\npenalty.\nDuring the whole of the\nsecond half the backs tackled\nextremely well prevented\nChelsea getting into their\nstride. Rod Edney \u2014 out:of\nposition \u2014 played well and\ngave no anxious moments. It\nwas the last ten minutes and\nthen IC's fitness began to tell\nas John\nFishburn had predicted. A good\npass from a Chelsea line-out\nfound the IC backs ready and\nwaiting. Bob Leeson broke\nthrough feeding the ball to Chris\nBecque who gave a simple\nscoring pass to Jon Pitcher,\nand Jon was so close to the\nline that even he couldn't fumble it. John Fishburn narrowly^\nmissed with the conversion (the\nfourth best kick of the game)\nbut IC had won anyway.\nIt was a fine victory and\neverybody played their part\nwell, but a special word of\nthanks must go to Tony\nFitzgerald who was dragged,\nliterally, out of bed to fill a gap in the team.\nMany thanks to all who turned\nout.\n4 Edney, J Pitcher, B Leeson,\nC Becque, L Davies, 'l \u2014Harery,\nM Duncan, M Zawarotco,\nT Fitzgerald, B Budd, C Cuthbertson, R Porter, J Fishburn, R Jennec, N Wiltshire\nRugby Extras 1st XV by Paul Jeffs\nThe day started unusually for the extra's with fifteen players\nturning up as planned. Events continued to go well throughout\nthe afternoon with beneficial factors ranging from a slightly\nweakened QM C2 nd XV to the sunny weather. The QM C captains\ncall of \" edge\" proved correct at the coin tossing and they played\nwith the wind for the first half. This restricted the score to 12 \u2014 0\nat half time, with the IC pack\nskillfully demonstrating how to\nbe twice as heavy as the\nopposition, but still lose\npossession. Matters improved slightly In\nthe second half but there were\nstill some Identification problems within the new team;\nKeith Lipscombe was seen\nstill pushing IC players off the\nball 5 minutes after the QM C forwards had been removed\nfrom the maul.\nThe final score after an\nImpressive last 20 minutes was\n46 nil, with Steve Sharpe, Dave\nBuckley and Andy Whiteside\nrunning in one try each, Steve\nJenkins and (surprisingly) Rob\nDoyle falling over the line\ntwice each, and Nigel Gl bbs sidestepping over for a hat-trick\nDave Turner capped a solid display at full back by kicking\nover five conversions from\nseven attempts.\nThe team, every member of\nwhich deserves mention\n(especially John Smith) was: Andy Witheside. Paul Chlsnell,\nRob Doyle, Keith Lipscombe,\nPaul Jeffs, Terry Griffiths,\nDave Buckley, John Smith,\nNeil Rust, Nigel Bass, Gerry\nMolloy, Nigel Gibbs, Steve\nSharpe, Steve Jenkins, Dave\nTurner.\nAt least it's mixed!!\nIC 1st22 LSE 14 by Chris Cuthberson\nIC played their second game of the season on Wednesday,\n15th October against their great rivals LSE. The game started\nwith IC playing with the wind and without anything resembling\nrugby. Within a few minutes LSE had scored a try after the ball\nsomehow slipped out of X's hands into the hands of an LSE player.\nHowever, IC at last began\nto wake-up and play rugby as\na team. The forwards, especially were much improved and ru cke d and mauled well, with John\nSmith outstanding in this\nrespect. After two well taken\ntries by M West and A Gregory,\nand a try by LSE, Steve Asp den finished off a forward move in\nwhich lain Mac la in, Phil Turley\nand Paul Robins were all involved, with a fine try . At half-time the score was 16 \u2014 8 .\nAfter the break, despite fine\nteam play from IC, with Nigel Gibbs making a most impressive\ndebut in the centre, LSE used\nthe wind advantage to reduce\nthe leeway to two points.\nHowever, IC came right back\nat them, and from a scrum on\nthe LSE line, Any Devaney\npicked up a fine try to restore\nthe 8 point lead. Despite a strong late challenge by LSE, IC held out well to chalk up a good win; 22 \u2014 14.\nTeam:- IC 1st XV - A Williams,\nA Gregory, N Gibbs, J Gilbert,\nM West, A Devaney, M Calter,\nI Maclain, R Austin, B Andrews,\nS Aspden, S Booth, J Smith,\nP Turley and P Robins.\nLACROSSE Kenton 'A'v Imperial (or If Six Was Nine We'd Still be one shor On Saturday 11th October The Imperial College Men's Lacrosse Club played it's first match of the season. The match was against\nKenton, at Kenton and should have been a league fixture. However\ndue to lack of support on the part of the members of Imperial\nCollege, we only managed to collect a grand total of six players\n(It should have been ten), so we borrowed two of Kenton's players\nand played a friendly match.\nAs the weather was fairly\nwarm, an enjoyable 80 minutes\nensued. It was an end to end\ngame, in which even the goalkeepers managed to get into\nthe opposition's half and much\nrunning about was enjoyed by\nall. In the middle of all this\nph rene tic activity one or two\ngoals were scored, even some\nby Imperial, so by half time\nthe score was 6 \u2014 4 in Kenton's favour.\nThe second half was similar to the first, but by now some of\nthe cobwebs had been removed\nfrom the coordinating centres\nof the Imperial College players.\nFor example, Mike Burke\nof em on st rated his ability to run\nabout all over the place (and\nvery well he did it too.), and\nshould be a permanent fixture\nin the midfield. Tony, The Happy Hacker, gave an object\nlesson in how to miss a barn\ndoor from five feet, but did\nmake up for it with his five\njam my goals. Our new recruit,\nPhil Varght, played very well seeing as he hadn't played\nbefore Saturday. With a bit of\npractice and encouragement he\nshould make a useful player.\nOur defense, Paul Jepson and\nBill Jackson both worked very\nbard and did a good job of trying\nto make themselves look like\nfour people whenever Kenton\nattacked, for which our goalkeeper and Captain( me) was\nduly grateful. Modesty of course\nforbids me to mention all the\nincredible saves our goalkeeper\nmade, or what a good job our\ncaptain did giving much\nencouragement and moral\nsupport; so I won't. In closing I would like to\nthank Kenton for lending us\ntwo players, one of whom\nscored two of our goals, and\nfor giving us an enjoyable start\nto the season. The final score\nwas 9 \u2014 7 in Kenton's favour\n(sob, sob)\nTeam:-i Bob Strangeway (Capt.),\nPhil Varght, Paul Jepson, \"The\nHappy Hacker\", Bill Jackson,\nMike Burke and Two Guest\nPlayers f mm Kenton.\nCommercial Break:- Anybody\ninterested in learning how to\nwin friends and influence\npeople, get a bit of exercise at\nleast once a \u00bbweek, wan r JSf around London on Saturdays,\nand generally have a good laugh\n(well you'd laugh if you saw us\nbaying I) shod Id contact the\nfollowing:- \u2022\nBob Strangeway Physics PG Bill Jackson Chemistry II\nPaul Jepson Zoology III\nMike Burke Physics III\nNo Experience necessary,\njust a willingness to learn.\nby Dave Balderstone\nEver got lost on the way to\nyour home ground?

These debates whilst serving to clarify the views\nand aims of each of the camps involved has not involved a wide\naudience. Thus, FELIX presents on these pages the various\naspects of the abortion debate.\nThe passing of the 1967\nAct helped to focus attention\non the need for better con-trace pti on, for more and\nimproved sex education, and\nfor safer abortion techniques.\nThe Act also exposed many of\nthe problems faced by contemporary women, and the\nservices provided under the\nAct helped to alleviate these\nproblems. By legal Using\nabortion, much jn divi du a I suffering was relieved.\nUnfortunately, sufficient\nprovision was not allowed for\nthe Act \u2014 with the result that\nconsiderable strain was imposed\non the NHS. This has lead to\nmarked inequalities over the\ncountry in the provision of\nservices for legal abortion as illustrated by our own Health\nCentre.\nDue to the fact that the services\nprovided by the NHS have been\ninadequate, profit-making\npractices have flourished,\nwhich for sufficient money will provide abortion on demand.\nHowever, the report from\nthe committee on the Abortion\nAct shows that abuse of the\nact has been limited.\nThe James White (Amend-ment) Bill( which lapses at the\nend of this parliamentary\nsession) is an attempt to limit\nabuse of the 1967 Act, but it\nseems to have failed to do so. The present law allows a woman an abortion if two\ndoctors agree that\n(a) continuing the pregnancy\ninvolves greater risk to her\nlife; or\n(b) continuing the p regan cy involves greater risk to injury\nto her physical or mental health\nof than an abortion; or\n(c) continuing the pregnancy\ninvolves a greater risk of\ninjury to the physical or\nmental health of the existing\nchildren in the family than an\nabortion; or\n(d) there is a substantial\nrisk that the child will be\nbom 1\n1 seriously deformed .\nClause( b) is known as the\n\" social clause\". The amendment bill would\nalter (a),(b) and (c) so that\nabortion would be justified if \u2014\n(i) continuing the pregnancy\nmeant Grave Risk to the\nwoman's life; or\n(ii) continuing the pregnancy\nmeant a risk of serious injury\nto the woman's mental or\nphysical health; or\n(iii) continuing the pregnancy\nmeant a risk of serious injury\nto the mental or physical health\nof the existing children.\nThese restrictions will seriously reduce the legal\ngrounds for abortion. Experts\nfrom both the pro and antiabortion lobbies have estimated\nthat legal abortions would be\nreduced by nearly 80,000 a year. Among th se80,000 unable\nto get abortions under the new\nlaw would be rape victims, unmarried or unsupported\nmothers, women who have to\ngive up their careers to have\nbabies and women whose\nmarriages are threatened by\npregnancy. The bill also contains several retrogressive\nclauses \u2014 for instance, girls\nunder 16 years of age cannot\nbe advised on abortion unless\nin the presence of their parents\n\u2014 information pamphlets on\nabortion would become illegal. The bill, which lapses at\nthe end of this parliamentary\nsession, will probably be reintroduced in the next session. It is expected that it will be\nmore refined than the crude\nbill presented by James White.\nIn the meantime the\nGovernment has accepted, in\nprinciple, the nine recommendations of the Select\nCommittee on the Abortion\n(Amendment) Bill. Mrs Castle, Secretary of State for Social\nServices, has also promised\nthat a motion to reestablish\nthe select committee will be\ntabled early in the next\nparliamentary session.

It is considered better to kill a foetus rather than allow him or\nher to become a possibly disadvantaged child. We, in our so called' civilized' society, have assumed the right to dispose of\n'unwanted' fellow human beings, because they have not yet passed\nthrough the incident In their life known as birth.\nFor example, we could try to\nOf course, opponents of this\npoint of view would maintain\nthat the foetus is not a fellow\nhuman, but is, rather, some\ncollection of cells, to be\nremoved, like a cancerous\ngrowth, for the benefit of a severely distressed mother.\nHowever, for a foetus whose\nheart beats at 25 days and\nwhose brain waves can be\ndetected at 6 weeks after\nconception, I can see no point\nat which the continuous process\nof its de vel p ment can be\nconsidered to make the\ntransition between non-life and\nthe human life so demonstrably\nvisible after birth. Therefore,\nas the fertilized ovum is already\nliving and genetically unique,\nI feel it is only reasonable to\nconsider this conception as having human life. Moreover I deem it a gross assumption to\ncontinue removing foetuses from\nthe womb until such time as it\nhas been proved that what is killed is definitely n of a human\nbeing, which proof has yet to be\nproduced.\nHowever, we must also show\ncompassion for the terrible\nposition of the mother in the\ncase of an unwanted pregnancy.\nIndeed, any society which sees\nabortion as the,only way out of\nher:predicament must be a very\ncallous and lazy one. Would it\nnot be better to give the woman\nthe 'right to choose' by providing a viable alternative; put as much finance and effort into\nproviding more effective and\nreadily available forms of\ncontraception and, also, help\nfor the term of the pregnancy\nand if necessary, thereafter.\nremedy the situation whereby\n40% of our homeless are one\nparent families. One reason for\nsaying this is that abortion,\nalthough a fairly swift operation,\nis by no means on a par with a tonsil ec to my, and can result in\nvarious physical after-effects\nincluding sterility, future\nmiscarriages, severe period\npains and soon. Most of these\nare caused by the basic nature\nof abortion in truncating\ngestation; during pregnancy a woman's body is geared to\ncamping the child, both\nphysically and metabolically\nand, thus, any premature\ntermination of the pregnancy is likely to cause these physical\ndifficulties as well as many\nsevere and long-lasting\npsychological guilt problems.\nThese factors lead me to the\nconclusion that abortion \u2014 far\nfrom being the only way out of\nan 'unwanted' pregnancy, is not even one of the better ones,\neven from the mother's point of\nview.\nMoreover, returning to the\nfoetus, it can readily be seen\nthat abortion is not the best\nsolution for him or her, as it\nleaves him (her) with no\nopportunity for any choice but\nrather imposes a most barbaric\nform of capital punishment on a vulnerable, innocent human\nbeing whose only crime is that of being socially inconvenient. What price a society\nwhich makes social inconven.ience a capital offence within\nits civil law?\nTony Fizgerald\nNOTICE\nYet Again . . . .\nAlthough sports articles are much in demand for FELIX\nin future articles will be rejected unless\n1. They are written on alternate lines\n2. Proper names, place names, technical words are\nwritten in capitals\n3. That the writing is LEGIBLE.

    "content": "FELIX5 The Refectory price\nsyndrome.\nTRUST is needed\nIf there are two heads which ought to be mercilessly\nsmashed together at the present time, then those heads\nbelong to Peter Teague, the Union President, and Victor\nMooney, the College Refectory manager. Whilst the refectory\nprice situation at IC seems to get worse, these two key\nfigures, who could if they really tried ease the situation\nsomewhat, seem content to just watch the opportunity\ndisintegrate like a dea\"d sausage.\nThe fact that Mr Mooney expected to put up prices by\n40% without increasing the quality of the meats served in\nSouthside clearly indicates that he is a total loony. The\nfact that Mr Teague is encouraging the students to eat\nelsewhere thus doing harm to the College's refectory account\nand thus ensuring that the prices increases at Christmas\nwill probably be double what they were first expected to be\nindicates that he too is a total loony.\n\"It's the UGC's fault with their self-balancing catering\nrules!\" they scream indignantly in an improbable incestuous\nunison, \"The buck stops there, not with us.'' \"Meatballs,\"\nI murmur, s otto voce. (Naive hysterical catcalls broach my\ntrain of thought: \"Come on then, nitwit! So what's your\nsolution then, eh??\" I unsuccessfully try to stifle a snigger\nand manage to purr \"Glad you asked\".\nHere goes:-tJ C Boycotting the refectories or encouraging students to\neat elsewhere is crass stupidity: it simply perpetuates\nthe loss on the Col leg e refectory account thus provoking\nfurther price increases.\n$Z The cost of a refectory item is essentially in two parts:\nA. the basic cost of the item; B. the cost of preparation\nplus staff wages, plus overheads.\n& If part A cannot be altered, what can be done about\npart B? Answer: Get more students to eat at the\nrefectories to increase the turnover and thus produce a refectory profit which can be used to keep the prices\ndown.\nHow cm n you do that? Answer: SERVE BETTER PREPARED FOOD. Once the quality is established,\nIC Unifm can play its part by vigorously campaigning\nfor students to support the College and eat in the\nrefectories as much as possible.\nToo many students are exasperated at being unable to\ndo anything constructive about refectory prices. This\nplan would at least give students the opportunity to do\nsomething about it.\nThis is a plan which calls for TRUST. The Union would,\nhave to TRUST Mr Mooney to maintain the high quality of\nfood and service which he would initially undertake to reach;\nMr Mooney would have to TRUST the Union to keep its part\nof the bargain and get students to fill the refectories. If\narbitration could help, then maybe the Rector should be\nasked to step in.\nDoubtless the smug little cynics on both sides of the\nfence will point to the difficulties involved in monitoring\"\nfairly the \"quality of the food\"; will quote Union policy\nwhich might preclude such a plan. May I be the first to\nmetaphorically spit in their eyes. This \"plan\" is a roughly\nhewn principle; no-one is denying that the College and\nUnion bureaucrats would have to work overtime, to determine\nthe necessary details which make up a proposition viable to\nboth the Union and the Coljege. Difficulties' CAN be\novercome; Union policy CAN be changed at a single UGM;\nall it needs is painstaking commonsense and the belief that\nit can work.\nDon't you think it would be worth all the effort? If it\nworked, the goal of good quality food optimal ly priced\nwould be realistically attainable, not just a figment of our\nalready exasperated imagining s. Not only that, but it\nwould be a storming victory for diplomacy, trust and common\nsense in a situation that was crying out for it.\nPLEASE MR MOONEY, MR TEAGUE AND ANY OTHEfl\nINTERESTED PARTIES (AND THAT INCLUDES ALL4,000 IC STUDENTS) GIVE THIS IDEA FAIR CONSIDERS\nATI ON WHEN DETERMINING YOUR ATTITUDES ON\nREFECTORY PRICES. IT CAN WORK. IF YOU DISAGREE,\nPLEASE WRITE TO FELIX AND TELL US WHY.\nMIKE WILLIAMS\n\n"

    "content": "12 MU X UGM Report\nA Union General Meeting was held last Tuesday lunchtime,\nprior to the demonstration organised by the SE region of the TUC, although the question of cuts in public spending were not\nspecifically discussed. No matters arose from the minutes of the\nlast U GM, and the only correspondence received was that\nmentioned in the Council Report printed in FELICITY on Friday\n171th October.\nPresident's report\nFormal dinner prices have\nbeen revised downwards after\nconsultation with Mr Mooney.\nMs Cowell, from the DES and\nUGC, will, be approached with\nthe idea that she comes to\ninvestigate the refectory set-up\nat IC. However, due to her\nperformance at LSE, the\npresident expressed doubt about\nthe outcome of such a visit from her. She apparently fell\ndown a set of stairs and broke\nher leg after only two hours\ngoing round the refectory at\nLSE and produced a report\nbased on her two hour stay I The president also informed\nthe meeting of a developing\nsituation at QE C( Queen\nElizabeth College) where the\nUnion there had hired catering\nequipment and were paying\nstudents to produce lunches\nbeing sold to students at only\n20p per main course. (A full\nreport will appear in the next\nissue of FELIX.) Peter Teague,\nICU president, and John Downs\nwill be investigating the\npr act ic abilities of this system\nfor IC.\nIt is almost certain that\nS RC finance will recommend\nthat hall rents be increased\nafter Christmas. The halls\nmade a heavy financial loss\nlast year.\nThis led to a recommend a ion that the meeting reaffirm the\nUnion's opposition to mid-session al price increases in\nview of the fact that grants\nare reviewed annually.\nA recommendation from the\npresident that only one observer\nbe sent to the next NUS national\nconference was rejected in\nfavour of a recommendation\nthat the delegation leader\nreports on the possible effects\na decrease in observers has on\na delegation's performance.\nHonorary Secretary's business\nThere was little of general\ninterest except that an IC slop shirt may soon be available.\nSuggestions as to what should\ngo on it are welcomed.\nA suggestion, to combat\nillegal car-parkers in Southside,\nwas put forward. This involves\nputting 10 inch square stickers\non the offender's windscreen.\nThese are extremely difficult\nto remove and the culprit would\nhopefully be caught whilst in\nthe process of so doing.\nDeputy President's business\nThe theme of the DP's business, for the second\nsuccessive U GM, was discipline People leaving posters up in\nthe Union Building for more\nthan two days after an event\nwill be liable to a fine and\nmay suffer more severe\ndisciplinary measures if they\ncontinue flouting this rule. Mr\nShakir was not pleased to see\nthat sell o tape was still being\nused to put up posters \u2014 blue\ntack is supplied for this\npurpose. He will also be\nchallenging people in the\nUnion to produce their\nregistration cards without\nwhich they could be evicted.\nRefusal to leave would be a disciplinary offence. However,\nthis part of the DP's report\nproved contentious and was referred back.\nElections\nElections for fo or rep and\none ordinary member of UFC were held. The candidates and\ntheir proposer s were called on\nto speak. Mr M Kessler( proposed by Mr K Ahlers), Mr\nR Mills( proposed by Mr J White) and Mr T Shanks\n(proposed by Mr P Ekpenyong)\nwere the candidates for floor\nrep. Mr A Potter (proposed by\nMr D Everett) and Mr R Genner\n(proposed by Mr M Wright)\nconte steed the post for UFC. The results of these elections\nwill be announced in the next\nissue of FELIX. Several\nuncontested posts were also ratified.\nThere being no A OB the\nmeeting closed at2 \u00bb.pm.\nAndrew Walker\nNAC Conference\nIt was decided by IC council last year to show support\nfor the National Abortion Campaign by offering free use of\nfacilities for a two day conference, in place of money. The\noffer was accepted and an open, national conference took\nplace the weekend before last.\nDuring the summer, the NAC and its supporting groups had \u2022\nfound the campaign at a low\nebb.

IC started well\nand looked like taking control\nof the middle, until a poor\nclearance from defence set up\nthe Brunei forwards who\npromptly scored. IC pulled\nback :.nd although generally\non top, the Brunei forwards\nlooked very sharp on the break.\nJust before half-time IC\nequalise d when Trev Futu\nlatched onto a through ball, beat two defenders and pushed\nthe ball through the advancing\ngoalkeepers legs . In the second\nhalf the play was very even,\nIC with more of the ball but\nBrunei dangerous and more\nmobile. John Latter put IC into\nthe lead with a goal from close in midway through the half and\nit looked as though the 1st XI\nwas on the way to its first win.

At this point it looked as though am asec re was imminent but St\nMarys changed their style to\nstopping the man at any cost. Using these tactics, the game\ndegenerated tempers were lost\nand the standard of hockey fell. No more goals were scored in\neither half although Boodie\nMiddleton did hit the post with\na glancing shot.

The game turned out to be close in fact,\nwith IC perhaps having the upper hand and although there were\nseveral scoring chances at both ends of the pitch the score was\n0 - 0 at half-time:\nThe second half started\nsimilarly but as time went on\nIC began to co-ordinate better\nas a team. IC in fact had more\nand more of the play, and Chris Parker in goal spent a large\nproportion of the second half\nsitting down admiring the view.\nAbout half-way through the\nsecond half IC took a short\ncorner and the resulting shot\nby Jim Marshall was saved by\na defender's foot and so a penalty flick was awarded. The ball was put in the back of the\nnet by Kim Houlden and a goal\nwas duly awarded.\nThe second goal came from\na fine individual display by\nDiana on the right wing, beating\ntwo defenders and then leaving\nthe goalkeeper wrong-footed\nwith a superb shot.\nThe score remained at 2 \u2014 0\nuntil the final whistle and\ncongratulations must go to all members of the side for such a fine performance.

    "content": "4\nFi lIX WELL SOC Contrary to expectations, WELL SOC's lecture on Monday,\nOctober 20th was not \" The Future of Communication\", to have\nbeen delivered by Pearce Wright. This was mainly to do with a certain lack of communication. This lecture will probably-be\ngiven later in the term, eg Nov 17th. Instead, Sir David Huddie\nfrom Mech Eng stepped into\nthe breach at the last moment\nand delivered a fascinating\nlecture on a survey conducted\nin IC a few years ago. This was concerned with what\nsuccess IC graduates felt they\nmet in their jobs. This opinion\nof success was split into three\nmain parts: Firstly salary, then\nresponsibility, and the amount\nthey enjoyed their jobs. A table\nshowed how little difference it\nmeant to your salary and\nresponsibility prospects if you\nhad a first class degree. Also, interestingly, an anomaly\nappeared at the lower end of\nthe degree scale: If you are a person in the 3rd class Honours\nbracket who will probably not\nmake a2nd, it appears to be\nworthwile to do a little worse,\nand get a pass degree instead\nof an Honours. But please, if\nyou must experiment, don't blame me, or Sir David, if it\ngoes wrong on you. One section of the questionnaire sent round asked what\nsubject the graduates felt should\nhave been included in the\ncourse, or enlarged upon. The highest scorer? Mathematics,\nall the way across the board.\nThe other main area was\nmanagement and economics.\nMIT conducted a similar\nsurvey of their graduates\nrecently. The survey boiled\ndown to one basic question:\nAre you happy? In answer, 70%\nfelt that they were successful,50% enjoyed their job, and 4 0 %\nfelt that MIT gave them an advantage.\nI could go on. Sir David\nproduced any number of\nfascinating statistics which I could reproduce. If you're\ninterested and want to hear\nmore, there is a rather rare\nreport on the IC survey\n\" around\". But in an ostensibly\nliterary publication, any more\nstatistics might not go down\nvery well. Opsoc\nsummer tour report\nOn Saturday July 19th seven\nyear's tour company set out on\nall parts of the country.\nOn Saturday July 19th seventy people who made up\nthis year's tour company set\nout on the annual pilgrimage\nfrom all parts of the country\nto Budliegh Salterton in Devon .\nIt was the eighth visit time\ntime and we were pleased that\nthe Devonians were not fed up\nwith us yet.\nWe thought that the choice\nof production \u2014 \" Patience\" by Gilbert and Sullivan, would\ncause a marked drop in our\nticket sales over the' 1974 tour,\nsince it was relatively less-known than the all-time\nfavourites \" Trial by Jury\"&\" HMS Pinafore\".

ICWA\ndebate on abortion\nThe sad lack of an IC Debating Society is being compensated\nfor by a series of debates organised by ICWA. The first of these\ntook place on Tuesday in the ICWA lounge. The subject of the\ndebate was\" Abortion is every woman's right\". The first speaker for the\nmotion was Karen Gadd. Ms\nGadd, in spite of wallowing in\nher own brand of bigotry about\nwomen, produced a very\nconvincing case.\nThe first speaker for the\nopposition was Janu c sz Fiedler. Mr Fiedler' s argument rested on\nthe belief that abortion would\nautomatically lead to euthanasia\nand men could treat women badly\nand irresponsibly if they believed that these women could\nobtain abortions.\nThe next speaker for the\nproposition, Nick Payne,\nconsidered abortion within\nthe framework of our society,\ndismissing the idea that\nabortion could not exist. He\ntalked about the horrors of back\nstreet abortion and the good\nsense of legal is ed abortion. He\nrefuted the opposition's claim that abortion was murder by\nciting the case of test-tube\nbabies.\nThe final speaker was Ms\nChristine Hands who used the\nbiological argument by considering the structure of the\nfertilised egg. Ms Hands'\nspeech was well thought out\nand thoroughly researched.\nThe chairperson, Ms Dot\nGriffiths, then opened the debate\nto the floor. An amicable and\nsurprisingly calm discussion ensued but unfortunately few\npeople discussed the points\nraised in the debate and used\nit as an opportunity to air their\nown particular prejudices on\nabortion.\nThe motion was overwhelmingly carried.\nIt seems a pity that more\noccasions of this kind are not\norganised at this college. The\npeople who attended Tuesday's debate all asked when the\nnext would be. There certainly\nseems to be a strong case for\nsetting up an IC Debating\nSociety. The series of debates\norganised by ICWA this term\nshould establish this point\nbeyond doubt. It would certainly\nbe pleasant to see more events\nof this kind.\nRifle Club\nIC RPC is run by eight\nvolunteers for those interested\nin 0.22 target shooting. For rifle shooters there is a choice\nof six excellent target rifles;\nfor pistol shooters there are\ntwo semi-automatics. Standing\nand kneeling rifle shooting is\nalso taught.\nThere is an inter-union\ncompetition run annually\nbetween teams selected from\nclub members. Day trips to the\nNational Rifle Association ranges at Bisley Camp are\norganised for 7.62mm Nato\nrifle shooting. Members who\nshow good progress may find\nthemselves shooting for IC\nagainst other UL colleges or\nperhaps shooting for UL.There\nis also an annual rifle and\npistol competition for the\ncoveted Clothworkers &\nSkinners Cup, the Huntingdon\nCup and the club Championship.\nIC RPC is open all weekday\nlunchtimes and all Wednesday\nafternoon/early evening.\nAmmunition may be bought at\nthe range, which is situated in\nthe Southside Sports Complex,\nfor 35p per 50 rounds. Annual\nsubscription is \u00a31.80.\nAnyone just interested or\nwishing to join is welcome to\ncome and have a chat with\neither myself or one of the\nCommittee members at the range\nany lunch tir rte and Wednesday\nafternoon.\nVLC Phillips\n\n"

    "content": "Abortion special -see centre pages.\nTreble overseas\nstudents' fees says\nMP - back page.\nFOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNo. 399 Tuesday 28th October, 1975. FREE! Health Centre\nunhelpful over\nabortion cases\nIt has come to light recently\nthat two women students who\nbecame pregnant un sympathetically dealt with at the\nHealth Centre. In the first case\nthe st n dent had become\npregnant only two weeks before\nher examinations. Having\ndecided to have an abortion,\nshe approached the Health\nCentre and had a pregnancy\ntest which proved positive.\nShe consulted one of the\ndoctors at the Health Centre\nregarding obtaining an abortion.\nA sympathetic doctor was\nunable to help because of the\ntime factor involved, but\nsuggested she try a private\nclinic. This, the student didi\nand finally had her operation\nfive days before her examinations were due to start \u2014\ndespite this setback she\nsuccessfully completed them.\nIn the second case the\nstudent, who is still at IC,\nwas given an appointment with\na doctor who was working at\nthe Health Centre temporarily.\nThe doctor was most uncooperative and reprimanded her\nfor being irresponsible and\npromiscuous. The student left\nin tears.\nShe subsequently had an\nabortion arranged for her by\nthe Pregnancy Advisory Service.\nBoth cases were brought to\nthe attention of the Health\nCentre who admit that in both\noccasions these events did in\nfact take place. However, it is\npointed that abortions take a long time and it was not\npossible to arrange the\noperations for the student, as\nq nick ly as they desired.\nIt seems also that the policy\npursued by the Health Centre\non abortions will not be altered\nin the light of these two cases.\nFELIX FELIX would like to\napologise to its readers and\nadvertisers for the late\npublication of this issue due\nto technical problems. For this\nreason also, the next issue\nof FELIX will not be published\nuntil Friday, 7th November.\nFELIX would also like to\napologise for the errors\ncontained in i the \"Council\nreport\" carried in its last\nissue, FELICITY.\nLess cash but more certainty-Government\npolicy\nperverse-Rector\nTHE RECTOR, in his Commemoration Day address, attacked critics of the higher\neducation system and government policy on higher education. Although it was important\nto raise the educational standards of the mass of people, there would always be a need\nfor highly selective education for those of exceptional merit. |t was for this purpose that\nuniversities had been created. The quality of students entering Imperial College remained\nconsistently high and there was no reason for any immediate change in our admission\npolicy.\nOne point of concern at IC\nhowever, was the proportion of\nwomen students which stood at\nless than 11% of the student\nbody. \"This is far fewer\nwomen students than we \u2014\nand no doubt the men students!\n\u2014 would like, and we are\nmaking strenuous efforts to\nremedy it\" . The attempts to\nattract more women to the\nCollege would be a slow and\nlaborious task. To help this\nand the College as a whole,\nSir David Huddie had been\nasked to consider what\nsubjects should be developed\nat the College in order to\nbroaden and enrich its intellectual spectrum.\nHowever, this planning for\nthe future suffered due to a lack of certainty over the\nfinancial out look of universities. \"In common with everyone\nelse the College has experienced\nsevere financial difficulties\nduring the course of the year,\nwith inflation almost making\nhavoc of our budget or y planning. What has been\nparticularly dispiriting is the\nuncertainty in which universities have lived\".\n\"There Is ad espa rate need\nto return to some element of\ncertainty in our planning, even\nif in doing so we have to lose\nsome money,\" he continued. \"Less cash but more certainty;\nthis might be a good bargain\nfor the Government and for the\nuniversities\", he declared. Referring to the self-balancing rules for student\nresidences and refectories he\ndescribed government policy\nas \"deliberately calculated to\nbe perverse\". The College had\nendeavour ed to make improvements and eco no mise where\npossible, but were inevitably\nbound by strict government\nregulations insisting that halls and refectories must pay their\nway without subsidy. \"That would be perfectly\nacceptable if the student\nmaintenance grant was adequate\nto meet the proper costs; but\nit is not adequate... These two\nelements of Government policy\nare mutually inconsistent; they\nare also socially divisive\nbecause they penal is e the\npoorer student; and they\nprovide a constant source of\npotential antagonism between\nthe student body and its\ninstitution\". The universities\nwere \" close to breaking\npoint\" and urgent action by\nthe Government was necessary.\nHe poured scorn oh Lord\nCrowther-Hunt's belief that\nmanpower planning would\nresult in economies. Manpower\nplanning was a notoriously\ninexact science and in\nany case it was more Important\nto train people so that ..they\ncould exercise the intellectual\npowers to the full. \"Criticism\ncan be helpful to the criticised,\nbut if thought to be vindictive\ncan do more harm than good;\nand we must take comfort to\nrecall with George Moore that\n'the lot of critics is to be\nremembered by what they\nfailed to understand'. On that\nscore alone Lord CrowtherHunt was already formed\nimmortality\".\nThe Rector also expressed\ngrave concern over the steady\nerosion, in recent years, in the\ncapacity of universities to\nundertake research. Basic research was vitally important\nand belonged especially in the\nuniversities and this should be\nmaintained and not be\narbitrarily sacrificed in order\nto maintain a pre-ordained\nlevel of student numbers.\nInflation and Government\nfinancial policies had weakened\nthe ' dual support' system on\nwhich university research was based.\n\n"

Owing to\nR All in son's F... ting about during the race, ( as well as before it)\nThe sup rise winner was the \" new\"( ie fit) Ian Ellis, who just\nfailed to complete the course in under 30 mins (a cherished club\nhonour.) This was mainly due to the ignorance of some sheep who\ndid not seem to realise that we wanted tb organise a race, and\nwere busily feeding themselves on our starting line. Consequently\nthe course was extended, Ian was robbed, and the sheep became\nthe target of much abuse. A close second was D Rosen with S Webb third. C Dale in his first race for the club ran well to finish\nfourteenth.\nOn the following Saturday,\nthe club had to honour two\nfixtures, one at Brightonjhe\nother at Bristol. The tatter was a league race and so we had to\nsend most of our star members,\nwho did the club proud in\nfinishing as one of the top\nclubs. R All in son ran a great\nrace and came a very commendable fifth. The remaining\nmembers \u2014 all proven superstars.\nPA's \u2014 travelled to Brighton\nto race against Sussex and\nHasting'sAC. For the race IC was forced\nto merge with the LSE, whose\nshares were suffering from\nlack of support. However the\nmerger turned out to be an\nunprofitable one and the team\nfinished a good third. The highlight of the day was when\nM 'Wilf' Welford whose overwhelming enthusiasm, (which\nis an example to us all) had\ncaused him to run an extra\nthree-quarters of a mile, finally\nfinished.

The\nfirst lap hurtled off at breakneck speed and even Andy Davey could\nnot avoid breaking ten minutes. The first earn finished a creditable\n14th, thanks to fine runs from Rob, Ian and Granny, and with a fully\nfit team we might well have finished in the first ten.\nThe progress of the second\nteam was abruptly slowed by\nPad Donnelly, whose temporary\nreturn from Es sam' s(e sorted by\nhis wife) produced very little\nglory in breaking 13 minutes.\nOwing to the un sporting action\nof a couple of teams at the\nback, who dropped out halfway\nthrough the race, Mike Welford\nwas left with the unwelcome\ntask of preserving IC's honour\nand not finishing last. Even\nmore unwelcome was the uphill\nsprint which enabled us to\nfinish last but one. It was learnt afterwards, from the\nofficial UC results, that Mike\nhad been credited with a time of\n9.13, which was surprisingly\nlooked on with much humour\nand hilarity. The evening was spent sampling real ale at the\nCity University Beer Festival. by Mike Welford\nSPORTING MOTORCYCLE CLUB The final \" Be m see\" club\nmeeting was held two Saturdays\nago at Brands Hatch. Unfortunately the College racer\ndeveloped a bent right front\nfork, so we had to cancel our\ntwo entries. Nevertheless a hardy group of members left\nSouthside at 10.30am to brave\ncold winds and heavy showers\nto spec tate and/or marshall.\nThe marshal Is were kept busy\nby a more than average number\nof accidents due to the wet\nweather and deteriorating\nlight; none of the riders\nhowever, received Injuries\nmore serious than bruises. As regards the racer, we shall try\nand let as many new members\nas possible'have a ride during\nthe winter in readiness for next\nseason. . ......\nby Steve Walks\nWATER POLO\nIC Water Polo Club took a great step towards winning their\nfirst major honour of the year when, on Monday 6th October they\nwon the first leg of the Winter Handicap KO Cup Rna l. For those\nof you who haven't been following this competition avidly (OK\nhands up) this is last year's winter, which has been somewhat\ndelayed. The match was the home leg against Hatfield and we\nstarted 0 \u2014 5 down on handicap. However for once we roared off\nto a great start with Cliff Spooner scoring three early goals, only\nto recapture our more accustomed\nstyle and concede two soft goals before the end of the first\nquarter. In the second quarter\nwe made further inroads into\nthe Hatfield lead with a goal\neach from Pete McCartney and\nCliff, however it was the third\nquarter which proved decisive. With Hatfield tiring five goals\nwere banged in, Cliff and Pete\neach scoring another and Mike\nMcCartney and Nick with two\ngoals putting themselves on\nthe score sheet. Thus at the\nstart of the last quarter we\nheld a commanding 10 \u2014 7 lead.\nThis was stretched further by\nyet another goal from Cliff and\none from Rory Lewis before\nwe conceded a late penalty to\nmake the final score 12 \u2014 8.\nThus we go into the second\ngame at Hatfield on 24 October\nconfident of achieving our first\never win in the competition,\nthough we are again under the\nhandicap of a five goal deficit.\nMeanwhile back in the\nMiddlesex League Division2, a weakened IC side met a weakened Isleworth side on\nFriday 10 October. The match\nproved to be a very tight affair\nup to half time when we were\nactually losing 1 \u2014 2 but from\nthen on our superior fitness\ntook it's toll and we strolled\nin for an astonishing 9 \u2014 2\nvictory. Goals came from Rory\n'Ignor' Lewis4, Pete McCartney\n2, Andy Smith, Paul Frieze and\nNick. So don't forget if you think\nyou can put up with at least\none of the following (a) water,\n(b) yellow balls,( c) Stan's bar,\n(d) friendly Irishman, (e) friendly\nWelshman, then please come\nalong to the pool on a Monday\nor Friday at 7pm and we'll get\nthe other four points sorted out.\nby Andy Smith\nBOAT CLUB Dodging the pleasure\ncruisers on the river at Putney\ncan often be seen members of\nthe Boat Club and here is a report of them from MR Jones. So far this term we have been\nconcerned mainly with sorting\ncrews into eights and trying to\nnegotiate some fixtures. At present we have Ladies eight,\nthree Novice crews and three\nSenior crews (The difference\nbetween the last two cat ago ries is based upon the number of\nregattas won).\nThe novices have been put\ninto ' click er' boats and are\nbeginning to understand basic\npoints such as which end of the\nEar to hold. Although they are\nlighter than last years Novice eight, this should not affect\ntheir performance and many\ngood races are anticipated.\nThe women are running at\nleast one eight this year and\nalready have one win to their\ncredit. A week last Saturday\nGerry Tap lin in a four won a pint pot at the Thames Scratch\nregatta.\nA smaller number of people\nthan usual turned up for the\nfirst trial. However we are\nrunning three eights of a general quality above average\nfor this time of year (some\neights of\nmembers have confessed to\nhaving run during the summer\nvac.). The first eight has been\nsplit into fours and is training\nfor a fours competition on\nNovember 1st which is steered\ncox less and results in an\nerratic course down the river.\nThe training has taken its toll, with people walking round like\nrobots for a week or so afterwards.\nThis term is used mainly\nfor technique training so we\ncompete in no regattas other\nthan the UL Winter Eights, the Vesta Eights and of course\nMorphy Day. So watch this\nspace for details. COPY DEADLINE\nAll sports reports must be in by 2.00pm on Thursday\n30th October except for matches played on Saturday\n1st November which should be in by 2.00pm on\nMonday 3rd November\n\n"

Still, it was rapidly\nconsumed by all and sundry, so\nit must have been quite good.\nThree barrels of beer also disappeared down the hatch\nwhich proves (as I have always\nsaid) that dancing is thirsty\nwork!\nThe music began at 8.30pm and after the initial shyness,\nthe lust of Fanny' s\" amazing\" Disco soon proved to be\nirresistible.

Still what better\nway of proving that you've\npaid?\nAnyway, it was getting so\ncrowded and hot that it became\nof paramount importance to\ncool off and so, as I cannot\nstomach beer, I thought it\nprudent to retire to the bar. This also seemed to be a popular\nidea'with quite a few other\npeople and it began to get\nuncomfortably hot in there as\nwell. All the same, an enjoyable\nevening was had by all, and\nwe hope that in the future all such events will be as well\nattended.\nTelix\nOverseas Students' Fees\nYet another MP has jumped on the 'charge overseas\nstudents more' bandwagon. Dr Hampson has suggested we\nrepeat Mr Crosland's1966 move and treble overseas\nstudents' fees. This will NOT drive overseas students\naway especially since our courses are highly prized.\nNONSENSE!\nIf their fees were trebled, these students would be\npaying fees of up to \u00a31000 a year. On top of this would be\ntheir hall fees which in some universities and polytechnics\nare as much as three times those for British students. In\none polytechnic overseas students are being charged \u00a361\na week to live in halls of residence. However, the polytechnic is not reaping in any money from this because these\nstudents have refused to live in hall. The average halls of\nresidence fees for overseas students is at least as high as\nthe weekly rate of the student maintenance grant paid at\nthe full rate.\nThe consequences of such a measure would be far reach-ing, especially for Imperial College. With a large percentage\nof our students coming from overseas the move could prove\ndisastrous if a large en ouch drop occurred in their numbers.\nAbortion\nThis week FELIX present in the centre pages the various\nviews of both factions of the abortion debate viz the pro\nand anti-abortionists. The aim of the 1967 Abortion Act was\nessentially to curtail the number of deaths by backstreet\nabortions by legal ising it.\nThe act has been liberally abused and it is for this\nreason that further legislation has been put forward to\ncurtail these abuses. However, the James White Abortion\n(Amendment) Bill, which was designed to do this has been\nthe subject of much controversy and rightly so. It would\nhave been (it lapses at the end of this session) a restrictive\npiece of legislation.\nThere are valid sociological reasons in many cases for\nabortion, but this does not detract from the fact that it is\nmurder in the strictest meaning of the word.\nby\nStella\nGodfrey\nDuring the coming session at least one member of ICWA will become pregnant.

(This presupposes\nthat her parents will support\nher during her confinement.)\nHopefully, she could then\nresume her studies a year later.\nSecondly she could leave\ncollege, have the child and\nthen attempt to keep it,\nresuming her studies this time\nwith the added responsibility\nof trying to rear a young child. I shall not go into the problems\nof accommodation and finance\nthat this would also involve.\nThirdly, she could have an\nabortion. That is, at present\nshe could have an abortion. It\nseems abundantly clear to me\nwhich step she would choose\nto take, James White permitting.\nJames White, for those to\nwhom the name is not familiar,\nis a man who would force this\nas yet hypothetical ICWA\nmember into a doping one of the\nfirst two courses of action I have outlined or into placing\nherself at the far from tender\nmercies of the \" backstreet\" abortionist.\nIn 1967 an enormous step\nforward was made towards\ngiving women a real opportunity\nto plan their lives as they chose,\nto govern their Own bodies and\nto be free from the fear of\nunwanted pregnancies; abortion\nwas legal is ed. Eight years later the James\nWhite Abortion (Amendment)\nBill is before Parliament. If\nthis Bill becomes law it will effectively make it impossible\nfor any woman not in the\nfollowing categories to have a legal abortion. Under the Bill, to qualify for a legal abortion,\na woman would have to be in a position of risking grave\nphysical or mental harm by\ncontinuing the pregnancy or\nshe would have to establish\nthat the child if born would\nseriously threaten the stability\nof her existing family unit. This neatly excludes the large\nmajority of women who at\npresent obtain legal abortions.\nOnce again we would hear 01\ngirls dying at the hands of\nglorified butchers; of girls\nbeing rendered permanently\ninfertile by the in expertise of\nthe illegal abortionist.

    "content": "FELIX 2\nWhat is wrong\nwith abortion?\nThis was the title of a lecture given at Imperial College\nrecently, by JJ Scarlsbrlck, Professor of History, and Pro Vice Chancellor of the University of Warwick.\nProfessor ScaHsbrlck\ncommenced his talk with a series of very emotive slides, showing foetuses aborted in a number of different ways. One\nof the most shocking of these\nwas the Vacuum aspiration'\nmethod, in which the foetus is\nsucked down a tube into a disposable jar. In the process\nthe body'is shredded by a set\nof blades in the tube.\nThe talk continued with a number of very persuasively\ncouched argue ment s, the broad\ntheme of these being, 7 s murder morally acceptable?\nProfessor Scarlsbrook argued\nthat a just society was one that\nsecures equality before the\nlaw, for all its members,\nregardless of race, creed, and\nsize. However he omitted to\npoint out that a just society\nshould also look to the plight\nof the pregnant mother and\nchild once It is born, and that\nabortion facilitates this. Merely because an unborn\nchild Is uneducated, and\nun so cl all sed this was no\nreason to treat him or her as a second class citizen. In fact\nit could be argued that an\napartheid system operates\nbetween the born and unborn,\nas a result of the total vulnerability of-the foetus.\nIf carried to its logical\nconclusion this criterion\nformed a very dangerous threat\nto our society, since we would\nthen be bounded to consider\nchildren, and handicapped\npeople as similar, second class citizens. The talk, which was\narranged by IC Catholic\nsociety, ended with a question\nsession, which lamentably\nproduced no real discussion between the pro and anti\nabortion factions.

I have one suggestion\nabout these services, which I think ought to be aired. On\nTuesday (Oct 8th),I had a meal\nin Sputhside, of cod and chips,\nfollowed by apple pie. The cod\nwas marked-up as 35p and the\npiece-of apple pie as 11p. The\nchips had no price marked, but\nlet us estimate their value at a nominal 4p. Now, my mathematics\nstates that this should total 50p, but the lady on the till reckoned\nit to be 41p. Being particularly\nshort on cash that evening, I was\nvery grateful, but the refectory\nmade a loss of 18% on that meal.\nPerhaps this might be their\n\" slight mismanagement problem\"\nthat leads to the \u00a378,000 deficit,\nand that because of this, the\n40% increase was more than\nnecessary.\nWith regards to prices, I have\nsampled a reasonable meal at a Teacher Training College in\nSouth London, for 30p. This consisted of soup (with roll and\nbutter), fish and chips and a piece of cake. This is perhaps\nnot exactly very nutritional, but\nwas good value for 30p. Perhaps,\nif our refectories were more\nefficient, then we might have a meal for a comparable price.\nBest of luck for the future.\nYours faithfully,\nAnon (1st year Aero).\nPG\nAFFAIRS CORNER\nTom Abraham\nThis is the first PG affairs corner of the term. Articles from\nPG students on any aspect of postgraduate life at IC would be\nwelcome. Although there were a number of contributions from rank\nand file PG' s last year, we could do with quite a few more since\nthere are supposed to be some 1500 PG' s at this College.\nPete Teague and I went to\nsee the Registrar, Peter Mee,\nto discuss the position of\npostgraduate students who\nover-run their three year\nresearch period. As far as\nthose who are registered as\n'writing-up' are concerned, they\nare allowed to do a certain\namount of experimental research\nwork which is related to the\nw rl ting up of the thesis . The\nsort of work involved would be\neither calibrating a system or\nchecking out experimental\nresults or even doing minor\nexperiments to verify theories\nformulated to explain certain\nobservations. While this is\nsatisfactory, we also raised the\nquestion of the exemption from\ntuition fees, of students who\nover-run their research period \u2022\ndue to circumstances beyond\ntheir control. The students who\nwould come under this category\nare:\nThe rector's comment that\nhe did not feel that the union\nwas catering for the postgraduates at IC is most welcome.\nMost of the PG' s would agree\nwith the rector wholeheartedly.\nThe IC postgraduate group was\nset up specifically to cater for\npostgraduates. It was meant to\nfunction within the Union\nstructure. However the Union\nhas not tried to integrate the\ngroup into the Union structure.\nThis can only be done if ICP GG is given full representational\nrights with regard to PG' s. It\ncould only operate if there was\nspecific postgraduate representation both on college and union\ncommit tess. In addition certain\n1. .those who have experienced minimal facilities should be\nong delays in the delivery of\nmaterials and/or equipment.\n2. those who have had to\nchange their project because\nthe original one was non-viable and\n3. those who have been\nsubject to bad supervision.\nThe college is quite aware\nof these sort of problems, and\nwould if the individual students\ndepartment so recommended,\nreact favourably to any\napplication for exemption from\ntuition fees. However it is not\npossible to lay down any\ndefinitive guidelines and each\ncase would be looked at on its\nown merits.\nWe welcome the open-minded\nattitude adopted by the college\non this matter, since we\nbelieve that it is impossible to\nIi mit research work to a predetermined rigid time period.\nIf any postgraduates are\nexperiencing difficulties\nbecause they have to stay on,\nplease get in touch with either.\nPete Teague or my and we wi fl see what can be done.\naccorded to the group and its\nofficers. I would reject criticism that we are being elitist in\nmaking these demands and state\nthat it is time the union\nrecognised the very different\nnature of PG work.\nKarl Ibribian? resigned as\nPGA O because he felt that he\ncould not cater for the needs of\nthe postgraduate students under\ncircumstances which made it\nvery difficult to carry out that\njob. It would be pointless for\nhim to spend all his time\nfighting for the basic demands\ndetailed above. Is y mpa this e with him and I would find it\ndifficult to recommend the job\nto anyone unless the union is\nprepared to discuss our demands.\nI would however add that Pete Teague's efforts on behalf of\nthe PG' s is very much appreciated. But Pete Teague\nalthough being president, is not\nthe IC Union. It is the union\nwhich will have to make\nfun de mental changes if it\nactually wants to represent the\npostgraduates at IC.\nCouncil meetings\nSir, \u2014 Surely your information\nabout the 'Shortest Council\nmeeting ever held at IC is\nincorrect. There was a meeting\nlast session which is recorded\nas opening at 6.00pm and\nclosing at 8.40pm \u2014 which\nappears to equal the time of\nlast weeks Council. Indeed it\nwas not unusual in the 1950's for Council Meetings to last\nless than 2 hours. I suggest\nbefore you make such a claim in the future you consult past\nCouncil Minute Books, which are kept in the Union Office.\nYours faithfully,\nJacqui Gerrard\n\n"
