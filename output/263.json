Having disposed of the minutes and other relatively minor matters, the meeting moved on to the elections, the results, of which appear on page 1,\nIn the major election, that fc r Be put,, President, Fran,: Morris was\nproposed by Ian' veils and Jeff Steer by Pam Horrocks. Despite veils' superior proposal speech and. Morris's slightly better performance in the* Questioning, Jeff Steer was eventually elected. Perhaps the fact that 'Prank\nMorris( ex president of.110) didn't produce our long lost mascot, lost him the day. When the election business was\nwound up, Ray Phillips, happy, smiling ana deadly efficient in the chair, gave out the Union General Awards. Sx officio awards went to Phillips. Lack and Karr is for their year of c' office at the top and three richly deserved awards were given to Rory led rna y ne, about whom nothing need be\nsaid but that he was once Editor of PJjlLIX and lias done a hell of St lot for ICU, toO hr is Palmer, for excellent work on carnival and to Nick Clarke, for doing a host of tiling s, Including FELIX, Dram soc and Ents. Social Colours were then awarded. Three more items of note came up. Keith Guy, freshly recovered from his lab accident, reported on Ents. successful year and massive profit of \u00a3 8 . 5 0 . , as against last years los s.Andy Jordan proposed that the Governing Body be consulted with the view of getting a sabbatical year for the President.2 his was\nreferred to the subcommittee which is looking into the Union Byelaws. The third item was a motion by Henry v/y nn deploring the brutality of the French Police towards the demonstrating students in Paris. Seconded bg John Williams, this, predictably, aroused, a lot of comment\nbut In the end the motion was accented. T ne two proposer s have organised both ao et it ion and. letters to MP'Pa b horr in v the use in Prance of Police* brutal! t1 against students for political ends. PARKING\nAPPLICATIONS\nApplication forms for College car parking spaces for next session are now available from the Union Office. Closing dates for applications are\"13 th September and3 rd October.

He would like to see changes in the Union, but feels that at the moment he probably does not know enough about his job to make tod many pro roi se s about the future. One field, though, that he\nwill try to expand is contact with other colleges. This can be done\nboth at Exe c,leveland on the initiative of individual clubs. The reared times when the President has to act without consulting people, but Rex wants to keep these down to a minimum. He\nwants Union meetings to instruct him what to do and feels that if less time was spent arguing about proceed ure and more discussing stud et affairs meetings would be less sparsely at ten aed. Communication with every member of the Union is what Rex is going to try and ac ni eve He pleads that anyone with a problem should not hesitate to contact him. This summer Rex is getting married to Sue Gibbs, a third year physicist, FELIX wishes them both best wishes for their marriage and their year of office. "

    "content": "Joint Council last Monday evening beside selecting the next President and secretary, got through a lot of useful, if rather dull, business, Muclt of the meeting was taken up with discussion of subjects to come\nup at JURGO - the Joint Union, Rector and Governors Committee tonight,' A whole series of corresponded3 had passed between the President a ad\nMrs Muriel Tab art, who runs the University Lodgings Bureau, about the wording of forms sent to people offering accommodation, which asks if they are willing to accept coloured students. The SGC Overseas Students Committee objects to these forms on the grounds that it encourages racial prejudice. Mr sTab art considers that it is better to ask which householders are prepared to take coloured students tb an place them in lodgings where they would not be welcome, or than send them to lots of places where they would bo turned away. This matter has also been aired in The Times letters column. The Registry, in conjunction vith the Welfare Committee, has succeeded in getting the wages paid by many\nlow paying firms fci*^ vacation training raised. The only exception to this appears to be the Ministry of Technology, which pays Sl>..10.C to students living at home and \u00a3 7 . 1 0 , 0\naway from home. After this much discussion ensued on how man:/ r ops Council thought it should have on various College Committees, these proposals to be\nput to the JURGO meeting. The College has obtained another nine houses for use as Student Houses. These are numbers5866 Evelyn Gardens, close to the two\nsets of houses the Colleges already leased and which will be occupied at the beginning of next session \u00ae The latest batch is likely to be ready for occupation about halfway through next session. On\nStudent Houses^ nd y Jordan proposed his motion again on having Student House wardens selected by a committee. It was decided that in future they would be selected by the President, the Student Houses rep and three other selected by Joint Council.. And so to the elections.

Pete Ruhemann asked Council tore commend to the Social Colours subcommittee that Keith Guy be re awarded Social Colours for his work on Ents this year, which was passed.
